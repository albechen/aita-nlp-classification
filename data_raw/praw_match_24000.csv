0,Not the A-hole,"My mom is incredibly well off. She’s never worked a day in her life, and is from *old* old Dutch money. She is totally awesome, generous, & kind hearted...But she can sometimes be a little selfish and I feel like this is one of those moments. 

On a few occasions now, she’s come over to my house & will help herself to whatever’s in the pantry and open a giant share bag size of chips. Nibble on 2. And then throw it away. Straight into the trash without even asking me. This is a behaviour I’ve never noticed before and the first time she did it I was aghast and asked her wtf she’d do that. She looked surprised herself but shrugged it off saying ‘she only wanted 1’.. I said to her I’ll use clips or a zip lock bag to keep em fresh, don’t throw the whole freaking bag out. I took them out the trash as it was a clean liner and saved my chips. 

She did it again yesterday with a box of expensive chocolates I bought. It was all individual pieces of dark chocolate. She took a bite out of one. Then threw the whole box in the trash. The individual unwrapped pieces fell into the dirty trash and there was no way I was able to save those. I admit I snapped at my mom and told her to stop wasting food like this. It’s just careless and rude. She grew defensive when I said it was environmentally unfriendly and she basically said ‘you live in this huge house with a huge car and you’re going to lecture me about who’s being environmentally unfriendly? And What about all the food that you waste?’ Which is kind of a good point as I do end up throwing food out a lot when it goes bad. 

She’s accusing me of being a bad host, and I think she’s wasting environmental resources. AITA here?",50,157,0.95

2,Asshole,"My son turned three years old today. We had a little celebration for him yesterday and he got a few presents. As is often the case with kids, his favorite thing was the small, $7 Paw Patrol toy we got to put on his cake. Figures.

Today after I went to work, my wife was working out in the yard on our small garden, repotting a few things, and had him out playing and helping a bit. She had to step inside the door to grab something (a round trip of less than 10 seconds) and asked him specifically not to touch the plants she was working on while she stepped inside. As soon as she turned her back, he picked up and threw several of the plants she was moving, basically killing them. My wife, who has been working hard on this garden for weeks now, was very upset. He smirked and tried to cutely say he was sorry, but laughed as she got after him and put him in time out. She texted me to express frustration and asked what we should do about his destructive behavior.

I said she should take away his new toy and tell him that daddy said we need to sell it so we can buy new plants for the garden, and to tell him that we can only have nice things when we take good care of them (this would not be the first time we've had a talk like this).

If he were a bit bigger I think I would feel just fine doing this, but the fact that he is still just barely 3 years old and is generally a very nice kid is giving me some pause. WIBTA for taking his toy forever?",140,257,0.94
3,No A-holes here,"So abit of background, ive been dating my boyfriend for around 3 months now. My ex and i broke up about a year ago and we both have new relationships, but we also have a 4 year old daughter together. Around 5 months before we broke up we booked a holiday to gran canaria with out daughter for 1 week, this holiday is supposed to happen next month and is paid for and non refundable. Our daughter is very excited about it. Our break up was clean and we decided we’d still go on holiday but we will take it in turns each night sleeping in the single bed while the other shares the double bed with our daughter. 

Now, when my boyfriend and i got together i told him about this holiday and he was fine with it. Now that the holiday is getting closer hes started to have a problem with it. Hes worried well end up back together and ive told him he has nothing to worry about as were both in new relationships and apart from our daughter we have nothing in common anymore. He asked if i still love him, i told him hes the father of my child he will always have a place in my heart and i will always care for him but i am no longer in love with him. He then asked me not to go and i said im going because its already booked and our daughter is looking forward to it alot, he wasnt happy with that answer and walked out and hasnt spoken to me since last night apart from one text that said if i go on holiday we wont be together when i return as he cant be with someone who doesnt value him enough to not go. I told him he was being silly and insecure but if thats how he truly feels i obviously wont force him to stay. 

Our mutual friends have mixed opinions on this so im here to ask if im the asshole on this or not.",180,36,0.76

5,No A-holes here,"So this happened a long time ago.

&#x200B;

I was dating this girl we'll call G. Relationship was ok at the time. We had been dating 6 months or so.

&#x200B;

One day I decide to make her dinner. She is fully Canadian. I am South African having emigrated to Canada 5 years prior. She has absolutely 0 experience of the world outside of Canada. And that includes food. No asian/mexican/african food at all. Basically just like burgers and steaks and rice and pasta.

&#x200B;

I wanted to make her my favourite dish. Potjiekos. Its like a lamb stew with tons of veggies. So i do. And she goes on and on about how much she likes it.

&#x200B;

Maybe 2 months later we are having dinner at her parents house and her mom says that she went to a restaurant with a coworker who ordered lamb for lunch. The whole family gasped. Then began a solid 20-30 minute discussion on how f-ed up it is to eat lamb and how none of them would ever do it and on and on.

&#x200B;

I kinda just sit there like [okay](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/5101e2e4b4e40be52150899a69f33bfa.jpg). And then I never ever said anything. The relationship was falling apart at that point already and I just figured there is no good outcome here so no point.

&#x200B;

To this day she doesn't know. I made the dish again (because she begged me to) but with beef and she commented on it not being as good.

&#x200B;

I was telling this story to a few friends and everyone thought it was funny but some said it was a dick move not to tell her. Some said I should have told her because she would have maybe opened her mind to new experiences and others said I should have told her when I found out she had such a strong opinion because thats just the right thing to do. And some thought it doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Am I the asshole for not telling the girl I was dating at the time she ate lamb when I found out later she ""Would never eat lamb""",319,1108,0.97

The thing is we still have a good time talking (including politics) but I dunno. It's getting to me. I don't usually talk politics much at all with my friends and family but I guess I'm one of those triggered liberals these days because of the news and it bothers me she supports something that would directly impact me.

11,Everyone Sucks,"My husband unexpectedly died about 4 years ago. We have 3 kids who are now in elementary school. After my husband’s death, I moved about 2 hours away to my parents’.

My husband’s parents (my in-laws) were also devastated. He was their only child. They pressured me against moving but eventually we compromised by having the kids visit them for major holidays and a couple weeks in the summer. The boys love this because my in-laws host large holiday celebrations and spoil them to hell and back. My in-laws have also insisted on paying for private schools for the boys, which I did not ask for but appreciate because the public schools here are not very good. My in-laws and I do not get along very well but they are great grandparents.

I have since met someone else and become pregnant and engaged. My in-laws have said unkind things about this to other relatives but I understand that they are still grieving my husband’s death. They have expressed minimal interest in my pregnancy and I do not think they will ever love this child as much as they love my other children.

I do not want my future child to feel like a second class citizen in the family. I plan to pull my kids from private school after they finish elementary because I cannot guarantee my in-laws will pay for my future child in 5 years. Going forward, I would like my kids grandparents to visit instead of sending my kids to visit them. I want to celebrate holidays with just my kids and fiance to ensure they are treated equally and to improve our family bond. I would still allow my in-laws to visit as they like, as long as they are equally kind to my future child, but there is no room for them to stay over and the boys’ grandfather's health concerns make visiting us difficult. Imposing these rules will nearly cut them out.

**Edit: I have no intention of cutting contact with my in-laws.** My kids will still be reminded to call them and make them presents, as they always have been. My in-laws are welcome to visit whenever they would like. It is just unlikely my in-laws can visit much.

**Edit:** Since this has come up regularly, my fiance only has a mother who lives with his sibling in another state. She's very excited for the baby but is dependent on his sibling and cannot afford to express her love in the same manner my in-laws can.

**Edit 2:** Thanks everyone. After reading through the comments, I've decided to talk to the grandparents about paying for the youngest child's K-12 education. I did not expect them to pay for any of my kids to go to private school, but I would rather they all go or none go. It is a huge and obvious difference in treatment for kids living in the same home. If they are hesitant, I will move everyone to public school and the grandparents can save their money to help the older 3 with college. The public schools around here are not horrible, just not as good as the private.

I will continue the kids' summer visits and we'll all start going to Thanksgiving as a complete family (previously, only the kids attended). We'll start our own traditions for Christmas and Easter.",1056,1944,0.93

13,Not the A-hole,"For the past three months, I've been assigned a short and quite simple project that counts half the grade of my Sociology course. At first, I was quite worried because one of my teammates was known for leaving everything last day. Anyway, I told them I liked doing everything as early as possible, but I know I am known on class for making people feel pressured because of that. I wanted to keep it cool, and said we could start the last month to take it seriously.

&#x200B;

Last month came in, I told them we could meet up, do it together, do it separately, etc. We decided to do it on our own. I was worried, so I decided to do the biggest part, let the second biggest part to another colleage, and left the subjective piece of around 1000 words to the problematic classmate, a girl.

&#x200B;

So, last week before the due date comes, we have a massive break of five days out of class, the next Monday being the due date. I have my part ready and written since two weeks ago, the second part is given to me on Thursday, and I sent an email immediately to problematic classmate about needing her part for Sunday, as I wanted to review it before then and put everything together.

&#x200B;

She answers to my last email on Saturday morning, apparently, she has been working all day and she can't do it until the due date, on Monday. She tells me if there is any problem with this she can do it Sunday night rushing it. I reply literally fifteen minutes after ¨I need the part on Sunday as we agreed on, if you have any problem, I'll help you.¨ I wanted it for Sunday to be able to review before it was too late and because I have my driving test Tuesday (tomorrow) and wanted to study for it instead of working on this.

&#x200B;

Sunday comes. No reply. Monday comes. She doesn't come to class. I write her an email first period telling her:¨After class ends we will send our work, we need your part before then¨. She didn't reply to my email, but apparently, she called my classmate between classes saying she had been barfing all morning and was sick.

&#x200B;

We told the teacher and agreed to remove her from the work. I came home and wrote her part hastily in 2 hours. She called me right after, she begged me to put her in the work again and that she could write her part now before the due time at midnight, I told her I already did it and the convo went back and forth for what felt like hours.

&#x200B;

Later, she called me again crying telling me she had the shittiest week and she begged me to get into the work. After denying it again she started shouting at me and saying it was all my fault and I was a cunt, I even told her I did my part over Spring Break when I was going in and out of the emergency room because of a virus, but she told me it doesn't compare to what she has gone through these past two days.

&#x200B;

AITA? And even if I am the asshole, I really need some advice on how to solve or cope with the situation, I feel really shitty",140,722,0.97
14,Not the A-hole,"I am indeed the asshole for how I handled it; I threw a tantrum basically and acted like a child. My family seems to bring that out in me.

So I have some brain missing, but that's a story for another day. Despite this newfound nurture-worthy development, I am cognitive and I can function. The time for babying is over.

But then people treat me like a baby, a-la mom yelling about keeping my apartment clean, or this (what this is all about):

So I went to the mall with my brother and his girlfriend. They're looking at clothes. I'm lonely, So I'm on my phone, playing a Facebook Messenger game with someone. Suddenly, she comes up to me and asks why I'm not participating, and grabs my phone out of my hands. I laugh it off, but then she's not giving it back to me.

This went on for about half an hour, I get progressively more childlike. I threaten to leave, I yell, I walk away for a while... My brother is just nodding and smiling. 

So that happened, but it was almost two months ago. Whatever, the past is the past. But last night, I was spending time with my family, and they came in. Whatever, all is good. My mom said something, I forgot what, but I briefly raised my voice in response, caught myself before I overreact a little. And my brother's girlfriend, she says, ""Don't be such a child."" And I pretty much lost it.

Like, this girl, who my brother has known for less than half a year, my parents practically see her as family. And she feels it's right to treat me like a baby, and then I'm completely to blame when I start acting like one...

So today, I'm talking to my mom on the phone, and she says I should apologize to my brother's girlfriend. I tell her my grievances, she says, ""You were yelling and screaming, probably."" I told her that I wasn't, at first. But she's so sure... She wasn't even there. And even if I did, is that a proper reaction?

My mom just doesn't get how it's rude, it's all my fault. So after a little while spent giving examples, I became progressively angrier.

Aside from my obvious lack of self control, is she being really rude? Is my mom right in that it's not a big deal? Or am I just an asshole?

The fact that I'm making this topic feels infantile.",56,130,0.94
15,Asshole,"So, it was my dad's birthday party yesterday, and his wife (W) threw him a surprise party with a corresponding lobster feed. My girlfriend (GF) couldn't be there for the surprise, but said that her mom would drive her up later. She had asked whether her mom (GFM) could pop in for a few minutes, and I said it was fine. However, GFM had _not_ been invited to the party or the dinner. When they arrived, my dad was the perfect host, and handed GFM a big glass of wine. Mistake number one. 

As the cocktail hour wore on, I became increasingly worried that GFM wasn't leaving as GF had implied she would. When people started putting lobsters in boiling water to warm them up, I discreetly mentioned to GF that it was time for her to ""kick her mom out."" She told me that she would ""leave when it was time for her to go,"" and I trusted her judgement. Mistake number two. 

When we were all seconds from sitting down and GFM was still lingering, W approached GFM and said, ""Okay, we're all about to sit down for dinner now, [long pause, blank stare from GFM] would you like to join us?"" Mistake number three. I guess it's a cultural thing, but I feel like that's where one should say, ""Oh, thank you, but I couldn't."" However, GFM, being raised by Dutch parents, took W at her word, and accepted the ""invitation,"" exactly the situation that I had tried to avoid putting W in. GF wanted to sit next to me, but I told her that she should sit by her mom at one end of the table and I would sit with my dad at the other end.

After dinner, I was pretty angry, so I spent most of the night cleaning dishes and avoiding GF and GFM. On the way home, GF asked whether I was angry, and I made it clear that I didn't appreciate her mom staying past her welcome and her not having her mom leave when I asked. She asked why I hated her mom, and I don't, it's just that this is part of a history of GFM missing social cues, and I anticipated this situation. She accused me of not being welcoming, but I'm sorry, _GFM wasn't invited_, and lobsters aren't exactly cheap. She noted that everything worked out fine: we found another chair, somebody was allergic to lobster so GFM wasn't taking someone else's, etc., and she's right. But I'm angry on the principle of it, and I'm angry that GF doesn't see her mom's actions as rude. So, AITA?

Edit: To be clear, her presence did bother a few people. GFM and W had met twice before, but GFM didn't even recognize W...the person whose house she was at. She insisted it must be W's hair, but she's worn her hair the same way for years. When I went downstairs to get another chair, I apologized to W that she was staying, and she said, ""Well, I can't uninvite her now...."" Clearly, W had planned a party for my dad, and GFM had not been part of the plans.

Later on, my uncle on my dad's side came into the kitchen to escape her for the moment, because she was dominating the conversation on that side of the table, talking about things that nobody cared about.",434,626,0.91
16,Not the A-hole,"Okay, a little bit of backstory: my sister has left home (we're from Asia) for college in the US (she's going to a pretty good one). Our parents are paying for her college, and will also pay for mine (if I get accepted). Not sure if that's relevant, but there.

Now, I'm making a website and spend the majority of my time on my laptop (VAIO, i3, a really craptop). I also do some video editing and Photoshop. Nothing too pro-level, but enough that it warrants having a decent laptop.

So, my laptops been having small but annoying issues lately, and my mother agreed to buy me a laptop as long as it wasn't too expensive. Laptops are generally cheaper in the US than they are in India, so we asked my sister if she would be okay with bringing it over (she wouldn't be paying for it) when she came back for the holidays. She agreed.

Now, here's the thing: my sister also got a laptop for college—an Asus, a light, fast one with just 256 GB of SSD. For the non-techies here, that's not a whole lot of space you have, but the upside is that it's faster than HDD.

When I chose my laptop, I looked at the best deals, good build quality, yada yada, and came upon a really Acer for $799 that gave me 128 GB SSD as well as 2 TB HDD. The downside? It's super big and clunky. The polar opposite of my sister's Asus physically, but a beast inside.

When it arrived, my sister voiced her concern, saying, ""nobody here has a laptop bigger than 12 inches"" and that I'll ""stand out"". Fine, whatever, I'm willing to sacrifice portability and sleekness for capability.

She relented and said all right.

Now, a few days before her flight back to India, she messages me this—  


>Returned your laptop  
>  
>No one is keeping anything that bulky under my watch  
>  
>Next one will be SSD only. Get one kb of hdd and I'll return it

&#x200B;

Now, I'm immediately put off by this. To me, it's not her right to choose which laptop I get, since she's not paying for it. **I'm** the one using it, I'll have to deal with it's faults.

On the other hand, I feel like a stuck-up little rich kid (our family is upper middle class, nothing fancy, just well off).

21,Not the A-hole,"throwaway. My husband and I are both 34. We've been together since we were 20, bought a house together at 27, and married at 31. We have no kids

We've got some challenges- He's extremely forgetful, drives so recklessly I don't want to be in a car w/ him, makes decisions without thinking, is extremely impulsive, has no sense of time management, and struggles to prioritize tasks. He's been telling me forever that all of this is ""just his personality"" and I knew this when I started dating him. He's not wrong, but I thought that was the personality of a 20 year old stoner in a puka shell necklace.

3-4 years back, right around the time of our wedding he found Jessica McCabe's TedTalk. It was a lightbulb moment for both of us. My husband very clearly has ADHD. Listening to Jessica describe her life was like listening to my husband. It's very obvious to both of us that this is what's been going on. If you listen to Jessica's talk or follow her work, she's emphatic that one of the most important pieces to her recovery was getting on the right meds and getting with the right therapist. He has refused. ""This is just how (he) is."" and I should deal with it.

Fast forward to yesterday. The incident that broke the camel's back. He left me at the grocery store.

We had just come out of publix and we were loading the groceries in the car. He grabbed the last two bags out of the cart and I said ""why don't i bring the cart back up front and you can pick me up there?"" He agreed. I took the cart back into the store and as I was coming out, I saw him leave the parking lot. I thought ""surely, he's just going to swing around."" He did not. I realize at this moment that my wallet, keys, cell phone, money and ID are all in the passengers seat of his car. So he is gone and I am alone, with no money, no ID and no phone in front of the grocery trying to figure out what I've done wrong. Reader, I sat there for just over TEN MINUTES before he came back. Which means he was 5 minutes back to our house before he realized I wasn't there. I took him 30 seconds to forget me, and 5 minutes to remember.

I think I'm done. I just don't think I can deal with this anymore. It's like playing roulette with him, I never know if I'm going to get the thoughtful stable husband, or an overgrown forgetful child. His risk taking, forgetfulness, and insensitivity make me feel like I don't matter. I am deeply, painfully jealous when we hang out with other couples because I want the doting husband, I want the teammate, I want the partner I don't have. My mother and some of my friends tell me I'm crazy, I knew what I was getting into, I just need to live with his ADHD. Others are telling me that if I feel this bad, I should leave, and that if it was alcohol/drugs/physical abuse and he wasn't getting help, no one would question my choice.

So, WIBTA if I left him because his untreated ADHD is making me feel like I don't matter as a person?

&#x200B;

Update 1: I want to thank everyone here, especially those with ADHD. I thought I had been clear with him about how much his actions were hurting me, but I took ya'lls advice and last night over dinner I laid it on the table. Clearly. Concisely. Bluntly. I told him that while I'm not necessarily ready to say this is irreparable, his past actions have shown that he'll only focus on this issue for a short period of time and then forget, so I need to move ahead as though we are divorcing and I have found an apartment. In the meantime, he needs to work on getting in to see a specialist, and I need to work with someone else to process all of this and find some strategies for myself. He hemmed and hawed for a bit, gave a lot of excuses for why it hasn't happened yet. #1 was money- ""I can't find a doctor in my network..."" I asked calmly- ""do you think you will spend more money paying for an out of network therapist, or a divorce lawyer?"" Guess what happened today? WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT! The waiting list is long, so we won't have any confirmation until July, but maybe, just maybe, we've crossed a rubicon here? I'll try to update again after the appointment.",572,2955,0.96

Let me just say I have no problem with this do whatever you want with your seat, but because of this my knee space was basically gone (I am a tall guy) so I was basically up against their chair from the back. The result of this was randomly throughout the flight this guy keep turning around waking me up and telling me to stop touching the back of their chair or else. Granted I could have been nicer to the guy about it (about the 3rd conservation I was getting rude back no cursing from me though), but I basically said their is really not much I can do for him as my legs have to go there.

23,Asshole,"For some Context: Back in Elementary, Our teacher told us that there were two kinds of Push-ups that you could do, there were ""Normal Push-ups"" which were the only ones us guy's were allowed to do during PT, and ""Assisted"" (Or as She called them ""Girl Push-ups"") which were the ones that she recommended the Girls of our class to start out with. because this was a rather small town out in dairy farm country, terms like this tended to stick with you even into later in High school. This is important for the Story.

So, I'm at dinner after school with my family (F, M, S, GM) While waiting for the food, we talk about our days and how they were. I finish my spiel and my sister goes next. She talks and eventually gets to discussing some new things she's been doing at the Gym, one of those things was that she is now able to consistently do Push-ups. Now Me (a self-proclaimed Workout nut who prays to 80's Jessie Ventura and Carl Weathers before going to bed) Was happy for my sister, so I asked how many she was able to do. It was at this point she clarified that she was able to consistently do ""Assisted"" Push-ups. Not knowing what those were, asked her what they were, to which she explained that they were push-ups with your knees touching the ground. 

Me, probably not thinking about what I was saying, blurted out ""Oh, so Girl Push-ups"". Her reaction to me saying this was a complete About-face of how she was acting up until that point, and it was punctuated by a single statement she made to my father ""See, I told you he would say that"". I was confused, and tried to figure out why she said that and what she meant, but I was met with a rather Hostile response when she stated that what I had called them wasn't the appropriate name for them. I retaliated with the fact that I didn't know there was another name for them. this continued until the rest of the family intervened, but (IMO) were extremely One-sided with their judgment, saying that I shouldn't have continued the argument and that I should have accepted that I was wrong, even though it was clear I wasn't defending what I had called them. If I was on the outer seats of the table, I would have simply stood up and walked out, as I didn't want to erupt with anger over how they were reacting to my ignorance.

I’ve known him since university. He met his wife in first year and they’ve been attached at the hip ever since. They’re both introverted people so it was like they lived in their own little world. They lived together in the same apartment.

They married summer after graduation. He got into medical school, she started working as a nurse. They had a kid and I basically never saw him anymore.

Flash forward, we recently reconnected. We’re living in the same city now. He’s a doctor and his wife works in the same hospital as him. They literally commute together every single day, drop off their daughter at the hospital employee nursery, eat lunch together, and then go home together.

I’ve been trying to get him to hang out but he always says hes too busy. I get it, youre a doctor with a kid, but he spends all his free time with his family. 

He canceled on me last night (we were supposed to go watch a GOT screening together next week) because he wants to spend Mother’s Day weekend with his wife and her family.

I was like dude, you’re only 27, live a little. Have some fun with people OTHER than your wife or her family.

A few days ago at work I was training a new person in my department. They seemed to have a pretty good handle on things, and were checking in packages without my help. Then, after a brief interruption in this, when we got back to dispensing packages, they accidentally processed one the wrong way. I could see that they were making a mistake, but I let them do it and didn't say anything until they asked me for help, at which point I showed them how to correct it (basically telling them ""you did thing X, which we only need to do for the other package type, and if you do thing Y that'll fix the issue.""). All told, the interaction took maybe two minutes, and I thought that'd be the end of it.

Apparently, though, it was not. I first heard rumblings of it when I next came into work (scuttlebutt was that this person was upset with me), and I ended up being called in to speak to my manager about it. This person had gone to management and HR, claiming that I had humiliated them and ""set [them] up for failure."" I'm not in any actual trouble over this, but I'm kind of shocked that this person actually escalated this to a formal complaint. Had this been an issue that would count against them in an evaluation or would have serious consequences, I'd have stepped in and stopped it from happening, but when there's no actual consequence I saw no harm in just letting it happen and showing them how to correct it (especially since I'm training people so that there's coverage when I'm not available, so this is someone who's theoretically going to be on their own at some point).

28,Not the A-hole,"This summer I’m planning to take my brother to California with me to spend the summer with our dad and I. Unfortunately he’s  the only one I can take. He tells me this means our stepsister will stay with our neglectful parents. I was already 18 and heading off to college by the time my mom was seeing our stepdad and since I spent the holidays with our biological dad I didn’t get to live with him. According to him while our parents spoil them with new phones, laptops, and expensive clothes they rarely spend time with them and they can be very verbally abusive. He told me they’ll go out of town for several days and leave them alone. I can’t speak for my stepdad but growing up with my mom I can tell this is probably true. 

My brother is the only one who keeps my sister company and with him gone she’ll be alone with our parents. She has expressed interest in me wanting to take her (she’s told my brother to ask for her because he says she’s intimidated by me) I’ve only met her a few times for Christmas and Thanksgiving and although she’s really quiet she seems like a nice girl. Unfortunately I don’t think I have enough money to support 2 teenage kids and pay for where her to do the things my brother and I were planning to do.

30,No A-holes here,"I am so not looking forward to the upcoming period (Mother's day and my sister's birthday)Ever since they banned my dog from ever coming to any family meeting whatsoever I really don't feel like emotionally investing in them anymore. Since they made me the black sheep in the last falling out.

Context:We had a falling out earlier last year christmas, with my brother and sister stating, we don't want a dog close to our kids when they're this young. Before my sister and brother each had a kid of their own my dog was referred to as ""the first grandkid"" My mom loved her to bits, and every time she came by us, or we went to visit them, she bought toys and dog treats. My dog is a malinois shepherd. Super trained, sweet doofus which grew up with my niece since she was like 2 years old. (with hugging, sharing toys food and whatnot)

So okay, my dog was not welcome anymore when they're young. And everytime we come to visit we need to get someone to watch her. Or we arrive later in the day and leave early because of doggy obligations. But the kids are getting bigger now, so I started the conversation on simply the question: When would you guys be okay with me bringing the dog again?

This exploded. At first they assumed that I wanted to bring the dog that day to the family gathering (which was not my intention) And then they all went beserk on me for making my mom cry that day. Simply because I asked for clear answer on where I stood with my dog. Turns out they discussed during christmas (when I couldn't be there because I couldn't get a sitter, and my father in-law was dying, so we're not able to visit) that under no situation whatsoever they wanted the dog near their kids. EVER. Since the dog is a crazy random thing that they are afraid of, and might grab their kids.

&#x200B;

Extra info:I've been the black sheep in the family all my life. My brother is a copy of my father (mechanic etc) and my sister a copy of my mother (healthcare) and I'm in IT. I was never allowed to chose my own education (they wanted me in healthcare I wanted IT. (they said IT would never make money)) Always I've been the odd one out in everything, music taste, hobbies etc. So relations have always been rickety. I try to reconcile and approach them for a relationship (including making my sister my bridesmaid)

For me the am I the asshole for asking clarification on when they will allow my dog near their kids. Since their first reason was not now, the kids are too young.(I am not allowed to bring our dog anymore to family meetings)

I have had two requests for updates and I'm not sure if there's a threshold, but I thought I'd share anyway in case anyone was curious, and to say thank you for the advice. It did shape the way we went about getting together, who we told and when, etc.

Our families have been incredibly supportive and we are really happy together. It has been about a month but it feels so perfectly right. We have had endless conversations about our feelings and our plans, we have started to redecorate the house, and we are planning to go on holiday together in the summer. It feels so much more wonderful than I had ever imagined it would be.

I don't know what else to add, but if you ever find yourself in a difficult situation, talking it through is so, so important. Everybody feels safer and better about everything when you communicate.

34,No A-holes here,"So I’ve been a vegetarian for 14 years, but I don’t care whether anyone else is or not as that was my personal choice that I’ve made for my own reasons and I’ve never tried to force someone else to stop eating meat. When I still lived at home I was the only person in my family who was vegetarian which meant that all pots, pans, plates, etc. were cross contaminated. 

There wasn’t much I could do about it, so I just went with it and was grateful to be living at home saving money. The only real downside is that if someone had used a pot or dish and hadn’t gotten the chance to wash it I would occasionally have to scrub the remainders of whatever meaty meal they had cooked, which did gross me out but because I was using my parents’ cookware I never complained.

When I moved out, I got an apartment with some close friends who are all vegan and as a housewarming present my grandparents gave me a really nice set of pots and pans which my roommates and I all share. Because none of my current roommates eat any animal products, none of my pots and pans have ever had meat products in them, which I’ve come to prefer as it feels “cleaner” to me and limits the chances of me accidentally consuming meat at home.

My roommates and I have been living together for three years, but in a few months we’ll all be moving on and I will be getting a new place with a longtime friend who happens to eat meat. I don’t care that he eats meat and would never try to change him, but would I be the asshole if I explain that while my pots and pans are for household use, I don’t feel comfortable having meat cooked in them?

Edit: I just wanted to address some points that have come up a lot in the comments -

1) He IS allowed to use my cookware, I just don’t want meat cooked in them.

2) I don’t want and would never ask him to purchase a full set of cookware, my suggestion will be that he supplies a few separate skillets, pans, etc that he can cook meat in.

3) I didn’t elaborate on this point in the OP as the internet can be pretty harsh towards vegetarians, but in addition to wanting to avoid any meat chunks or residue in my pots and pans, the thought of cooking my vegetables in the same skillet that just had hamburger washed out of it grosses me out. It’s a mental hang up of mine, but it’s there.

4) A few people in the comments asked about other utensils, bowls, etc. I don’t have an issue sharing non-porous items such as plates and utensils, but my porous cookware is a different story. I also plan to have him buy a cutting board that he can use for meat as it’s not a good idea to chop produce on the same surface as raw meat.

5) I’ll update the post later this evening (pacific time) after I speak with him over dinner.

Thanks for all of the feedback and comments, guys! I appreciate it ~

UPDATE:

So I just came back from dinner with him and mentioned my thoughts about cookware and he said “That’s fine, I have a skillet I was planning to bring that I can use for meat.”

Hey Reddit! First post. hear me out

&#x200B;

I have been with my girlfriend for five years. Our years has been up and down in conflict, and we have had our fights over issues.

&#x200B;

Since the start of our relationship, when we went out drinking with friends, we all started playing ""Never have I ever"". She told everyone about the several times she has slept with different people in different situations. for example, ""I poked him on the shoulder, and then we ended up in bed"", and ""I was heading on a afterparty, but then this guy asked me to join him home, so I did"". If you make those examples and add 30 different ones, you have it all (that I know of)

When she first told them a couple of them, It was entertaining, who has not slept with other people when you are close to their thirties, right?

&#x200B;

After the eight story, I felt at an unease, thinking that my girlfriend was sharing too much, and that she was putting herself in a bad light, and that I felt my stomach churn for each new story she told. I took it up with her, that I thought and she said, ""its in the past, it does not matter now"".

&#x200B;

I do agree with that statement, but it still keeps bothering me that she mentions those stories. When all comes to all, I get the impression that she is unknowingly calling her self cheap, and easy to get to bed.

&#x200B;

I took it up with her today, after she told a entertaining story about peeking on some boys in the shower at high school. When the story finished, she again ended it with, ""he was the worst guy that I ever slept with"". I again felt my stomach churn because of it and saw it as the final straw, so I confronted her with my reasoning, saying that, she gives the impression of being cheap, and easy, and it makes me feel bad. I hope you can respect me enough to try to contain yourself from saying these stories when I am present, as I don't like to hear them and you are putting yourself, and myself by proxy in bad light.

&#x200B;

She said that she couldn't help herself, and that she blurted these things out sometimes, and that she couldn't guarantee that she did so in the future. I said that it was okay if that happened, but when she did, she could afterwards, say that ""I know you feel bad when I am telling these stories."" So that it does not bother me so much, and I know she cares about how I feel.

&#x200B;

She would not listen to that suggestion, and I said, that ""It is not interesting to hear about your past when you once poked a guy on the shoulder, and that made you go sleep with him afterwards. You were acting like a slut"".

She then got furious and angry with me for calling her that, and here I am. Am I in the wrong here?",1114,1002,0.89

40,Not the A-hole,"My extended family and I are having our quarterly cook-out together. Aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, I have a HUGE extended family.

&#x200B;

So after dinner, most of us are relaxing in the living room with a glass of wine. We're just chatting, and out of nowhere, my sister asks me, in front of everyone, if I could be their recently-born son's (my nephew) God Parent.

&#x200B;

Some background info about me: I'm single, early-30s, no kids, I own my own home, I have a stable, well-paying career I can ride until retirement and beyond, and I have no debts (besides a bit of credit card debt from regular purchases, groceries, etc.) In other words, I have my s\*\*\* together. Life is peaceful for me, and I never want that to change. To that end, I decided long ago that I never want to have kids. My parents know this, but they've agreed to just keep it amongst ourselves so my sister, and everyone else, probably doesn't know I am of the 'child-free' crowd.

&#x200B;

Back to the present. I am absolutely floored by this. She's never talked about to me, it was never hinted, my brother-in-law never brought it up; this comes as an absolute surprise. I say nothing and an uncomfortable silence fills the room. I look at my (big) sister and ask if I could talk to her somewhere else. After we find some privacy, I explain that WOW this is a huge responsibility. I asked her if she was sure of this and she said that in case anything ever happened to them, I would be free to take care of my nephew. I asked her why she thought I would make a good God Parent, since I've never raised a kid before. She starts listing my house, the fact that I'm single and has a lot of money and 'spare time'.

&#x200B;

Afterwards I explain that I don't have any plans to start a family, hinting at wanting to be child-free. She takes the cue and we awkwardly go back to the living room and quietly sip on our wine.

&#x200B;

AITA for refusing to be the God Parent to my big sister's son?

Note: My BiL and my big sis are perfectly healthy, financially stable, and are good, responsible people.

So there's this girl I've met about 5 years ago, we always were mostly ""just friends"" and never went further than just kissing. After a while of not really talking or seeing each other (I was in a relationship), we started going out only as friends in recent weeks. I was always wanting to do more but I could see that even when she seemed interested, she wasn't really willing to make that step.  


I went out with her again recently and discovered she's had a boyfriend this whole time but she told me that in recent months they would barely see each other and he didn't give her any attention (which explains why she kept going out with me). I pretty much told her that I thought that was unfair and that she has plenty of men around her willing to give her this attention, he doesn't. That was her choice to make. I also made it clear, that I'd be willing too.

My two friends are currently reading Harry 
Potter, I believe they are on the first or second book, they have been reading it non-stop and at lunch. My other friend  L, knows that, she’s seen her reading it and M has told her multiple times that  she was reading it.

Yesterday, M sent a [Meme about her favorite character]  and 

L responds with  “Character is __Character trait character has received__” 

M: “ Yeah I know, this happened at ____(setting in which character had received character trait)”

L goes on to tell her, the her character dies. And M tells her she hasn’t seen that part yet and L just says Whoops. At this point it’s a common mistake, nothing more, nothing less. But, L begins to spoil even more saying,” Well he’s still dead, he dies in book __ by ____ because ___”   Then proceeds spoil more about different characters, all while M  is telling her to stop. This only stops after A kicks her out. Later E adds her back in saying,” Why do you want me to add you back In”,,” You spoiled and that’s not cool”  finally, I kick her out the second time I had nothing to do with the situation, I just knew

I feel like he eats so much. And most of his meals are fast food. I've tried keeping the fridge stocked with healthier items but he chooses fast food instead. And since I hardly eat, we throw away a lot of food. Even if we cook a meal, he eats it once and we end up throwing away the leftovers because they go bad before I can eat them all and he just chooses fast food again.

He's noticed the issues too. But he just gets mad at himself. He is losing his confidence and lately he won't have sex with me because of how he feels he looks.

He would go days ""forgetting"" the cat needed food and then would force the cat to binge feed. The cat is less than a year old and over 15 pounds. He would lock the cat in his room for days on end with only a litter box it wasn't until we said something he added water. He was upset we even suggested it. He would lock the cat in her room despite the cat crying to get out and play with my cat and my other roommates cat. He treated him like a stuffed animal not a cat. He literally killed the will of this cat it didn't matter what you did he wouldn't fight you the cat had no play or fight left in him. He's a kitten and he was so complient about everything but not in a way a cat should be he had no spunk no spark. He would eat human food all the time in fact the roommate encouraged it and even though the cat would vomit several times a week the roommate refused to take the cat to the vet even though he could afford it. Me and my other roommate did our best to try and take care of this cat but it we let him out we would get yelled at because he ""knows how to take care of a cat. It isn't difficult.""

49,Not the A-hole,"This was about 10 years ago, me and a friend shared a house for a job we had away from home. We agreed with the landlord that we would pay a week in advance so we could have a rolling contract week by week. He also wanted a £500 deposit plus the rent was higher doing it this way and in cash so he could avoid the tax.

The place looked ok but after a few days we had no hot water, the toilets kept blocking and the place started to smell and then we seen our first rat!!!!. We was there for less than two weeks, I rang the landlord who apologized and said he had another property for us and he would meet us the next day to take us there.

So the next day we're stood there like a pair of lemons outside the house with all our stuff  waiting for the landlord to turn up, he never did. I rang him and asked what was happening his words to me was ""you can stay there or you can leave either way it's not my problem"". It come out of nowhere he was fine the day before. I chose leave and demanded our deposit back, he obviously refused.

After a heated discussion he just out the phone down on me and wouldn't answer anymore. I realised that we had'nt payed the lady who collects the rent but everyone else in his other properties would have. She lived on the same street so I just went and knocked, she was alone with her two children. I told her that the landlord had asked me to come over to collect the £500 deposit. She said she would have to ask him first, I said not a problem go for it.

She rang him and asked him about the money I didn't hear his responce but she handed me the phone and he just started to call me everything under the sun. Now I was in this ladies house on her phone with her children present so I wasn't about to lose my shit infront of them. Instead I just nodded saying ""yeah, yeah ok"" and just chuckling a little now and again. I ended with a laugh like he said something funny and said ""no worries mate we can do the paperwork tomorrow"" and put the phone down.

After that I kept hold of her phone and told her that he said it was fine to get it of her and I can see him tomorrow. She was clearly confused but went and got me the money anyway. The whole time I kept hold of her phone turning it of as he rang back. I got my money and left. 

I never heard from the landlord after that he never come rang me but someone in work told me that the lady lost her job for giving me the cash. I went round to see her and her husband was there, she was clearly upset and I felt terrible. I spoke to her husband and explained the situation and explained I didn't want this to happen.

50,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I feel like shit and don't want to have this tied to my main account.

A bit of a background: I \[24F\] have been with my partner \[30M\] for close to three years now. We've discussed kids before and came to the conclusion that we really don't want to have them now but accept that our minds may change over time. He has two younger sisters. The older one had two kids \[11F\] and \[5M\]. None of the dads are in the picture. This sister died two months ago after a car hit her when she was riding her bike from work. We never really got along but I was obviously shocked.

Shortly after his sister died, my partner started the process to adopt his niblings. I told him that I'm not feeling up for that but he insisted that it's his duty. He loves them to bits, while I'm honestly kinda indifferent about them (sounds bad but I mean, they're just kids, it's hard for me to have a meaningful relationship with them). Also, they're really bad behaved, his sister didn't discipline them at all.

Since the kids moved in, our lives have changed for the worse. The girl talks back constantly and throws fits for no reason. I also found some money missing from my wallet. Last week I came back home to my clothes crumpled in the wardrobe and dirty. She also went through my makeup and I found it all dirty and spilled, my eyeshadow palette was crushed and some stuff were missing. When I confronted her, she kept screaming at me and I blew up and shouted that she's not wanted here so she should act accordingly. My partner was obviously mad at me when she told him.

The boy is alright, I guess. He'd been rather silent but recently he started mimicking his sister's antics. He sometimes wants to sleep in the bed with us but then he wets the bed. Also, I feel really weird about sharing the bed with a child so I've started moving to the couch when he wants to sleep with us. My partner thinks I'm overreacting.

There's been some good moments but they are rare and far between.

I tried suggesting to my partner that those kids could live with his mum. She more space for them, and she's also this no bullshit oldschool lady and definitely more capable of disciplining them. She lives in his country of origin in a ""poor"" rural region though and my partner doesn't want to uproot them.

Yesterday, when I was driving back from my part-time job I've realized that the thought of coming back home fills me with dread. I asked a friend to let me stay with her, drank a whole bottle of wine with her and slept on her couch where I am currently, skipping my classes and ignoring my partner's calls.

I'm 70/30 decided on leaving but I feel like an asshole for leaving him because of this kind and selfless gesture. And I still love him even though he's been a total jerk towards me these last two months.

51,Not enough info,"So basically in like 8th grade I complimented this girl and during the last week of middle/junior high school. She told me that was one of her greatest memories, just because I never romantically pursued her or anything. It was just an innocent compliment that made her feel really good.
Since then I’ve always tried to compliment my female friends (and male friends too but this is about the girls). I don’t have feelings for them but I want them to feel good about themselves. I know they don’t need my validation and they all understand where I’m coming from.
However I started dating this new girl and she got really mad that I was complimenting one of my female friends. My female friend was having a hard time and was struggling with everything but also her body image. I complimented her and my new gf saw the texts and got really mad at me.
I get where she’s coming from, but I don’t think she gets where i’m coming from. Am I the asshole?

So to make the long story short.

I was going to a uni that's ranked 1200-1400 in the world ( it's the best in my country ) and told almost everyone about it. My friends were excited. My gf was excited because we'll see each other A LOT more and everyone was so happy. I am not going to lie I also was happy that I am going to see a lot of the people I really enjoy being with a lot more.

Well for the past few weeks I've been thinking of applying to every single University that there's a possibility for me to go to. And I found out that I can apply to a few multiple Uni's that are A lot better 200-500 ish. And some of the options would even be cheaper.

Now would it be assholish to leave my friends whom I've promised that I'll be with during Uni to go to a better one? Does it feel like I've lied to them?

54,Asshole,"Throw away account here. 

A little backstory...this is my first mother's day and I've been really looking forward to it. With my husband working like a dog to support us, taking care of the baby is 90% my responsibility. Not complaining, because it is the agreement my husband and I have, but the countless days of having the baby all day by myself have really started to wear on me (plus grad school finals). I'm just really itching to celebrate on Sunday. I've been working my ass off this year, and I'm excited to celebrate my first Mother's Day as a mom. 

So, to get to the real situation...We have known that my husband's aunt has been terminally ill for the past year, but this morning we got news that she is transitioning to hospice care this week.  My husband has expressed to me before that when she passes he would likely need to go up and help his uncle, who had a major stroke a few years ago. Today was the first time they had spoken since our wedding last year, so they have been fairly distant relatives for a long time. In the 5+ years we have been together we have seen them twice, and we don't really speak in between. 

So anyway, we're sitting on the couch this evening talking about his plans to go visit his aunt and uncle this week, and he suggests leaving Thursday and coming home Sunday, to which I (albeit rather shortly) said ""Sunday is Mother's Day and you can't miss it"". Well...that ignited a less than pleasant conversation that involved my husband calling me selfish for wanting him to come home for Mother's Day (or for even trying to ""plan around death""), and me being really disappointed that he didn't think my first Mother's Day was as important of a priority. He suggested that we do a make-up Mother's Day, but to be honest I'm a bit of a  purist and celebrating on a different day just wouldn't feel the same, which he didn't seem to understand. He understood that I wasn't asking him to not go, just to be back for Mother's Day, but I think my disappointment upset him. I think he wanted me to just be okay with missing mothers day and for him to be able to freely support his uncle (which I understand).  I also expressed frustration at having to take care of the baby alone on Mother's Day. I think the heart of the issue was that I was upset that he would be gone, and he was upset that I was upset. 

The conversation did not really go well and my husband is now sleeping in the other room. I understand that he feels obligated to his uncle and is grieving for his aunt, but at the same time this Mother's Day feels like a huge milestone for me and I would be really upset he missed it. 

AITA?

Edit for context.

Update:  We spoke this morning and he agreed that it was important to be home for Mother's Day.  Thank you for your judgement.  I don't think I explained the nuances of what is going on very well, but I can take my A from you all and move on.",114,79,0.74

56,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year. I really love him and I know he loves me. Everything in our relationship is great, there are no problems of any sort. Our anniversary was last weekend and he proposed the idea of getting matching tattoos. I don’t have any tattoos and I don’t plan to get any, so I said no of course.

He then said that’s fine, I’ll just get your name tattooed. I told him not to. I just feel like that’s jinxing the relationship. Every couple that gets their significant others name tatted on them eventually ends up breaking up. I don’t want my name on him. He said he was going to do it regardless. I told him I would break up with him if he would, and he called me an asshole. He still wants to go through with it and thinks I’ll come around once he actually gets it. All my friends say I’m being an asshole too because he’s doing it as a sign of “love”.

WIBTA if I broke up with my boyfriend for getting my name tattooed?",25,35,0.97
57,Asshole,"Some context - I'm a SAHD.  When my wife and I first met, she was a huge workaholic and was always chasing her career.  I was fine with it; if it made her happy, who was I to judge?  I'm more of the artistic type, not a 9-5'er, lol.  We got along really well; even though I'm not ambitious in a career sense I'm definitely a clean freak and I actually like doing household chores and repairs.  When we moved in together it was great for both of us.  She suddenly had someone to do all that other stuff for her so she could focus even more on her career, and I got to trade my crappy low-paying job for taking care of a home and selling my art.

The one thing we didn't really agree on was kids.  I definitely wanted kids, being a father was my dream.  She wasn't sure - she liked the *idea* of kids, but she said that women especially end up really losing out on career advancement because of them.  So she mostly said she didn't want to have any.

We talked more and more about it, never fighting, just talking about things as our lives changed, and eventually we got married.  Then we started talking more in earnest; I still really wanted them, and she was still adamant that she didn't want to make the necessary sacrifices.

Eventually she said ""I would only have kids if I knew you could take care of them 100%.  I can provide all the money we need for the household (it was true, she makes great money, never a problem there), but only if I can concentrate fully on my career.  I don't want to have to do any kid-related chores.  I'd love to be a mom and do family stuff together, but all of the actual chores, housework, etc. still has to be on you.  If you don't want that, we can't have kids.""

I thought that was really really selfish, but if that's what it took to have kids, I definitely wanted to be a dad.  So I agreed.  She seemed shocked that I would, and it took some time to convince her that I was really serious.  But we agreed, and she got pregnant.  She worked almost all of her pregnancy, and even for the last few weeks she worked from home.  Even after the delivery she was working from home again immediately.  She nursed for a little while working from home, but then we switched to formula and she was back to work.

Our son is now 7 months old, and my wife refuses to help in any way.  I can't do any of my art because I'm constantly tending to him.  I keep the house mostly clean, but if I ask her to come home a little early from work 1-2 nights per week to help she refuses.  On the weekends she's home, but she has a lot of projects for her job so she's on the phone or in front of the computer a lot.  We eat dinner as a family, but almost immediately after she sleeps since she's usually up at 5 AM to get to work.  I'm tired of being the only one parenting.  I'm at the end of my rope.  Am I the asshole, or should she parent more?

EDIT:  I should make this clear:  It's not that she doesn't want anything to do with him. She actually spends a lot of time with him; when we eat dinner together (which she almost always makes a point of doing), she sits him on her lap and plays with him, she carries him when we go for walks, stuff like that. Like, when she's home she's all about him. She just won't help with chores or anything. Like if he wakes up from his nap crying on the weekend and we're both home on our computers, it's 100% always me that has to get up and take care of him, instead of splitting it equally.  She says it's because she's actually working and I'm not, but I don't see how that makes a difference.

EDIT #2:  I should clarify the money bit.  She makes good money meaning we never struggle, but we still can't afford a full-time nanny.  That's very expensive.  We could afford day care, but she says she'll only do that if I go back to work, because she says it isn't fair that she has to sacrifice the money she's putting aside for other things just so I can do my art.  And I should note, she's not spending money on dumb stuff, she's actually way better with money than me.  She's very anal retentive about saving and investing and she likes for us to be able to take a vacation each year, and now she also has a long-term college savings account for our son.  All that would take a hit if we put money into professional child care.",386,300,0.89

60,Not the A-hole,"  I'm a landlord and one of my tenants is a single mother of 5 children. Her background is murky but from what I've gathered she's been recently widowed and barely makes any money to support herself and her children. Her first month here she didn't make rent and came up with an excuse. I tried to be understanding but I made it clear that this can't be a monthly occurrence. The second month she also couldn't make it and when I hinted that I was going to evict her if she didn't come up with money she started crying and begged me to give her one last chance. Fine.

  Come the end of April however and for the third time she has no money. I reached the end of my rope and told her she had till May 15 to come up with at least this month's rent.

But I also have a family to feed and I need the money. My wife called me heartless upon hearing that I was going to evict a widowed mother of 5 but I have to do what I have to do.

62,Not the A-hole,"One day I got into an Uber and got a notification on my phone that my driver was deaf. Okay, no biggie, I respect people in general. As it turns out he has a hearing impairment and is able to hold a conversation, I just need to not mumble. Anyway, at first the ride seemed pretty normal, we got to talking and somehow the discussion turned really strange. He suddenly says something along the lines of:

""I used to have anger management issues, in my late 20s I was driving drunk and killed a young female teenager. I was arrested and served time.""

Immediately, I wasn't comfortable with that.  How did they pass the background check?

Well, as it turns out the guy tells me that he bribed the judge on his case to expunge his record after he got out of prison. I was stunned, just a kind of ""WTF"" type of moment. He proceeds to tell me stories about him being exceptionally violent and how I was cool because I didn't care about his deafness. That he doesn't hold back when someone is rude about his disability he starts telling me stories about how he solves his problems with violence.

He even says to me, ""I hope I'm not scaring you!"" Now, normally, I'd have exited that Uber a long time ago, but we were in a canyon where there was no way I could get a new ride and being dropped off in the middle of that area would've looked too suspicious.

I don't know if he was spouting off lies to make himself seem ""tough"" but, it certainly wasn't impressive. The stories he was telling me made me feel like if I disagreed with him or said the wrong thing, I might get hurt. Finally, the ride ends and I am dumbfounded.

My first instinct was to report him right away, but I felt like this:

>""Maybe he's turned his life around bribed or not the judge expunged his record and he did serve his time for his crime. I'm all for those who become better people. He does have major chip on his shoulder though and if I feel like if I said the wrong thing I'd be in physical danger, I can only imagine if someone did say the wrong thing and he went off on them.

Would he be violent? Could I save someone if I report this? What if.... and that's what ultimately led me to make a report to Uber. Their safety assurance line was very helpful and thought the whole situation was bizarre and uncalled for. When I was on the phone with uber, I made the comment that he could be lying and suspending him might be a bit much, but maybe reach out to him about what he's sharing with passengers and Uber flat out told me that they were refunding the ride and suspending his account.

IDK am I an ass? I just felt really conflicted about this because on one hand, he paid for his crime, on another he seemed like e could easily be set off and become violent again, and on another hand he had a disability and I didn't want to ruin his livelihood, but at the same time i felt very threatened and scared in his car but maybe I'm just a wuss.

I've got a couple requests for an update, and to be honest I could have given an update the night after it happened but I didn't want to post too much if something changed. I'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. I read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but I didn't really have time since she found the thread. I tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and I think one of her friends clued her in.  I hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their SOs.

&#x200B;

Some of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest I didn't really think she was abusing him. I just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. Molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.

&#x200B;

My original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. Something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. None of this happened sadly. She came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. The vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). I'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. Our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. I know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. Even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.

*toxic relationship not abusive, because you did break his arm when he tried leaving, and you did burn cigarettes on him when you got mad at him, so it's a toxic relationship not an abusive one.

66,Not the A-hole,"I lived in an apartment alone which I loved. A new girl started at work, we clicked and became good friends. It was about time for both of us  to sign new leases on our places. She didn’t like her apartment and didn’t enjoy living alone. The conversation was had to live together. I went back and forth for awhile because I really liked my current space, but to further sell me on the idea of living together we looked at a place that was would save me a lot of money. I agreed, we put a deposit down.

I had (have) a boyfriend and she had a long-er term BF who was still in school in a different city but was expected to graduate soon. After we committed to living together, she asked if it would be OK if her boyfriend lived with us.... with his puppy German Shepherd. I said I wasnt comfortable with that, bc it’s kinda weird living as a third wheel and we both each had a cat- itd be too much. I love dogs, but my cat hates dogs and I didn’t want to live with a puppy which I had no control over.

Long story short, we ended up finding a house for rent instead of the apt.  I agreed to pay a greater portion of the rent (which ended up costing the same as my old apt) to have the master suite. She got her own bedroom and bathroom, just wasn’t a suite. We used my furniture to furnish all communal living spaces. After about a month of living together, herBF graduates but doesn’t have anywhere to go (no job) so she asks if he could live with us. I communicate how I was upset she is putting me in this situation (again), but I’ll be ok with him living there for 2months max under the conditions he pay equal rent/utilities for his stay then for the rest of our lease (1yr) we go back to 50:50 split on the rent. Doing the math, she would only owe 65$ more on the year, bc he would be paying a portion for those two months which *should* also alleviate her financially. She FREAKS OUT. 

It comes out she was planning on paying for whatever portion he would owe, because he doesn’t have a job. Their relationship was never very stable, and she blamed that on me. I got called some nasty names, got rumors spread about me at our work place, and endured her pettiness at home every day until she moved out.  

Her boyfriend and dog had stayed a weekend or 2 prior to his graduation with us and they were total chaos. They didn’t believe in crate training the dog, so whenever they left the house the dog would jump the “barrier” they made with pillows and she would chase my cat, chew furniture, jump on counter tops, Etc. Things destroyed.  Again, it was my furniture getting ruined.

My bf would spend the night often and she would throw that in my face and say how it isn’t fair he “lives here” but her boyfriend “wasn’t allowed”.

So I have been working on an artwork  am fairly proud of, it's shading and all together style of it i absolutely love. I have been working it for about a week and a half, meaning I have taken more hours on this than many of my art. My teacher (Mrs. Doggo ) had been watching me work on it for a long time, as most of my free time in school was in her class, she complemented me and told me things that I needed to work on when I showed her my art.  In class we had been studying end of year finals , I had just finished my work early and was taking out my sketchbook to draw for the rest of the class. The teacher noticed I was finished and took up my paper, smiling at me and walked away to her desk to probably grade. I continued to draw for about ten minutes before the teacher came in front of the classroom and announced that if anyone wasn't done to speed up because there was only 15 minutes of class left. She walked over to me and took my drawing from my hands, crumpling it up into a ball and scolded me for not studying for the finals, I just started in horror as she threw it into the bin and sat back down. I walked up to the bin and picked it up, ABOUT TO FUCKING CRY MIGHT I ADD. I crumpled it as she scolded me for getting it and telling me to go back to me seat, I started to cry and went out of the classroom. I went to the office to see the headteacher and I cried to him, saying that she allowed me to before and she liked it. I guess he didn't want a complaint from my parents or something so he sent her home for the rest of the day, leaving a helper (?) teacher in charge of the class. for the rest of the week she has been calling out in class, ""Oh Scarlet-Be-Sketches, you look like you know the answer, please stand up and tell us.""

And she made some lame excuse that C’s card must have still been on her account from the previous year (they went to the festival together last year). I know that was garbage because we didn’t have C on my account at that time and i know for a fact she took cash (it was a memorable weekend that’s for another time). We both knew she was lying. Also because we have had no charges in the last year to Uber.

G texted C with an Apple Pay for the exact amount that was charged to her card. I want to get new bank cards tomorrow, and I kind of want to press charges anyways. I know the bank will likely need a reason for the cancellation and issue of new cards. So I’m really considering. So WIBTA if I press charges?",58,71,0.94
73,Not the A-hole,"My dad passed a few years ago. The property is around two hours from the city we both live.  My sister, say Hannah, wants to fix up and rent out. It is also not rentable in my opinion because of water issues, no working furnace(does have a fireplace furnace) As we are far from the property I didn't want to rent as it would hard to deal with any problems that may come about. That first year we had the place we used it for a cabin for camping.  Then the winter hits and I find Hannah has put a tenant on the property.  I didn't find out from her, I found out by my power bill being expensive. She confirmed it.  She shared half of the couple months of rent she got from the guy.  But now he is not paying his rent on time.  She never vetted him and she knows better.  She also didn't let me get my stuff I had left out there so now this tenant has access to all of my stuff I left.  So my hubby and I go out there to get our shit and deliver an eviction notice.  He wasn't there but went in and grabbed what I could of my stuff I could find.  All the furniture and stuff that the tenant didn't want in the house was left outside in the snow, getting wrecked. 
I consulted a lawyer and they said I could get out of this situation by sueing for the property to be sold through the courts. She wouldn't have a choice.  I am conflicted about this.  I feel she fucked up and ruined the property even more than it was.  The thing is this guy is still probably on the property without paying rent.  So  I got the process going.  But the place isn't selling for over a year because the place is in shitty condition and the market sucks.  I miss her.  What would you have done? AITA?

Edit: it seems I am not the asshole to do this to my sister.  I am the asshole to the tenant, though I wasn't asking about that.  It's easier to see things looking back. Doesn't make things easier.  Thanks for the opinions people!",61,216,0.97

76,Asshole,"Some background here: I’m a high schooler, and for my last birthday my parents promised they’d buy me an iPhone. This was quite an appreciated promise, as my family is lower income and the only other connection I’d had to the Internet was a crappy old desktop computer we share. My parents rescinded this promise, however, after they wrongfully blamed me for something that my year-older brother did. My brother let me take the fall, and ended up getting an iPhone while I got nothing.

I worked hard to save up money for an iPhone, but didn’t get a whole lot. Nine months later, some new evidence came to light and my parents realized I had been innocent all along, and my brother had actually committed said offense. They apologized profusely, and after a while I asked them (not in a bitter or entitled manner at all) if they could now get me the iPhone since they now know I didn’t do it. My dad told me, very apologetically, that that will have to wait a while since our financial situation has gone downhill the past nine months (mom lost her job, etc.) He said he’ll try and save up the best he can over the next few months to get me a phone. I was disappointed but a good sport.

Then I came up with an idea that would help get us the much-needed cash nearly right away to buy me an iPhone. I did some research and number-crunching, then documented my plan and presented it to my parents. **First**, we take my brother’s iPhone and sell it (which is fair as HE should have been the one not given an iPhone as punishment). Used iPhones of his model sell for a decent amount, but wouldn’t get me enough money to buy a new one. 

Thus, the second part: my brother recently bought his girlfriend and himself some tickets for a rock concert that he saved up for for six months, has been deathly excited for and been counting down the days until. They cost a total of $250, and if sold or returned, would provide enough money combined with the returned iPhone money to buy **me** an iPhone. I presented all this information to my parents, and they agreed it would be an appropriate punishment for my brother. They took away his iPhone and tickets, and we are in the process of getting them sold, much to his dismay.

My brother is furious at me and is refusing to talk to me, but I don’t really care that much. I’m angry at him for letting me take the fall, and am looking forward greatly to my new iPhone. AITA?",82,71,0.87

The bagger ended up wasting $15 worth of bread, chips and fruit. He actually popped a bag of chips when loading a bag in my cart. When I requested another bagger she looked at me like I broke some law. People were giving me strange looks but the dude did his bagging job 100% wrong.

79,No A-holes here,"Let me preface this by saying this would actually be on behalf of my friend (Abby) for their Friend (Isabel). Abby and I are both very body positive; Both of us are a little on the larger side ourselves but we can function as well as the average person. 

Despite this, we know there's a line between body positive and obesity encouragement.

Our friend, Isabel, cannot function in day to day life without struggling heavily due to her weight. The first time we met was when our mutual friend, Abby, was taking us out to a nearby pub for lunch. Abby and I can make the walk there in about 20 minutes if we hit every stoplight on the way there. But, with Isabel with us, what should have been a 15-20 minute walk tops turned into an hour walk as we had to keep stopping for Isabel to catch up to us or take breaks as her knees begun to hurt not even a quarter of the way through.

I remember we got there and she orders the biggest bowl of fries they had and left nothing behind.

I've only seen Isabel a few times since then (she doesn't much like me as Abby seems to have a preference to me vs Isabel) at clothing swaps or protests but even I have noticed how much larger she's become.

Abby confided in me, recently, that she's become very scared for Isabel as she's realizing that their quality of life is so poor because of their weight, as well as the fact that her health is becoming grossly affected. She apparently has tried to help Isabel lose some weight or eat a little healthier only for Isabel to cry fat shaming before she turns around and goes to the nearby fat burger. Abby says Isabel sends her snapchats of her eating at fat burger at least once a day.

Any attempts to address Isabel's health in confidence has resulted in hostility and cries of fat shaming and the like and it's starting to become ridiculous. Abby has even cried because she's so scared of what may happen to Isabel!

Abby wants to hold an intervention but is afraid of how Isabel would react. I, on the other hand, don't care how Isabel would react as I feel she really needs this final push to either; change her lifestyle enough to not struggle with so much as walking, or give up and allow herself to be consumed by her weight.

So my question is, would I be the asshole for doing this on Abby's behalf? Would it be inappropriate to even address this? Should I just let Isabel do what she wants and pretend it isn't happening?

Everyone I asked said they would show up, they even asked about times, dates and what I wanted for my birthday. I didn’t want gifts, I wanted to celebrate with friends and family. One cousin volunteered to be the DJ. My mother was thrilled because I tend to not be the most social of butterflies and cooked everything herself.

The day of the party came and only a few showed, my closest friends, my cousin texted me last minute to say he wouldn’t be able to be the DJ. My massive party was suddenly turned to a small bbq.

The few that showed managed to make it special. I was really bummed but concluded that now I didn’t have to go to any of these people’s events or get them a gift for said event.

A neighbor we invited is having a graduation party for their son and I invited them to this party, they didn’t show and I don’t plan on attending their sons graduation, I also stopped buying b-day and holiday gifts for family and friends who didn’t show. Am I the asshole for returning the same shit that was dealt to me?

Edit: To be clear, these neighbors didn’t have their party the same day as mine, theirs is next week.

She received a $400k inheritance about 7 months ago, but hasn't made any changes to her life.  Still sleeping on a friends couch, not looking for work, spending all day on social media.

No issues except my neighbor Clint has his wifi network labeled ""k!ddie d!ddler network"" (sorry for the edit, I don't even know if reddit automods will allow that). Every weekend it shows up on my kid's devices and every weekend I have to figure out how I am going to explain what he's try to do.

86,Not the A-hole,"I had Tiger for close to 15 years. She was a beautiful calico, and I couldn't have asked for a better girl. My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. 

I'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.

Fast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) ""Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?""
Obviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. ""[My name],"" she said at least 3 times, ""[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?"" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, ""wow you're really mad at me?""

A day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my ""attitude"" and saying things like, ""I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke."" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.

They might have a vegetarian option as an afterthought, but like frenchfries or cheap pasta but sold for $$$+. Usually I have to add together a meal out of appetizers. But I don’t complain because I’m the only one. Although as an animal lover it would be nice if my family would eat less meat :/ But I don’t ask them to.

For my birthday dinner this year, I asked my mom to take the family to a vegetarian restaurant where there will be entrees that are designed for people like me. Stuff like spicy mushroom empanadas and adobo enchiladas. (we all like mexican food.) Mom's argument Is that there won’t be anything for the rest of the family to eat there. My argument is that they can eat anything they want to, I’m the one with the restriction. Mom says it’s not a restriction if you choose it. But I kinda feel like it’s not a choice, I can’t just snap my fingers and change my ethical beleifs. Like I “choose” not to shoplift with my friends because know right from wrong.

My roommate seems to be very nice though we haven’t gotten to speak that much as she’s leaving on Tuesday for a month and is spending a lot of time with her friends and family. The only other things in the basement are a bathroom and the laundry room which is in the middle. 

The laundry room, hallway and my bathroom now absolutely reek of ammonia but I didn’t notice it at all the first day I was here or when I came to view the room. I had to clean it on Friday night because it smelt so bad and when I brought it up to her she only scooped the poop and left everything else. Today it reeked again and I checked the liner (which is just a paper bag with something waterproof on the inside) and it was soaked with urine. The litter box is just a plastic tub and the “liners” are way too small. 

She answered my ad looking for a room which specifically said I need a place that doesn’t used scented laundry producers because they give me migraines. There is zero ventilation in the basement and all smells either sit there or have to escape through the stairs or the window in my bedroom. 

I can’t deal with it. I’ve woken up with a headache that hasn’t gone away for the last 2 days and I’m miserable. We talked briefly about trying a different litter but I don’t want to deal with it all. I just want to ask her to move it somewhere else. She was just going to have someone come clean it once a week but I said scoop it for her while she’s gone. I want it moved before she leaves but feel like I might be overstepping by asking.

Edit: I’m an idiot and forgot to mention the part where the box is located in the laundry room, not in a common living space. There is no ventilation at all so the smell just sits in the 3 downstairs rooms. I don’t use the living room at all and spend 100% of my time at home in my room.",27,85,0.94

My husband and I travel for work, and don't see my family a lot. My sister decides to bring home Jim for Thanksgiving - without checking in with me or my husband. We still miss her ex, and Jim has been kind of sprung on us - we weren't expecting him. Thanksgiving is now about Jim. It's a lot, especially having just come back to the US. He's a nice guy but I could've used a warning. I'm usually close with my sister, but she was wrapped up in Jim the whole time.

My sister and I are now on bad terms because I wasn't accepting enough of Jim. It's true: I wasn't myself, but I didn't know how to get out of the funk I was in. I wanted it to be just family, as I won't see them again til summer. My sister's said that she doesn't know if Jim will last, or if he's the one, but I need to be supportive and welcoming of whoever she's with. I'm not sure I want to do that so early. Her ex knew our whole family, he and his parents came to my wedding, we had professionally worked with him, he was part of our lives. I don't know Jim, I don't have anything against him, but I don't want to commit to getting to know him like that after just a couple months in.

LAST WEEK: my mom asked my sister to plan a family reunion. We're excited. I was talking with my dad looking at the family emails list my sister put together, when I see Jim's email there. My dad's bummed. His family has had a lot of ups and downs, and they reconciled in 2017 - a big deal. Some are sick, and are coming in from far away. My dad wrote to my sister asking Jim to not come, for this to be family only, since she was engaged recently to a guy everyone knew. Jim and my sister are not living together, they've had ups and downs, and my dad doesn't want everyone to meet him just for him to disappear too.

All hell broke loose. My sister decided I had forced my dad to write this email (I hadn't). She said that it's not up to me to decide who she can call family, as in Jim is her family. She said even if they break up, she still can bring him, though no one else is bringing a boyfriend/girlfriend.

I hadn't demanded that Jim not go at all. My dad has since told my sister that he can go, and now they are okay, but my sister says she'll never talk to me again. She thinks I gossip about her new boyfriend, that I hate him, she refuses to stay at our home if I'm there.

I've sent her a card saying I miss her (I'm abroad), but my mom thinks I need to apologize, and talk on the phone with Jim to tell him that I want him at the reunion. Honestly: it's whatever.

If he’s driving and keeps veering over into the wrong lane or riding a car’s bumper. I’ll point that out because it honestly makes me nervous. He’ll immediately get angry, rant about how much he hates riding with me in the car because when he’s by himself no one bitches at him. 

I don’t think I’m being bitchy.

But if I don’t say anything then I just have to be embarrassed/uncomfortable with what he’s doing. 

If I ask why he gets so angry over this he tells me I’m dramatic or bitchy. Being honest it does happen alot, usually because he ignores me and just keeps doing whatever he wants no matter how much it bothers me or anyone around us. So I’ll ask a few times before he either blows up or I give up.

104,Not the A-hole," So a couple of hours ago I was on a 5 hour plane home with my mother from a small trip. There was assigned seating, which resulted in my mom getting sat somewhere else not next to me. The man who was supposed to sit next to me did not make the flight so I had an empty seat next to me. Me, being your typical 17 year old male, thought that this was great! I would have all the legroom in the world! 

Then, I saw them enter the plane. Two 6 year old twin girls flanked by two parents. The two twins proceeded to sit right behind the two seats I was currently occupying. Their parents sat next to them. I included a poorly drawn diagram I quickly sketched in my notes to show the plane layout.

The twins remained relatively calm until we got in the air. At this point, they started trying to see who could kick my chair the hardest. I decided to switch to the empty seat next to me, and they proceeded to kick the chair I switched to. I switched again and, surprise, they started kicking my new seat. 

 At this point I was extremely frustrated. I was on two hours of sleep and grumpy teenager mode had officially activated. I looked back and stated very loudly “Can you please stop?”

This seemed to get their parents attention. They seemed to look at their children, who immediately started behaving once they noticed their parents looked. Their parents said “stop” to their children, and proceeded to go back to not paying their children any attention.

At this point the children stopped. However not even 5 minutes later, these things crawled under my seat and grabbed my leg. They started trying to do everything they could to annoy me. I was fed up. I yelled “STOP” and the flight attendant noticed. The flight attendant demanded that the parents go to the very back of the plane towards empty seats with their children or they would be suspended from the airline for all future flights.

AITA for yelling and not calmly discussing it with their parents or was this justified?

Edit: Please note that I am a 17 year old male and so everything I said probably came off with a rude tone.

Pretty soon a family showed up, a mother, father, two little kids and a baby. The other tables had filled up so they sat at the same one as us, which was cool with everyone. One of the little kids was sitting next to me and talking to me about the lions and stuff. All good.

Anyway, we are super slow eaters and they were kind of in a hurry so they got done before us and packed up their stuff. Then the woman put her baby on the table and started changing his diaper, right next to where my friend and I were still eating.

We were grossed-out and aside from anything else, there were toilets right there, and also some of the other tables had freed up, if she really really wanted to change her baby on a table where people eat. Anyway I said to my friend ""this is so disgusting!""

The woman heard me and was like ""You think I'm disgusting?"" I said, ""Not you, but the diaper on the table is, yes."" She got angry and said that I didn't understand because I wasn't a parent, and that the diaper only had pee in and not poop, so it was clean.

107,Not the A-hole,"So last night, myself and a friend of mine had shows we directed and have been working on for about a month open, in the same theatre in repertory (my friend’s show was before mine). I was unable to actually see my own show as one of my cast members was violently ill and I took her place onstage. After the show, partially because I was unable to see it, I asked my friend and her boyfriend (both of whom are close friends of mine) what they thought of my show. They informed me that they were unable to pay attention to it because a mutual friend of ours was sitting next to them and talking to them through large parts of the show. Of course, it is theatre etiquette 101 not to talk while a show is happening, and I was pissed off since my friends were unable to watch my show because of uncorteous audience behavior. So I texted my mutual friend who talked for the entire show and told her that I was disappointed and kinda angry at her for talking through my show, informed her how sad I was that my friends were unable to watch my show due to her talking, and told her if she had no interest in seeing a show that she should simply not watch it instead of coming in and talking through the whole thing. I texted her about twelve hours ago and have received no response. Reddit, AITA?",14,89,0.95
108,Not the A-hole,"So my roommate (28 F) and I (28 F) have lived together for four years now. She has become one of my closest friends, and she really means the world to me. But I’m moving out of town for a new job, and it’s now time to sadly part ways. So throughout our time together I have been dreading at some point moving out because we both have acquired a lot of things, and I have come to know how stressed out (more than what I perceive as normal) she can be about everything. We all have our obstacles and challenges, but doing anything that requires the time and energy that moving entails I just knew was going to send her over the edge. 

So knowing that, a month ago I created a calendar of how we were gonna pack, basically like “week 1, pack decor, week 2, sell furniture and pack bathroom items.” I’ve followed the plan somewhat, and was pretty impressed with how easy this whole process has been. But my roommate, she has done next to nothing, even with me trying to coax her along slowly. Well tomorrow is our move out date and I seriously doubt it’s going to be done. She had the whole day off to do stuff yesterday, but barely did any packing as far as I can tell. I was going to take today to move the rest of my boxes to the storage unit and then clean the entire place, but now I’m at a loss of what to do. 

My roommate did not take off from work today and has been having a complete meltdown all morning while there. She comes home in an hour, and she is telling me that she needs help and asks if I could start packing her things. Well, I have my stuff to do, not to mention the cleaning that she will totally not touch, and I’m supposed to go to my sister’s house for dinner later. I guess I am feeling very assholish because I don’t really want to help her. She’s known for months that we were leaving, I’ve tried to organize things to make it easier, and it is just now sinking in. But I don’t like seeing her like this and I’m dreading her coming back here because she is probably just going to sit on the couch and cry. I know if I help I will be doing most of the work because she will need to remove herself to destress every few minutes which is so frustrating. I don’t want to go out on a bad note here, but I really want her to do this on her own for her own sake. So reddit, am I the asshole if I don’t help her?

Edit: UPDATE! Okay sorry for the delay, it’s been a long two days. Anyways, I’ll start with yesterday. I went out and did a few things while my roommate first got home. She called me a few times but I ignored them. I wanted to get my stuff done first because it was inevitable that I was going to have to help her. So when I was done I got back to the apartment only to find her on her phone just sitting there. She had packed two boxes and was just chilling on the couch. Now, she had been home for three hours at this point and only had packed two small boxes of some of her kitchen things. I was livid!! I went to my room to grab my jacket and was going to head to my sister’s house. She really didn’t say anything to me until I got home later that night to which again I walked into her sitting on the couch on her phone. I got a bit snarky because I said, “you do know our move out date is tomorrow right?” She then started to cry and say that she doesn’t know where to start. So I honestly grabbed her phone and told her we were gonna go room to room and do this and we’re not going to bed until the downstairs was done. That honestly took about four hours of just me holding each object up I could find and either it going in the “pack, trash, or donate” pile. I was so aggravated, especially if her phone would buzz and she wanted to check it for ten minutes. Finally I told her I was done and we did make progress but I told her she should stay up later and get more done. So jump to the next morning, I woke up and came downstairs to find she did nothing more the previous night and not only that but she was still asleep. So I left and went to the apartment office and told them the situation. Well the manager is wonderful and an hour or so later she went and knocked on the door, waking my roommate up, and telling her that if she was not vacated by 5pm that she (and only she) would be charged an extended rate. I thought that would light a fire under her ass but it didn’t. She made breakfast and then slowly moved along. So honestly, I just sat there most of the day and tried to clean. She cried several times and finally her sister came over to help but really they were no quicker together than if my roommate did it herself. Around 2pm about half of her stuff was in at least boxes but the big pieces of furniture still were just chilling there and I wondered what she was going to do. Long story short she called the office and she is willing to pay and extended fee so that her and her parents can go back tomorrow and get the rest. I’m not sure if she’s still there, I left a bit ago and she apologized and thanked me for helping. I don’t feel bad like I did before, more annoyed if anything. So I’m going back tomorrow too to clean since I didn’t really get a chance to shampoo the carpets. We’ll see how that goes...I know we will still be friends but I don’t think I could ever live with her again.",101,625,0.98
109,Not the A-hole,"For some background, I work at a science center and today I am stationed in a gallery meant for the little ones. In this gallery we have big foam blocks that kids can build with, they're quite big so I've seen mini houses that many kids can fit into. 
Anyways for the story, while sitting in the gallery I was watching these two girls build a rather impressive arch. After awhile they began to build a house behind it. While they had their backs turned a boy about the same age as them ran over, screaming, and kicked the arch and unfinished house over. The girls were quite upset. One of them was crying to her mother who also seemed upset. The kid who kicked it has a history. His family have season passes and he is notoriously misbehaved. Today alone I've had to tell him multiple times not to run, he has tinkered with broken exhibits, and in general tests the boundaries set. (His parents are also questionable, they mostly sit on their phones and let him do as he wants, they never reprimand him after many times of me politely reminding them and him of the rules.)
After a little while of him thrashing around in the blocks he starts to build, and his castle begins to take shape. I am standing near the bench and overhear the two girls talking to the adult with them, they ask if they can destroy it and she says it's against the rules. At this point I lean in and say ""I wont say anything"" the mom nods at me and the two girls go off and do exactly what he did. He screams and runs off, and he and his parents leave.

110,Not the A-hole,"I apologize for the length, there’s a lot of background.

My older sister didn’t live with us growing up. She grew up with my grandparents, who have more money than us (upper middle class, we’re below the poverty line). They now live in a different state but we still talk somewhat often. She’s never really understood how tough it is for us to buy basic things. Now that she lives on her own she has a better idea, but things like rent are still paid for by my grandparents.

My graduation is coming up and I can’t afford a cap and gown. I’ve talked to my school about this with no luck. I’m still going to graduate, just not going to walk. 

This has been killing my dad. He never got to walk and really wants to see me do it, but any money he can offer (and money from my job) are going towards my college expenses.

The problem is, my older sister also REALLY wants this and has been hounding me about it. She’s mentioned it to my dad, which has made things worse. She’s constantly saying things like “(parents) need to understand this is a necessity, something you NEED to buy” and “I’m coming up there to see you walk, so you have to” and “just ask (grandparents) for money.” First off, my parents really want this for me, we just literally cannot afford it. Also, my parents have asked my grandparents for money my whole life. I refuse to take advantage of them financially like the rest of my family does.

I’ve spoken to my grandparents about how I probably won’t walk. They’ve offered to send me the money they would have spent on the trip here instead of actually coming up. This would help me tremendously, as I have a lot to pay off to my college next year. The thing is, they’ve offered to send the money up with my older sister.

More background: My younger sister LOVES playing video games. My uncle isn’t around a lot, but he knows this and offered to give us his Xbox. She was ecstatic. Since he was in the state my grandparents and older sister live in, he dropped it off with my grandparents, asking them to bring it to us when they visit for thanksgiving.

Understandably, they forgot. They promised to mail it as soon as they got back. However, when they returned, my older sister decided to take the Xbox and keep it for herself, because “It’s easier to watch Netflix and Hulu.” She could easily afford her own. She hates video games. This is something we would never be able to afford otherwise.

My younger sister was heartbroken. I was livid. I messaged her, saying that it was meant for our younger sister and needs to be sent to her. She says she’ll send it to us “when she finds the money for a package that big.” I offered to give her money to send the package to us. I haven’t heard anything about it since.

Now I don’t trust her to bring the money up here. I’ve brought this up with my parents, who are disappointed I feel this way. I haven’t said anything to my grandparents or my older sister.

111,Not enough info,"FINAL UPDATE: We shut down everything early yeasterday for a nice catered in lunch for our meeting. He had printed out emails from all of us about our specific areas and what is lacking.
 
Everything was laid out by all of us. The conclusion is we're all getting pretty decent raises, not the 35k that was talked about.

The owner also told me to hire 2 office secretary/assistant/gofer people to collect everything for the reporting.

This will alleviate a lot of the issues on my end as well as free up time for the other guys. They won't have to worry so much with the paperwork. The two assistants will be doing most of the data entry during the week and I'll be able to manage everything that needs to be done.

So not too bad of a deal and I don't have to start looking for a new job yet.

______________________


UPDATE: I sent the owner an email yesterday asking him to call when he could. He called me about lunch today and I aired out the ongoing issues. He told me, flat out, that I could do one of two things...he told me to hire an assistant/secretary in at 35k, or go from hourly to salary and I take the 35k and continue doing what I do. Now I'm torn, an assistant to relieve some of the stress, or 35k to deal with the same stuff I always do. I was not expecting a response like that. He also told me to setup a staff meeting for Friday because he wanted to visit. First time he's ever wanted that.


I took a job last year that I wasn't wholly prepared for. I learned quick and saw several flaws in the tracking and production methods.

Whrn I started there were 3 of us, now there are 5. Owner is absentee.

We all have the specific area that is our sole responsibility, but have to help each other out because it all ties together.

Since I've started, I built new tracking paperwork, a new inventory database, and compilation spreadsheets that keep all of our numbers on point. It's an almost perfect setup with what I've built.

The other 4 guys don't accept the computer. They refuse to use and just keeping doing everything with pencil and paper.

When you have 4 other guys doing their paperwork the old way and refusing to change it sucks.

The owner prefers the nice, clean, printed spreadsheet that shows everything that was done for the month. So it has to be done that way now.

Every Friday I have to take everybody else's bullcrap chicken scratches and compile it into the spreadsheet because no one else will even attempt to learn.

I usually wind up having to stay over 2-4hrs on Fridays to enter everything because it can't be kept track of very well until we shut down that afternoon.

Now, if I stop doing what I'm doing, there's a solid chance the company, at the least, shuts down for some time while they figure out what materials need to be ordered and what the consumption rates are. The more plausible scenario is that the owner would just close the doors as he has other income sources and views this as a hobby almost.

I'm a pretty marketable guy and can move into what I was previously doing without much more than a phone call. But the guys I work with probably don't have that same capability.

115,Not the A-hole,"For context, the girl in question (I'll call her Anna) lives with my girlfriend and constantly has other men round. All the people who live in the house disprove strongly, but don't want to make things uncomfortable by telling her boyfriend what she's doing. At current we know for a fact that she's slept with at least 2 guys in the last few weeks, repeatedly. There's been nights where Anna has stayed at somebody else's and nobody knows for sure what happened on those occasions.

I don't want to do anything to make my girlfriend uncomfortable, but I can't imagine how betrayed I'd feel if I was in the shoes of Anna's boyfriend and people didn't tell me as soon as possible. They don't have an open relationship and on the few times I've spoken to the guy he's said how much he hates living long distance and that trusting Anna is the only reason he doesn't struggle too much.

So essentially AITA if I tell him? I could make a fake facebook account to give him a heads up anonymously and then I'd be more than happy to leave it alone. The other girls won't tell him anytime soon but really hope he finds out and Anna won't ever tell him I don't think.

Edit: I'm worried that it might destabilise his mental health. When Anna spoke to my gf about it, she said she'd thought about telling him but that he's said he'll ""kill himself"" if she ever cheated on him. Now I'm aware she's probably lying to get her housemates off her back, but I don't want to tell him if there's even the slightest chance of that being true.

If I don’t notice they were in there he gleefully tells me after eating that there were mushrooms in the dish.

This morning for breakfast he made a quiche. When I asked what was in it he said “eggs, sausage, and cheese.” So I took a bite. I could taste something was off. That earthy dirt flavor that mushrooms have. I asked him if there were mushrooms and he said “no, no mushrooms” I looked at him and said “it tastes kind of like there are. Are you sure there are no mushrooms in this?” He then said “come on! They add so much flavor! It’s umami!” 

I was upset. I asked him before eating and after suspecting what I was eating was a food I dislike heavily and he was dishonest. He wouldn’t apologize for it, and said “You’re not allergic. Calm down.”

117,Not the A-hole,"I am about to graduate college next week and only plan on inviting my brother and mom (my parents are divorced). 


I had a falling out with my dad's side of family three years ago. For reference, my dad is Hispanic and is very traditional. Long story short, I was fed up with his ""machista"" chauvinistic attitudes towards women that had started since before my parents divorced. He was okay with my brother's girlfriend living in his home, but told me it wouldn't be ladylike to move in with my boyfriend of two years. I called him out on his double standard as my brother's girlfriend and I were the same age (20 at the time), and in response he told me that it's not the same between women and men. Additionally, he wouldn't support me financially if I were to move in with my boyfriend. I told him that was fine, and have been living with my boyfriend (now husband) supporting ourselves independently for the last three years. I have been NC with my dad ever since.

It has been challenging budgeting our expenses while also going to college, but we did it. Next Friday, my husband and I are both graduating and going off to grad school out of state in the fall. We were accepted to fully-funded programs and are SO overjoyed to be starting this chapter. However, this week my brother texted me that my dad's side of the family is coming to my graduation. I have sisters on my dad's side that I have not seen for the better part of three years since they took my dad's side on the matter. They have gossiped about me in the past (I hear about this from my brother) and fear that they only want to come for the chismes (gossip). He told me that they were dismissive of his warnings that I may not want them there.


I only planned to have my mom and brother there since they (along with my husband) have been my rock the last few years. Would I be an asshole if I were to text them (dad's side) that they are not invited to my graduation?

**EDIT**: Thanks for your input! I let them know that I have sent out all my invitations and would prefer they not come.

**EDIT 2**: 
More details. My sister (who I haven't seen in 3 years) texted me expressing how my dad's side of the family would really like to come. I texted back that I prefer if they didn't. 

No response from her. But I assume she told my dad because then *he* texted me ""See you at your graduation !"" I was floored. Again, I replied that that wasn't necessary as I only invited and wanted my mom and brother to be there. Silence.

So for some background: my upstairs neighbor and I go way back to high school, and were housemates at one point as well. I consider him to be my friend. He drinks and sometimes overdoes it, and there are times when there's no talking to him when he's like this. During these times he's been known to want to be social or ask favors at what I consider to be inappropriate hours/circumstances. Over the years I've come to accept this is just one of his ""things"" and it usually doesn't lead to anything major. The drinking is relevant because I suspect it might have been a factor in this situation.

As for me, I get up for work very early in the morning (3am, start work at 5am). I'm a fairly crucial opener, so unless I'm too sick to work I really need to be there. 

I was getting ready for work the other morning and there was a knock on the door. My boyfriend answered and it was my upstairs neighbor asking if we could go pick up his friend who was stranded downtown. My boyfriend said no, as his license is currently not valid and even if it was, I'm the only one with a car and I was heading into work soon. 

So I'm walking out to my car and he's outside. I don't know if he was specifically waiting for me, but he asked me again and I told him I really had to be at work and couldn't do it. I asked about calling an Uber for the stranded friend, and he told me ""she's lost"". So not only would we be going downtown to pick up this person, we'd have to actually locate her as well. :/

I ended up going in to work, but I still feel kinda bad for it. I don't think it was at all unreasonable of me to decline, but I keep thinking ""what if she was in trouble?"" or ""what if something were to happen to her and I could have prevented it?"".

I'm honestly not sure why an Uber wouldn't have been an option unless they didn't have money for one, but I would have been fine helping them out with it if that was the case.

124,Not enough info,"Unfortunately, the title is as silly as it sounds, and this post isn’t going to make any sense of it. Basically, for as long as I’ve dressed myself, I’ve always put on two pairs of underwear. I don’t know why it started, but I’ve been doing it for a while. I’ve tried to break the habit, but every time I try, I feel physically uncomfortable and just don’t bother.

Now, I’ve been with my wife for 3 years and married for 1. Until recently, she did not know I had this habit. This Friday night, we were getting ready to have sex and we were both kind of stripping down, but in a corny and silly kind of way. We were both being very dramatic about taking off our clothes, and once I took my pants, I sensually took off the first pair of underwear slowly before taking off the second. She completely burst into laughter, and found the whole situation hilarious. She told me that I had way too much dedication to this sensual stripping but we were doing, but then I told her that the two pairs of underwear wasn’t part of the bit, and I actually do that normally. She didn’t believe me at first, and it took some pestering for her to finally realize I wasn’t making this up. She said we’ll talk about this later and we continued on with our sexual activities, however, I did notice some subtle signs of her being slightly less affectionate.

Anyways, yesterday we wake up, and all day she’s questioning everything about my habit. She brings up things like how it doesn’t make sense because I go through twice the amount of laundry, how it’s uncomfortable, and how there probably isn’t anyone else in the world who does this. I understand that what she’s saying makes sense, but again, I mentioned to her that I tried to kick the habit and was very uncomfortable doing so, so I just stopped trying. She tells me that I barely gave it a chance, and that it just makes zero logistical sense to wear two pairs of underwear. I told her it isn’t hurting anyone.

After this initial argument, she continues to complain to me about this issue. She starts getting gradually more angry about it as the day goes on, and what started out as playful ribbing turns into heated argument. She starts bringing up how it’s gonna be a total turnoff in bed now because she won’t be able to stop thinking about it, and she starts calling me a weirdo, which definitely hurt me. I know she’s probably doing it to get me to stop wearing two pairs of underwear, but it still hurts regardless. The argument just keeps going in circles until I just say that I’m done talking about it. She remains very angry for the rest of the night and basically doesn’t talk to me and we just get into bed silently that night. It’s this morning now, and she’s not awake yet, but I’m really starting to question whether I’m actually in the wrong here or if she’s overreacting and making a big deal out of a minor issue.

Then she proceeded to suggest that we be in an open relation to which i agreed then further down the line disagreed and told her she hurt me for even asking that.

We break up. She then that night goes to this guys house and sleeps overnight. Comes back to our flat in the morning and tells me she was at one of her girlfriends. We go non contact and dont speak for 3 days and on the third day her car was yet again in his driveway.

So i pack her shit, then was going to leave it at her car outside his house, it was gone once i got there. So i proceeded to go to her familys home where shes staying and drop the stuff i packed with a broken picture of us. And then left a bag at his home with a note.

129,Not the A-hole,"Weird situation, and from writing that title alone I feel like the asshole, but hear me out. Throwaway for privacy, but if you know anyone in the story you'll recognize this anyway. 

My partner's band was invited to play a small festival (5-600 people max) on a campground later this year. The band doesn't fit the bill but was invited because another member (Tj) is friends with the crew throwing it and they're trying to expand their vibe. From what I understand Its like a mini burning man with an extended group of Tj's friends running it. 

Tj started off the conversation by saying his girlfriend was his ""plus one"" but myself and the other girlfriend needed to buy our tickets asap. We sell all the merch and do all of the loading and unloading for the band, for context. We told him we thought it was weird we had to pay $50 to help the band when his SO didn't have to, he said he'd see what he could do and we dropped it for a month.

Friday, he says he can ""get us in free"" if I let him borrow my generator for personal use, and I agree. The boys shake on it. After the boys leave, he calls me and says he might need me to volunteer at the event for an hour. I agree, even though he switched up. Today, he calls and says now it's 4 hours or buy a ticket for $40.

I want to support the scene but I'm annoyed that he went back on his word, broke, socially awkward (I'd be working the gate), and I wouldn't go if we weren't playing it (not my scene. We play metal, this is an EDM/DJ event). I think I might be a little entitled because I have been to and worked every single show these boys have ever had, manage their money, sell their merch and generally support, no questions. It seems odd that I'd have to pay to get in to what's basically a big exclusive camping trip for Tjs friends when he made it seem that he could give out entry on a whim. I also recognize that this event is bigger than TJ and it is ultimately a non profit so paying wouldn't be the worst thing. WIBTA for asking him to stick to his word or cancelling?",141,770,0.96
130,Asshole,"First of all this is all happening in a muslim country with moderate tension between religious and secular people.

So, I have coworker named let's say ""John"". He and I've been working together for a year and we've become pretty close friends. So close that I was a kind of pseudo-best man for his engagement, I took care of everything for the engagement party. I was also the only one he invited from the company.

John and his fiance ""Jane"" are very religious, on the contrary I am not. I'm not the neckbeard atheist type but if anyone asks I don't hide my religious beliefs or the lack of them. 

So the engagement party was a small affair, 30 or so people all family and friends. Almost all women were wearing headscarves etc. Not really the type of party you would mingle with the opposite sex. ""Jane"" had invited a few of her friends and they also wore headscarves except one girl. I didn't interact with any of them besides saying hello. 

Anyways, two weeks passed and John out of the blue said ""Hey, do you wanna meet with any of Jane's friends, they are single. But I guess you wouldn't wanna meet any of the girls wearing headscarves?"". I replied with ""I don't care if they are covering their hair or not but I don't think a religous girl would wanna meet me. Did any of the girls mentioned me to Jane?"" to which he replied ""No"". So I said ""Ok then, there was this girl not covering her hair, how about her?"". He was happy to do that and said she was a good person and single.

Two weeks passed so I asked John if Jane had asked the girl about me. He said no, he forgot but he will as soon as possible. Another week passed and I asked him again, this time he said he told Jane but she was dealing with family problems. So I said ""I don't need a formal introduction, just pass her phone number or instagram and I can ask her if she wants to meet."" to which he replied ""Sure, ok"". Another week passes and I again asked John about her and he told me I was too desperate. I reminded him that he was the one to suggest the whole thing, not me but he laughed it off.

Well a week passes again and I was pretty angry about the whole thing. I went to John and told him ""Don't bother, tell Jane not to ask her about me. I changed my mind, I don't even remember what she looks like."" He again laughed it off and said he asked Jane yesterday and I can't change my mind at this point, it would be offensive to the girl. I couldn't contain my anger and told him to fuck himself and that I would not be attending their fucking wedding.

Anyways I decided to cut ties with him because I feel his fiance thinks I'm a bad person since I'm not religious. I don't care about the friend,  I forgot what she looked like. But still him offering to introduce me then refusing to do so feels very immature. Moreover I'm starting realize practicing religious tolerance means nothing unless it's reciprocated. So am I the asshole for cursing him out and ""breaking up"" with him?

132,Everyone Sucks,"To give a little back story I had been dating a woman for 2 1/2 years and were at one time engaged. We had our problems and for about the last 5 months we've been dating but not been a heavy part of each other's lives. I said some mean things to her during a fight and actually told her to get out... I quickly changed my mind but the damage was done. Now, I have a 7 year old daughter from a previous relationship (I have her half the time) in which my girlfriend had really stepped in as a step mother.  But over the last 5 months has not really been apart of my daughters life and my daughter has seen me suffer with my girlfriend and I not working. 

Now, to the actual event in which I wonder AITA.  My girlfriend a while back bought tickets to an event for my daughter and we decided to all go since her and I were both wanting to work everything out. My daughter acknowledged and thanked my girlfriend for the tickets but she didn't really show excitement. Through the event my daughter really wasn't excited and even in my eyes was not very grateful. I can't really blame my daughter for not knowing how to act around my girlfriend since their relationship had disintegrated over the past 5 months. My girlfriend was not happy about how my daughter acted and let me know that after the event. But she called my daughter some names that really pissed me off. She called my daughter an ungrateful shit ass. I got upset and I hit the window in the car (didn't break it). This really startled her and she got very upset with me. When I got her back to her house she had already told me several times that we were done. I tried to talk to her but it seemed hopeless. She even said to me that she has the option to be a step parent and she wanted it now (after doing the stop parent thing for 2 years).

On my drive home I thought about what she said and it pushed me to the point of being done with it.  She came the next day and got her things from my house.  We both spoke about how we did love each other but we did break up.  I really feel done with it but when I think about the mean things I've said to her in the past I've wondered if I'm being the ass hole by ending it.",66,83,0.86

For the six months I've worked in the department, the junior supervisor has managed the department nearly on her own because of the senior supervisor not pulling his weight. My senior supervisor oversees another much smaller department. Given his split duties in different locations, he is allowed to use a company vehicle to travel between sites. I recently found out that he has scheduled himself for nearly the same hours in both departments. He is currently pulling 20+ hours of overtime and doing almost none of the work. On top of this, he has been leaving early with the claim of going to the other division to finish his shift but goes home instead. He is using his personal vehicle instead of the company vehicle, which means he is eligible for reimbursement for miles traveled. He recently turned in a monthly request for reimbursement of a few hundred dollars. This would compute to an ungodly number of hours driven. His fraud has been going on long enough that any cursory investigation would find that nearly everyone has covered for him in the past in one way or another to save their own asses.

134,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone so apologies for the long story. My ex texed me today asking to make amends with me. We had a terrible relationship we were both toxic for each other and both addicts that enabled each other's addictions. 

I haven't talked to him for 4 months and I've finally starting to be happy again and I'm four months clean from Xanax and heroin. 

Now when he texted me tonight I started shaking and immediately had a panic attack. I breifly considered letting him try to make amends but here is the thing. 1. I'm still very emotional scarred from the relationship 2. I dont forgive him 3. I feel like since ive been doing so well since I haven't been in contact with him that it would be a bad idea and probably a trigger to see him again 

I guess I feel bad because I know that making amends is an important part of recovery. And I want him to be able to stay clean. I just feel like it would put my sobriety at risk to see him. Is this wrong of me? AITA?

136,Not the A-hole,"The other day I (27F) decided to buy last minute tickets for an event after work on Friday that started at 8pm. The event was about an hour and a half away from my house and I don't get home from work until 630pm. I wake up around 530, get ready and go to work at 7. My commute is an hour. 


My friend (27F) texts me in the middle of the day saying she'll be near the event that night and if I could give her a ride home afterwards. Her original plan was to stay at a friend's house near the evenr. But she lives near me so sure, no problem.


Fast forward to the end of the night. The event ended at 11 and my friend texted me for the first time since asking for a favor earlier that afternoon. She asks where I am, so I tell her and let her know I'm ready to leave. I've had a long day and still have to drive an hour and a half home. 20 minutes go by and no response. My parking meter is about to run out and the parking authority are walking around writing tickets. I hop in my car and ask her where she is. She tells me she's in another town 20 minutes away and that shell ""start walking now."" Mind you, it's midnight at this point and I've been up for almost 20 hours with a long drive ahead of me.


I made an executive decision to leave because I was extremely tired and her original plan was to stay overnight anyway. Also she asked me for this favor towards the end of my work day. I figured someone asking me to do a favor would at least try and be considerate of my time. Who asks for a ride home then makes it inconvenient for you and ends up actually being in a whole other town?

I’ve learned to just be cordial with the women and not become friendly with them because I always get the “why didn’t you tell me?” Or “why would you say something so cruel. He won’t do that to me.” Lose-lose situation for me. 

Anyway, this chick. Let’s call her Number 1. Number 1 has been getting on my nerves for quite some time. She doesn’t clean up after herself. She always wants to talk to me about things. Most of it I have no interest in. Now, whenever I see her, I do run up to my room just so I don’t have to be bothered with her. 

She treats me like a child and scolds me about this things I’ve “failed” to do. She’s texts me several times a day to do things that I’ve either already done or plan to do when I have time. Since my brother works longer hours than I do, household chores (like grocery shopping, cleaning the common areas, etc.) falls to me. I don’t mind it usually but sometimes working a demanding job, cleaning and cooking,I’m bound to forget to something. 
She will not pick up the slack or offer to help. 

The girlfriend has no job. She doesn’t stay with us, thankfully, but she’s coming over more often. 

I’ve asked her several times to not speak to me like a child. I’ve asked her to not text me unless it’s an emergency. I’ve asked her not to use my things, ESPECIALLY without asking.  I’ve asked, as nicely as I could, to just leave me be. All I get is blank stares and her saying that I will be OK.

Obviously since we were never expecting a child my GF never took pregnancy tests regularly. As soon as she suspected she was pregnant she went to the doc, and sure enough, she was. We began immediately looking to abortions, and the doc said that he have to look into it because the ""baby"" is around 1 months old. We were very worried that abortions may impact her health, but she said that she will do one anyways, even if it makes her sick.

So he came back and said it is safe to do an abortion. Obviously we were ecstatic, and we threw a little party. After the actual abortion (about 1 week later), my GF, in her excitement, posted a facebook post about how happy she is to ""dodge a bullet"", and tagged me in it. So since I was tagged, I commented ""Yeah lmao"" (verbatim).

Days later I begun getting harassing texts from my GF's family, telling me how we are scum and we deserve to rot. Later I heard from my GF that her family is quite pro-life, and that's one reason why she didn't introduce her family to me, because she basically cut ties with them.

To start off, I was expecting AT LEAST fifty dollars today because I didn't know how long I'd be babysitting this kid. 

The kid I babysat is 8 years old and all he does is play video games and watch youtube which is fairly easy i have no problem dealing with this kid. Except for the fact that he is extremely picky and extremely clingy. 

When I say clingy I mean that he follows me everywhere and if I leave for ten seconds he comes to ask me ""can you watch me play"" or ""can you watch with me"". I have no time to myself when he comes over. 

He asks to eat pizza and only wants it from Pizza Hut. I order a bacon medium sized pizza for him and the total is $16 but i added a $4 tip (delivery).

So finally after ten hours of my day his mom arrived and pays me $30. 

To be fair, I'm not some certified babysitter and I'm only 17. but I technically only got $10 because of the pizza. I got paid one dollar the hour.

I specifically was talking about how the last time I went out to eat I had to leave because there was a bunch of drunk guys from my school hooting and hollering and a kid screaming it's head off and the noise made me panicked.

A girl in my common room took this as a personal attack on her and aggressively snapped at me that she is an autism mom and her kid has outbursts and I 'need to deal with it and get over it' because 'you're an adult and they are a child so it's worst for them' and 'I have higher expectations for adults than kids. You should have higher expectation for yourself'.

I have a temper. I've always had a temper. Instantly the implication that you can walk autism off with age pissed me off. Her not being a part of the conversation but busting in pissed me off. Her being so aggressive pissed me off. Her talking over me (a problem a lot of autistic people have with self proclaimed 'autism moms') pissed me off.

Apparently my cat was irritating my brother when he was making his present for my dad, and he picked her up to throw her out of his room. My cat must have landed weird or he must have thrown her too hard, because her upper leg bone was broken. My parents rushed my cat to the animal hospital while I tried to calm down my brother.


He was super upset he hurt the cat. So I made sure I told him that he didn’t mean to hurt her and he was a good boy. I believed it too. He really loves that cat, but he doesn’t know his own strength sometimes. He’s a wild kid and often will ignore pleas to stop doing something if it’s hurting them. He has hurt me and my mom multiple times (no broken limbs tho) due to his roughness. He’s 12 so he’s very energetic.


The cat came back with a cast, and is in a lot of pain right now and it’s horrible to see. In the meantime, we tried to celebrate my dad's birthday a bit, and had cake and opened presents. It must have taken my brothers mind off this morning because he was playing with our dogs. But he got rough again, and jumped from the stairs and landed just a bit from one of the dogs to scare her. He didn’t actually land on her but it was close. 

This made me MAD! I waited waited until everything was done with my dad to talk to my brother in his room. I said that he needs to control himself and his behavior or else he will hurt another animal. I told him that when someone tells him to stop, he needs to STOP. I didn’t curse or yell or anything but my tone wasn’t nice. I admit that.

He obviously was upset again, and when on about how he’s “a terrible kid” and completely glossed over what I was trying to tell him. He does this occasionally when someone is mad at him to make them pity him instead. He will go over the top with self-hatred in the moment and do nothing about his actual behavior. I told him to stop throwing a pity party and actually promise to change his behavior. He yelled at me saying I’m making him feel bad, and that he will be better (said very angrily). 

For the rest of the day I’ve been giving him the cold shoulder. I’ve helped my mom give medicine to the cat and try to comfort her. While my brother is watching movies downstairs. He cried again a few hours ago because the cat was howling in pain (medicine was wearing off), but then proceeds to go in his room and play on his DS for hours. 

When he talks to me, I am admittedly short with him.

Apparently, he told my mom that he thinks I’m mad at him and she came to my room crying that I need to not treat him so badly. She says he feels terrible enough and I need to support him. But I don’t think I should pretend like there isn’t a problem and that he isn’t at fault here. I wouldn’t have been mad if it weren’t for the incident with our dog literally hours after our cat came home. But now I don’t believe he will do anything to change.",88,143,0.92
153,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost a year. We're in a city where you can live well without a vehicle. In fact, neither of us has ever owned one. It's still nice to have a car but walking, public transportation, and the occasional rental are more than enough for our lives.

My new job gives me a company truck. I can use it for personal things and the company pays for all of its gas (within reason of course). So I've begun to drive it almost everywhere I go. It makes things a lot easier.

Yesterday my girlfriend asked if she could drive the truck to the nearby grocery store. I said no, but I offered to bring her. She was angry. Safety concerns aside (driving a full size pickup truck for the first time on city streets isn't a great idea), I really don't want to start a precedent for her using the truck regularly. I think she should get her own vehicle if she wants the convenience of one. She says since I don't pay for gas or insurance, I'm being selfish/controlling for no good reason. Am I?",56,107,0.95

157,Not the A-hole,"There is a disconnect between how my family handles these things and how my wife's family does, and I just want to know what is normal here.

My wife is very close to her grandparents (they raised her, so practically parents) and we are over at their house quite a bit for dinner or just hanging out. I get along with them really well. Also, my wife and I hardly ever eat out; we aren't destitute but with two kids, student loans, her only working part time, and living in one of the highest cost of living places in the US, money is tight. Her grandparents are retired and comfortably wealthy.

Once a month (they want this to be an actual once a month event type thing, like they'll plan out which restaurant they want to go out to which month) they badger my wife until we agree to go out to dinner with them. They always pick the restaurant. We've offered to have them over and cook and they'll take us up on it but that 'doesn't count' as our time going out to dinner for the month. Birthday dinners also don't count. They don't ever pick up our bill.

My reasoning for thinking this is kind of off is twofold. First, my family is the opposite. Any time we've ever been out to dinner with them they've picked up the bill. My parents still work but are in a pretty similarly comfortable financial situation to her grandparents since they got the house paid off and all the kids are out on their own. That's what I've always been used to, but if you all tell me that we're the weird ones I'll believe you.

The other reason is that this isn't a dinner we're really choosing to go out to. If we're going to go out we're getting a babysitter and actually trying to go on a date, which we hardly ever get to do since time and money are tight. Also we're probably not going to fucking Outback every other time.

So, AITA for thinking that if they're going to request we do a monthly dinner out with them (this not being NEARLY the only time we see them a month) that they should at least be picking up the bill sometimes? I've talked to my wife about telling them it's financially hard for us to go out like that, but she (correctly) pointed out that her grandmother is the type that, if we did that, would be sure to point it out every time she saw us spending money on something discretionary. You know, ""Oh, you don't have money to go out to dinner with us, but you do have money to 'insert whatever here.' Hm.""",25,100,0.95
158,Not the A-hole,"I recently joined a 24 hour gym. Members can access the gym any time, but owners and employees are rarely there. Most people who go there are great, but today when I went there was a woman there who brought her horde of children with her. They ranged in age from young teens to 8 or 9, and spent the entire time running around, messing with the equipment, and being loud. 

While the noise might just be something I should expect to deal with at a gym, the other issues are more serious. The gym has a rule that you have to wipe down equipment when you’re done using it, and also replace any weights you use, which the children did not do. The children were also literally running around equipment that was actively being used, which is dangerous. 

WIBTA if I reported the woman if this happens again? The gym has security cameras and a system that tracks your keycard’s uses, so there would be no issue with the owners figuring out who she is and verifying what I tell them. Part of me feels like my issues with rambunctious children being in the gym are valid, but I also just generally don’t like being around children so it’s possible I’m biased.",73,492,0.95

A few weeks, I started a conversation with him. I asked him where does he see himself, and what are his goals? He said he doesn’t know, just working (he works at Taco Bell right now). I told him that he needs to find some long-term goals and take steps in his life to achieve them; he can’t just sit in my house rent-free and without any ambitions. He said he understood and will try to.

Yesterday, I asked him was there any update and he just shrugged. I told him if he still doesn’t have any goals, he can’t just sit here and do nothing, and that he has a month to move out. Alternatively, he could join the military and he can continue to live here as long as he wants. He felt like it was unfair for me to push either of those things on him, and that I never threatened to kick his sister out (who goes to the local state school). I told him that she was actually doing something with her life, and I couldn’t see him waste his life like this, and that he has a month to decide what he wants to do.

Well he threw a tantrum and went up to his room. I knew the kid was gonna be upset, but I can’t just let him stay here and do nothing. The reason why I’m asking is that my sister called me about the situation (she’s sorta his mother-figure ever since his mother died when he was 7). She tried to tell me I’m being entirely unreasonable. I told her if she wanted to let him move in, she very well can, but at this point, my son needs a push to get started in his life, and I’m not going to raise a freeloader. We argued back and forth but neither of us could see the other’s side.

My parents invited us to their lake house next month and my mom texted me a few minutes ago saying, ""Just a heads up, even though you have been sharing a flat this year, I am not a hip, modern parent who is comfortable with her son sharing a bed with a girlfriend in our home, so if she joins us you will be in the front upstairs room with twin beds.""

I've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""Money"" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

Last year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

Well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

Also, nobody except said friend knows (well, fuck getting drunk, i should have known better), and she has only learned about it recently.

Now that she knows, she is constantly pestering me about lgbt events and joining her party and their internal lgbt group. Honestly, I like her party, but I really don't feel like participating in politics, and especially not in any lgbt group or focused on lgbt topics (basically making it public and I'm more interested in economic policies and in the justice system). 

At first she was very... patronizing? (not sure what I should call it), like ""you have to stand up for yourself"", ""you're hiding this for a reason, fight that"", ""freedom"" (you get it). Now she is becoming more agressive, accusing me of being biphobic, opportunistic, part of the problem, etc. 

Thing is, I have never acted on it (and as said only one person knows) and I don't know if I ever will. I have absolutely no intention of telling anyone (except maybe a future gf, just so she knows).

He's had the worst luck with women and it really gets him down. The problem is, he tends to chase after gorgeous women. Women that could be models if they wanted.

I mostly want to say something because he CONSTANTLY talks about it.

176,Not the A-hole,"Okay so let me first explain. I know the title makes me sound awful but you need to know the context.

When my family first moved down here there were two old sisters living across the street from our house. My mom went over there a lot since they were the only neighbors who would talk to us on our street.

Where I live if you weren't born here. You aren't given the time of day. 

All seems well and we all act civil. Until about 2015.

At this point the main old lady and problem in the story called M. Had gotten already. Is now in her 80s and has no family who wish to take care of her.

So she gave my mom this offer. If she took care of her for the rest of her years. She would give my mom the house which was already paid for. Sounds good right? 

It was for the first 5 minutes. Immediately after that she began treating my mother like dirt. And has been for the past 4 years. 

She's accused of stealing money from her which we never have and she just screams that often.

Complains and bitches about all the house repairs my mom has paid for out of her own pocket. Saying that wasn't what she wanted even after my mom had confirmed everything she requested.

Growls and screams at my mother when she won't do everything she wants. 

And doesn't let my mom have any time for herself. My mom stays there from Monday till friday, when she comes home for the weekend to be with her family.

As for what's going on recently. M has done something I don't want to forgive her. And has made me hate her so much I hope she dies.

So in March my mom was involved in a head on car crash. A car drove ahead and hit my mother. The other driver came out uninjured. While my mom wasn't so lucky. She was in the hospital most of the month with horrible injuries. 3 broken vertebrae in her neck, a broken leg, a lacerated liver, 5 cracked ribs, and brain damage that has been yet to assessed by a professional.

The whole time I was waiting for news on whether or not my mother was paralyzed while in the hospital. 

M kept compaling and bitching about how. ""Why did this happen!? Now she won't take care of me like she's supposed to!"" 

It took a godly force to not have me scream at this C Word of a women.

Thankfully my mom isn't paralyzed but is still hurt. And M EXPECTS MY MOTHER to clean and do everything like before!! My mom is currently in a brace and needs a cane and a walker to walk.

I have not been polite since than. I glare at this women everytime she opens her mouth to speak at my mother. I speak to her like she's dog crap. And she deserves it.

My mom is now angry at me because I should treat her with 'respect'. I have no respect for this fucking witch. She is draining the life out of my mother.

My mom says someone needs to be the bigger person in this. But I don't agree. You get back what you give. Treat my mother like crap. I get to treat you like the shit you are.

178,Asshole,"Context: I've been dating my girlfriend for close to 5 months now, and things are going really well. We've agreed to take things slow and not rush into anything. But we both feel like ""this could be the one"", and have casually started discussing stuff like marriage, kids etc.

Let me preface this by saying that I have no reason at all to doubt her specifically. She's an amazing person with a lot of integrity and moral character. I trust her more than any other person in this world.

That said, I'm a poster child for [Popper's theory of falsifiability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/12/14/theres-no-such-thing-as-proof-in-the-scientific-world-theres-only-evidence/#67910d395392). Ie, *""Nothing is for certain. There are only things that have not been falsified yet.""* Heck, I could even be a [Brain-in-a-Vat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) for all I know.

With that in mind, I half-jokingly mentioned to my girlfriend that in the hypothetical future, once we have kids, I will get them DNA tested just to be (more) sure that I'm the father. This thought came into my mind, because of a story I had seen about a father who found out 20 years later that [his 3 children were actually not his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm_PXqtElnY). I have no reason to suspect that my girlfriend would do anything like that, but I would be absolutely devastated if that happened to me, and I figured there's no harm in getting the kids tested. We had already agreed on signing a prenup (her idea), and I figured this is no different.

Anyway, she was very upset when she heard about this, and started crying. From her perspective, me getting our kids tested shows a lack of trust in her, and is an insult to her. She wants our relationship to be based on trust and faith, and getting the kids tested would run contrary to all that. I tried explaining my perspective above to her, and that it has nothing to do with her personally. But that didn't change her feelings.

We've eventually patched things over - I agreed to not get our kids DNA tested. I trust her enough, and if it means so much to her, I don't mind taking that (miniscule) risk for her happiness.

That said, I'm curious to hear how other people think about this issue. Is getting the kids DNA tested a reasonable thing to do? Or is it an asshole move?

Haha, wow, thanks for tearing me a new one guys. I showed this thread to my girlfriend, and we both had a good laugh over it. I appreciate the feedback - I know I have a very weird way of looking at the world, and it helps me to get more feedback on how my thoughts can be perceived by others.

To respond to a few of the comments: 

- No, I'm not going to secretly get my kids tested. I said I wouldn't do it, and I pride myself on my integrity
- I can understand why someone may think that I'm a jealous/controlling person. But I'm not. My previous ex even got upset with me because she thought my lack of jealousy is a sign of my not caring about her. I would never want to restrict my loved one's ability to live life to the fullest. I would suggest exercising a little more caution before making assumptions about others :)
- I do trust my girlfriend more than I trust any other person in the world. But then again, I did work in risk management for a company whose motto is *""Only the Paranoid Survive""*, so maybe it has rubbed off on me ;)",287,544,0.88

If you don't know, not every fan gets a giveaway item -- there's a limited supply, and it's first come, first served.

Fortunately, we arrived in time, but the game was about to begin. Before each game, the National Anthem is played, and the fans are supposed to stand up and face the flag in center field. Personally, I don't care about the Anthem, at all, and in particular, I don't think there's any need to play it before a sporting event. As such, I ignored it. We were on ground level, and our seats were on the tippity-top of the stadium. Coupled with my want -- no, NEED -- to partake in some Dippin Dots, I didn't have any time to waste. 

So, the Anthem starts playing as we are speed-walking through an open pavilion area with a full view of the stadium. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people around us on the pavilion, all standing still. Honestly, it was eerie, if not bizarre, to see a bustling stadium instantly freeze. 

We are the only people moving around at this point. As we keep walking, we begin getting death stares. Our fellow fans are PISSED about us moving around. We walk by a guy who says, ""It's the Anthem, bud,"" with as much vitriol as he can muster. I hadn't actually thought about the social norms of this situation until he said that...I just wanted to get to our seats before the first pitch. However, I couldn't stop now, lest we be surrounded with hundreds of people who are pissed at us. Awkward! We continued on our way, and eventually, the Anthem ended. The rest of the night was uneventful. 

Now, I don't feel that bad about it, but I don't know how my girlfriend felt. I kind of realized the next day that I was basically dragging her through this incredibly awkward situation without stopping to ask her about it. She never said anything, but after being together for over a decade, I know that she wouldn't bring it up, even if she was irate. If I ask her about it, though, she'll be honest, so I need to do that tonight. 

TL;DR: Walked around a stadium during the National Anthem. Fellow fans were mad, and I didn't think of how my girlfriend felt until it was too late. Dippin Dots were fantastic; it is truly the ice cream of the future. The Cards got blown out, but we got some amazing tumblers.

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for all of the responses so far! I upvoted everyone, whether they called me a buttchasm or not. I talked to my girlfriend about it, and she said she felt super uncomfortable but she doesn't hold it against me. I'm gonna feel bad for awhile, though.",50,85,0.87
180,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I dont want to risk anyone I know finding my account. TLDR at the bottom. 

Background: I'm in my mid 20's, have a solid income, my own place, am financially independent, and I'm childfree. My parents split up years ago, and are both in new relationships. My dad met a woman and now has 2 kids with her (3y/o and 1 month old). A few days ago I went over to their (my dad and his gf) house to visit with everyone, and at some point they pretty much asked me if I would be the legal guardian of their kids if anything were to happen to them. To put it mildly, I was extremely shocked, and said thank you for trusting me this much, but no I wont. 

I found out very fast that this was not the answer they were looking for. They seemed really upset and started demanding a reason as to why I wouldnt. This turned in to a huge argument, but the main points set out by each of us are as follows:

My dad and his gf: I should because 1. I'm family. 2. I live close by whereas all our other family lives at least a 6 hour drive away so if the kids were to go to them it would be a huge change for them. 3. I have the means to provide a good life for them so I should. 4. I most likely won't ever be in this position, so why not say yes? 

Me: I shouldn't because 1. I don't want kids. 2. Just becuase we're family doesnt mean they're my responsibility. 3. (and this is very important) I would make a horrible parent. I could write an entire post about why this is true, but baisaclly I just lack the patience for kids and they would wreak havoc on my life. I know for a fact they would always come second to something more important to me, and I would grow to resent them because of effect they had on me. I don't want to subject a kid to that. 4. Just because I *probably* wont be in this position, doesnt mean I wont be. Theres still a chance. 

I told them I would be more than happy to be more involved in their kids life's than I am now, however I would not be raising them because of the points listed above. They really don't seem to be taking no for an answer on this one, and they started calling me an asshole and a piece of shit for even *thinking* about ""abandoning"" their children. When it started to get heated I told them to call me when they calmed down, but the answer is ""no"", its not changing, and all guilt-tripping me will do is cause me to see them less often. I was pretty pissed off when I left, so I was ranting to a friend who told me she agrees with my dad and his gf that I should take their kids if anything happens to them and that I'm an ass if I dont. 

AITA? 

**TLDR: my dad and his gf think want me (mid 20's, financially independent) to take their kids (3yo and 1 month old) if anything were to happen to them. I said no because I dont want kids and I would make a horrible parent. They and one of my freinds is calling me an asshole. AITA?**",260,1520,0.96
181,Asshole,"Yesterday there was a car wash drive in our city to fund for a family who lost their home in a gas explosion. My husband went to it. My issue is it was organized by a family friend of the affected family and I guess they had their three teenage daughters washing cars in bikinis and what-not. I don't know their ages but I know it's a set of twins and a third, maybe 15-17 years old each. Am I the asshole for being royally upset with my husband for going?

He's said in the past he hates washing his car and full service car washes aren't so common. He works offroad a lot and his truck is always filthy. He says the automatic washes seldom work. That's fine, I get it, but why get teenage girls in bikinis to wash your car? I don't get the appeal whatsoever, it's downright disturbing/disgusting to me.

183,Not the A-hole,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fiancé for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?

Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I’m so sorry I haven’t been reading I’ll try and catch up

Edit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiancé not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiancé to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",1735,20065,0.92
184,Asshole,"Ever since my husband and I started seeing each other I always noticed he drank a LOT of coffee. I'm talking 5 cups or more on certain days. It definitely helped him stay awake and focused (he works night shift) but also made him jittery. I talked to him about it and asked him if he could cut down on the caffeine consumption or switch to decaf since it made him over energetic but was met was a ""no thanks"". Like I said the caffeine made him too energetic sometimes so I decided to switch the coffee to decaf in secret. What's the harm?

That was like a year ago and he still hasn't noticed. He calmed down and it doesn't seem to have affected him in his work, so I thought everything was fine. Except when I shared this secret with a friend today she said that I was controlling & manipulating him, even if it's just about decaf coffee.

This animal loving streak means buying a more expensive beard oil for his pride and joy face hugger. 

Now, I go along with him on most things, for example, we don’t have meat in the house and it’s saving us a lot of money, but the beard oil, really? So I’ve been quietly refilling the same bottle of “cruelty-free” with clarisonic.

189,Not the A-hole,"Some background: Husband (25) and I (21) have been together for 2 years but married for 8 months. We have a 6month old daughter together. I am a stay at home mom and he works.



In two weeks my parents are visiting. My husband actively encouraged me to invite them (why dont you invite your parents to visit? did you ask them yet? why dont you ask?). I invited them and we even planned on them staying with us but they went ahead and booked a hotel, a rental car, and flights. Totally fine with us! 



We talked last night and he mentioned he wasnt very excited for them to be visiting. I know theres some tension between them because weve had issues previously but I asked why, hed probably barely see them anyway, as theyre here to see the baby and we have plans. He already expressed hed be working and 3 months ago we visited them and he spent the week getting drunk with his cousin and I spent the week with my family, which was fine, I had a good time. 



He told me theyd be here around dinner time as Id be home to cook dinner for him and clean the house. I told him he was grown and could cook for himself for a week if I wasnt around (if Im home I dont mind but Im not dropping everything to come home and make dinner). I also said if I wasnt here the house wont be dirty because - get this - neither of us would be here to make the mess. He was displeased with my answer and asked whether or not I planned on spending any time with him that week? I told him he was welcome to come with us if he was free, I dont mind planning something for the day he has off, and we already planned on going to his favorite restaurant and working around his schedule so he could come. 



I figure, my parents are spending a lot of money to come visit at our request. Theyve only met their first grandbaby two times, and my dad has met her once. I plan on spending as much time with them as I can because I want them to have a relationship with my daughter and frankly, I miss them. My husband thinks I should still make time for him. Id like for him to be a little more understanding and just cook and clean up his own messes if it calls for it. I see him every day and will still be sleeping here, so Its not like Ill be vanishing off the face of the earth for a week.

190,Asshole,"I’m in high school, and I eat with lunch with the same group of friends everyday. One of the friends, we’ll call her Abigail, has a severe peanut allergy. Not to the extent where she can’t be in the same room as peanut products, but she has to avoid skin contact and obviously no consumption. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches relatively frequently during lunch, probably about once or twice a week.  Abigail has told me that when peanuts or peanut butter are near her, her face gets itchy and she begins to feel uncomfortable. She says that's the extent of it though, and its not a true allergic reaction.

Almost every time I’m eating peanut butter, she says something along the lines of “I can feel that you’re eating peanut butter”, kind of jokingly, but, I think, also kind of annoyed. I always apologize and she just says “it’s okay”, but I don’t know how much she actually cares. We have a great friendship otherwise and nothing about peanuts, peanut butter, or allergies is every brought up outside of lunch time.

I don’t want to make her feel itchy and uncomfortable, but I love peanuts and peanut butter is a staple of my lunches. If she was having a true allergic reaction I clearly would stop eating peanuts around her, but since it just makes her feel uncomfortable itchy, I haven’t stopped.

AITA for eating peanut butter around her when it clearly bothers her?

EDIT:  She experiences no physical reaction from the smell (eg. no hives) and has never even considered using her epi-pen from just the smell.

191,Not the A-hole,"Where to start,  


A couple months back, the Children's pastor at my church reached out to me asking if I would be interested in taking an internship opportunity this coming summer. It would be paid, I would get to go to all summer church functions for free (Mission trips, weekend retreats, etc.). All in all, it's a good deal. However I have my issues with the position, and I think they are valid opinions to have regarding it. 

1. I would be required to teach sunday school to kids - I'm not good with kids. Like, at all. I'm awkward, they're awkward, and to be honest I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of the Bible to be able to give these kids a decent lesson each and every sunday.
2. I already have a job, a job I LIKE - I work retail at an Adidas store, and I truly enjoy working there. My coworkers are awesome, my hours are flexible and reasonable, I get paid well enough for a 19y/o in college (something like $250-$300 per check). But working there PLUS having to intern 3-4 days a week makes me fear I won't have much free time to myself. 
3. I have personal issues with one of the people I potentially would be interning under. There's a lot of detail there, but to keep it short he's disingenuous, and he's got a major superiority complex.

Now that those are covered, I also want to acknowledge what my other plans would be for the summer if not that internship, which would be school and prepping for my upcoming classes. 

I want to major in CS, and I have a mentor that's been guiding me through my school and such. And with his guidance I really feel a desire to take some summer classes, and also do some independent studying on Python and Java that my fall classes will involve. 

My family does not like that idea. Whenever it's brought up they berate me about how 'invaluable' this will be for me on my resumes. How it will show that i'm willing to put others before me, etc. etc. (Ignoring the fact i've been on 7 mission trips through my church, which require more physical and mental sacrifice than teaching 4th graders about noah's ark on sunday morning.) 

And when I try to make my case, it will always boil down to this phrase: ""Please, do it for me!"". It's slowly becoming a phrase I despise, for reasons than just this.

My last class yesterday ended at two, so I decided to take my girlfriend to rewatch a movie. Her sister wanted to come along because she hadn't seen it yet, so I let her tag along. After it ended, we noticed it was getting late. We didn’t get anything to eat at the theater so I decided to stop by Chick-fil-A. My girlfriend (who we’ll call C) was fine with it, but her sister (who we’ll call T) was not happy with the idea. She didn’t say anything, but I could tell she was opposed to going.

I should probably point out that T is anything but straight, and is very vocal about politics. I suppose a Chick-fil-A boycott to her was obvious.

I drove to Chick-fil-A, and offered to pay for whatever they wanted. C said she only wanted some lemonade. T said she didn’t want anything. She said “Just go in. I’ll stay here.” I think I saw life drain out of her when I said “Just so you know, I’m dining in.” She decided to come with C and I. (I always dine in.)

We all sat down. I ate. C had her lemonade. T didn’t really talk to us. She just used her phone. I dropped them off at their house afterwards and went home. C texted me to say that T was not happy with what I did. I decided to take a look at her Twitter account and lo and behold there was complaining about Chick-fil-A.

Earlier this morning C said it’d be a good idea to apologize. I haven’t yet, and I don’t think I’m going to. If I did, I wouldn’t mean it. I don’t want to give a false apology.

I want to know if what I did was wrong. I don’t really think I did anything wrong, but I know for a fact my perception is skewed here because I participated in it, and my girlfriend's giving me second thoughts. Any call to apologize makes me think ""Maybe I did screw up.""

I'll stop because I'm rambling. Am I in the wrong here?

TL;DR saw a movie with girlfriend and her sister. Went to Chick-fil-A even though sister is against it. Wanna know if I screwed up.

196,Not the A-hole," 

Some background, my cousin is 16 and I'm 20. I've always been fond of him, we used to be really close, people would joke about us being brother and sister.

So, last week my uncle called my mum to say that my aunt (who was a recovering alcoholic) had started drinking again and she's not getting out of bed, not showering, not helping to look after my cousin etc... and I just felt this immediate sense of dread because this same thing happened before. When I was 17 my nan got that same exact call, I offered to go with her to check up on my aunt and we ended up coming back with my cousin. I was pretty happy at first, I wasn't seeing much of him at the time so it was nice to be able to spend time with him.

After a while, I realised that my mum had agreed to let him stay at our place while my uncle was trying to get help for my aunt in the hopes that I would be the one looking after him. My mum was working full-time and my sister was away for the summer with a club, which left me as the obvious candidate as I was on my summer holidays. I didn't mind at first, it was nice having him around but looking after him meant that I had to be with him all the time. I had to take him to the park, I had to bring him with me to hospital and dentist appointments (I was late in my recovery from surgery so I had a lot of follow-up appointments). From when he woke up at about 5 in the morning until my mum got home from work at 7, I had to be watching him. I couldn't go out with friends, couldn't even have friends over otherwise he would kick up a fuss. The only alone time I had was at night which is when I like to go on my laptop, listen to music, do some writing but by that time I was too tired to do any of that. There were times when I'd catch him masturbating, not even accidentally walking in on him but he would do it in the open in the living room, would shove his hands down his pants when we were out in public. I would tell him not to do it, he would say sorry but carry on.

That was my whole summer. I was stressed, I was missing out on a lot and I was missing my friends, my mum kept telling me that it wasn't for long, that we (?) were doing it for my aunt. He was here for over 6 weeks. That's the experience that turned me off of wanting to look after him again.

My mum got in touch, told me it's happening again and if I can come home for a week or so to help look after him. I just straight up told her no. I'm older now, I'm living away from home, I'm a student working part-time with amazing friends. I told her that I have a life of my own now, I can't just drop everything and come home to look after my cousin. She got really upset with me and told me I'm being selfish because she has to work and look after my sister (who's now the same age I was when the responsibilty was dumped on me). I told her that it's not fair to just expect me to do it and then hung up on her. I've been trying to forget about it but a part of me feels bad.

201,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory mobile posting apologies. Sorry if it's rambling, I don't have much time. I am late 20s female and my mom is late fifties. Every year on her birthday my sister and I take her on a shopping spree that my dad pays for. They are going through a late midlife crisis over the past couple years. They went from plain, simple, average people to being tatted up, plastic surgery-ed, swingers. Honestly, I don't care! Live your life the way you want to live it! I'm happy that they are finally doing stuff that makes them happy. My problem comes in during last year's birthday shopping spree. We picked out some clothes then helped my mom pick out some bras. Bras are not a problem for me, they are an everyday thing that the majority of women use. But, then my mom turns to us and says we should go check something else out while she picks out some lingerie for herself. Cool, I'm already halfway turned around when my sister scoffs and tells her we are all adults and we would gladly help her. I put on my poker face but inside is definitely uncomfortable. My sister has always accused me of being immature, so I wondered if I was just being a childish. I was really uncomfortable, but we did it, she picked out a bunch and tried them on. My sister was completely fine telling her what looks good and what doesn't. I didn't like it, I don't want to pick something out for the purpose of turning my dad (or others) on. But I bit my tongue and just did it.

Here's my question, today is my mom's birthday shopping spree again. Am I the asshole if I refuse to do the lingerie shopping again? Am I just being immature? I would NEVER want my sister or mom to pick out lingerie for me and my husband. If I say that I'm going to check something else out while they look at the lingerie, my sister will be pissed and ridicule me, and my mom might become embarrassed and be upset the rest of the day; she is very sensitive. I don't want to ruin anyone's day but I also don't want to do that again. I only want to go the saying no option if I know that most people would side with me, if I'm just being a selfish asshole, I'll swallow my unease and carry-on.",16,50,0.89
202,Not the A-hole,"A little context before I tell you the story. My sister constantly reminds me to share the food I get with my family. I don't really like sharing but I don't mind giving them a few fries from my plate every now and then. However, most of the time she acts as if my plate is free real estate waiting to be claimed and eats almost all of a certain part of my meal, typically the sides. She doesn't even ask if she can take a bite out of my food. I used to fight with her about her actions and would have to take the most annoying actions possible to make her stop like eating at a different table (all this usually happens in restaurants by the way) all by myself, where even then on the car ride home she'd still shame me into sharing food with ""everybody"". This eventually worked and I only share with her to spare my head from headaches caused by arguing.
Today my sister took it to a whole new level. My family is currently traveling to New York City and we were in the subway when we stopped by Starbucks and took a little break and ordered some drinks. I got a hot chocolate because I don't really like coffee and I drank little by little when my sister just grabbed the cup and proceeded to guzzle the hot chocolate all by herself, then passed around to my family who all took a sip, who then passed it back to her. I was so god damn angry at her that I just gave her the hot chocolate. I didn't even want it anymore if she was just going to yank it out of my hand all the time and pass it around like it was hers. I told her I didn't want it and that it's hers now. She tried to give it back but I just refused to take it, and she would try to shove it into my hands before she gave up and threw it out. I've been thinking about it for a while and I don't know if I really was the asshole in this situation because of how I handled it but Reddit, am I the asshole?

203,Not the A-hole,"My (34F) husband (34M) and I just had our first son last year. We were blessed with a beautiful, healthy baby after two years of heartbreak and miscarriages. 

My husband is one of five kids to a mother that has a habit of guilt-tripping her children. Because of this, my husband and his siblings tend to go above and beyond for holidays to avoid the inevitable shame if they don’t. 

When I was discussing Mother’s Day and what I would like to do, my husband said that we need to see what his mother would like to do first, since it’s “her” day. I disagreed, as I feel that his priority should be me on that day now. His response is “you’re not my mother”. 

We are very close to both of our families, living within miles of our parents and siblings, and therefore seeing them often. I plan on celebrating my mother and his mother... but I also feel it’s secondary to my well-deserved day. 

AITA for wanting Mother’s Day to be about me?

EDIT: After reading all of the comments, I want to emphasize that this isn’t a “choose me or her” situation. We are very close to both of our families and will celebrate both of our mothers. My predicament was predicated on the fact that I wanted to be the priority that day... as in ask what I wanted to do that day, then plan his mother’s accordingly, while he felt it should be the other way around.",310,893,0.94
204,Everyone Sucks,"First off I genuinely would like to know the truth here, so don't hold back. I also think I could have handled the situation better but my frustration got the better of me. The situation literally just occurred and she has walked away without it being resolved so I would like some independent views to help me when we resume the conversation later.  

So, I own and operate an independent clothing store where I work full time, and my girlfriend whom I live with, and usually get along with absolutely fine with no major incidents at all, helps me out on Saturdays when the store is busy. 

Today as usual she was in the store and helping with customers, when one of her friends came in with flowers to celebrate the store opening (it's a new business). My girlfriend put the flowers in a pot, and started to rearrange the counter where i serve people so she could put the flowers on show. Now she had already mentioned she didn't like the way things were laid out, but I do and as I am in here every day working and she is not, I feel like I have more of a say in arranging things the way I like them (feel free to disagree with this and tell me why). 

There is a valuable ashtray with significant sentimental value sitting on the counter which I have there because I like the design. However my girlfriend does not. She said she wanted to move the flowers to sit in the place the ashtray is and put the ashtray away because she doesn't like it. I said to her I would prefer not to have the flowers in that specific place as it will totally block my view out of the window of the store, and I like to see the street when I'm working, as I often make eye contact with people walking by and this prompts them to come into the store. She said fine, and I thought that was the end of it. 

However about an hour later, i was leaving the store to pick up lunch for us. As I am in the doorway, I hear a crack and turn around and see that she has gone ahead and rearranged everything anyway, and in the process dropped the ashtray onto the concrete floor. I assume it's broken and in the heat of the moment exclaim ""Fuck *Name of girlfriend*, just leave it alone!"". I then walked out to get us lunch. 

When I came back she was extremely frosty and said I should never under any circumstances shout like that and I am totally in the wrong. I said I understood that and was sorry, but she should understand that I was extremely frustrated as when it happened, i thought she had destroyed this valuable object because she totally ignored my specific wish to not move the flowers, so I was both upset and frustrated at being ignored and thinking my ashtray was broken. 

Her response is that that is irrelevant and I am in the wrong for speaking to her like that. 

So Reddit, am I entirely in the wrong here or as I think, we're both arseholes here?",61,208,0.96
205,Not the A-hole,"In my college town, there's a bistro that is quite popular with the Greek life crowd. Back in the day, I worked in the kitchen of this bistro. I have worked in many restaurants and this one had, by far, the grossest kitchen. I'm talking caked on dirt and dust on nearly everything, an air filtration system that didn't work (so the cooks are doing a ton of coughing), a dish tank that didn't really work. They also didn't really keep inventory that fresh. Also, they shocked the rice and noodles in the dish tank but usually didn't bother cleaning it because the rice was covered in sauce and you really couldn't tell. Just a lot of gross shit that usually would never fly in a real kitchen.

I recently mentioned some of this to a friend of mine and his wife lost her shit. Apparently, that place is sacred to their relationship story. I love both of these people but when they heard that their favorite little romantic spot in their college town was less than pristine, they became very unhappy. I don't feel bad about telling them this stuff because a) it's true b) i tried to change it but the kitchen management didn't care and c) I would want to know.

206,No A-holes here,"My wife (26F) and I (26M) have been married for almost a year now, but dated for 9 years before getting married, so will be reaching the 10 year milestone soon.  

My problem is with ""the child issue"" that many couples have experienced - she wants kids, I do not. This is something we have talked about at length for several years, and during that time I have always had the same views on children; I don't want them. I have never wanted them, and I will never want them. It's not happening for me, and I have made that very clear to my wife since we were 16.  

On her end, however, she has flip-flopped on this issue many times, but the majority of the time she has sided with me on the no kids front. She is someone who would naturally be a great mother, I'm sure of it, so before ever proposing/getting married I felt it was important to have these long talks about what it would mean for her to marry someone who does not want children. In the end, she always ended up saying that her life with me is what she wants, and if that means no kids, then no kids is fine.  

Shortly after we got married, however, she broke down in tears one night saying how she thinks she wants children now. After talking it out for a while, she said she was probably just feeling the ""what next"" feeling after taking the next big step in our relationship, and that she doesn't really want kids.  

Since then, the issue has come up several more times, with long talks each time, and she is now on the ""wants kids"" side, probably permanently. She still says that I am what she wants, and that she would never divorce me to find someone who will give her children... But now I feel like I am depriving her of something she was meant to do. Both of our mothers would desperately love to have grandchildren, and make that known to us regularly. I really feel like I'm some monster who is the only person preventing this happiness from everyone around me.  

Other than this, we have such a happy marriage and life together, there are zero complaints otherwise, but I can't live like this, it comes up very frequently and I'm always the bad guy. This is why I told her that I think it's unfair for her to hold this against me when I have always been very clear that children will not be a part of my life.  

TL;DR: Don't want children, wife agreed to marry me saying she also doesn't want children, changed her mind, I want her to stop bringing it up as I feel it's unfair to make me seem like the bad guy when I'm not the one who changed my mind.  

Help me Reddit, AITA?  

EDIT: Wow, this exploded. Reddit is very opinionated on children.  

I'm definitely making couples therapy a priority ASAP. I'm not ready to call it quits as many have suggested, I don't think we are that nuclear yet.  

I'll also be talking to my mom, and suggesting she talk to hers, about them backing off on the comments. It's really not their decision to make or their place to comment.  

Thanks for all of the comments, I've read all of them and will continue to do so. It's been great to get this out - I don't have many close friends to talk to, so I appreciate you all.",438,1404,0.96

So me (20f) and my bf (26m) have been together for almost two years. Yesterday we were cuddling and he randomly said that he's loves and appreciates me to which i replied back that I love him too. We ended up having sex. After doing the deed I looked at my calendar for period prediction and it said I was supposed to also start yesterday (I always start in the morning no matter what tho) I missed my period. No big deal since I'm pretty irregular but I took a test because I still had some mild cramps through out the day. 

Well the test came back positive O.O. It Had A very faint positive. I thought I was misreading it so I showed my boyfriend and he saw it to. Here comes the weird part. He started being cold to me. A complete 180 after us having sex lol.

He tells me to take it again in the morning then jumps on his computer and ignores me for the rest of the night. I said alright and tried to go to bed. I can't really sleep well when he isn't next to me. I wake up two hours later to see he's still on his computer in the living room. I ask him to come to bed and he replied curtly that he's researching. I say researching what because i was little interested and he ignores me again. 

I go back to bed a little dejected. I wake up again and its around 1:30 in the morning and he's still out there. I had to pee so I took another test. Positive again. I show it to him and he says that its irrelevant until I haven't had my period for two weeks. I thought fair enough and he tossed it back to me roughly. I was a little hurt. He ignores me for most of the night then tossed the test at me.

216,No A-holes here," My partner and I are both guys in our late 20's. Yesterday the topic of children came up and I said if we were to ever have children I'd want to go the surrogate route rather than adoption. Somehow the conversation changed to how much suffering children are in and how much it would mean to them to find a home. He said that having a baby via surrogacy is selfish when adoption is an option to which I reminded him practically every straight person is selfish then. He went on to say that he wouldn't want to pass his genes (for some reason? He's attractive and seems to have no medical issues) & I said I'll gladly take the role then. We haven't spoken to each other since and it's been bugging me, Aita?

218,Not the A-hole,"So this happened two days ago, but feel like I might as well get a second opinion before I go through with it.  


So Cinco de Mayo is coming up, and I (20M) am hosting a party at my apartment with my friends and their friends. They suggested the idea since I'm the only mexican dude in our group, I have a big apartment and I absolutely love cooking for others and hosting things like this. We planned it out for a day or so, just getting an idea of how costs would be split, what food would be made, etc.   


And here comes the issue: one of my friends of a friend, Janet (18F), asks if there's going to be any vegan friendly options. I said (suddenly realizing most mexican dishes I make include some kind of meat) that we'll pretty much just have chips and salsa, and maybe tortillas that she can fill with some vegan friendly things. She then says something along the lines of ""Really that's it? I thought mexican food was way more vegan lol"". I told her ""Maybe some places, but not this weekend!"" to which she replies ""If I bring XXX (vegetable I've never cooked with) will you make (apparently mexican food i've literally never heard of)?""  


I said I've never made it so probably not and I have enough on my plate making literally everything else, but she can feel free to use the oven/stove to make it. She gets snippy that I'm not ""catering to our guests"" and should be more ""mindful"".   


WIBTA for telling her she's no longer invited? I realize it's social ""faux pas"" or even taking the ""nuclear option"" to tell someone they're no longer invited to something after going out of your way to invite them, and it might seem like a pretty minor thing to rescind an invite for, but christ. It's one thing to ask if there's any vegan options, and another to complain when the host won't make your random dish you found on pinterest.

EDIT: I do feel the need to say this, let's not turn this into a ""vegan bashing"" fest. I realize that the whole situation comes off as ""picky VEGAN tells MEAT EATERS what to make!"" clickbait, but I should mention 90% of the vegans I've met are awesome people that barely even let their dietary choices known. One minor inconvenience shouldn't decide how you view a whole group of people! :)

220,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so where to start..    

Before we got together, my boyfriend has lived with his family all his life. His school debts and the crash of the car industry made him lose his job before he could get properly certified as a mechanic. He gets a different job but it's not enough to move out.    

His family is super close, I admire that. His mother got super sick and evetually died. It's been 3 years now. Just before his mother died, his father was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. His father has managed to live so far. The core of the tumor is actually dead and we hope for the outer ring to die soon.    

His sister is 32 now and jobless. She had quit years before to take care of their mother and then father in their worst times. It's admirable and kind. However, now their father is getting better and stronger. The family has told her she can look into getting a job again. She hasn't tried however.    

She's too comfortable. She pays for nothing herself. No rent, not her car or insurance, nothing. She wakes up at 11am, takes a nap from 130pm to 5pm, and goes to bed around 3 or 5. She doesn't cook and getting her to clean the house is impossible. *She* owns the cat at the house but you need to nag her to clean the litter box.    

**EDIT:** She struggles with depression just like I do. She has for years. We are her support, we do what we can. She keeps delaying going to the doctor about her antidepressant which she has been taking for 16 years, same dosage. I had told her that it's highly unlikely it's working anymore, that her body has grown used to it. It's been over a year since we had this discussion.

My boyfriend works 4 days a week, 10 hour shifts, nights. We work together. It's all physical, warehouse work. We are exhausted. Yet my bf is expected to work on his days off. He cleans because he hates a dirty home. He cooks dinner. On our work nights, his family orders out or eats at restaurants because his sister won't cook. She can - she just chooses not to. Their father can nag, but he's gotten sick of hearing her complain. I've said that he is enabling her.    

I live alone, in a tiny one bedroom apartment on the second floor of some +100 yr old house with shit landlords. So he can't really move into a place that can't even hold his own things. We have plans to get our own place before the end of fall. We cashed out some of our company stocks and he's managed to pay off almost all his student loan. As soon as it's paid, we have a green light.    

So to the main topic.    

It comes up, what happens when his dad does pass. His dad is in his 60s. The cancer is almost gone, but we still aren't in the clear. The topic of his sister was considered. My boyfriend put his foot down immediately and said that we would **not** be taking in his sister, no matter what.    

Bf: You at 32. You're not a child. Get a job and get your own place. 
    
She got extremely insulted and went to her room. He explained that we will only have money for our selves. That he refuses to place the stress on me. That it's not right that a *25* yo would be caring for a *32* yo. His dad wasn't happy with the tone from my bf.

225,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

Long story short. Me 22F, recently emigrated with bf 24M. We're from other sides of the world (litterally) and I don't know if it sometimes is cultural differences or just him.

I'm in therapy for traumas and have been doing stuff to myself until 6 years ago. I am still depressed and these changes kicked me back 10 years (as it feels)

Situation with BF 

It all started with me cutting the bread and cutting deep in my hand. He says Haha are you starting to cut yourself again?

I told him it was not something to joke about. He told me that it was a long time ago and I should be able to joke about it at some point in my life.

I let it slide in him feeling tired and me being happy to finally having the day off. We were going for a walk in the woods and I had my (to my knees) heavy skirt on because I finally could (can't with work and I ride a bike)

He told me to change because I am making him feel uncomfortable. I asked him why? We are just going for a walk? He said it makes him uncomfortable and he will not take me if I wear it. I changed in jeans. He said sure about those jeans? I said yep. I got my shoes and again sure you want to wear those instead of my gym shoes. I got my gym shoes.

I tried explaining it to him in the car how it made me feel and he turned the matter around. How inconsiderate it is of me to not consider his feelings about a matter. And he said you could've also offered it yourself as a nice gesture. 

I could explain the cutting joke to him after putting it in a situation he could understand so I thought fine all good.

I jokingly said to him while walking in the woods that I'd like him to compliment me sometimes on my body (have been going to the gym, trained my behind pretty well) and I asked him why he never comments on any of my bodily features. And i explained that i like it when he calls me sweet etc but i also like a compliment about something he likes from my body sometimes to make me feel sexy.

He said well if you work a bit more on your ass I'll compliment you on it and went on joking how much better his ass is comparing to mine etc. 

I told him he must me joking and he looks at me while holding my hand, why is that? I said well no man with a clear mind would say something like that to his lady. He didn't say anything anymore except how me talking about that issue of him never calling me sexy and him never getting horny by me was making him feel uncomfortable.

Now I told him after I made dinner and wrote this down that he has been making fun of me emotionally and physically and I do not accept that and that I need some space and time. He is now mad at me and refuses to think about why or how it has come that I feel the way I do.

227,Not the A-hole,"So, this story started on Thursday, when I had an English test on the whole year arguments and, just as I expected, my twenty-people class started to use notes while the teacher was doing her best to act like she didn't know what was happening. 

Since the start of the test, I had noticed many people cheating, in particular one girl that went so far to: Sit next to four people who would suggest each other, putting her English book opened on the irregular verbs page under her table and using her phone to send photos of the exercises with another person in front of her.

That's just an example, but I was sure that at least four people (those near me) were cheating and way more were doing so in the rest of the classroom, but since I tried to avoid looking at them, I can't really tell.

At 16:15 of the same day I had to go to a concil with most of our professors and with the other class representative and after half an hour of them complaining about our class, I raised my hand and exposed the cheating problem and, in a matter of seconds, i was having comfirmed my intuition that they knew my classmates cheated on their tests, but they weren't doing anything because they ""had"" to trust us.

Fast forwanding to the last hour of Friday and the English teacher was taking with her six people (the cheating girl and the other person that used the phone were with them) out of the classroom, only to bring them back twenty minutes later and all with sad faces.

After they returned, I was panicking for the simple fact that I knew the other representative was gonna tell everyone that it was my fault, which he did, since during after-school a friend from another classroom asked me why I did the spy, meaning the whole Insitute may as well know what I did.

I'm quite sure my classmates will be facing me on Monday and because of me being Asperger, I already know that I won't be able to do much other than keeping quiet and hoping they won't harm me, even if I haven't mention any name.

So, am I the asshole?",51,122,0.9
228,Not the A-hole,"So, my sister and I are not friends/don't really get along. Fine. We're just very different people. We are adults (in our late 20s) and can get along for an event.

However....she always brings hers awful dogs (four of them) everywhere. Don't get me wrong - I like dogs. She just has somehow managed to make every bad decision possible with them (imo). They are not neutered and the only training they have beyond bladder training is some off leash training with a shock collar. The result is that she won't put them on leashes, even in public. They bark non-stop. They jump on everyone. I've left get togethers with muddy paw prints on my shirt. 

They are sweet dogs, not malicious or mean, but I can't stand trying to talk through barking or having to constantly push them off me. 

Basically all family events take place at my Mom's house and the dogs are always there. I'm not happy about this, but I've been made to feel like asking her not to being them makes me an asshole for not wanting to be around her ""children""/my mom's ""grandkids"". 

I've mentioned a few times that they bark a lot and it makes it hard to talk and the response was ""yeah, they do that, they're dogs"". 

m I really the asshole for not going to, say, Mother's day activities, with the family because my sister will bring her dogs. (I would not ignore the occasion entirely - I'd get a gift  and hang out with my mom at a different time in the weekend). I'm not tryin to slight whoever the event is about - just can't deal with the dogs.",180,1345,0.96

230,Not the A-hole,"I left my GFs apartment to pick up my nephew who was staying for the night, and to pick up some food. Coming back, as I'm driving in, I make a wrong turn because its a new place, so I took the long way to her unit. I'm definitely driving a bit slower than usual traffic because everything is still new to me, plus there are a bunch of speed bumps and my car is lower. A cop followed me as soon as I turned in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once I parked, I texted my GF that a cop was following me. I get our stuff when he cuts the spotlight on me and turns on his lights. By this time we're already out of the car. He walks up to me and asks me what I'm doing. In general, my philosophy is to say very little to police when I'm approached in an official capacity. I've had some run-ins before, and my nephew has priors.

&#x200B;

I responded matter of factly, ""Nothing really. You?"" I thought it was a friendly conversation. Thats my normal response to anyone asking me that question. He tells me he's the one that asks the questions, not me. OK. I'm also the one that doesn't answer questions so if we want to go that route. He asks me why I went the wrong way, and why was I driving so slow. I just say that I don't agree with the premise, and that neither one of those things are crimes. He says, ""What are you, a sovereign citizen? Give me your ID.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By this time, he's been shining his flashlight inside my car looking for shit. My GF is out front, and due to his lights 2 sets of neighbors are also out front. I state that again, I didn't commit a crime and since this isn't a stop and ID state I don't have to ID myself. I wasn't pulled over, I was approached after I was already parked. He says he got a call that someone who fit my description and matched my car was driving around the parking lot looking inside of cars, there was a recent car theft in that lot. He literally started following me the second I pulled in, which was 2 minutes ago, so I know thats bullshit. My GF speaks up to say something, and I tell her I've got this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He then turns to my nephew and demands ID. I tell him that he's a minor, and I don't give him permission to speak to him. I say that lets not act like he didn't run my plates, so we both know he knows who I am, and unless I'm being detained, I'm leaving. I walk inside and make sure they both follow me. Nothing else happens.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She's really upset that I would speak to the police in that manner, especially considering they have had some minor crime recently. I was never rude, I just don't want to answer a bunch of questions. She's also highly embarrassed that I would do this in front of her neighbors. Do what? I'm not the one that turned the discussion sideways, and I'm not the one that started lying. Also, we're Black while my GF and her apartment complex is all White. That may have something to do with how I've experienced police encounters versus how she has.  

&#x200B;

Edit:  They've had a couple of car break-ins, and 1 home break-in within the past 2 months or so.  They put a cop on site for nights like this.  GF insists its just for security, and its the same as having to check-in at the front in a gated community.  Lots of people have apparently been questioned, and all you have to do is tell them where you're going and give them your ID.  Although I'm glad they're being proactive, I still feel like I didn't sign up for all of that.",581,10394,0.9

232,Not the A-hole,"For context I am 18 and my mom’s family lives overseas.

The last time we visited them was last year and my mom only really sees them once a year. I love my grandparents , aunts and uncles and cousins, but since they’re super religious (Roman Catholic) and live in a provincial area they can be close minded about stuff relating to gender norms and LGBT people.

When we visited them last, I was sporting super short hair (atypical of how a girl looks in their area). I’m also a lesbian but closeted to them. 

I noticed my uncles giving me weird looks and not really wanting to talk to me when I would be talking to them. I felt weird because they usually made me feel welcome/loved in the past, when I still had long hair and was more feminine.

On the first day we arrived, a family friend of theirs came by my grandparents’ house and saw me. She acted as if I wasn’t in the room and asked my mom “she’s not a boy though is she? She’s still a girl?”  Referring to my haircut.

Then when we were at the beach one of my uncles said to me out of the blue, “why do you have short hair? Are you a boy?” 

I didn’t know what to say, I just already felt really uncomfortable and alienated during the trip. I know it’s not a big deal and maybe I was being too sensitive but it hurt me so I went away and cried about it.

My mom understood why I was upset and she told my uncle off, which reassured me a bit.

In the days that followed I got a really bad cold and just felt shit in general during the whole trip. There were more comments made about me in passing, about how I used to be beautiful with long hair. 

And in another trip to the beach I accompanied my uncles and cousins (all male) to go to this jumping raft. My uncles pretty much ignored me so I didn’t have the best time.

At the end of the trip I cried and told my mom that I felt super unhappy and uncomfortable, and that I wasn’t sure when I’d be ready to see them again cause they made me feel unwelcome. She was on my side and told me I wouldn’t have to visit them. I told her she could visit them anytime just without me but she said she would just rather not go because she doesn’t wanna make me upset.

I feel guilty because I feel that my mom feels obligated not to see her family because of me. AITA?",13,93,0.94
233,Not the A-hole,"Just hear me out first. About 4 years ago I slept with this one guy who worked with me. Just a casual one night stand, nothing more than that. The next day, he was pretty paranoid that I'd tell anyone, which I can understand since that workplace was oozing with gossip over office romances. It wasn't a big deal for me cause, I mean, it was a one night stand, so I didn't even think of telling any other co-worker. My friend, let's call her 'Lana', also worked there, but after I resigned, I didn't really have any contact with my former coworkers anymore.

Skip to now, Lana and I got into talking via instagram and soon after we met up a few times and we got along so well and talked about other co-workers with who we still had contact with. She, then mentioned, that she got together with the guy I slept with. I was pretty surprised and asked since when they were together. Turns out, they got together before he even slept with me. (Note, that she doesn't know about me and him.) Now his paranoia made a lot more sense. After we met up a few times more, she told me a few times that she'd been often times be suspicious of him cheating on her but after talking to him a few times about it, she's sure that her  ""jealousy would be destroying the relationship "".

Now I'm really torn. The guy obviously cheated on her with me just in the beginning of the relationship and she's blaming herself for suspicions that seem to be valid, at least 4 years ago. I had no idea that they were a thing back then and I really do think he should be the one to tell her, but as he doesn't, I sort of think I owe her my honesty. So WIBTA if I did?

EDIT: Would not telling her make me an asshole?

EDIT2: Oh wow, this got a lot more replies than I expected. Thank you all for your input and different perspectives on the topic. The general consensus seems to be that I should tell her. I don't know yet how I'll approach her with these things. I know it will be really uncomfortable for me and I'd rather avert the drama but this is about her but I owe her the truth.",54,408,0.95
234,No A-holes here,"So a little bit of backstory. Husband (33M) and I (30F) have been married for almost 5 years now, it was an arranged marriage. When we got married, husband and I both bonded on our love for travel and agreed that we would postpone having children to travel, explore and have fun. But life had other plans, we had an unplanned pregnancy and now we have a 3 year old daughter. I have never traveled outside the country and have always wanted to travel abroad, husband knows this. But we never got to it, we bought a home, had a baby etc. Now we have a comfortable life and with some planning we can definitely afford a trip. But husband is stingy and he might be traveling abroad soon for a long-term business opportunity. He always says we can go when he travels for work. I argue that it wouldn't exactly be a trip but we kinda disagree on that.

Now to my in-laws. MIL is a mild CB. She is alright otherwise and doesn't really demand things. But she does have a lot of expectations from her children (husband has a younger brother). For instance, we live in city A and IL's live in city B. They have their own apartment in our city, which they have rented out but that was apparently not enough. When we got married, she was insisting that we buy a house in city B, so that they can live rent-free. Husband was all for it, but I put my foot down and refused. We once got her a watch as a gift during a festival and she says ""oh, but I already have a watch. I wanted a smartphone. I hope atleast BIL gets me one"". Now to the issue at hand. MIL is visiting us and she was casually mentioning that husband's uncle (her BIL) who lives abroad keeps asking them to visit whenever they chat and she says if they want me to visit so bad, why can't they buy us our flight tickets!!! Even husband is shocked and he says something like you can't expect random relatives to spend a fortune on you, don't worry, someday I'll take you. Now he wants to set aside some funds to be able to buy them tickets for a trip abroad. Now in our culture, it is expected of children to support parents and it isn't like I don't want him to spend on them at all. He pays them a decent sum every month for their expenses and I'm the one who reminds him to do so most of the time. And we do pay for their health insurance. I am more than willing to support them financially to the best of our abilities and to pay for any medical expenses incurred. But I don't think it's our responsibility to fulfil their dreams and desires, certainly not at this stage in our life. AITA?

For further context - we are both Indian so supporting parents financially is not up for debate. IL's had a bout of terrible luck (major accident, cancer, theft of property, loss in business) so they don't have any savings or a retirement plan.",15,41,0.89

Anyways, whenever they come to visit, I’m always the one who has to give up my room because we have no guest bedroom. So, that always means that I must sleep on the couch and let them stay in my bedroom for however long they stay and my sister has not once ever had to be the one to give up her room. My parents never ask me if I’m okay with it and always give some excuse that I have the cleaner room or more comfortable bed and that’s why I must sleep in the couch. For as long as I can remember it’s always been like this when family visits and I feel as if I’m being punished simply because I keep my room cleaner than my sisters. Well, my graduation is in two weeks and my mother just informed me that I must let my grandparents stay in my room and I have to sleep on the couch. This seems incredibly unfair to me because not only is it one of the most important moments of my life and would like to get ready in my space and sleep in my own bed and not the couch, but also because my sister doesn’t even live at home and her room has been empty (and clean) for months now.

She believes that it would be hard for my grandparents to get out of my sisters bed due to the height, however I don’t believe it would be.

To be clear, this is a hypothetical discussion.

 I only really want 2 children, as someone that was effectively 1 of 3 children (I do have 5 siblings, but the age gaps work it out so it's like growing up as 2x groups of 3) I found that it was always a case of someone being handed up on our left out. It's an off-putting thought, but probably avoidable though. However my main issue is the notion of carrying and giving birth 3 times. 

As 1 of 2 my SO feels that 3 children would be better. 

Here are my terms: if after a second child, he still wanted a 3rd, I would ask him to go through a birth simulator, efficient would essentially put him through the pain of contractions. My point is that he'd be asking me to go through an incredible amount of pain, so maybe if he could comprehend just what he was asking me to do, he would take into consideration the sheer amount of pain that is child birth.

He thinks this is barbaric, like if he were to lose a leg in a war, him coming back and chopping off other people's legs so they know how he feels, my counter to that is no, because they're not asking you to go back specifically to lose your other leg, it's a dramatic and false equivalency.

251,Not the A-hole,"So, I used to go visit my grandparents (dads side) in California every summer. Last summer when I went, on the last day I heard them talking on the patio directly outside my open bedroom window. They were saying really terrible things about me to each other. From what I can remember, here were the highlights:

-  My grandma was upset that I didn’t eat much of her food throughout the stay. That one I can understand, but (and of course they have no way of knowing this so I’m not holding this against them) I do struggle with a restrictive eating disorder and I did my best to eat as much of the meal as I could. However, the part that concerns me was the way my grandfather talked to my grandma about it. He said I wasn’t eating the food because I clearly didn’t like her cooking and I was only doing it to upset her. Not true, obviously. 

- when I’d first gotten to California my grandma had told me my grandpa was really excited to take me shopping. On the day that the drama happened he had taken me out to a boardwalk and asked me what I wanted to do. Since there was nothing there but stores, and I was under the impression that he’d wanted to go shopping with me, I suggested we go into a store. He seemed happy to go. Less than $50. Then, when I heard him talking about it, he told my grandma that I’d manipulated him into buying me things and that the only reason I wanted to come visit was so that I could get free stuff.

- on the ride home from the boardwalk, I’d asked if we were going out to dinner that night. He had said no. Later, to my grandmother, he brought that up and said “i just spent the whole damn day with her, why would I want to take her out to dinner? I’m tired of her.” My grandma enthusiastically agreed.

They said a bunch of other shit but those were the most important things I think. Obviously I was pissed, especially because this wasn’t the first time they’d done something like this, they’d also done it to my cousins. I called my mom from the airport the next day and ranted. She was furious as well and told my dad, who immediately called his parents and confronted them. They said I must have misunderstood and they were talking about someone else (lmao).

Fast forward several months and my grandma comes to visit for my moms birthday. We had not talked since. I spent the entire visit except for the birthday either in my room or at work. The times I was forced to talk to her I kept the conversation brief and made it clear that I was not interested in having small talk. I didn’t bring up what happened.

Was I laying it on a little thick? It definitely caused tension between her and my dad, which I feel bad about, but my stance is that I shouldn’t have to coddle her feelings about the situation. My mom said I was punishing her, but I think of it more as the consequences of her actions? Am I in the wrong for thinking that I’m not obligated to pretend that our relationship hasn’t been fucked up?",33,54,0.89
252,Not the A-hole,"Granted, I am 23 and I don’t have any children, so what would I know? My boyfriend recently made a comment about how when his daughter is a teenager, he will never let her wear crop tops. And I asked why? He said because she is under the age of 18 and that’s not her body. It’s his. And I looked at him and I said are you serious? And he was very much serious and thought it was “annoying” of me to get upset about. Side note that I am 23 years old so I wear crop tops and just normal 23 year old shit that I wear. Nothing ever revealing besides a little midriff. And he will throw a FIT about it before leaving to whatever we have going on that day. He will also throw a fit if a dress is even a little bit above my knees and will refuse to go anywhere with me if I wore the dress he wasn’t “comfortable” with. 

Anyway. AITA? Or is my state of thinking not really justified because I’m not a parent???

UPDATE: thank you all for your responses. i didn’t think this would get so much attention and i really appreciate everything that’s being said. i had brought this up to him again, and he at first refused to entertain the conversation bc it would result in a fight. we then ended up talking about it and he retracted saying his daughters body statement was a “obvious joke”. but then i asked so you really don’t believe that right? and he proceeds to say ”i own her and as long as she’s my daughter, she is not allowed to wear crop tops. it has nothing to do with me not being comfortable. it’s not appropriate.” and that was the end of the discussion.",659,2059,0.94
253,Not the A-hole,"So as I write this I'm feeding my 7 week old son. I am totally in love with him, he is amazing. However... The process of bringing him into the world was not good. At. All.

In order to explain why i might be an asshole I think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.

I had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that I weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before I conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). I could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and I got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.

Then came labour and delivery. I was in labour for 92 hours. My son was back to back, so i was in agony. I had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. In the end his heart rate dropped and I had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.

I ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. My son was ill following delivery and ended up in the NICU for a few days. I had issues breastfeeding once he was out of NICU, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. I spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.

Once home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.

He's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.




So why AITA?

Well, before I got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. Which, pardon my French, is bollocks. I still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe I could mentally deal with another pregnancy.

Part of the reason I think I have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues I had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. Nobody told me that everything can go wrong. I didn't expect my birth plan to go as I hoped, but i thought I might get some things I wanted. I never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. I didn't prepare for him being ill. I didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.

So when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, I was totally honest.

I didn't sugar coat anything. I explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. I have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, I probably won't be doing it again.

Well my friends have said that I'm an asshole for being so honest as I've put them off having children in the future. I didn't mean to scare them, but I felt that I would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.

I don't feel like I should apologise or say that I exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe I'm wrong.

257,Not the A-hole,"I'm the only woman on my team at work. I get along well enough with the guys I work with. I've had some jobs where I was treated different, treated like shit, etc... This is not one of them, the guys I work with are good people. I go out with a group of them on Fridays after work for happy hour. nobody I work with has ever crossed a line with me, nor I with them

It's probably worth mentioning that I'm queer and like 95% interested in women... So like I'd consider a guy if he was somehow perfect in every way but in reality I'm far more often attracted to women. I'm currently casually dating a woman right now. And my coworkers know this, and aren't judgemental or creepy about it at all.

So, my friend Jeremy said that the group usually goes out for a long weekend at a beach house every summer. Just the group of them, out to drink and hang out. And they invited me, and I said I was down to go. I started at my job under a year ago so this was the first time I heard of this.

The beach trip is a week away now, and I've already picked up my share of the supplies and I was looking forward to going.

Yesterday, one of the guys, Sam, asked the group if it was cool if his girlfriend joined. And the rest of the guys said it wouldn't be the same, plus ones never came, it was always a friends trip rather than a couples trip. 

Then, today, Alex said he didn't think he could make it, he was going to stay home with his wife. Everyone was sad that Alex couldn't make it, and kind of annoyed he'd cancelled so late.

And just an hour ago, Sam told me privately that the reason he asked about his girlfriend going is that she said she wasn't cool with being excluded after the trip turned from a 'bro' trip to mixed genders. And he said that Alex had also bowed out of the trip because his wife wasn't cool with me being there and her not being allowed.

I was surprised to hear that, I had wished Sam had said that outright. And I'd wished Alex had been honest too. Because then the group could have figured something out.

Sam asked me if I'd stay home from the trip because he wanted to go. And that honestly hit a nerve for me, that he'd do that so backhandedly. Asking me one on one to quietly stay home rather than being upfront with the group. So I told him nah, I'd be going, it's on him to figure out shit with his girl, or with the group. He didn't get to decide to exclude me because he's got relationship issues.

So, Sam told the whole group later that he'd be staying home. And right now, I'm in the awkward position of knowing why the trip's falling apart, and not being sure if I should spill the beans to the whole group.

I know the other 5 guys going would really rather have a trip without couples.

I'm also frustrated with Sam for how he handled things and I don't know if I should tell the whole group what he asked of me.

258,Asshole,"My girlfriend loves to sing but she is not very good. I'm pretty sure she's aware of that fact. On certain songs, she sounds fine. She has had no vocal training, or anything like that. If I had to guess her range is unusually low for a woman because she absolutely cannot do songs with high notes, her voice literally goes out if she tries to hit a high note. Most songs by women she butchers, but songs by men she can do fairly okay. She can belt out Patsy Cline fine and other women with more smokier voices like that. I tolerate it for the most part as it makes her happy.

On Friday we went out. My girlfriend doesn't like crowded places so we go to a little hole in the wall bar. They have karaoke there but my girlfriend isn't into that usually as she is a bit shy. That night she had enough liquid courage to give it a go. She picked the absolute worst freaking song for her voice: I will always love you by Whitney Houston. It was terrible. I was cringing the whole time. I don't know why she would do that to herself. I was humiliated for her. 

She got a hearty response from the crowd which was nice of them but I did not want her to be encouraged by it so as to prevent future humiliation I told her she couldn't sing. She was very hurt, naturally, but I felt she needed some tough love. 

Ever since then I haven't heard her sing anymore. She always sang in the shower and she doesn't anymore. I feel kind of like a villain now. I didn't mean she shouldn't have fun and enjoy herself on her own time, just not do it publicly. That's all.",100,114,0.76

260,Not the A-hole,"My mom was my best friend growing up, considering that we moved around a lot. About a month ago she had a stroke and a heart attack, marking her 6th stroke since 2016. This time, however, she’s barely functional and the rehab center called and told me she is going to need 24/7 care, implying that I do it.

The thing is, after her first stroke, I realized that she wasn’t as good a mom as I had always thought. She would scream at me whenever I’d cry, she’d pour water over my head, she laughed when I told her I got assaulted, and forced my brother and I to live with abusive men for many years, among a million other things. These men would not only treat her badly, but me as well, to the point that I’ve got quite a few mental health problems that she’s ignored. The final straw was a few months ago when my mom was supposed to be watching my puppy and she calls to tell me the puppy had died when she was away.

Ever since I’ve been trying to distance myself from her, but now I’m expected to drop my whole life (I’m 20, about to be a junior in college, and am a manager at my part time job) to just take care of her.

She also has an enormous victim complex, still leeches off my parents, has this toxic group of friends and online community and is just a pain in my ass. I have no sisterly love for her at all. 

For my entire life she's gone around with this saying ""oh she can eat whatever she wants and she never gains a pound"" in reference to our weight difference. I'll be totally up front I pay zero attention to what she eats, how she exercises or what she does with her time so maybe she does eat a salad and diet coke and still gains weight.

269,Everyone Sucks,"I am a guy in my early 30’s who works at a restaurant, and we got a new employee a couple weeks ago named “Jane.” Jane is an older woman in her late 50’s, who seems like a good person, but is very, very annoying. She acts, as I said in my title, a lot like a “mother hen” to other employees - whenever she sees someone working with sharp, dangerous-looking objects, she gets big eyes, goes, “ooooh, careful”, and continuously pesters them that they’re not doing it safe enough/right, and reminds them over and over to “be careful.” She’ll frequently help people who insist they don’t need it and aren’t even in her department, and gives them advice on how to better do their job

It gets **very** annoying very fast, especially considering that she’s the new person. Typically, the “new guy” is the one who’s more submissive and deferential in his first couple weeks; to be a long time employee and have the new person treating **me** like a baby, or giving me advice on how to do my job, is very insulting.

The other week, I was using a large, sharp device/machine to cut some things up, and Jane stopped by, doing her usual “big eyes” and “oooooh, careful,” over and over. She kept leaning in my personal space and giving me pointers on how I could use the device “better” and “safer,” and how she “doesn’t want me to get hurt.” After a long time of this, I turned it off, put everything down, and confronted her.

“You want me to be safe, and get this sliced safely?” I asked her very harshly. “I’ll tell you what you can do - quit fucking bothering me while I’m working! I’m not a dipshit, I’ve worked here 20 times as long as you, I know how to use their fucking tools!

271,Not the A-hole,"This is a really long story that I must condense for character limit. I hope the sense of it all is intact.

My ex girlfriend deceived me for our entire relationship. She told me she was a very important charge nurse with a BSN and worked at a prestigious hospital in our area. Here in reality she is not a nurse at all but a phlebotomy technician and not at a prestigious hospital either. 

She had a total breakdown when I confronted her about all of this and ended up getting put on an involuntary psych hold. I do not know how she did it, but she got herself released after only 2 days and is completely off the rails. She broke into my house. I came home from work the other day and she was in my shower. Not taking a shower, just chilling in there with my cat. It really fucking freaked me out. She ran off before the cops came. They couldn't find her. 

She moved here a few months before we started dating and I didn't know any of her family. After she broke into my house, I did some internet sleuthing and tracked down her parents and older brother. I was able to make contact with her mom because they have a landline with a listed number. I told her the situation. I gave her all of the information I knew about my ex. Her mom thanked me very much. Apparently my ex went ghost on her family about a year ago. Her mom told me they would take care of it and just wanted her to come back home. 

Her brother called me very frantic shortly after I got off the phone with their mom and I talked to him for awhile. He said he was flying out first thing to hunt my ex down. That was yesterday. I was satisfied and relieved with the response.

I spoke to some friends today about it and they think I did too much and shouldn't have involved her family because I don't know the dynamic.

Because of Canada's citizenship laws at the time of my birth, I am afforded dual citizenship by Canada (from my understanding, the US doesn't officially recognize dual citizenship, but kind of turns a blind eye in most cases for countries they're friendly with). 
I was in the process of requesting a citizenship certificate from Canada so that I could get a Canadian passport to travel more easily, and potentially live abroad. Right before I finalized the paperwork, I got a call from my brother. The company he works for contracts work from the American government occasionally, so he's required to have a certain level of security clearance to keep his job. The fact that our father is Canadian frequently throws red flags on his clearance checks, and he has to go through a bunch of extra steps every couple of months at work. After the most recent incident at work, he was informed that he also had to report any time he spoke with any citizens of foreign countries, including dual-citizens (which would be me, if I officially get the citizenship certificate). When he informed his work that I was in the process of becoming (or rather, certifying that I was) a dual-citizen, he was told that this might compromise his ability to keep his clearance, and as a result, may lose his job, if I were to do so.

Here's the rub. I'm a vegan (I know, I know, I'm the worst yadda yadda), but you would never ever, ever know unless you asked me, or went out to eat with me or whatever. I literally never talk about it, and prefer not to because whenever someone finds out its nonstop questions and snarky remarks.

So for the past three years or so I have asked that I just not be included in these events because A) I'm more than likely not going to be eating anything any one brings. B) When it comes around I have nearly 30 people asking me ""Can you eat this?"" ""Just a bite, try it, you have to, C'MON"" ""Well we worry that you aren't eating"" ""Someone brought some lettuce for you."" I just want everyone to bring their dishes, eat, have a good time and stop worrying about me eating. I will be just fine.

So regardless of my request, I still get asked what I'm bringing, how much I'm making etc. and every time, with out fail, I say I'd rather not participate, and the grilling begins. I get treated like I'm the biggest dick in the world and people say that I just must not like anyone in the office, or I hate them, or I'm just a grump. I cannot stress enough how nice and cordial I have been about these things every time.

Fast forward to today, we had a Cinco De Mayo party, and I got asked to bring the ice. Cool, that's an easy, cheap, contribution. I oblige with no resistance. But I show up with the ice and I get a  ""seriously that's all you brought"" and I finally snapped. IN THE NICEST WAY POSSIBLE, I said ""Its what I was asked to bring, I respect what I am asked to do unlike the rest of this place when I ask just to be left out, but here I am bringing ice for your soda that I'm not even drinking."" Immediately met with a kitchen full of shitty looks and snarks, even some from the Presidents assistant about how big of a scrooge I am and a ""I go throw some grass on the grill to cheer him up.""

So, TLDR, am I the asshole for not wanting to participate in office carry-in's for dietary restrictions, and harbor no ill will for not being able to do so.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of the comments are asking a similar question ""Why not bring a dish."" The short and sad answer is I have tried that. I did for the first two years, from simple things like hummus and pita, to  bruschetta, to a veganized buffalo chickn dip. And they went over okay, but often times they were rarely eaten, or the selection was too large and they went unnoticed so I just found it easier to not bring something, which is why I requested to forget me for three whole years. Its probably a little selfish and dickish but at what point does my time become wasted, when everyone else is eating just the same?

&#x200B;

Second, I want to clarify that my office is directly connected to the common area/kitchen where most of the food is served/stored throughout the day, this is not an outside of the office event, it goes on throughout the day. There is often far too much food, leaving lots of leftovers and waste as it is and contributing to that is also another problem I don't even want to get into. 

&#x200B;

Third, I'm not excluding myself from the mingling part at all, in fact I'm generally right up in the action talking and having fun with the folks who are standing and eating etc. hell I even help with the cleanup when needed, but it still never gets dropped that I don't want to participate and I always leave feeling like I've done something wrong.",59,122,0.92
282,Asshole,"We have 4 kids, ages 21, 17, 9 and 5. The 5yo Bday is also on Mothers Day. 

She is truly the gift that keeps on giving!

For her Bday we are all going to Legoland and staying in a hotel. 

I was just daydreaming about staying behind by myself.

I can take a long quiet bath , get room service and hours of uninterrupted sleep.  

I can swim in the hotel pool without the little kids constantly calling ""mommie look! "". 

This feels  selfish since its her bday and I can't have her sad on her special day if I don't go.

283,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

So I've been getting cold sores my whole life. I'm pretty sure I got the HSV-1 virus from my dad, who also gets them, as a very small child. Almost 70% of the US population carries the virus, and I've always been careful when I have a cold sore. I don't share drinks or do anything that could possibly swap saliva until the outbreak is totally over. I get one about once a year, usually due to stress or an allergic reaction to a specific compound that I've learned to avoid, and any time I even feel a tingle, I go right to the urgent care or minute clinic to refill my acyclovir prescription. Most of the time, I can take care of it before the blister even surfaces. I've never had an STI in my life and am very considerate when it comes to safe sex, know all the risks, use condoms etc. And like most HSV-1 carriers, I've only ever had the blisters surface orally. Never had a genital herpes experience in my life.

So I went on a first date last week, and we made plans to see each other again this weekend. The guy was nice, though I really couldn't tell whether he was attracted to me, and he did kind of ambush me with a kiss at the end of the night but I thought he might just be awkward. Anyway, last night I felt a cold sore start to come on, so I rushed to get my RX refilled, and texted the guy I was supposed to see tonight that I was still up to get drinks or dinner, but I might have a cold sore coming on, so if he wanted to postpone, that was fine with me. He didn't respond until this morning, and when he did, his response was this, verbatim: ""I cannot believe you would expose me to herpes without disclosing it. I didn't take you for an irresponsible whore but I'm livid right now. Don't contact me again.""

The thing is, \*he\* chose to kiss \*me\* without asking whether I had ever gotten a cold sore! I'm not overstating when I say it really did feel like an ambush... he just kind of grabbed and kissed me out of nowhere as we were saying goodbye. At no point in the evening did the subject of any kind of viruses or infectious diseases come up. I appreciate that if you're part of the \~33% of Americans who don't carry the HSV-1 virus, it's your prerogative not to date people who carry it, but if that \*is\* your prerogative, I think you should also ask before doing anything that would potentially expose you to it (even if it's as simple as taking a sip of someone else's drink).

Am I wrong, though? Am I the asshole for not formally announcing ""Oh, and by the way, I get cold sores about once a year"" during a first date with someone I wasn't even that sure was into me physically?

284,Not the A-hole,"  

So I have a pretty tight group of friends that have all been together r since elementary school. All early 30s now. Lately with people getting married and our careers we haven’t had much time to spend together. So one of my friends suggested a long overdue guy’s night. Just pizza and beers and catching up at a buddy’s place. I said that I would order and pay for the pizza from our usual spot.

So the day of guy’s night, I get a text from the host’s wife (We’ll call her Kim), asking me to pick up some pizza on the other end of the city. At first I was confused and then I found out that she basically just cancelled her plans with her girlfriends to interject herself into our guy’s night. I told her that the place she wants to pick up from is on the other end of the city, plus we already had a place to order from. Kim had wanted to order a bunch of these super expensive, tiny thin-crust hipster pizzas. I tell Kim that we’re a bunch of dudes that just want some regular filling pepperoni pizza to eat while we have a few drinks. The host texts me after to just say, “Yeah, go ahead and just get the regular, its way easier.” So we go ahead and order the regular stuff. While I’m driving to his place, I get a message form Kim that reads something like the following:

“I think you’re being really selfish here. I wanted to share something with you guys that I found amazing and have a new experience with you, but you decided that you just have to make this all about yourself. You know that Host isn’t going to say no to anyone and you’re just being mean to get your way.”

I told Kim , “Just cancel the order, get whatever you want. I’m out” and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, I wasn’t upset about not getting my choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy’s night and then started making demands about food for us and telling me to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that’s used to getting everything she wants.

So I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don’t want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.

286,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment with 3 other girls. I didn't know them prior but while I was looking i saw their ad and we all talked in a groupchat for a month met up in person a couple times and everything was good. They seemed nice and I was running out of options.

The girl, her name will be sarah, told us she was vegetarian early in me meeting her. Not obnoxiously, just casually because I recommended we go to a good burger place for one of our meet ups. They had no vegetarian options so we chose another place. All was good.

&#x200B;

I like to cook  frequently and do it as much as possible. Sometimes 5 days a week. I'm not a vegetarian and I really enjoy meat, it's usually the center of my foods. The rest of our roommates are not vegetarians and sometimes eat what's left of what i make or make their own. I buy everything I need to make my food. And I don't usually buy stuff for the future as I know myself and I'll forget i have it and buy it again.

 It started off as little comments from sarah about how she's going to starve now. I know that sounds dramatic but shes very sarcastic and we laughed it off. I didn't really take it seriously. Then she began getting obviously annoyed going in the kitchen and being upset there's not much she can eat. She huffs and goes back to her room.

&#x200B;

Last week when i made chili and rice and  went into the kitchen and began to casually talk about  how hard it is for people to accept vegetarians and it's not expensive to buy alternatives. She even mentioned the word oppressed.

&#x200B;

Not I understand her feeling left out, but I'm not doing it on purpose. I know she doesn't eat meat but I do. Just as I don't expect her to change her diet i don't think she should expect me too. I cook for myself and the other roommates take what's left. After she said this i apologized and said she could cook her own food or meat alternatives.

&#x200B;

Sarah isn't a chef. When she cooks it's usually something simple like eggs. That's it. lately I've been feeling guilty about her not being ale to participate in dinner with us. But now it's her completely ignoring us during dinner and making snide comments when she rarely comes out the room. One of my roommates said I should try tofu, but i have and i don't like the taste. the other said it's not our problem she's just being sarah she'll get over it.  I've been thinking of a compromise, if she buys the tofu I'll try to make it on the side next to my regular food. AITA for not making food for her and making her feel left out?  This is not a ""obviously you're not TA"" because I don't feel like i am, but I feel like I'm missing some sympathy and would like to know from other people's point of views.",74,42,0.87
287,Not the A-hole,"We have been separated since before our daughter was born and recently she has been getting into trouble at school (she’s 8, and in grade 3) for not doing her homework. The homework is usually one worksheet per night and sometimes an online portion to strengthen skills. On these nights when she seems to forget to do it, it’s almost always at her father’s.

The other day when I picked her up, she had forgotten her homework at her dads house (before she left for school that morning) and she was crying so hard I thought she was going to get sick.  Most parents know what it’s like when they are THAT upset, and it disturbed me to see her like that over a piece of paper. 

When I started asking questions he was throwing around accusations that I never punish her or when he grounds her I don’t reinforce it (he never tells me when he grounds her). He said that the only reason she wants to live with me is because I let her do whatever she wants. 

Here is where I get hung up on things. According to him, he not only DOESNT remind her or help her figure out her homework, he doesn’t make sure it’s in her bag for school, it’s HER responsibility. When I pick her up from his house her bag is usually filled to the brim with garbage, toys, and papers that need signed but have been ignored. I’ve found old permission slips, and once I been found a parent teacher conference slip that was a week past due. To me, she’s still learning responsibility; We need to help keep her on track, not expect her to just do everything herself. He has a list of chores which she needs to do (including yard work) every day and he claims she has a smart mouth with him and that “needs to stop because she shouldn’t speak to adults the way she does”.

The thing is, I don’t have these issues with her. I don’t allow her to disrespect me, but she is allowed to speak her mind openly. Not once has this been a negative, and when she tells me how she feels it is in response to something she doesn’t like and she isn’t rude or disruptive about it. As for the chores, she has responsibilities at my house with no complaints: She feeds/waters the animals, keeps her room clean, empties the dishwasher and the trash when I ask her, and she usually volunteers to help with laundry and vacuuming when I do them. 

My rules are that as long as she does as I ask her to, she is allowed to spend her free time as she chooses. When she gets home from school, she immediately does her homework and chores, sometimes I have to remind her but most of the time I don’t.

When I tried to talk to him about our contrast in parenting and maybe changing both of our rules to have more consistency, he just dumped all these problems on me and claims it’s my fault. I “baby her”, or I let her “get away with everything”. 

I’ve never had a good example of great parenting, I just want to know what the right thing to do here is. Am I the asshole for not being as strict?",31,80,0.95

289,Not the A-hole,"So just a little background:
I’ve been with my husband for nearly 15 years, we have 3 children. He’s always had a great relationship with his friends and I also had my own group of friends years ago but after I had my first child, all of my friends chose to either travel or focus on their careers and so I fell out of touch with most of them. For a few years we would hang out with my husband’s friends and their partners to do “couple” things but in recent years they’ve all seemed to become single, so now it’s always guys only events and it’s rare if I get a night out. 
However, at least 4 times a year my husband goes on his guys only wilderness trips and has regular nights out too. Now I’ve never opposed to these events, especially as they go mainly to do their hobbies (hunting, fishing etc) but my issue is that he spends a lot of time and effort planning these trips yet he never plans things with me and the kids. We hardly ever go on day trips and our vacation plans are always left for me to deal with. 
He has planned a weekend away starting tonight but I’ve been so exhausted and sick this week, I’ve struggled looking after the kids and I really just need a little time to relax. 

He was packing his backpack last night and asked me to go to the store in the morning to pick him up some supplies, usually I wouldn’t have an issue with this but I wasn’t feeling great, I was trying to simultaneously feed my youngest child (10 months) bath my middle child (5 yo) and make sure my eldest child (8 yo) was doing his homework. Something in me just snapped and I told him that if he needed something from the store that he should get it himself or maybe he should have been more prepared rather than leaving it to last minute. He then started to tell me how I needed to calm down which just made me even more upset. I yelled at him telling him that he was selfish for leaving me and the kids to go on a trip with friends especially whilst he could see that I’m clearly in no state to be looking after them by myself. 
He didn’t speak to me before leaving for work this morning and hasn’t replied to my messages either. 
Am I being unreasonable to suggest that he should have cancelled or even postponed until I was feeling well? Is it fair that he gets to go on his trips and nights out when I’m here with the kids all day? I never get a day off, not even a few hours to go to a spa or go shopping. 

TLDR; My husband always goes on guys trips and leaves me with our kids, I never get a day off. I called him selfish for leaving this weekend even though he knows I’m sick.

EDIT; we’ve had discussions in the past about this issue and he sees where I’m coming from but nothing ever seems to be done about it. The few plans he makes with us seem to be secondary to the plans he makes with his friends.",102,130,0.92
290,Not the A-hole,"My SO doesn't think I'm the asshole but this is still bothering me. 

For the capstone course for the Computer Science and Engineering BS it is just a semester long group project and 2 exams. The project is a programming assignment worth 80% of the grade. 

This team member K. He got 2 coding action items done the whole semester for this group long project both took a long time and there were errors I had to fix. He had countless other action items he was asked to do and said he would, but then never did. He would not even tell us he couldn't do it, it just wouldn't get done. 

There were other problems with a different team member who finally ended up pulling his weight so this whole thing was just so much stress and extra work for me. 

The day the project was due I told K that he didn't do anything. 

He said he did the best he could and brought up his disability. I didn't ask what it was. But it really bothered me. Just because someone has a disability doesn't mean they can take a senior capstone course for a Bachelors of Science and expect to be able to do nothing! He took a heavy load of classes and he is using his disability as an excuse.

I told him ""We all have our shit, I have anxiety and depression. You need to be honest with yourself about your abilities because you took too big of a load and it heavily impacted the rest of the team because you did nothing. If it was up to me you wouldn't pass this class.""

So my school recently started holding special classes where they give a ton of free time between classes about 2 hours a day, and I really wanted his sports equipment to take to school that day. So here’s how it goes. I go to him and ask him as nicely as possible to give me his equipment. He dosent have classes right now so he basically plays all day but uses his equipment only from around 5 pm when it becomes quite cool. I come back from school at 4:30 pm and he denies giving me his equipment. It’s not easily damaged and I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t give me

So I go and ask his mom, (my aunt) for the same. She, to my surprise says it’s up to her son, ie my cousin (we’ll call him X) X had outgrown his old bike and basically uses my bike everyday. I don’t ride my bike, so it’s fine. I asked her nicely again, asked her to consider how he uses my bike everyday. She snaps at me, shouting, haven’t I told you already, it’s up to X, and the cycle thing dosent matter as you don’t use it anyway. I reply telling her that he won’t use it on the time period I use it either but to no avail. I got really angry and started shouting at her about how she’s a bad and entitled parent and X is gonna grow up spoilt. I slammed the door and left, while shouting at X too about how he’s a huge jerk

My aunt told my mom everything and now my mom is shouting at me too, telling me that I am a bad cousin, and it’s all up to X about how he used his own stuff. I locked myself in my room

I turned to see her smiling, so I asked her if she thought she of all people had the right to call people fat. I don’t think she understood what I meant at first, so I said to her that she’s half my height and probably twice my weight. Between the two of us, she’s the heffer.

299,Not the A-hole,"So, for my whole childhood, my hair has been kind of a sore subject for me. My mother's always tried to ""play with"" my hair. She's claimed that the reason she had a girl was so she could play with her hair. 

If anyone is familiar with my posts, you'll know that my grandparents were my legal guardians for most of my childhood. So, when my mother wasn't playing with my hair, my grandmother was trying to make it neat and orderly. If you've ever had curly hair, you know that it's not exactly the type to stay organized. 

For my teen years, the process went like this: my grandmother would ask if I wanted to get my hair cut. I would say no. Two weeks later, my grandmother would tell me that she made made me an appointment at her salon. I would say no. She would say 'you're going'. I'd go, and I would tell the hair lady that I just wanted a trim, cause, well, I didn't want to be there in the first place. I would get it trimmed and my grandmother would be angry for the rest of the day, sometimes the rest of the week, that I ""didn't do anything"" with my hair and that I wasted her money. 

This went on from when I was 14 to when I left for college around age 18. I haven't been to a salon or let anyone touch my hair since then, with the exception of a Christmas present to my mother. 

I'm 23 now. I'm graduating next week. I really, really want a side-shave. 

I've almost developed a fear of hair salons, so this would be a big step for me. And I definitely want to do it. I love side-shaves. I guess I'm just debating on when I should do it.

If I do it after graduation, I never have to face my grandma. But I'll also never get to see her reaction. If I do it before graduation, it'll upset her and could cause a lot of problems.

Idk, I guess I'm just on the fence about it, about whether causing all these problems  is justified, or if I'm just being a spoiled brat.",52,190,0.91
300,Not the A-hole,"I (25m) have been best friends with James (25m) since 6th grade. He was once in an abusive relationship with a girl we'll call Ella. She accused him of cheating, stole his phone to unfriend girls, isolated him, even got physical, digging her nails into his arms/pushed him as hard as she could. When we got the chance to hang out, the conversation was always about Ella and we never got to have fun. Our friends got bored and drifted away, but I knew that abusers isolated victims, so I stuck with him.

This led to 5 years of frustration. Every conversation was about how much he wanted to break up. I listened, offered advice. It was always ignored. Years in, I got tired. I had my own shit going on, deaths in the family, a sports injury that cost me a scholarship, but James never asked how I was. If he did, he'd barely listen and turn it back to Ella as soon as he could. Our friendship became strained, but eventually he broke up with Ella for real. We've been fine ever since; I chalked his selfishness at that point up to the abuse.

Nine months ago, he started dating a girl he met at work. Beth is sweet, and very kind. She also happens to be incredibly boring. James is outdoorsy and likes adrenaline. He spends his weekends dirt biking or climbing. Beth likes to stay in and watch Netflix. She is also hard to engage in conversation. At first I thought she was just shy, but James has been complaining that she doesn't talk much or have a personality. She also has no sense of humour or at least not one compatible with ours.

I've kept my opinion quiet; she's nice and James has seemed happy, despite the occasional complaint. I've offered solutions; compromises, asking questions to start conversation, etc. But this weekend he asked me for my personal opinion. I told him I think she's boring and they aren't compatible longterm. James instantly agreed. This was a red flag; he used to agree with my opinion when it came to Ella, then later decided I was an asshole for criticising his girlfriend. But I thought we'd outgrown that.

James chose to break up with Beth. With the relationship over, I felt comfortable expressing my opinion. I pointed out the incompatibilities I'd noticed, and suggested she might be low intelligence hence the lack of conversation. I wasn't trying to be mean; I also said that she was a sweet girl and I wished her well.

Today, James told me the break up is off. He wants to propose. I'm irritated; I was short in my reply to his text. He asked what was up. I said I could see this becoming an Ella situation; not that Beth was abusive but I'll have to listen to him complain for the rest of my life. I told him I was tired of wasting my time offering input that goes ignored and I don't want to be made to look like an unsupportive friend for being critical of his partner. He told me I'm an asshole.

301,Not the A-hole,"First, some background info.

I have 2 younger siblings who I love very much. My sister suffers from  depression which she is getting professional help for. My brother has  Asperger's and ADHD. I have anxiety issues which used to be rather mild but have gotten a lot worse over the course of last year. My mom is generally a good parent, she makes sure to support my siblings while dealing with her own stuff at the same time (her parents both have cancer and she and my father are divorcing). My father does his best to help, too, but he works full time and isn't at home that much.

Now to the main story.

As I already said, my mother does a lot to support my siblings and helps them overcome obstacles in their lives, despite it clearly stressing her out a lot. She asks them how they are on a regular basis, does her best to listen to their problems and helps them out with things that they are having trouble with. I admire her for her strength. But I can't stop myself from thinking that she is forgetting me.

She never asks me how I am and doesn't help me with my problems. I know that this probably comes from the fact that I never was a problem child and all the problems I had didn't seem to big to overcome myself, which used to be true when I was still in school. But since I graduated, my anxiety has become so much worse that at this point, I can't see myself managing to keep my life together without a bit of support from my family, especially my parents. My dad does his best to listen to my problems, but he can't really do anything to actually support me as he isn't at home most of the time.

Whenever I try to tell my mom about my problems, she doesn't take me seriously and turns the conversation around to about her. I get that she wants someone to listen to her problems, too, but I wish that just once a conversation could actually be about ME and not about her. It's making me feel like I'm worth less than my siblings since she always listens to them.

On the other hand, I feel like absolute shit whenever I tell her how I feel about her treatment of me because I know how much she is going through right now and I don't want to give her yet another problem to worry about.

A few days ago, I was in a really bad mood for some reason and told her she didn't care about me and blamed her for not giving me as much attention as my siblings and making me feel worthless. She didn't say anything after that, which is very unusual for her and I could see in her eyes that what I said had deeply hurt her. I immediatly felt like the biggest asshole on the planet and wanted to apologize right away but couldn't because only seconds after I had finished talking she turned around and left the house.

302,Not the A-hole,"For a seminar class, my classmates and myself were put in groups where we had to create an online presentation and an accompanying video, and I ended up as the leader. 

In any group project, there’s always one person who gives you issues from the start. This girl, C, didn’t want to download WhatsApp and join the group, even though the rest of the group was on there. I sent weekly emails to everyone to reinforce what I had said in the group chat, until it became redundant to do so because she wasn’t replying AT ALL. 

I fell into a bout of health issues and was hospitalized twice, but I maintained constant communication with my group detailing what I was working on and where we should all be. It took some time, but we came out strong, the rest of the group finished the presentation, and I dedicated my efforts to the video. 

THE LITERAL DAY THE ONLINE PORTION WAS DUE, C emails me and says she was in a car crash but still wants to continue as part of the group. I tell my group this so we can democratically decide what we want to do, and we vote to keep her in. I give her ONE THING to work on, and I go as far to provide links to our online discussions which she had available to her, but never checked, and a few hours later, she submits an awful piece of work that essentially has nothing to do with all the collaborative efforts my group has made over the past 16 weeks. I email her and I tell her to please double check the online resources in which the entire group had come to decisions and she replies with, “I don’t think it’s fair that you don’t send that to the teacher and make me fail the class.” At this point, I was in the hospital and after undergoing a lot of tests and I was over everything, and I rashly replied, “I don’t think it’s fair that you’ve contributed nearly nothing to this project, so I too, will speak to her.”

I let my professor know what C said to which professor replied, “She had a major accident and was out for three weeks, she wasn’t at home.” I explained to her that while I understood, I unfortunately had 0 knowledge of this and had health issues of my own, but I made sure to let everyone know and still kept working. 

I genuinely felt like an asshole for saying that but this project is 25% of everyone’s grade and her swooping in at the last moment after not speaking to us for 16 weeks honestly felt like such a punch to the gut. Especially to me. So, AITA?

Update: my sister is a better (or at least, more conflict avoidant) person than I am - and based on these comments, also than most of y’all. She didn’t spoil the movie; instead she put in headphones herself to try to ignore the situation and listen to an audiobook (apparently could still hear the movie through her headphones) until eventually someone in the row ahead snapped and screamed at the woman, at which point she *finally* took headphones out of her bag and put them in too.

309,Not the A-hole,"Edit: There is no and never has been a dinner to go to. The dinner never existed for the family. Only in my sister's head. That's the point of the post

In a couple of weeks, I will be traveling with my family for her graduation from university. She has a boyfriend she met there; we already met him when she brought him home for Christmas. For this graduation, his parents will also be there and both families are going to meet and greet. The university has a lunch event planned for graduates and their families so the original plan is/was to have the meet and greet be during that lunch.

Afterwards we would part ways since our family has a road trip early next morning on Monday. It was initially discussed between my family that there would be a dinner too, with them, that same sunday, but it was discarded since my mom doesn’t eat at night, and we had to get up kind of early as well.

So anyway, I started looking at bars near the hotel and calling to see if any would be hosting a GOT finale showing so I could attend and go home. Nobody was doing it. So I texted my sister asking her if she could help, and she said she could go with me if I wanted to and that her friends also watched the show so I could watch with them and she’d be there, and then she asked me to call her. So I did, and that’s when she sprung this unplanned dinner (with her bf and his family) on me saying it would be very important if I attended instead of watching the finale. I said I wanted to watch the finale and that we would be meeting her BF’s parents for lunch as agreed and that this finale was important to me.

I called my parents over to ask if they knew this was happening and my parents had no idea either, they just knew of the lunch event, as did I. And we said we had agreed on lunch but not dinner. My sister got really mad, said she had to go and hung up, and that was that. I had to go to bed for work early next morning.

Last night I was talking to my parents and they said they had a long talk with my sister regarding this fight and that she is very hurt about how I acted and that I need to apologize to her. But I feel that a total surprise event that was previously agreed on to not happen is not fair, and I do want to watch the finale for a show I’ve been watching and waiting on for years. Especially since I won’t be at home to watch it where I usually do. The family had already said there would be no events during the finale so I got my hopes up and started planning around it and I could do this by myself since I wasn't driving next morning. I don’t think it’s fair either that first she agrees to help me plan how to watch it and then suddenly turn around and get mad for throwing me a curve ball. AITA?",85,123,0.89

Edit: I'm gonna look for a speech therapist when I get the chance.
___

So I[27M]'ve been stuttering for as long as I can remember, and I've always made do with it. Depends on the fatigue and the day, if I'm angry or stressed out, but most of my daily life it doesn't really impact me negatively cause I've learnt to make do. 

By that I mean that I know the word that I'm gonna stutter on while making the phrase in my head, before saying that word. This leads me to have to change my incoming phrase's phrasing mid-sentence to use a different word that I'm not gonna stutter on. I've learnt to do this mental gymnastics since I was a kid, so as to stutter as little as possible if I can avoid it, but it is mentally exhausting in the long run. I've gotten pretty good at it and I now know not to use certain phrasings, but it can still be a pain at times. 

But honestly for the very most part, I've been fine with it, I always speak my mind even in public even if I have to stutter along the way, I'll still say what I have to say. I joke about it with great pleasure the same way I joke about pretty much anything.

When my stutter comes about in conversations, people often ask if I've ever been to a speech therapist to which I tell them I had seen one as a kid, but it didn't work out after the one session although I didn't remember the why or the how of it. That was the memory I had of it.

Untill today when I was thinking about this and asked my mom why the one session with the speech therapist did not work out. Well turns out the guy was no speech therapist at all, he was an orthodontist.You see my teeth were quite fucked up growing up so my parents, on medical advice of our dentist, were looking into maybe putting some pieces of metal in my mouth to straighten the whole lot of them. The guy's prices were outrageous, my parents were pretty poor at the time and could not afford it as it was only considered cosmetic by the Social Welfare and wasn't reimbursed.

So anyways, I had mixed the orthodontist guy with a speech therapist. (I guess both of them have got to do with the mouth so...?) They told me they didn't think my stutter was that bad growing up and they didn't think it was necessary for me to see a speech therapist.

I didn't want to upset my mother about all this cause she's undergoing cancer treatment at the moment so I left it at that and just said ""oh ok no problem"", but I can't help but feel upset about it. I've always been mostly fine with it, but at the same time I thought that there had actually been a try to do something about it.

Am I being childish for being a lil upset?

313,No A-holes here,"Tldr; I got shamed in school for cancelling a motorcyclist who's a female, called sexist by everyone. (Please read the whole thing if you have the time, thx)

So in my country, there's this service we can order with our phones that can call Ubers but you could also use motorcycles. 

Most of the time, the other end who's accepting is a male.

During dismissal, I sat down with a few ""friends"" and ate together in this canteen. I ordered my ride since it was getting a bit late, and saw that it was a female. The fact that it was a motorcycle means that I have to be a few inches away from that person.

I'm fine being with people whom I recognise, but when it comes to strangers, I get a bit uncomfortable. I wanted to cancel, saying that I was uncomfortable. One of my friends saw this and shouted; (F for friend, M for me)


F: ""Dude wtf! Don't you feel bad!""

M: ""I do, but I get really uncomfortable being around a female who's a stranger...""

F: ""You're so fucking sexist. You're why women can't work.""

M: ""But I don't think that's what it mea-""

F: ""Just don't cancel it...""

I didn't cancel, I went through with it.


The next day, when I reached school. A few people stood near the entrance and started saying how I was really sexist. Everyone I passed said so. And I really didn't appreciate it. Luckily, it's been 2 weeks and barely anyone calls me that. But I kept thinking about that event thinking if I really was being sexist.

So reddit, am I the antagonist?

Edit 1:
I am uncomfortable with all strangers. But I usually find males easier to approach. But when females do share my interests, I try to befriend them. One of my bestfriend is an anime lover, and she's one of the best person I know.

Ps. I'm 15, male. Just a heads-up

It's 4 times more expensive using cars than bikes. I'm trying to save up.

315,Asshole,"Hello everyone!This happened a week ago and is still affecting my daily life.

So, my girlfriend got suddenly sick where she was diagnosed with some problem in her uterus. The pain was quite bad but was supposed to go away within a week. I brought her to the doctor and spent all day with her. The next day however, I had plans with my best friend who has moved away to a different city, I had not seen him since half a year and that day was the only day I could see him before he travelled away again. We made the plan to meet a while ago. The day I was going to meet him I asked my girlfriend if she needed me to prepare her dinner, or buy any other groceries that would ease her pain. She felt betrayed that I was leaving her and started a fight. I left because I really wanted to see my friend before he left. I sent her several messages asking if she was okay, and she did not respond. When I got back home she was pissed at me for leaving her and said that she was considering to break up with me. I apologized and I said I will take care of her next time. She didn't let it go immediately and was mad for many days.

Fast forward to today, she is very well now. I have plans with a couple of my friends and she is still making me feel guilty about leaving her. I told her that I should be able to see my friends whenever I want to without having to feel guilt. And now she is pissed again and left without saying anything. So reddit, am I the asshole for leaving my girlfriend when she was sick and leaving her today too?

UPDATE: For the people asking for information:

&#x200B;

I was gone for like 8 hours, left at 2 pm and came home at 10 pm. She has several friends that could visit her, and she has close family living 20 minutes away (her father) who could have taken care of her. However, she did not want her father to be the one taking care of her because she said it was an embarassing problem. I did ask her how she felt about me leaving, however she was really angered over the fact that I even thought about leaving, which did not lead to any proper conversation. We have been together for 2 years, recently moved in together.

316,Asshole,"The other day I was at a BBQ and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""I have a bone to pick with you"". I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""You don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah I might go too"" ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear. 


Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole?


Edit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid.

317,No A-holes here,"English is not my frist language, so I apologize in advance.

To start off, I recently bought a car (august 2018) and have had it since then. It's a decent car, drives well, nice tech and decent fuel economy but doesn't have the ""power"" of a car with a turbo (it's a Mazda 3 2.0 120hp naturally aspirated).

I'm a spontanious person by nature and I do and buy stuff off the bat when ever I feel like it (mostly minor stuff) and I normally dont ask permission from anyone. Sometimes I buy stupid shit, but I don't ask anyone for help financially because it's my own fault if I do.

When I bought the Mazda I did it way to rushed and didn't really think much about it. I didn't research anything about Mazda og asked anyone for guidance. I just bought it.. Done deal.

The last 4-5 months I've had bad feeling about the car not in a sense that the car is bad or is breaking or anything, but because it wasn't the car for me. This time i've done a whole lot of research and I've found a new car I want. It's within my financial limits (tight but manageable) and I REALLY want this one. 

My GF is not good with spontanious things in general. She likes things being planned ahead of time etc.
I presented her with my idea and we had a rather ""hefty"" argument about our future etc. She thinks that we wount be able to do anything in our spare time becuase the car would cost to much monthly.

I'm thinking on buying it anyway once the right deal presents itself. AITA for wanting to buy something that would, objectivly, make me happy?

I apologize if the story is incoherrent. Please ask for more INFO is its insufficient.

EDIT:
We do not share finances other than rent, food and household items etc.
EDIT2:
Thanks for the many different responses! There seem to be a misunderstanding when I said i didn't have a plan for my current car. I dont intend on keeping my current one but selling it for the right price.
The car i've been drooling over is a Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0t super 200hp from 2016. Older but more expensive than my current one.
EDIT3: We've talked about this and everything is all good now. I'll wait with buying a new car until the right conditions are met. She understands my POV and I understand hers.

I absolutely love playing video games and it's been a nightly routine of mine for quite some time. Lately my SO and I have been getting into it over the amount we, because they play as well with me, have been playing and say that we dont spend enough time together.

Now I would totally understand and get it if it weren't for the fact that my job is very high stress. My SO doesn't do anything work wise except sit around and work on their Art trying to make a career of it, but after almost 2 years of them not trying to sell anything and just telling me that they aren't ready I feel like I'm entitled at this point to enjoy my nights.

Now yes I am ok with them doing this to achieve their dream, but after spending all this time solo taking care of the bills and buying them various items of choice when I can, I feel that my time alone or my time that I can enjoy things is greatly hindered unless I spend my nights doing what I want.

320,Asshole,"So a few days ago i met a nice girl in vrchat. Got a girlfriend so it’s not going to be that kind of a story.

We spend some time in a karaoke room and she was a pretty good singer I have to admit. I am utter dogshit when it comes to singing so I’m mostly in that  room to listen to people instead of singing myself. We added each other as friends in vrchat and in steam. 
She told me that she is streaming from time to time.
I tried to stream for a brief period aswell but lost interest at some point. I asked about her setup and stuff like that and she told me her twitch name. I was pretty tired that day so I went to bed soon afterwards. The next day I got up and went to work. On the way I tried to check her twitch account but the twitch app didn’t work and I couldn’t look her up. I googled her twitch name to find her that way but it did not only show me her twitch it showed me her Facebook account aswell.

I have to admit that I was kinda curious, I’ve been a very very very small streamer with mostly 5-10 views but nonetheless somebody found my phone number, called me mid stream and send me dozens of sms and was annoying me. And I don’t share my phone number on the internet. So I was kinda surprised that she has never googled herself and saw this. I clicked on the fb link from google and found a post she made to an overwatch group advertising her stream. I looked at her fb account and luckily it doesent Show much beside her name and a picture.

Maybe I should have stopped at that point but i continued and googled the name she had on Fb.
The very first result was her full name, including her middle name and her complete adress. It was a Norwegian website  wich even showed a google earth picture of her house. Needless so say i would be careful if this stuff was easily found about me. Maybe you can find old football club pictures from me but not my whole adress.

I then messaged her telling her that her adress was super easy to find on the internet and that she maybe should write the website owner to take down her adress. If I was able to find all this in just a few seconds some people with more dedication could probably find even more.

At first she told me she doesent care and if she is becoming famous people would know her name anyway. Maybe I should have stopped there because, well it’s her life and her adress.
But I tried to convince her that privacy is important and stuff like swatting actually happens. This is not some sort of twitter account, it’s her adress. If I’d been some sort of fucked up person I could actually book a flight an visit her in about 3-4 hours. 

She then became were defensive and called me a stalker for looking all that up and telling her. I tried to explain that I found this basicly by accident and only wanted to inform her. She didn’t listen and continued to call me stalker and stuff like that.

323,Everyone Sucks,"So I have this friend (let’s call her Amy). We’ve been friends for a couple of years through uni and work. She is fun and positive and I considered her a good friend. 

To cut a long story short, I got offered a job teaching in the Pacific Islands as a teacher. 
Of course I accepted the job and told my family and friends - including Amy. All my friends joked about coming too and I always said “yes please come too!” knowing no one would. 
However Amy took it literally and then within the next hour she had sent her CV out to a bunch of schools - including the one I got offered a job at and then got a job there too. 
I was upset at first, and probably still am. This was a unique experience that I’d always dreamed of and I kinda wanted to keep it for myself. Selfish as that sounds but I worked my ass off and out myself out there for this job.

Fast forward to now and because the school pays for our accommodation, we three are living in a small apartment and me and Amy are working at the school. 
After three months here instead of being a nice and fun friend she now purposely excludes me from things she knows I would enjoy doing e.g. she has been playing my favourite sport without telling me so I wouldn’t try to join the team, she makes little digs at me constantly at home, she is super loud around the house and is always rushing around - she is a very intense energy to be around (my partner and I are super calm and quiet people). She’s also rude and demanding to the principal at work which is super embarrassing. 

Today after work I was so tired and excited to go straight to bed for a nap and I walked inside the house and she had a group of our colleagues around. They were all laughing, eating snacks and making cocktails. I got so upset that 1. I was so tired and I had to deal with people in my private space while feeling like that, and 2. I wasn’t invited to the party. 
I went to my room and shut the door and they all started whispering and laughing and ran upstairs.

It breaks my heart that I essentially invited her to come with us and she’s just making me upset or angry so much of the time. 

Am I being selfish or over the top?

My husband makes $10 working full time as a temp in a factory. We've been together for a decade and married for about four years. He knew that there was a strong likelihood that we would have to move after my degree program. Now that we're approaching that point, apparently I'm now restricted from going certain places because we have to be in a state that isn't too restrictive on guns, because that would be taking away his freedom. That leaves me with pretty much the deep South, the rustbelt, and a scattered array of other states where I'm probably not gonna be able to make a living. Most of the jobs that pay a living wage in my field are in big metro areas, VA, DC, and so on. Again, this was discussed. I also brought up the possibility of moving abroad, but apparently that made him super angry because he stormed off and accused me of being inconsiderate.

I love my guns too. Don't get me wrong. I don't particularly want to go where I can't have them, or am restricted from having certain things that I can have right now. It's not like I'm trying to move somewhere where we can't have them. The bottom line is, I have student loans to pay... and honestly, most of that went to keeping us afloat while he was in between jobs for a year (I found him the job he has now... I was going broke paying his half of the bills while going to school, and I couldn't take any more hours at work without failing because of my schedule), and that was on top of him need health insurance (I have the VA... I didn't need it. I'm basically having to pay for both of us to have insurance so he can even qualify for it). I would like to 
at least pay off those student loans so we don't have to spend our lives in poverty. I'm not asking him to do it. I'm not even asking for help. I'm asking to be able to get a job that allows me to do so. It would be one thing if he had a degree, or knew a trade, or something... Anything, really... But he doesn't. He hates his job, doesn't want to go to school. He has no aspirations to do anything at all that actually involves any more planning than what he's doing now. Am I the asshole for wanting a better life for both of us? And feeling like I should be able to go for that, since I'm pretty much the breadwinner here?

328,Not the A-hole,"So a bit misleading I guess, but my roommate calls it underwear. It gets pretty hot where we live, and we also live in a higher floor, so I tend to wear a sports bra and either shorts or leggings, because I’m lazy and don’t like to change or shower immediately after going to the gym. We have been living together for a couple of months now, and she has never minded before. 

Recently, she got into a serious relationship, to the point where he’s here more than half of the time. She told me she’s not comfortable with me “walking around in undies, half naked” while he’s here. But the problem is, he doesn’t pay rent. 

I don’t see why we have to have a new dress code just because she has a boyfriend, plus I don’t think he really cares anyway. He regularly works out at our university’s gym, so I feel like he’s used to seeing women in workout gear. I tried talking to her about it, and she’s saying I’m being an AH because it’s making her uncomfortable. 

I volunteer at an elementary that has a rigid dress code, and have an internship where I have to dress business casual. I just want to be fucking comfortable in my own place, and have told her this. I just feel like she’s being slightly insecure over nothing, because her bf has expressed 0 interest in me, and I in him. But, i guess it’s also not that hard to wear a shirt, so AITA?",159,538,0.93

1. Can't use it between 7:00pm and  1:00am.

3. No loaning out the Netflix or logging in at their friends houses.

They managed to break all 3 rules in 1 week, so I changed the password to the account and won't tell them.
They argue that they deserve it because my fiance ate with us sometimes when we were younger, and because they offered to pay for a plane ticket so she could go see her family.

I told my mom who I think the tickets should go to and she seemed fine with it until we found out my dad wouldn’t be able to make it because he doesn’t own a car and my mom doesn’t wanna go pick him up. I accepted that and said I’d just give the ticket to my uncle instead. 

The next day, my mom tells me she thinks her boyfriend should get the extra ticket instead. I said if my dad can’t be there, then neither could her boyfriend. I wanted my family to go celebrate my graduation not anyone else and now she’s been guilt tripping me like crazy because she said her boyfriends feelings are hurt.

Trying to keep this as short as possible.

I’m 33 and my brother is 23. He graduated with his computer science degree last December and asked if he could move in with me temporarily while he looks for a job. I said “Sure, as long as you pay me $75 a week.” A week later he flies to San Francisco from Florida and a week after that he lands a part-time job as a waiter. These last few months went pretty smoothly. He’s enjoying San Francisco, making lots of friends, and (with my help) polishing up his resume since he’s having a bit of trouble finding a tech job.

Before I go any further let me state that I’ve been cheated on by 2 different ex-gfs and therefore absolutely despise cheaters. My brother knows this.

To make a long story short last night I find out that my brother is cheating on his long-distance gf with a girl he met here. I show him the incriminating evidence and tell him to pack his shit and leave.

All day today I’ve been bombarded by texts from our parents asking me to let him move back in. Even after I explained the situation they said to let him move back in anyway because he’s family.

333,Not the A-hole,"Just want to preface this by saying my Mom’s on going cancer battle has killed quite a bit of the empathy I used to have, it’s been emotionally draining, and may have thrown my perspective on my girlfriend’s situation. 

My (29M) girlfriend (27) is from Southeast Asia, came to the US on a visa, and got a job at an apparel startup. I met her about a month before her visa expired and she had been in contact with an immigration lawyer trying to get her into the H-1B lottery. The immigration lawyer botched the paperwork and missed the application deadline. She didn’t leave before the deadline and wouldn’t be able to re-enter the US for 3 years, which I didn’t think was so bad considering if she overstayed an additional 6 months, she wouldn’t be able to re-enter for another 10 years. She said even 3 years is too much of a setback and decided not to go back to her home country. She has been continuing to work at the startup, while also working on launching her own apparel business, already putting production orders in. Her boss has let her know that after year-end he will no longer keep her on as an independent contractor and must be on payroll, which she can now only do if she marries a US citizen. She has also hit roadblocks in setting her business up due to her immigration status. At this point the 6 month window has also passed, so if she leaves now she won’t be able to re-enter for 10 years. 

I have been dating her for 10 months now and about two weeks ago she started really pressuring me on getting married, which I’ve said is something that I’m not ready for right now. She says that getting married can solve all of her problems and has likened me to someone who has the cure for cancer and won’t give it to someone they love, which seems like her just trying to relate her situation to my Mom’s. She says that I’m the most selfish person she has ever met and that I’ve ruined her life. I don’t want to get married just to solve a problem, I want to get married because I am certain want that person in my life forever. In these past 10 months I haven’t spent enough time with her to know that, so I’m not willing to get married to her. 

Am I the asshole?

It’s a free service completely paid for by the state in which I live.  So I’m scheduled to see a new kiddo for the first time. I speak to the mom over the phone and everything is set for me to be there tomorrow. Once I get there, I see that there are no cars in the driveway and so I park there. No big deal, right? Not only are the parents not home at all, mom forgot I was even coming. Mind you, I spoke to her yesterday, but whatever. So their daughter answers the door, calls her mom, and then says their dad is on his way. Cool, I wait a couple of minutes inside and meet the kiddo I’m supposed to treat. Out of nowhere this dude comes barging and he is completely unhinged. He is livid that I parked in his driveway. He asks if it’s proper “protocol” to park in driveways. It takes me a second to process wtf he’s talking about, so I just politely apologize and move my car to the street. I come back in to try and do my job. Dude picks up his son, and says “ this is a bad first impression, I think you should leave and try again. At this point, I’m so confused. So I just apologize, pack up my therapy toys, and leave.

335,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I met for lunch and he got a phone call from a number he didn’t recognize. Mostly we both ignore these types of calls because they’re usually telemarketers and such, but he answers it. Anyway, he says it’s our bank calling and our account has had fraudulent activity. My husband starts giving out his name... address... zip code. I vaguely remember the bank calling us before about fraud stuff, but I don’t remember all the details being necessary. I whisper to him “sounds like a scam to me” and he ignores me and continues on. When he keeps telling them stuff I tell him not to give them his pin, because a real bank wouldn’t ask for the pin. I’m ignored mainly, but he says something about how they’re just trying to help and he wouldn’t do that. I’m waiting, getting hungry, and getting more suspicious. He asks if he can use the mobile app to check the fraud activity and they say no. At the point I’m super suspicious and want him to hang up. All of a sudden he’s saying his pin out loud and telling them codes getting sent to his phone!! As if the bank would ask!! I show him a google search result that says banks won’t ask for your pin and he refuses to hang up, saying they need more info to send us a replacement card and how our online account will be inactive for a while, not suspicious at all right? I finally mute his phone and tell him to hang up it’s a scam. Finally he hangs up, and I compose myself and say call the actually bank and try and get the cards shut off. This takes some time so we’re both hungry and I’m a little peeved he ignored me and fell for something so obvious. Luckily I have 20 dollars in my wallet so we go to have lunch. When we finally sit down I kinda jab into a bit, I said “what were you thinking!, I can’t believe you fell for that and ignored me”. He gets super flustered and said “don’t you think I’m mad enough at myself!! Why do you have to rub it in”. So we eat the rest of the meal without saying much and later when we get home from work I mention how I feel disrespected for him not listening to me, he’s super annoyed I keep bringing it up and says everyone makes mistakes and how I should let it go. I try and make some jokes, but these just make the situation worse. Anyway, AITA for not just letting it go and making it about disrespecting me? I’ve certainly fucked up before and he doesn’t rub it in my face, but come on! Giving your pin away to a stranger on the phone?

Edit: wow, I usually don’t use reddit and wasn’t expecting such a response. Thanks for the practical advice on what to do for protecting ourselves, it’s really helpful. Things are uneasy today (just happened yesterday) but in general he did apologize for messing up which is nice, but I still don’t think he cares much about disregarding me trying to help which sucks. For people asking yes he’s fallen for other things before, but never anything so serious..

336,Not the A-hole,"I was at a restaurant the other night with some friends from out of town they weren't frequent to the area and we decided to take them to this very nice join exclusive to the city. It's a pretty standard night until a family walks of 5 walks in and is seated about 2 tables away from us. The 3 kids are all younger than 7 there's a 2 year old, a 4 year old, and a 5 year old. The 2 year old is crying about who knows what and the 4 and 5 year old are bickering very loudly. It took them all about 5 mins to really get on my nerves I didn't want to cause a scene by confronting the parents directly so I talked to an employee about getting a different table but we were a party of 6 so unfortunately we couldn't be accommodated the employee however tell us she would talk to the family which we saw her do. Not even another 5 minutes goes by and the 4 and 5 year old are smacking the table loudly complaining about them being hungry and keep in mind they're being quite loud and the parents are doing fuck all about it. I decided to not say anything to anyone because I figured that the staff would handle it, I was wrong. The kids are still arguing very loudly and at this point I decide to go back to staff and let them know what's going on. Apparently they have received other complaints from people and they we're ""attending to the matter"". We were eating at a nicer restaurant so you'd figure this kind of commotion wouldn't be a problem it wasn't even a place people normally bring their children to. about 10 minutes goes by we have our food and the kids start acting up again I saw the 5 year old smack the 4 year old which started a scene and very loud crying. The 2 year old started crying as well and left the booth and somehow got to out table and latched onto my friend's leg. One of the staff members was already on their way as well as one of the parents. The parent is trying to grab their child and one of the staff members asks if everything is ok. At this point I'm furious, ""Does everything look okay to you, we are trying to enjoy a night out right now just like everyone else here but unfortunately none of us can do that with these children causing a commotion."" The parent who's has their child in hand now is trying to ""apologize"" saying that they want to enjoy a night out too and they were sorry about their kids. I get up and let them know that this isn't exactly a place for children to be. At this point I see what I assume is the manager who tells the family that they have to leave. Now the family is upset that they're being kicked out and look at me and say, ""thank you for ruining our night I hope it was worth it."" Once they left everything was smooth sailing. But the mother was on the verge of tears when she had to leave and the father was to busy trying to calm down his kids. I don't know if I was a prick by targeting them like that.

338,Asshole,"I am currently holding my beautiful month-old daughter and reflecting on the fact that I haven’t spoken to my brother-in-law or sister-in-law since she was born and am starting to wonder if I’m the one at fault.

My wife and I are living in different cities while I pursue a job opportunity (around 90 minutes apart). She went into labor 3 weeks early at 4am and texted and called me to get to the hospital ASAP. Unfortunately, I had accidentally muted my phone so it wouldn’t ring or vibrate and missed many calls, texts, and voicemails from her between 4am and when my alarm went off at 8am. However, those were not the first messages I saw when I woke up. Apparently, my wife had texted her family joking about the unfortunate situation where I was not awake and her sister in a different time zone was awake enough to text me “Your wife is in labor and delivery. Get your ass up now. You have one job. Show up.” Suffice to say, not the friendliest way to find out I was about to become a dad. I also saw her husband had emailed me to say that I “was about to catch hell” if I didn’t start responding to my wife. I called my wife quickly and was able to get to the hospital hours before the baby was born but have been waiting on an apology for their rudeness since then. The way I saw it, they had three possible justifications for reaching out in such a dicky way:

1. They thought I was sitting and ignoring my laboring wife but would listen to them if they texted.
2. They thought their phones were magic and would wake me up when my wife’s wouldn’t.
3. They knew I wouldn’t see the messages until I woke up, and thought I deserved to find out in a shitty way because I had overslept.

None of these seem like good reasons to me but the apology is clearly not coming, and my wife is pressuring me to resume contact with them. Neither has reached out to me in the weeks since the birth but have complained about me to my wife ad nauseum about my failure to update the family while we were in the hospital and when we got home. (I have been keeping in touch with her other sister who texted me congratulations that morning instead of berating me).

Am I the Asshole for not wanting to speak with them until they apologize?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Because a couple comments have been asking: My phone has a notification slider that goes ring-vibrate-mute. When I went to bed that night I accidentally switched it from vibrate->mute when I meant to switch it from vibrate->ring. Completely boneheaded mistake but my wife understood immediately that that's what mustve happened and forgave me for it. Also, I found out when I got to the hospital that my SIL had been sending a lot of ruder messages about me to my wife which also motivated me not to reach out. They've been in touch since the birth, just not with me. 

&#x200B;

I also reached out to my BIL this morning thanks to the feedback last night. I still have no motivation to speak to the SIL who is just badmouthing me everytime she talks to my wife. Thanks for all the input!",146,151,0.9
339,Not the A-hole,"So one of my duties at my job is to work check-in at a medical office. Cindy is the coworker in question. Cindy was hired back in January to be check-in. The check-in desk has always been a shared space because the staff must cover check-in in the event someone calls in or an employee has to leave to another satellite office. Five other employees potentially use “her” workspace. 

About 1 month ago, Cindy got moved from the check-in desk to learn check-out and because she has been terrible (which I won’t get into) at check-in despite months of training. I have taken her place at check-in. 

She has had several small children’s toys the size of my thumb that are maybe worth $0.15 sitting directly in front of a card scanner, obstructing it. She never had to use the scanner because the software to use it was never installed on her computer profile. On the contrary, I constantly use it to scan patient’s insurance cards. Being an extremely busy office, you can imagine the frustration when you have to be careful not to knock the toys over while scanning cards which slows you down. Finally, in the middle of an extremely busy day, I got fed up trying to work around these toys and I put them in the drawer before I had to leave for the afternoon.

When I came in the next day, the supervisor told me that after I left, Cindy had stormed over to the check-in desk while a coworker was with a patient at the window and was snatching her things and forcefully slamming the drawers. Our coworker even asked Cindy, “Can you please not do that now? I’m with a patient.” She didn’t care and she continued her tantrum. (Supervisor’s words.) 

I didn’t think much of it yet when I told Cindy that I had to leave a document on the desk she was at so she’d know not to move it she remarked, “Oh I won’t move it. I don’t touch other people’s things.”

She’s made comments like, “It’s MY desk.” Even though she hasn’t sat there for weeks. 

TL;DR AITA for moving her toys?

My family has lived all over, but never anywhere close to our extended family. To top it off, she has had alzheimer's for almost two decades, and has been a husk for most of that. Needless to say we haven't really been close. I love my immediate family and my extended family. We are all on good terms. I can't stress that enough.

Now, I have worked for years to graduate. Not just 4 years, more like 7. I fell into a depression early on in college. I flunked out and was homeless for a bit. I got myself together and made a lot of sacrifices to get to where I am today. I had support from my family, and I always made time to support them. I would drive an hour each way to help out if they needed anything. I would go back to take care of my sister if my Dad was out of town and my Mom was at work. Once I got a good paying internship, I would spot them money to help pay for my sister's summer camp, and so much more.

Now, I have not been a needy or outwardly emotional son. I try to get on without lashing out when something goes bad.

341,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend (""Ben"") and I have been dating for about a year and a half and, for the most part, have a great relationship. He’s a bit socially awkward, but he’s generally kind and sweet. He’s studying to be an engineer, and this semester he got an internship in a city several hours away from where we live.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, he texted me saying that a group of interns made plans to go to a strip club, and he asked what my opinion would be about him going. He told me that three women from the office would be joining the mostly male group, which I found reassuring for some reason? Either way, I appreciated that he reached out to me, and told him that I didn’t mind if he went (which was absolutely true at the time).

&#x200B;

That night, he texted me with occasional updates about what was going on, which I hadn’t asked for, but, again, appreciated. Things seemed pretty normal until I got a message saying that a female coworker (Sue) was dancing on the pole. Moments later, I got a message saying that she had taken her top off.

&#x200B;

I didn’t get any messages for the remainder of the night because his phone died (which I learned later). To me, this felt much worse than it would have if he’d chosen to not text me about the event at all. The next day, he told me that the internship coordinator had organized this event and had paid Sue good money for her strip tease. Ben reassured me that that Sue’s tits are “bigger than \[mine\], but not as nice.” Gee, thanks!

&#x200B;

I was angry, and I told Ben as much. I was pissed at him for not telling me that his phone was about to die and for thinking that complimenting my breasts would make me feel better. I was pissed at Sue stripping for her coworkers. I was pissed at the internship coordinator for being a skeeve and taking advantage of an intern.

&#x200B;

Ben told me that it was okay to be pissed at him and the internship coordinator, but I shouldn’t “slut shame” Sue. I agree that the internship coordinator deserves the bulk of of the blame, but Sue is an adult who made her own decisions. I told him that this wasn’t about her being a slut (..mostly) — this was about her being a young engineer who behaved extremely unprofessionally. I believe I have the right to privately judge her (though I guess now it’s pretty public).

&#x200B;

Anyway, I told him that I would prefer if he not go to another strip club with his fellow interns. He said okay.

&#x200B;

That evening, to my surprise, I got a call from his mother. She said that men in Ben’s profession are expected to go to strip clubs, and it could potentially damage his career if he avoids these events. I told her that I wasn’t interested discussing this with her. Now I’m also annoyed that he roped his mother into this, but I feel like that’s another topic entirely.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here for either 1) Reacting the way I did regarding what happened at the strip club or 2) Not wanting him to go to another one?

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are curious about why going to a strip club would be normal, and the only explanation I can think of is that it's located in Las Vegas... but I'm not sure that's a great reason. Ben's dad used to work there, and apparently went to strip clubs regularly with his coworkers.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thanks for all of your responses. A lot of people are pointing out that it was childish for him to call his mom, which I agree with (and yet here I am telling the internet). Maturity/independence is definitely something that has been an issue in our relationship.

Another example of that: He's now telling me he's worried that he'll have a hard time saying no if they ask him to go again, because he wants his coworkers to think well of him and he doesn't have anyone else to hang out with. I told him that he can just tell them that his girlfriend is a controlling bitch if it comes up. Boy am I excited for this internship to be over.",97,188,0.91
342,Not the A-hole,"My brother is getting married in June.  His fiance and I have never gotten along,  but last month she asked my wife if our sons would be ring bearers.  She made very specific demands about what clothes they should wear, which would have cost several hundred dollars if my wife hadn't found more affordable alternatives.

When my parents pushed back on her attempts to get them to pay for the wedding, instead of just the rehearsal dinner, she picked a ludicrously expensive venue, where the average entree starts at $30, and then got mad when my dad said he wouldn't pick up the bar tab.

For the past few years, my brother has been MIA for all important family gatherings, and can't even be bothered to return the occasional phone call or text.

For a little context, I'm a 17 year old girl who is moving away to university next year, so I needed to open a student bank account. When I went to the bank, a banker asked me to come into his office to get the process started. The first 15 minutes went okay, but then he started asking me questions like, ""Have you had boyfriends before"", and when I said yes, he asked ""What's the creepiest thing you've done with your ex?"". I don't know how that was related to the process but I was a little oblivious so I just said, ""Oh haha, I don't know"". He then proceeded to ask me if I was a virgin, and upon my saying yes, he told me that it was a good thing and I need to preserve my purity. Now, people have said weird things like this to me before, but never in a professional setting such as a bank. In hindsight, I know I was a dumbass for not saying anything, but idk I guess I just wanted to get it over with. Some time went on, and after a while he asked if my prom was coming up. I told him it was, and then he said, ""if you want to make your ex jealous, I can show up looking slick in a limo"", and ""I can even be your date to graduation"". I said, ""no, but thank you"". Finally, at the end, he asked me where I wanted to work, and I replied SpaceX, and he was like ""oh did you say sex?"", and then he saw his boss walk by and told me to shut the door. At this point, I told him that's okay, I need to leave pretty soon and to please speed up the process if that's possible, and then left as soon as the process was finished. 

Anyway, so I went home and wasn't going to tell my parents but eventually did a couple days after, because my friends told me that I should since this was sexual harassment. I was afraid to tell my dad, but he always tells me that I can tell him anything and that I should always trust him. So I did, and I told him I absolutely do not want to do anything or press any charges or such. He said okay and, if it matters, he didn't seem very mad. Like it didn't seem like it but I guess he was. 10 minutes ago, he just told me that he went to the guy and talked to him, and he is probably getting fired. I got mad because I was pretty afraid to tell my dad exactly because of this, and I put a lot of trust in him and he totally turned around and broke his promise. I got angry at him, and yelled at him to leave me alone, and he stormed out of my room, slamming the door. My mom overheard, but she hasn't said anything.

I've now remarried and have a 1 year old daughter with my new wife and life is amazing, my wife is the mother of all 3 kids and hannah only knows my second wife as her mum due to her age. 
and jane calls my new wife real mummy. 

last week I got a phone call from my x wife, she wanted to see the kids and be apart of there life. I explained that hannah will not remember you and jane does not see you as a mom anymore. 

she keeps on pushing me to allow a meeting, so I told her she could meet them as a auntie or a cousin. she is refusing so I have told her she can't meet them.

347,No A-holes here,"Last year a new teacher came to my school. We'll call him Mr. R.

I didn't have Mr. R for any classes, but I liked hanging out in his room, and I'd sit in there and bug him during frees. We had, I guess, a cordial relationship, wherein I would come in and sit in dead silence until the period ended, and sometimes he would sit at the table with me and play country music.

I Googled him one day, as I am prone to doing. I've done this with all of my other teachers (so do all my peers; teachers of Reddit, take note) and generally have found nothing of interest. This was not one of those times.

I looked him up on Youtube and found his channel from when he was, like, 15 years old, and it was full of videos of him, clearly being 15 years old. Nothing incriminating, but definitely cringey, and something I wouldn't want public.

*And then I sent it to my friends.*

This was a dick move, and I instantly felt guilty. I still feel very guilty for that matter. Eventually, after several weeks, I told Mr. R that his Youtube account was public, and he told me it was fine, but made it private a few weeks later. I did not talk to him about it anymore.

Anyways, all that is just for context.

Some time passed. A girl in my grade told me that Mr. R has a music career and told me to look him up. I did, and I found his music, and listened to it, and liked it. Then I downloaded all that I could find for easier listening, and then I stopped looking it up, except for maybe like, refreshing his FB every few months to see if he'd uploaded anything new.

This was all last year.

About a month ago, I cracked under the stress of feeling like I was sneaking around behind Mr. R's back, and I asked him for the tabs to one of the songs. He told me a very strong no. Several days later, Mr. R pulled me aside and told me to not look him up anymore.

It's been a few weeks since then, and I still feel terrible about this, and I'm fairly confident Mr. R didn't like me too much in the first place, but he *definitely* doesn't like me now. I want to go and apologize to him for being creepy, but I also don't want to remind him of my transgressions. Was I being exceptionally creepy? Is he being overly sensitive? Am I overthinking all of this?

Before anyone asks, I'm seventeen, and I'm 99% sure he's 25.

348,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway so my friends don't see this on my reddit. 

Every once in a while, I get depressed. During this time, I take a weekend, turn off my phone, completely disconnect from the outside world, lock myself in my room, and eat pizza and ice cream while binging a series on Netflix. No idea why but, it makes me feel better.

Fun fact: ice cream makes me fart. A lot. Loud, smelly, gross farts. That's why I don't eat it. However, during these special times, I allow myself to indulge. Since they are my own farts, I don't really mind them. However, since I am locked away in my room, the smell starts to linger. After a day or two, it can be really bad. I literally lay around in a room that smells like fart and pizza. It's not attractive and it's sad but, whatever. Let me live my life.

Recently, I started dating a new girl. I texted her at the start of my weekend that I would be unavailable and I needed two days to myself. No problem. On Saturday, one day into my fiesta, I'm chilling on my bed and she walks through the door. Apparently, she was worried and decided to show up unannounced. Immediately when she walked in, the smell hit her.

She was grossed out and went into the living room. Since I was ""caught"", I decided to explain - a simplified version of what I wrote above. Then, she started lecturing me about mental health, suggested that I see a therapist, etc. I told her to leave. She did but started crying because she thought I was breaking up with her. At that point, I honestly couldn't handle anymore discussion and wanted her out so I told her I'd text her later but she had to leave. Now she isn't speaking to me.

349,No A-holes here,"So I started dating this girl about a little over a month ago. Overall it's been pretty good but one weird thing. Whenever we're talking or intimate she really likes making eye contact and I hate it. It's nothing against her or anything I just find it super uncomfortable to make eye contact with anyone, is that weird?

She says that not making eye contact is indicative of hiding something and that it makes her feel like I'm not trying to be vulnerable with her. I feel for her, but I find the idea of making eye contact with anyone super weird and creepy

Am I the asshole here? I dont want to make her feel bad but I've never heard of someone wanting to make eye contact unless they're like interrogating you. I know in movies they do that deep staring into eyes thing but I thought that was just movie overdramatization. 

For reference I'm 21 she's 19, I will admit some of the other issues we've had are also based around intimacy, she likes holding hands, I'm not a fan, she likes having lots of sex and making out etc and while I enjoy at times nearly not as much.

352,Not the A-hole,"[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)

So my sister's wedding was today. I took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and I are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. She stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn't welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn't allowed after ""what he'd done to her"", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. I just calmly kept telling her that if she didn't want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. 

I guess she thought I wasn't being serious, because I got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where I was. I told her I wasn't coming. I got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew I was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. I ignored them all, though I did text mum and apologise for causing problems but I *did* inform my sister I wouldn't be going. Culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. They got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. Apparently I've ruined her wedding day, but I'm really struggling to care. Maybe that makes me now the asshole, I can accept that. 

Just thought I would share this update, since I posted about it here initially.

ETA: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.

First the whole ""she got rejected by my boyfriend"" thing. This one is my fault, I thought I'd included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! Essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don't blame her he's hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y'all got triggered) and was told no. She's held a grudge ever since - I think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he'd said he wasn't interested i her. He was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. 

Second, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. This is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. I'll clear up that we've *never* has a good relationship, and she's been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since I was very small. She's also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. This is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it's caused.",858,13543,0.96
353,Not the A-hole,[deleted],23,35,0.85
354,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds bad. Throwaway because main is too easy to identify. I manage a restaurant serving a specific kind of Asian cuisine in a very multi cultural city. I understand tipping varies by culture, but generally a 10-20% tip is standard in the US. Ask any server, if you can’t afford the tip, you can’t afford the meal. We have a family that happens to be from the same country whose food we serve, and they’ve been coming in for some time now. Usually 4-6 people. They ALWAYS have special requests, whether it’s something from the dinner menu at lunchtime, substitutions, something made a certain specific way. We ALWAYS do our best, but they always nitpick, always mumble something about “traditionally”, and need to be checked on CONSTANTLY. My servers have begun to complain, since they rack up a $100-300 and tip a big fat zero. Me and the other managers have had heated discussions about possibly banning them, and I’m on the fence about it. Would we be the assholes for banning a notoriously difficult group that never tips?

EDIT: as per our city laws, we pay our employees above minimum wage and the tips don’t factor into their wage. Tips are on top of regular pay.

EDIT 2: the owners trust us and are aware of the situation. This is an issue of staff morale, not about whether or not our employees make a livable wage. 

EDIT 3: hopefully this will clarify our issue. Our employees are paid a livable wage independent of their tips. The big issue here is that on a bill so high, the server loses money due to kitchen/support tip out, and because I can’t blame my servers for not wanting to serve a difficult table that doesn’t tip, when there’s plenty of other tables that do.

EDIT 4: while I do accept my judgement as being TA, I’d like to remind everyone that I’m a manager. I don’t get gratuity, I don’t care about the tips. This is about choosing either the happiness of my servers, or the business of an extremely difficult group of customers who my servers are always reluctant to serve. I’m not in control of my countries tipping standards. We do our best by paying a fair wage. Just lookin for some advice as a manager.

FINAL EDIT: needless to say, bigger response than I expected. I can understand where both sides are coming from, and while I do still feel somewhat like TA, I can’t justify my servers feeling disrespected for the sake of one table. Our restaurant is pretty busy, and one $300 tab won’t break us, as the owners told us when they handed over the decision to us managers. Our restaurant is also more on the upscale side, and our servers are very well trained as we are extremely selective in our hiring process. I spoke to one of the servers, and hearing more about the table I’ve decided that my stance (not the final decision as I still need to talk it over with the other 2 managers) is that I will allow servers to choose not to take them, try to get them some compensation if someone chooses to serve them, and if truly no one wants to, i think as a manager I’d be okay taking them myself, as I won’t be getting a tip anyway and it’d help me get a first hand look at what they’re really like. I don’t want to ban them, mostly because it’s not a conversation I’d like to have with a customer, I agree that it’s a severe move to ban a family that genuinely seems to enjoy the food (they’re in at least once per week), but they also will no longer get special treatment, which is the one thing I’ll be putting my foot down on. Lastly I’m going to try to suggest a tip sharing system where everyone gets their tips according to hours worked and not based off of what tables you get, as it’s probably more fair that way anyway. Unfortunately that’s the best I can do in the tipping culture that the US has, I don’t necessarily agree with it but at the end of it all I don’t have much control. We do what we can, but we can’t change the world. Yes it is your choice not to tip, but if you do that and disrespect my employees on top of it, I absolutely am gonna step in as I believe they are entitled to respect from their customers. Good employees are more valuable than disrespectful customers IMO. I’m not sure this post is big enough to warrant an update, but I can give one if you guys wanna know how my discussion with my comanagers goes, and how the customers’ next visit goes. Thank you guys for all the input.",241,235,0.87
355,No A-holes here,"I’m a swim coach for an age group (10-12 year olds) team. I’m the assistant coach to the 5’4 petite blonde head coach who uses the “you catch more flies with honey” approach, but when that fails, I (a 6’2, 200 lb facial haired guy) step in to play the bad cop to get their attention so she can explain the set, etc. This dynamic seems to maintain the attention of most if not all of the swimmers. 

Yesterday, we were working on backstroke, meaning the kids couldn’t see where they were in the lane, which resulted in numerous collisions between the kids. 

After seeing a couple collisions, I gave a quick spiel on on lane etiquette (staying as far to the right as possible) to ensure that no one got hurt. 

In doing so, I made the (what I thought was standard) “I don’t want you to get hurt because I don’t want to do the paperwork” joke. I get the usual tongue sticking out response with a few chuckles, and the collisions reduce. 

After practice, I get pulled aside by one of the parents who went on the explain on how two weeks ago her kid sustained a concussion at a sister facility (after he was running on the deck, that he’s been told not to 100 times). Apparently the staff there “handled it very poorly” and were “more concerned about the paperwork than the health of her kid” and hearing such jokes “makes her blood boil” and that jokes of the sort are “highly inappropriate” 

I listened, and pivoted the conversation to the health of her kid and if there’s anything that I should be watching out for. So, I never actually apologized, nor made any promises to never do it again. But obviously, I’ll watch my tongue around here.

357,Not the A-hole,"First I'd like to say that my husband and I don't argue often, and I wouldn't even call this situation much of an argument, but it has become a source of tension to be sure.

We live in a relatively decent neighborhood. There have never been any incidents at my house as far as break-ins or anything, but we do have a very tight-knit community, and as such, everyone kind of keeps an eye on everyone else. Starting about six months ago, some of the neighbors started noticing a young guy stalking around late at night, kind of casing the place. There were a few instances of cars being broken into and one night, everyone's mail boxes were opened an emptied . It became enough of a situation that non-emergency was called and we all filed a joint report.

An investigation (along with other tips, I'm sure) lead to a house in the neighborhood being raided and the guy was found and arrested for dealing.

Last week, my husband was taking a nap (middle of the day, sun was out) and I was out in the living room, and someone knocked on the door. I checked the peep hole and saw that it was a woman, clearly doing some sort of sales (we're plagued by solicitors because we aren't in a gated community). We have a German Sheppard and she was going crazy, barking up a storm (good guard dog!) because someone is at the door, so I open it (keeping the security gate closed and locked) to tell the woman we're not interested and she moves on. 

My husband was furious and told me that it's not safe for me to answer the door, because it might be someone from the drug dealers crew coming to rob us.  He went on to express that he prefers I never answer the door, and if we're both there, to just let him do it.

He's always been a bit paranoid when it comes to security, but this just takes it over the edge for me. I don't want to sit there for ten minutes waiting for the dog to calm down (she won't, until I show her the coast is clear), so what's the harm in opening the door in broad daylight when there's a perfectly sturdy security gate between me and whoever is on the other side? He's so serious about this situation and doesn't seem to understand why I'm annoyed, so I have to ask. AITA?",55,41,0.86
358,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend (M27) of eight years and I (F26) got engaged in November. We immediately chose the weekend of our nine-year anniversary in March 2020 for our wedding. We told most of our friends and family about our wedding date pretty early on, and started putting deposits down on everything from the venue to the dj and the photographer (we're paying for everything on our own).

Fast forward to two weeks ago and his cousin (F30) gets engaged as well. Long story short, she's decided to hold her wedding on the weekend directly before ours, despite knowing about our wedding plans. Her explanation was that no other weekend worked well for them between work and other conflicts.

Now normally this wouldn't be such a big deal, but we all live pretty far from the rest of their family. My fiance and I live in the South, his cousin lives in the Midwest, and most of the rest of their family lives in the Northeast. Since we'll both be getting married locally, this means that the family will have to travel pretty far distances two weekends in a row to attend both weddings. They'll also likely be tired and less enthused to be attending a second wedding in so short a time, assuming they can even show up for our wedding between the expenses of traveling, taking time off of work, and their health.

It's especially hurtful to me because I've known them for so long and I was looking forward to becoming a member of their family. But there seems to be a sentiment on the part of some people that our wedding just isn't as important because my fiance is *only* the groom and who cares about me. Meanwhile, his cousin is a bride and she should get whatever she wants. On top of that feeling, we really put ourselves out there by planning this wedding. I have a strong aversion to big parties/event planning, but we thought it was important that we include the whole family, so we planned out this big wedding. (And of course, now we're also going to have to worry about our wedding being directly compared with theirs and not stacking up.)

360,Not the A-hole,"About 6 months ago he stopped coming home at night.  He was out 4 days a week. Often hed come home at 11am, 2pm etc, high on drugs with an opened box of condoms in his pocket. (They were old,  they're his friends,  they were free at the bar so he took them,  etc) He was always pretending to poop so he could text this girl all the time (she's just my friend)  After realizing this was not a temporary phase and I wasnt being jealous/ridiculous, I requested he move from my home.  

The crying and pleading started. He was sorry. He would do the right thing.  He loves me. 🙄 Shockingly, none of that was true. (I know)  So I gave him 30 days. He only came here to throw dirty clothes on the floor, take an occasional shower or nap, change clothes, cook food... etc. He never cleans up after himself,  so I'll come home from work to a huge chore. It became a massive source of stress for me to never know when he would show up, what condition he would show up in,  and what mess he would leave me to find.  He would often show up in an unfamiliar drug induced rage, and would put his hands on me while I was asleep in bed. Once he tried to sexually assault me but apparently I need to chill since he couldn't actually do it.

The 30 days went by... the girl hes been 'dating' decided to break things off since she didn't want him moving in. Hes now wanting to stay another 30 days.  I can't do that for my own safety and sanity.

He won't get his things.  Instead he wants to keep his things at my place and stop in every few days to change clothes (aka throw filthy bar smelling clothes around my house, leave mounds of dishes,  and dirty the floor and new couch with muddy shoes) I can't do it. I've considered picking up a xanax habit to deal with the stress I have from this. 

Would I be the asshole if I washed his clothes,  neatly folded them and put them and his things in a suitcase and dropped it off at his work after the restaurant closed and its just his coworker buddies, no customers? I know it will embarass him. I don't want him to lose his job or anything. I just want him gone and that's the only way I think he'll understand I'm serious about this and that I'll be safe. 

I know I'm not the asshole for breaking up with him and kicking him out. But would I be an asshole if I calmly brought his things to his place of work after close?

Everyone says I'm not the asshole if I do this.  But would I look insane if I did this?  I would be mortified if my ex did something like this.  But then again,  I'd never cheat

Edit. Started throwing his shit in a suitcase without folding. He has cum filled women's underwear with skid marks and shirts covered in cum... washing and folding is out of the equation now. I'm going to barf. Thank you reddit for giving me the courage to actually rid this guy from my life

3 years down the drain. But at least I'm not dating someone that collects underwear with skid marks and cream pies on them. Definitely getting tested since this shows he hasnt been using condoms

Update. I thought I was being a huge ass by doing this.  Reddit just gave me the strength to do something mildly assholish yet 100% deserved. I didn't wash or fold any of it. I changed the locks.  I've blocked his number. And I'm about to spend an hour getting ready so I look fine as fuck when I drop his suitcase at the restaurant. I've decided to actually do it during business hours since theres less of a chance he will retaliate physically or chase me.

NEWEST UPDATE 

Thanks to reddit for giving me the courage to take a huge step in the right direction.  I probably would have dealt with his behavior for weeks. I did not wash or fold his clothing after finding some really gross things. I put it in a suitcase. Went to work. And politely asked for him.  He was busy so I said ""tell him his girlfriend brought him the things he asked for"" and left. I wanted it to seem more of a ""he asked me to bring this"" not a ""here's his dirty laundry"" (literally)

I guess hes dating one of his coworkers. She thought we broke up a year ago. So hes not having a very good night. And I guess the drama free drop off I thought I planned was anything but. 

Whatever. Hes out of my house. 

I've recieved threats, demands for money,  name calling, the usual when a shitty person realizes their luck ran out. He threatened my cat of all things. 

So, I ruined the ending of the avengers then blocked his number. Good riddance

My lock is changed. Some of my neighbors are aware. My friends are aware. I have cameras. 

Its just a waiting game now. I know that he will retaliate. Just not when.

361,Not the A-hole,"About a week ago. I got a call from my mother it was an average conversation talking about every day thing. “You know How’s life? how’s the weather over there?” in the middle of that conversation she casually mentioned that she signed my name to cosign a loan for her. I at first thought I didn’t hear her right. She continues going into the details of “Yeah. You have really good credit so I thought it would help.” 

I just stayed silent during most of the conversation not quite sure of what to say as she talked what she would use the $25,000 she would get for the bank for. The next day she sent me some papers because the bank required my signature and some information about me that she couldn’t give them. Explain to them that I’m kind of uncomfortable with this entire situation. To which she gets defensive about. Stating that there’s nothing about that I should be uncomfortable about. Seeing as I won’t be paying the loan. At this point I ask her what exactly she means to which she states that she just wants to use my credit so that the loan will get approved so that she’ll be able to get the money and then that she’ll pay it back by herself. At this point I tell her that just doesn’t really seem like a good idea because taking out money to pay bills Will just Garner you more bills. Which she probably gets angrier about sending me a string of messages saying how “Oh! Why I helped you with A,B, and C why can’t you do this for me?!” She’s been messaging me for days about the subject and I’m not entirely sure what to tell her or whether I’m the bad guy in this situation for not wanting to do this or whether that’s even legal just to use someone for their credit.

She is already an awesome aunt to my small daughter. The problem is that she NEVER stops mentioning that she's ""trying."" It has come up at every dinner, in every casual conversation, and in every context for three months and she's driving me batty. She talks about it anytime someone even mentions alcohol or a trip that would involve strenuous activity. For example, ""Oh, I wish I could have wine too, but you might as well drink it. It can't be in the fridge since *we're trying,* you know?"" I haven't said anything yet, but I might snap.

It's not just that she talks about it, either. She also already assumes that she is having trouble trying to conceive. She has, on several occasions, exaggerated the amount of time they've been trying to conceive. They started in maybe mid-February (I specifically remember because of some insurance stuff she had to work out first) and she claimed a few weeks ago that they've been trying for four months. That's literally not mathematically possible. She has also brought up  - more than once - that I had ""no trouble"" getting pregnant, since my daughter was unplanned (conceived just days after stopping hormonal birth control, and while using backup methods). She went so far once to accuse me of ""having it easy"" when she knows for a fact that I would rather have had a harder time, since I was not even trying. She makes me feel as though she is mad at me for getting pregnant so easily when, really, nothing she is experiencing is concerning. This is also the same person who told me, when I told her about the doctor's appointments, blood work, and minimal testing associated with my pregnancy, that she would not allow doctors to do those things to her, and she would just find a way around the mandatory testing. 

The average woman is told to try for at least a year before she seeks further help to conceive, even longer if she is younger than 35. Most doctors say it can take up to that long for your body to adjust after coming off of hormonal birth control, which she didn't do until they had everything else worked out - early to mid-February. 

I also have friends who have struggled - hard - with infertility. Miscarriages, multiple rounds of IVF, the works. I am angry for them every time she complains about how long it has been. One friend gave up after 9 years of trying, and another successfully had two children after multiple rounds of IVF and over 10 years of treatments. 

Also, ""We're Trying"" to me is like waving a flag that says ""We're having A LOT of sex and NOT enjoying it!"" 

I do not want to just snap and tell her to shut up about all of it. I want to be supportive and there for her. But would it make me an asshole to explain all this and to ask her to tone it down?",81,701,0.98
363,Not the A-hole,"I’ve always known growing up that I’ve had a biological father whom I’ve never met. The story of the circumstances of my birth changed over time. It went from, “daddy and I couldn’t stay together.” To “Your Father can’t live with us” to “your father has another family” and on, and on. 

The reality is that I was a product of an affair. 

My father and mother were fooling around for a few months while training at an army base, (or instructor/student... the story is hazy because everyone has a slightly different story) and as the story goes, my father and mother parted ways at the end of training. 

Three months later, my mother found out she was 6 months pregnant. 

Anyhow. Father is committed to his wife and his 2 kids 5 and 7 year old. My mother has me. He visits me twice after I was born, then noped out. 

*life rolls on*

Mom marries a guy when I was 4. Divorces him when I’m 18.

***

When I was 18 I sent my biological father a letter introducing myself, and we started a sporadic letter/email relationship up until I met him at 23. At that meeting. We talked about me meeting his family. My half siblings, aunts, uncles, etc. 

I had brought this up in emails and he had always pushed it off. I had a feeling for what was coming next. 

No one in their family knows I exist apart from him, his wife, and his (now deceased) parents. 

He has 8 siblings. 

The 4 of them all agreed that I am not to be introduced to the rest of the family. His wife reiterated that sentiment to him right before we met. It was what I had feared. It was a little rough to hear that. But I accepted it then. 

That was 15 years ago. 

My wish is to recontact him and through him, meet my siblings. But I am considering going straight to them since I expect I already know his answer, and I would rather not make an ultimatum. 

 I don’t know how this news will affect his family. I don’t want to destroy a family by exposing a 38 year secret. I want a (hopefully) positive outcome, but I’m not sure I can... but I still want to do it. 

But I also think it would be shitty to wait until one/both die to initiate contact with the siblings, because they could never explain/defend themselves. 


I don’t want money, or anything like that. I just want to connect with them, and at least be acknowledged as existing.

364,Not the A-hole,"I am the cultural secretary at my school, and I try my best to encourage everyone to come up with new ideas that can help my fellow students and also benefit humanity.
A bunch of girls came to me with the idea of normalising periods to guys and helping them understand that women might feel pain during sex and what consent means. I honestly thought it was a good idea, and we unfortunately have gender segregation at our school and something like this could educate a lot of people.

It started off really well, and I attended one of their mock classes and was pleased by the way they laid out the boundaries of consent and what forced sex meant. So I allowed them to continue without my help or permission for every activity.

A couple of weeks in, I am going home after class and hear a couple of kids laughing about what was displayed inside the club. So I got curious and checked, and I was shocked to see sanitary pads with period blood kept inside the class without any supervision. Curious Middle schoolers might have even played with it for all I know.

I go inside the club room only to see no one there, and come to know the next morning that the 3 girls had done this twice already and on purpose. I told them to shut the club down, and maybe align it and make it something more like what it previously was to get a pass.

Now I am not on Instagram, and I don’t really know what happened for sure, but one of these girls posted about this incident and a friend of mine posted a screenshot of the comments, and all of them are about how I am a bigot, massive piece of turd etc.

I honestly want to be the best man possible and thought that it would be nice to have a third opinion on the matter.

Thanks for your time.

EDIT: YES! It was actual period blood, I touched it and they said it was to normalise it and red dye would not have the same impact.

Now, this was obviously important to me and my girlfriend of 2 years was delighted when she heard the news. I brought a dress for her and we were really looking forward to go, but she unfortunately has really bad periods and was feeling absolutely miserable that day. 


She tried to make me think everything was fine and all but she was clearly uncomfortable. 


Her friend(who is also a close friend of mine) told me she was still feeling a lot of pain despite taking the best measures but wanted to try her best to come.

 
I kept trying to get her to rest, but she is way too stubborn when it comes to these things. So I told her the function was postponed, and told her I would be coming late because of work, I thought I would take her for the second function.

It kind of backfired when my sister posted pictures of the whole thing on her Instagram.
And now my girlfriend is really pissed and threatening to break up.

Edit:Thanks a lot for the prompt response and heads up guys! 
I realise I am the asshole in the situation and love you for the honest opinion.

Sorry, I just wanted to add that this is a reoccurring thing. She usually tells me she would come with me but usually goes halfway through the occasion or tells me to go back with her. If I say no, she comes in an über .We have cancelled vacations midway because of her periods, but she always tells me she can handle it. I don’t know if this is a big detail, I am honestly really stressed out and kind of wanted to emphasise where I am coming from.

On the otherhand, I have a desktop computer that was a hand-me-down and is quickly becoming outdated. I'm going to college next year and I need a computer that can handle the workload that is required for my major. I already have all the components picked out and through my parent's work it can be built for free, but it still comes out to be about $1,550.
So I thought that, ""Hey, its my birthday soon, ill just ask people to give me cash instead of presents. Because 1) I basically already have everything I need/want other than the computer, and 2) I really really want that computer.""
So recently (I think this past weekend) I brought it up to my Grandma (who I live with) and while she didn't necessarily say that it was a bad idea, she looked uneasy. I asked her about it and she said that while she doesn't care, she said that others may think that its kind of an asshole thing to request from my friends and other family if they want to get me something.

She had then mentioned that she can’t get time off next year for this (even though the annual leave hadn’t even reset yet since it was in November). I was sad about it but if she couldn’t get time off then at least we can do something together later that worked. 

Since then she has not shown up to bridal dress shopping, hair trials, bridesmaid dress shopping (I had to ask her for a month to find out her size). I at least wanted to see her before the wedding so I asked if she wanted to come up and hang out with her bf at our house. She says yes only to cancel the day before saying she has no money to come up (she went to Corfu the week after) and that we can make plans later. 

Now my wedding dress fitting in next week and I really wanted all of my bridesmaids to come and see and discuss the day since it is almost 2 months away.

&#x200B;

I'm a 28 year old woman with an otherwise reasonable and supportive mother. When I was three years old, my older sister died from cancer when she was eight. I feel horribly for my parents. This tragedy they endured basically robbed them of their otherwise ideal life. Their marriage didn't survive. When I was 21, my father confided that he and my mother did not agree on how aggressively they should treat my sister when the prognosis was incredibly grim. That pretty much explained for me the large rift between them. 

&#x200B;

Growing up, my mother would take my older brother and I to our sister's memorial and sob uncontrollably. I don't honestly have any memories of my older sister. My earliest memories are instead of these trips to my sister's gravestone. When my brother got older, he stopped attending since he moved several hundred miles away for school. On the other hand, I stayed in our hometown for both my undergrad and master's program. I'm very close with our mother and I love living near her. Even now, I still accompany her to my sister's grave about four times a year (she prefers not to drive on these trips and I take over the driving). For the past couple trips, I asked my mother if I could stay in the car and wait for her. I could tell she was really hurt the first time. The second time, she didn't say anything at all. These trips are emotionally draining for me and I found that staying in the car made them less draining. My chest physically hurts to see my mother so helplessly sad.

&#x200B;

Last week she brought up my staying in the car. She rarely brings up my sister outside of our trips to her gravestone. She brought up the fact that I no longer cry when we visit and she's worried that I'm letting my sister's memory fade. Generally, my mother is a well adjusted and happy person in her day to day. I think she keeps her sadness on hold and just experiences ALL of it a few times a year, rather than dealing with her pain on a daily basis. I didn't say anything at the time and asked her if we could discuss it later.

&#x200B;

I really don't have any memories of my sister. I'm so, so sad that she's gone, but I don't have memories of HER. I used to sob uncontrollably right next to my mother for years, but I cried more for her and my parents' pain than my sister. I want to explain to my mother just that, but I don't want to hurt her. Honestly, I would rather just stay in the car EVERY trip. It takes quite a while for me to move past seeing my mother so hurt. Every trip is like a four day event for me; the trip, her sadness, three days coming back down from getting swept up in her pain.

Am I the asshole if I ask to stay in the car on ALL trips?? I want to support my mother, but I feel emotionally drained for days after each of these rituals.",41,158,0.97

379,Asshole,"I (24M) recently showed up 'unsolicited' to a couples event my fiancée (27F) was invited to 'in a professional capacity'. She is currently very pissed at me.

My fiancée is an attorney. She's been working at a firm for some time since graduating law school. Every year the local bar association organizes this event where attorneys from the area are invited to network and see some old palls from college. The invitation also goes out to the partner of said attorney.

Last year I went together with her and had a merry good old time. I saw some guys there, who also work at her firm, that frequent the performance engine shop where I work as a mechanic. We share similar interests and we pretty much hit it off immediately (we still hang out every now and then). The event got pretty rowdy towards the end (contrary to popular belief a lot of these attorney types aren't the goody two-shoes they pretend to be) and I (amongst others) ended up on stage singing to classics such as Journey's 'Don't stop believin'' (fucking love that song). 

However, my fiancée ended up experiencing that night very differently. She pretty much went off by herself during the entire thing. She told me she spent the night networking with a few established attorneys and some old acquintances. She also told me she got a bit embarassed by my actions towards the end and that she would like to put on a professional demeanor in front of her colleagues and expected that of me too. 

Now, mind you, we often go off the deep end in the weekends and she doesn't have a problem with me acting like the fool I am then!

So last week when I mentioned how excited I was to go with her again this year, she flat out rejected me! She told me I wouldn't be able to properly behave myself in front of her fellow members of the bar and that was that. I tried promising her that I would be on my best behavior, but ""No means no!"" was the final answer. 

Why would you be embarassed of going to an event with your significant other just for being the person he is? Certainly if that very partner promises to be as innocent as grace itself! The event is literally meant for couples...

Initially I wasn't gonna go, but my newfound friends whatsapped me and I thought ""to hell with it"". So I got there early, joined up with them (saying she was gonna run late), texted her, had a few drinks, and when she arrived almost got dragged out of the party. I got stomped into my car with strict guidelines to go home and was whipped into motion! Not wanting to make a scene I drove off, got two honey butter chicken biscuits from whataburger and spent the rest of the night netflixing. Fun times. 

A week later she is still pissed as hell at me for not respecting her boundaries. I've been sleeping on the couch since then. In the meanwhile I can sort of find the humor in her not wanting to lose face in front of her fancy pants colleagues because of her 'oddball' (it truly isn't that bad tho) fiancé. But she still can't.

383,Everyone Sucks,"So using throwaway since this has the possibility of being an ongoing legal incident. 

A week ago my kids and I were driving home from school. If I had done something wrong, I would cop to it so honest to god I don't think I did anything wrong. Out of the blue a guy in ""tuner"" car was next to us screaming ""move that fucking piece of shit or I'll blow you away!"" I reactively flipped him off (which I should not have done) so he swerved in front of us almost taking our front end off. He spent the next 1 or 2 minutes short stopping in front of us, getting behind us and racing up like he was going to rear end us and again almost clipping our front end. After that he sped off at like a million miles an hour and we thought we were done with him, but it was very, very scary. 

About 10 minutes down the road at an intersection we saw the guys car with about 3 motorcycle cops. As we pulled up we saw that he was on the ground with handcuffs on with a cop's knee in his back. I rolled down my windows and yelled out ""ha that's what you get asshole!"" and started honking my horn. The guy clearly made eye contact with me and mouthed either ""fuck you"" or ""I'll get you"" but I didn't really care. One of the cops came over to the passenger window and asked if we knew the guy. I quickly explained we had an incident with him a few miles back. The cop asked me to pull over into the parking lot and speak with him. At first I thought I was in trouble but basically the cop took my statement and number. I asked what road rage guy had done to end up on the pavement and he said rather not say since my statement on the previous incident may come up with separate charges. I asked if I was going to get in trouble for yelling and honking and he said no, that he and his fellow officers found it very funny.

So I haven't heard from anyone with the need to make a statement but my wife is furious with me. She thinks I put our kids at risk by even engaging the guy. I told her I didn't speed after him, I didn't threaten him and I drove safe the entire time. She is mad me flipping him off but she is mad to the point of us needing therapy couple for yelling him at the light. My 4 year old son I guess is walking around yelling ""that's what you get asshole!"" and she feels that I've exposed ourselves to a maniac when I could have just driven away quietly.

We decided that if they take the oldest, they have to take the other one too because it's not fair. They're a package deal - it's all or nothing. The baby shouldn't have to stay at home with us and miss her sister while she's out camping with her grandparents and cousin. Well my dad didn't like that idea.

Next day I woke up with an itchy head... I've got dog allergies, and it turns out the dog likes to sleep on the bed (dog wasn't in the room when we went to bed, I didn't think too much of it). Not ideal, but sure, these things happen.

I went to get a glass of water the next day and noticed the kitchen is the sort of place that should be condemned. No clean surfaces, floor is a state, looked like washing up never gets done. For someone that lives alone, it looked like she lived expecting someone else to go wash up.
In the light of day the bathroom was beyond grim. Towels which didn't look like they'd been cleaned for months. 

Living room was suitable only for one person, due to the fact you had to move things out the way to get onto any sofa.

After my divorce I focused on raising my daughters and ensuring they were good and well adjusted. Thankful that they are. Both are now graduated and successful engineers. A lot of sacrifices went into this both professional and personal for myself. This was my choice and the way I wanted it to be. No regrets at all as my children were my focus. So all good there.

They are devastated. They don’t understand. They feel abandoned. I have asked them to move with me. There’s nothing keeping them here. But they won’t. They expect us to stay with them and look after them. It’s the cultural way. Despite this I am going. I feel hopeless and guilt about this decision. I am hoping they will change their mind and join me. For the maybe 20 good years that I have left, am I wrong? Am I a douche for leaving them?",18,51,0.9
390,Not the A-hole,"My partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. (Condom broke, we used the morning after pill but I still ended up conceiving)

After consulting with my family, doctors and my partner, we decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of mine that put me at risk, this was a choice made in regards to my physical and mental health. Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. 

Fortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. 

Seeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (My home was over an hour away)

I was touched by his thoughtfulness and told my best friend, who hates my partner, by the way.  She wanted to join me in the hotel instead of him, to ‘support’ me. 

She went on to say that my partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of us. This comment caught me off-guard. 

I wasn’t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, my partner intended to be there for me and I *wanted* him there. 

This made her upset. She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. I should always chose my best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which I’m thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn’t that big of a deal, my fear was unjustified and only in my head, it wouldn’t hurt anyways, etc.]

It escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and I went there with my partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of my life.

Afterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of my partner. 

**AITA for choosing my partner over my best friend in this situation and denying her a luxury weekend? I’ll admit that we were both going through a lot of stress at our workplace, so I do understand that she wanted a spa getaway. I feel like I made the right call, but it was recently brought up and she still feels like this was selfish - so I’m unsure and would appreciate a strangers POV.**",235,818,0.89
391,Not the A-hole,"For context, I'm adopted and have super long & very thick red hair. No one in my adopted family has hair like mine,and it's been kind of a thing for them to touch, admire, & talk about my hair at family gatherings since I was a kid. My aunt has lung cancer, and it's really taken a toll on her. She's lost all her hair and has talked about getting a wig, but they're too expensive and she says she wants real hair. My mom suggested I donate my hair to make a wig for my aunt at Easter dinner, and my aunt got so excited she started crying. I felt horrible about it, and didn't say anything. We went to this wig place and the lady said she could make a shoulder length wig for my aunt using my hair. (I keep it up extremely well & it's down to my knees) My aunt started crying again and again I feel so awful, but I really don't want to part with my hair. I know it grows back but still.

No one had asked me how I felt, but I think my mom could tell I wasn't very excited about it because she asked the lady if she could donate her own hair, and she said she'd need both my sister (mom's biological daughter) and my mom to donate their hair, since it's very thin, and she could only make a chin length wig with it. My aunt also wants red hair, so the lady said she'd have to dye it & that would cause it damage & cost more than using my hair. My uncle then said it'd make much more sense to use mine.

It's been a month and my aunt wants to know when we can make the appointment. I don't know what to do. I told my sister and she called me ungrateful and told me to stop being selfish because it would grow back. If I'm TA I won't hesitate to donate it but I don't know anymore.

EDIT: People suggested I clarify, I have knee length hair & I'd have to cut all of it off to the scalp in order to make the wig.

To all the people saying it doesn't take that much hair to make a wig: it does. One average donation of hair doesn't make a full wig, they match it with other donations. It usually takes 2-3 heads of hair for a full wig. Mine is long enough on its' own for a full wig, and my aunt doesn't want synthetic hair mixed in to supplement it.
I completely understand everyone that said I was the asshole for not saying no in the beginning. I'm not trying to justify that, but I want to make it clear that it's extremely difficult for me to stand up to my family. I don't think I've ever had a say in anything since I started living with them, and that's how it's always been. They never give me a voice, even though I should have spoken up. It always goes without saying that what my mom says will happen.",2219,9411,0.93

Her boyfriend thinks that I’m just an autistic schoolgirl and he’ve always made fun of me, basically of my anxiety and my inability to develop basic social skills - sometimes I laughed, but other times I ended up crying in my room because of his blatant remarks. I’m simply not comfortable around them and I always try to avoid them as much as I can.

397,Not the A-hole,"Long post, sorry! I can be pretty specific.

Husband and I currently live in his Mom's house even though his mom is already in a different country. His grandma and aunt also lives with us. We are currently here because his workplace is nearer and we still cant move to our own house near my hometown bc of several problems. So we are here for a few months.

So his aunt has BPD, she's 40 years old, unmarried and childless and she treats my daughter as her own which is nice. But sometimes she's a bit too much.

Im a SAHM but I still have a lot of errands to do by day WHILE taking care of our six month old daughter alone. It is pretty tiring so at the end the day, I just want to lay down and have a little play time with my daughter while relaxing with my SO.

But recently, she's getting on my nerves. She would knock every night, and if our door is unlocked, she would barge in and steal my play time with my daughter.

One time, after two painful hours of breastfeeding my teething baby, she barged in and wont stop kissing her until my baby woke up. She giggled while apologizing and left us to deal with an irritated infant until 2am. 

The last straw was awhile ago. She barged in when I was about to lie down after a tiring day of laundry, cleaning, and taking care of my baby and she started rummaging through MY drawers. I was furious and asked her what the fuck was she doing, and she was taken aback and said she just wants to check my daughter's clothes. She also peeked on my shoulder while Im using my SO's desktop while I was messaging a few relatives. Then she lay on our bed beside my daughter and just used her phone while playing with my daughter once in awhile. My daughter was starting to get irritated because it was 8pm and she wants to nurse so I thought it was a signal for her to go. But she then asked if she could just bottle feed my baby and be the one to put her to sleep. I refused. I went downstairs and asked SO to get her out of our room and to lock it. She wont leave at first but I was so mad my voice turned cold and told her I was tired, baby was tired, husband was tired and she needs to go.

When she left, SO and I had a heated argument because he thought I was being too rude and his aunt just wants to play with our baby. I told him our daughter stays downstairs with them while Im doing chores until dinnertime. And I just want to rest and have private time with my daughter and husband from 8pm onwards. I asked him to set boundaries but he said I should just give his aunt a chance because she never had kids. I just want the goddamn bedroom door locked and be undisturbed from 8pm til morning. So, am I the asshole?

TLDR: aunt in law always want to stay in our bedroom all night, not considering if I want to rest, invades my privacy and wont leave unless asked. Asked SO to set boundaries and he thinks it's disrespectful. AITA?",121,405,0.97
398,Not the A-hole,"I’ll keep this pretty brief, but for some background I run a staff of about 40 people at a restaurant in a highly sought after area in the Midwest (every time we open a job posting we get 200+ applicants within the week). 

Recently there has been a small group of people causing problems and singling people out to target for their nonsense. I have had countless meetings and documenting about their conduct but nothing seems to change. This group has caused several employees to leave and since believes they will always get their way. 

A few weeks ago one of the members of this group didn’t want to be assigned to a certain section of the restaurant and became emotional stating that it was unfair and she shouldn’t have to have a section she didn’t want. Then she began crying and saying she didn’t need this job and that she was leaving. She was warned by our front of house manager that leaving would constitute quiting and that she would be out of a job, she left anyways. About 20 minutes later she re-entered the restaurant claiming that she never quit and she was just outside taking a smoke break despite grabbing her purse and walking out. At this point the front of house manager contacted me and I explained that by walking out she left her position and we accepted her notice and we already reworked the restaurant sections to make the day work. She then got extremely emotional and kept repeating that she didn’t ever say she quit so we can’t tell her she’s not allowed to come back. I once again explained that she walked off the job with warning that if she did so we would accept that as her quitting. 

Overall, I think it will be a better work environment because people won’t feel attacked. I try to cut people some slack where I can but I felt like if I allowed her to come back it would show employees can throw a tantrum but still get their way. AITA?

399,Not the A-hole,"*Backstory: At the time, I shared a flat with my best friend V and her boyfriend O. I was going through a rough patch at the time and was looking forward to having a day ‘off’ from all the drama on my birthday.*

*Just a week before my birthday, my partner moved away from London to New Zealand. It was really sad, seeing as we both liked each other a lot, and he left me his coat and a beautiful mirror to remember him by, with a wooden frame and African carvings.*


When my birthday came around, V and O kept telling me that they didn’t have a gift for me yet and weren’t sure what to get me. They asked me for ideas, and I told them that I’d be happy with instant film photos for my polaroid camera, but that anything would be fine. Money doesn’t matter, the gesture does, so I’d have been happy with something handmade/creative as well, for instance. 

The plan was to go out a day before my birthday and party ‘into’ it past midnight. We had a great time at the bar and I’m grateful for that. 

Back home, V and O told me that they hadn’t wrapped their gift, which I was fine with. 

Except, it turned out to [be a mirror.](https://imgur.com/a/pP9Xe7g) Exactly like the one that my (ex)partner left me before he went to NZ - only that it was a drugstore £5 version. 

I’ll be honest - I was disappointed that my two best friends got me a mirror that I neither needed, nor wanted. Still, I thanked them politely and made sure not to show my disappointment as to not seem entitled, but I wasn’t extremely excited either. 

My friends were upset that I wasn’t visibly happier with it, but I assured them that everything was fine and we all moved on. 

A few days later, I met with a friend of mine (H). He had a belated gift for me - a [model of the Jeep](https://imgur.com/a/f3hZC0l) that I owned back when I still lived in America. We always had playful banter around the topic of my Jeep, I obviously loved it a lot and he doesn’t think highly of Jeeps and ‘made fun’ of me for it. 

It was a very unexpected gift. 1) I didn’t expect one from him, 2) he *hates* Jeeps, but apparently noticed how much I loved my old car and how much I missed having it in London (had no car, used public transportation)

I was touched and really happy - I even shed some tears. It was such a personal and thoughtful gift to me. 

However, when I told V and O about it, they became visibly upset. Neither of them like H to begin with. They claimed that I was ridiculous for being so happy about a ‘dumb car’, while showing no reaction to their ‘practical gift’ that I could actually use (despite being gifted a nicer version of the same mirror just a week prior by my ex partner). They expected the same amount of happiness for their mirror and were upset that I seemed more or less indifferent to it.

402,No A-holes here,"My grandma turned 80 last summer and she’s now thinking about dividing her possessions between my, my mom, my aunt and cousins. One of those possessions is about 500-700 blue and white porcelain figurines. She has many other possessions and collections but I believe this is her most prized and valuable one. It’s worth mentioning that my grandma lives in Russia, my mom and I live in Canada and my aunt and cousins live in the states. As summer comes soon and this is the time we usually fly out to visit grandma, she started reminding us to bring bags and leave lots of space for her figurines. She instructed me to bring a carry on suitcase that can fit 100 of them. Now I think they’re nice and all but I don’t want 100 of them sitting on a shelf. During my weekly call with grandma today I mentioned that I only really want about 5 and I can’t  have my carry on just for these figurines, I need space for other things. She got upset and said that why are my things more important than figurines. Then I told her that it would be impractical for me to carry them around every time I moved (I’m in university right now so I move quite often) and that they are not my hobby and I just don’t want to have that many. I told her 5 is enough because when I look at them I won’t be admiring how beautiful they are, I’d be remembering my grandma. 
She got really upset after this, she said that ‘you don’t even have any nice things in your house right now anyway’ which was kind of mean but I understand she was upset. I talked to her some more and explained why this wasn’t personal. She got really quiet then and hurried to end the call. When I asked her why she was so upset she said that I claimed to have really wanted them when I was little and she spent time collecting them for us. I felt really bad after she said this because I obviously don’t remember saying this. I thought she was just collecting them because she liked looking at them. I feel like she was about to cry when we ended the call and now I feel terrible. Should I not have said that? Should I take her figurines even though I still don’t want 100? I feel like it’s too late to tell her otherwise because now she knows my true opinion about her figurines. Also I don’t know if the rest of my family wants them either.

403,Not the A-hole,"
For some background, for about 3-4 years now, I’ve been working at a pretty well known pharmaceutical company in their finance department. While yes it’s a bit stressful, “boring”, and all the other terms about corporate life, I appreciate working there because it gives me a great salary with no college debt, and a opportunity now to go to grad school debt free. 

Now, I have a friend who all in all, is very impulsive and thinks she’s the “shit”. Every single conversation I have with her is always about herself, how pretty she is/how many guys hit on her, how smart she is because she’s in this PT program etc etc. Now before you ask, why am I still friends with her? Because of a traumatic incident that happened a couple years ago that she had my back on when I was pretty broken. So while I’m still loyal due to this fact, I’ve kept my distance due to her conceitedness. 

Now, at the last meet up with this friend, all of a sudden she tells me she’s dropping out of her graduate program, as it’s her first year, dropping 60K into the toilet essentially, with no job prospects or income coming in. As a genuine offer, I tell her that I might be able to get her a interview/job with my company, as I have a little pull because I’ve worked my self up at this point. All of a sudden, she goes into this rant about “corporate life sucks”, and how she’s too good to go to a regular 9-5, how she’s a free bird and can’t waste her time etc etc. 

I’m getting visibly annoyed, because it’s all indications that she’s making fun of my own career, so I end the conversation. Couple days later however, I get a text about “can you still help me get a job” and send over her resume. I’m still feeling highly annoyed, but my curiosity gets to me and I look at it. Her experience and job history is good, but since it’s nothing finance related, the most I can get her is a receptionist or assistant position. But the thing is, I’m hesitant to help her because she has a history or taking and leaving jobs with no notice, and it would impact negative on me if I give her my Recc and she pulls that again. Along with the fact that she thinks she’s much “better” than me for getting a Corp job. 

Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: I only knew about leaving the jobs with no notice is until AFTER I saw her resume that she sent. The last three jobs she had were only between 3-4 months working at each job. When I asked her about that, she told me she got hired, “tried it out” then just never showed up after.

2nd EDIT: I’m pretty tired of people saying YTA because I’ve broken a “promise”. I’ve never promised her a job/interview/recc. I said I could help her or give her a chance, and she rejected it by insulting my “Corp” career. So I think it’s pretty ridiculous to say YTA based on a “promise” that never existed.",54,66,0.91

But she kept asking me about it if I really didn't have a slight preference and finally I admitted that theoretically if I could choose I'd probably prefer if it was a girl.

Then she wanted to know why and I think the answer is pretty simple. First of all I think it's nowadays a bit easier to raise a girl instead of a boy because of how society has changed. The other reason is that we're both pretty short, I'm white 5'6"", she's half Chinese 4'10"", so height isn't something we're genetically blessed with and our kid will most likely not be as well. We also live in the UK so it's not like we live somewhere with really low average height. Overall I just think if it were a boy that'd make things more difficult for him while for a girl it wouldn't really matter. 

My wife says it's a stupid reason to have a preference though and almost insinuates that I wouldn't be supportive of our baby or love it less if it was a boy. Nothing could be further from the truth though. I simply said that if I could choose I might prefer a baby girl for those reasons and not because of myself but because I want my kid to be happy and have a fulfilled and rich life.

Most of the replies were supportive and a few others even said it helped them get the courage to quit as well! One guy however said I was essentially just looking for sympathy. He went on to claim I was faking my depression to be fashionable, and I was just trying to get internet people to coddle me. This was untrue and really upsetting...

My job is sending me \~1,800 across miles across the US for an incredible work opportunity and I have known that I would be moving for the last year.

Because of this I have not been trying to date anyone because I don't want to be emotionally invested with anyone before I leave and I also wanted to properly heal from my last relationship.

A month ago I met someone at a bar and we clicked instantly. She's a gigantic dork and so am I. The first two weeks we hooked up a couple times and it was great. Fast forward to now and we've gone on a few dates (Red Sox game, GoT bar, and the Movies,) but this started as just a hookup and the dates happened because of good timing. I don't plan on doing long distance and I assumed that this would have been over by now, so I haven't told her I'm moving and I don't plan on it.

Now I think that IATA in this situation because I'm not only leading her on but also myself, but all of my friends I've consulted insist that I'm not because ""you're just having fun"" and ""there's no harm in living a little.""

Prior to me finding out, I went on a family trip that included my step mom and her side of the family where she was saying a lot of interesting things about my dad. She’s said that he is careless with money, doesn’t know where he is half the time, gave up on our family, and all sorts of other details that she obviously wanted to tell me to sway me before I knew the truth. 

My dad pulled me aside one day and told me everything that happened. Right as he said the words, a lot of things I had questions about hit me all at once. Her flirting with the neighbor, going off with him to “grab food for the New Years party” for hours and a bunch of other sketchy details over the years that I had never connected until that moment. 

She tried to talk to me and explain things but never apologized for disrupting the family and was in denial about any wrong doing, which she blamed all on my dad. 

She hasn’t changed her lifestyle or attitude at all over the past year. My dad is starting a new company and she refuses to get a job to pay for bills, she bought a very expensive dog recently, my dad now has to live at my other small house we still own 2+ hours away from work because she refuses to leave and she is still delusional about the whole situation. 

My whole family has kind of coincided with her because she is not in a great mental state and doesn’t know what to do otherwise.

They're the kind of people who are comfortable with anyone coming in or dropping by unannounced just to say hi, show someone something on their phone, etc. It's very Full House.

So that being said, they don't lock their door. We've piled into the car to go to the store or other places before and I've said ""Do you have the key?"" to be (gently, not meanly) laughed at and had it explained that they don't need to lock the door. 

I'm not comfortable with that, but I didn't say anything. I just moved my travel bag into my car. When we went to get ready for bed, I passed by the door and saw it hadn't been locked. I asked if I should lock up for the night and the family chuckled again. I felt extremely uncomfortable, so for peace of mind, I locked up. 

In the AM, FIL got up and went to get his paper. He found the door was locked and said ""(My Name), did you lock the door?""

I said yeah, very casually. He looked at me like I was crazy. I said I'm just not comfortable with leaving doors unlocked. Both of them laughed, and for the rest of the weekend, the jokes continued. Things like ""Who hurt you?"" and ""What was so bad in your childhood that you can't deal with an unlocked door?"" and ""What do you think was going to happen, someone was going to break in? This isn't (Big City we live in).""

We ended up leaving early because my husband was tired of telling them to knock it off. A few days later, my MIL posted what was supposed to be a funny thing  on FB and tagged me, saying ""(My Name) and Husband visited, but DIL isn't cut out for that (town) life! She couldn't handle a few unlocked doors and thinks the whole world is out to get her!"" cue the family making fun of me, my upbringing, etc.

I'd finally had enough and posted back: Home invasions happen. My best friend's dad was murdered in their home by an intruder when I was 12 years old. Forgive me for caring about my safety and infringing on whatever makes you feel superior here.""

She deleted the post and told me I was out of line, it wasn't my place to lock doors in someone's house that wasn't mine, if I didn't feel safe with them, maybe I shouldn't visit anymore. I said sure, Husband and I won't visit anymore. She backpedaled and made it clear she meant just me, but I asked why he would drive all the way out there (it's about 5 hours) without me just to be with people who were mean and judgmental about his wife and a locked fucking door? This turned into another big ""you're taking my baby away from me!"" situation.

Anyway in relaying the whole story to others, I've had a surprising reaction. Am I the asshole for locking a door at night?",2454,12745,0.94
414,Not the A-hole,"Background, in January I inherited the family business after my uncle fell dead of a sudden heart attack. My grandfather founded it in 1949 and we woukd be celebrating our 70th anniversary this year. We are essentially the last small scale manufacturing facility in our area. I worked at the place off and on since I was 11 and have a strong affinity for its success.

However, we live in an area ravaged by the opiate crisis. I have 50 employees and can count on 25/30 showing up on any given day. I've watched us being able to afford essentially a ""gold plan"" medical insurance for all employees to paying quadruple premiums for bare bones coverage that seems to be fueling my issues with pain pills. We work with precious medals and I even with a strict inventory procedure I lose 10% minimum every month. 

Last month our entire facility was shut down for 1.5 days while ATF and sheriffs department tore the place apart because two my my long time employees were moving pills out the back door. It cost us high five figures with the downtime and time to get to full production. I started looking at alternatives and I can essentially ship our raw materials overseas, cut my labor costs by 40% and have none of these issues and have an as good or better product shipped to our customer in our boxes. 

I have several great employees (8 actually) I would keep on here because they are great workers. I could give them a raise and improve thier medical coverage. 

But I woukd be sending 43 other people into guaranteed long term unemployment and it would make my already suffering community worse. The addicts would no longer have medical coverage and stats woukd tell us they'd turn to street opiates to serve thier addictions (38 current employees are on pain pills of some degree, others probably are I don't know about). 

A huge part of me feels tremendous guilt for being part of the problem of losing jobs. But I also know I don't sleep, I also know I often work 20 hour days both as the owner and filling in on production because of no shows and I don't know how long my health, marriage and family can take it.

Would I be the asshole if I follow through with this idea?",23,45,0.92
415,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 29yo gay man and I've been with my boyfriend (28) for 6 years. I grew up in a normal, accepting family, and the last time I was in the closet was when I was 15. Since then, my family, my friends, my boyfriend's family, everyone knows that I'm gay and he's gay and we're together. Even my coworkers at my old job knew, because they sounded cool about it so I brought my boyfriend to the Xmas party.

About 6 months ago, I started a new job. The company is amazing, I get to do much more fun and interesting stuff, I get paid almost 3 times as much as at my previous job, my commute is shorter etc. etc. Except the coworkers are trash. They are 90% guys (it's an IT company), most of them over 40, and they have pretty much caveman worldviews. I heard them speak against other professions, women (including their own wives), gay people, Muslims, atheists, black people, Roma people and so on. Btw, it's a predominantly white European country, so there are no people of color at the company, or any non-Catholics (except a few atheists).

In the first month that I was here, there was a dispute between several of the men at the office and one woman who mentioned going to the gay pride parade in the past. It lasted way too long, it was way too loud, and it ended in all of them going to the HR person and agreeing that the woman will no longer talk about things that are uncomfortable for others! Anyway, I know they are TA, but I want to know if I am too, for doing this:

To make my life easier, when we started to get to know each other and talk about our private lives, I lied that I was single. I never said I was straight though, because I either just smile, or change the topic or say I'm super busy and leave. But I still lied. When I talk about something I did with my boyfriend, I say ""friend"".

All of my friends think I am a complete motherfucking asshole and that I, as a grown ass man, should have said I'm a gay man and stood up for myself and my boyfriend. My boyfriend was a little hurt but in the end he agreed that it's probably for the best, considering my chances are low of getting the HR guy on my side in case of a fight. I don't plan on working here forever, but the money is so good I just don't want to risk it. It sucks not being able to talk about yourself truthfully, and I feel horrible and treacherous and as if I let down my boyfriend and gay people in general. But I also feel like it's at least somewhat justified. AITA?

I smiled at the lady and said something along the line of “mmm you smell very nice”. She kind of scowled at me and walked away. 10 minutes later my supervisor calls me into the office and tells me the lady had complained to him and told him I was being creepy and inappropriate it. I was then written up and told not to comment on females appearance, smell or anything that could be taken the wrong way.

417,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR:  My female classmate who has depression and anxiety stole money from 12  different people at once to ""help her mom pay for her therapy"" and tried  to frame me. I want to file an incident report on her (an incident report is like our way of filing a case against someone in school, from now on shortened as IR).

So I'm a high school student. All these events happened within the past 4 days, culminating just today (May 02, 2019).

This Monday, at around afternoon, 12  different students (including myself) have lost money around the same time, in total amounting to around 80 USD.

We've discussed about it the following Tuesday and Wednesday. Let's call the thief ""student E"". Student E was clearly suspicious and we were almost, without a doubt, sure it was her, we just lacked visual or verbal proof.

Now it's Thursday. There was an envelope found by student E at around 7:10 in the morning (local time). We opened  the envelope and in it lies around half the money of the total stolen,  an apology letter, and a coded message which is implied to be the name  of the thief.  
When decoded it says ""Erudito"", which is the username I  use for almost all my social media and video game accounts, you can  actually see it in my Reddit username, and all my classmates know this.  No other person I know uses that username/nickname.

My classmates, of course, all supported me and didn't believe it. The only  proof you need to hear is the fact that I entered school 7:40 when the  envelope was for sure found 7:10. I also ain't the kind of guy to steal. It was an obvious frame up.

We spent the next 3 hours discussing about the whole matter as a class, Student E included. We mostly told the class of the sanctions of  such crimes, in order to convince student E to finally confess. We  struck a deal that we wouldn't file an IR as a class on the thief if they just confess within the time period. She didn't budge the first 2 periods... until the last 1. She finally confessed that it was her.  Student E then proceeded to cry and explain her ""motives"" for stealing the money in the first place. She said that her mom was struggling to pay for her therapy for her depression. Whether  everything she said is true, we still don't know. We're unsure of her family's economic status or if she maybe has another condition like  kleptomania or compulsive lying.

As a class, we voted not to file an IR on her, with people thinking her condition must be considered.

I don't feel the same way.

I then consulted my social group (all members of which are also my  classmates) and they said they'd back me up and support me if I decide to file an incident report on my own.

So now I'm consulting you, Reddit. Will I be the asshole if i try to file a  case against my classmate, who I know has depression, for theft and  attempted impersonation? Am I morally in the right or wrong? Do I have  the right to do this?",150,546,0.94

422,Not the A-hole,"I got pregnant in high school, when I was 17 (I am just turning 30 now). I wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. He involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

I was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. I was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. Delivery was a nightmare. The whole process was so traumatic that I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it, for which I've been in therapy for the last four years.

In my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so I did that. I haven't regretted it for a minute (I do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, I do NOT regret giving up parental rights). I do not think about this child, I do not think of myself as having a child, I am not a mother. I have never met the child and never want to.

Last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. I told him that we did things according to his wishes and I never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

He and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought I'd 'come around.' They want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. I won't. Am I the asshole here? All I have done is what I have always said I would do.

Note: Sorry, English isn't my first language. I also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very US-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as I am not from US and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",3363,18011,0.79

424,Asshole,"Hi Reddit!

at an impasse with my girlfriend after a pretty heated discussion. would like to know your thoughts!

I am a professional musician, I live from my music. It’s electronic. I don’t make a ton of money, but enough that I don’t have to have a job and can have a bit of cash to spend here and there on fun stuff like music equipment etc. I met my girlfriend because she was a fan of my music and we really hit it off. 

We’ve been living together for a few years now and she is quite an introverted person. I’m perfectly fine with this, I also like my own space, but she is much more introverted than me. She doesn’t really have any friends in our city, and isn’t interested in making any either. 

Occasionally I’ll have people over from existing collaborations to work on music or rehearse for performances etc. this is all fine with her. We don’t have trouble with the neighbors as they also play music loud.

The issue comes up when I want to have other people over. A few months ago a friend named John was visiting and he asked for a place to crash for one night. I offered our couch as he had previously let me stay on his. She was upset that I didn’t include her in the decision, and didn’t want him there. It was a pretty big fight. 

I thought it was fair to want to be included, but I also thought it was just a bit unreasonable. John had stayed with us once before, she knows him, and it was only for one night. He ended up staying and it was totally fine.

So anyway, this morning I’m chatting with my friend Fred who is coming to visit and he mentions wanting to jam in my studio. He wouldn’t stay over, he just wants to come over one day and work on stuff. We had done a track by sending files to each other and it came out great so I was like yeah cool! No concrete plan or anything but I was just excited.

I tell her oh yeah I’m gonna jam with Fred and she immediately starts telling me I can’t decide these things without her and I can’t have him over. I was just flabbergasted and got pretty angry and we had an argument.

I understand wanting to discuss things, but I hadn’t even made a concrete plan and she immediately jumped into denying my jam with my friend.

To me it’s like come on, I’m a musician for a living, you know me because of my music. Part of being in music means collaborating with other people and hosting friends and engaging in the community. 

I think it’s totally unreasonable to just shut everyone out and say I can’t have anyone over like that.

425,Asshole,"I’m a 32 y/o male. She is a 38 y/o female. We started dating in September 2018 and things started off amazingly. 
After about a month and a half of dating I started to become paranoid due to small changes in her behavior. I have been previously cheated on and I did not know if I was just being paranoid.

She accused me of being insecure and did not react well to my insecurity. With her knowledge and encouragement, I began seeing a psychologist about my insecurities with regards to infidelity in relationships.

I later found out, after I became concerned about her cheating, she did in fact cheat with her ex boyfriend on nights that we had big fights.

When I found out, I tried to block her out of my life. However, she relentlessly contacted me. She said she spoke with God, was a changed person, and pledged to be there for me and give me complete access to her or her phone any time I wanted it. She also broke it off with her ex completely.

I decided to give her a chance. Since then, I no longer get the constant creeping feelings that she is lying or hiding things from me. I generally believe things are better and she is faithful. 

We are currently exploring getting an apartment and moving in together. 

I have been suffering from depression since finding out she cheated on me which has led to difficulty sleeping through the night. The depression is not just because she cheated on me.

This has led to me waking her up in the middle of the night to express my sadness and need for reassurance. At first she was supportive, but now it genuinely angers her when I do this.

Tonight, I woke up at 130am and decided to look through her phone. I rarely do this despite my access.

Tonight, I found emails from POF (Plenty of Fish, a dating site) in her email. 

I woke her up at about 2am to ask her about this. She got angry that I woke her up to “accuse” her of something. I stayed calm as she told me “This is Fucking ridiculous! You wake me up in the middle of the night to accuse me of something when I have done nothing wrong!” She logged into the old account for me and verified there has been absolutely no activity on it. It’s just an old account and doesn’t even have a picture.

She said I do not respect her and that she has told me repeatedly to not wake her up in the middle of the night.. 
She wanted an apology. I refused to give one. I said maybe if you had not cheated previously, I wouldn’t be this concerned when I find an email from POF in your inbox. 

If she had not reacted so negatively to me waking her up, I’d be a lot more inclined to apologize.

I love her. She loves me. But as you can see, it is complicated. 

Am I the asshole for waking her up in the middle of the night to question her about emails from POF?

*edit*
People are upset I went through her phone. This was with her expressed permission. It was part of HER proposed terms to continue the relationship. Although, I still get what you are saying.",52,38,0.77
426,Not the A-hole,"So here is the situation. There is a guy who lives in my apartment who parks his gigantic jacked up 4-wheel drive in Car parks that are not his to park in.

The Apartment we live in has a two level car park underground and a Visitors lot in an enclosed area. Every Apartment itself has 2 spots reserved with their Room number on the ground and the concrete stopper. Example is that the one for mine is 213A and 213B. My roommate has his car parked in B and it never leaves that spot, ever.

I don't think it has moved in the 2 years he had been living with me. So I always use A. Anyone coming to visit me or him parks there car in the visitors area. The Rules of the Apartment clearly state that if your allocated spot is taken(Example being if 3 people live in 1 apartment with 3 cars) then the extra car needs to be parked in the visitors area. If you park it in another apartments spot you get demerit points. 5 points you get a ""fine"" which is a 1 time charge of 5% on your next payment which goes towards upgrades to the building. 10 points you get evicted. Obviously there are other things that get you demerit points, like having parties without informing the manager/night manager.

Anyway, there is a guy who lives about 2 floors above me who lives with his friend and Girlfriend. It just so happens that their parking spots are next to mine. They are full 9/10 times.

So this guy has a habit of parking in my spot. A lot. And it drives me nuts because then I am forced to park my car in the visitors area. So I have to go out the exit, drive around the block and come back in(the way to the underground is through the visitors parking and the entrance and exit are one way only). Depending on the time of Day that could take anywhere from 1 minute to 30 because I live in the CBD. Too bad if I have to take a major crap or am in a rush for something.

I've reported him once for it. I've asked him 20+ times not to do it. He still does it. The manager has caught him a few times and he has done other things which earned him those demerits. Most know his car because it is very distinct and kind of screams ""I spend lots of money to make this car look the way it does"". He has never really apologized for it and has even reacted in a very ""I'm a tough guy, back off"" tone with everyone but the manager and night manager.

So at this exact moment. He has 9 Demerit points. 1 more and he is gone. I want to report him, but I think that will make me kind of petty, which I'm not. My ex thought I'd be an asshole if I reported him, but then she thought he was one of the hottest guys in the world, another issue for another time.

My Roommate doesn't particularly care. He has never had an issue with him.

I realize that I should have gotten more information from her when she first offered but it honestly didn't cross my mind.

She immediately got offended and asked why. I kept telling her I was sorry and that the school just isn't a good fit for me. She kept pressing and I couldn't think of any other reasons so I finally just told her that I don't want to be a part of any catholic organizations, for personal reasons.

435,Everyone Sucks,"My Reddit is heavily connected to my personal life so take this throwaway as a token of my appreciation. 

My friend, calling him Jason, is trans FtM and came out in freshman year (highschool). We're in junior year now. We all were and still are supportive of him. 

 No matter what the original conversation is about he always finds away to mention his being trans or his sexuality (he's also gay) or talk about the LGBT+ community in some way. To be frank, I'm so fucking tired of it. I get he's proud of himself and I'll be there for him when he needs me but at this point, I don't really care that he's trans and I want to have one goddamn conversation with my friends without it turning into him saying how he'll turn of our friends he likes gay when we talk about a movie or him talking about how he can wait for top surgery so he doesn't need his binder while we're planning what to do during the weekend. 

I'm not the only one that feels like this, most of our friends can't stand it either but no one says anything about because we thought he'd throw a fit. Almost all of today, Jason had been talking about his gender for no reason and we left subtle hints at the fact we  didn't  want to talk about it. At lunch we were talking about one of our friend's new dog and how she left a revenge dump on her bed after a bath. 

In the middle of us cracking jokes about it, randomly Jason starts talking about how he thought his grandmother was gonna shit on his bed when he came out and was about to dive into something regarding being trans (He started the sentence with "" And since I've been out as trans..."" ) I snapped and cut him off by saying ""Stop fucking talking about being trans, I don't care."" Cue a screaming match between us in which I was called transphobic and he was called selfcentered that ended with us both getting detention and our friend group is split with more of them saying that they were glad I said something. 

I'm here because he and the friends on his side are demanding I apologize and that I was waay out of line and I kinda feel a little bad now but not enough to apologize. I didn't say I didn't care about him being trans because he is trans, I said it cause I was fucking tired of hearing it over and over for 2 years and upon saying that to them, they all called me an asshole and are blowing up my phone.

Afterwards, A kept saying “hetties be like” and “yes, i, the heterophobe is making a comeback”. I just laughed at the comments and acted like I saw them as jokes, but I was kinda annoyed.  This one girl who is very close friends with A kept hearting her comments and saying “god i’m so happy that A, the heterophobe, has made a comeback”, which B sent a dislike in response.

I called her a friend because we had a few funny conversations over text, but besides that my friend group and I don’t have much history with her.",86,94,0.81

443,No A-holes here,"Now before I start this I know it sounds bad but I’ll try to explain.

So I’m 21(m) and my girlfriend is 21(f). I’m a full time university student studying engineering currently about 4 years in with 2 to go and working part time while she works full time. We are also living together and have been together for 2 years.

Recently she told me that she is pregnant, only a few weeks along now but it was a massive shock. We always use protection etc. so I can only assume it must have been a defective condom because I don’t believe she would be the type to cheat.

Anyway, I suggested abortion to her as an option since neither of us are financially in a position to raise a baby and I can’t speak for her but I’m definitely not in an emotional position to do so either. However, she refused to hear it saying it was immoral and illegal and murder etc. (it turns out she has been reading exclusively pro-life media about this for a while). Anyway in short she said refused to talk about it or even listen to me when I tried explaining how the situation wouldn’t work and instead said I should be supporting her instead of trying to change her mind. She also said she had already told her family and if I didn’t want it I should just leave. When I asked her about how it would work she basically said she expected me to drop my degree and the last 4 years of my life to support it.

I should also note that she has wanted a baby for a long time and has talked about it a lot over our relationship. I talked with her and got her to agree that we would try later when we older and both ready before but now I’m not sure if she just lied to me then when she agreed. Now she says she’s upset with this situation and scared but I’m pretty sure she’s lying again as outwardly she seems over the moon about everything and couldn’t be happier (this also makes me a little suspicious on the broken condom)

I don’t want to throw away my youth raising a child when I’m 21 but she won’t listen to me at all (a bunch of other people in her family have had children young as well and all are now single parents). I feel like my only remaining option is to do what she said and just leave. Tell her I can’t change her mind on abortion but if she wants to raise a child she will be doing it on her own because I’m not ready to do that at 21.

I just want to know WIBTA if I do this? Thanks reddit

EDIT:

Thanks for the comments so far. I think I should clarify a few things:

1. When I say leave I mean leave HER not completely abandon the child. What I would do is leave but still financially support what I can as well as help to look after it. 

2. We had discussed kids beforehand and both decided to wait until at least 28

3. I know I cannot force her to get an abortion nor would I want to. This decision is based on the fact that she didn’t even consult me about the decision and refuses to even discuss it with me, completely cutting me out of the decision making process. It’s also based on the fact that she basically laid out an ultimatum for me which was ‘drop out of school to support us with a full time job or two, or there’s the door.",448,682,0.93

445,Not the A-hole,"She wants to redecorate and because she’s my brothers flavor of the week and she’s older, she gets a say in household matters. She believes her voice is louder than my voice although the house is my brothers and mine. Actually, fully mine since my name is the only one on all the papers...

At first it was haha... now I’m getting irritated. 

I like elephants. So the house has a lot of them incorporated in the decoration. She’s an AKA and she’s like the first order to business is to get rid of the elephants. She so kindly stated that I can keep the ones in my room but all the others have to go. 

She is serious and that was just ONE of the situations she’s complained about. She mentioned things about my kitchen, MY EN SUITE BATHROOM (why tf are you in my room anyway), my living room, my whole house. 

I told the chick that if she doesn’t like the way my house is decorated she can KMA and never come back. This is my house that I so kindly let you visit, not my brothers. 
I further said that before she moves anymore of her things into MY house, she needs to have a job and be willing to pay me to stay here. I said if she wants somewhere to stay for free she’d better find a fucking shelter. 

She got angry and proceeded to call me...judgmental 🤷🏾‍♀️ (me? 😂😂😂)and petty, among other , very nasty names. 
My brother called me a bitch and said that my reaction was uncalled for. 

He said he’s going to move out that he’s tired of my shit. I said good riddance especially if you’re leaving with Jobless Janice. 

Just so we’re clear- my brother ended up staying with me because he fell on hard times. He’s only supposed to be staying with me temporarily. It’s been about a year now. 

Since he works less hours than I do and is home playing his game mostly, I only asks that he pays the light bill and keeps the common areas decent. 

I’ve gotten several notices over the course of the year that the lights have gone at least 2 months late. He gets paid weekly 😑 

“My shit” I guess is me telling him to make sure I don’t come home one day to the fucking lights being off and to make sure whenever he and JJ decide to cook they clean up after themselves. 

Yes, I do tell him that he is the older brother and I’m the younger sister and I shouldn’t have to remind him of shit common sense shit like he’s my child.

Edit 1: 
Yes, I had an attitude when I said that. I’ve had a history in my family of not sticking up for myself and allowing people to take advantage of me. Prior to my brother living with me, we’d not spoken for a looooong time because of something he’d done to me and me calling him out for it and FINALLY standing up for myself. 

For months I’ve tried being nice. I’ve tried laughing it off then changing the subject. I’ve tried to talk to these people like adults and say hey, that’s a rude thing to say or that’s not nice or I don’t appreciate you making those comments about my house.  I’ve asked him to step in and say something to her and not feed into her idk...ideas. 


I’ve told him idc if he has company over but my help only extended to him and though I didn’t mind JJ spending some time at my house, I didn’t sign up to take of her. I didn’t sign up to take care of grown people period. I signed up for helping him get on his feet. Letting him save money and pay off his debts so he can get a place of his own or they can get one together.

That was included as a part of “my shit” and me being a bitch.

I’m sorry, if some of y’all could sit there and continue being nice and trying to take the high road with them, I commend you. Y’all are much better people than I am.

I never felt like anyone disliked me because I went vegetarian. 

onto the issue  

I had gone over to a friends house and brought some vegetarian sausages, my mate was going to cook them up and we would have a movie night.

I thought my sausages looked odd but had never had this brand before, it was not the most appetizing and it tasted kinda gross but i kept on eating. half an hour later I started to feel Ill so I asked him if he cooked them properly. 
he started laughing and told me he gave me a meat sausage, I started gagging and ran to the bathroom to throw up, I did not make it and he ended up with throw up on his carpet. 

he got mad and told me I would have to pay for his carpet to be replaced. I told him that he needed to apologize for feeding me meat and then I might consider replacing the carpet. he told me the meat sausage thing was a joke. 

I grabbed my shit and walked out his door, and had to walk home (20 minute walk) because of how sick I felt. i also threw up on my way home. 

I've now not gotten an apology just him repeatedly massaging me about his carpet being replaced. so I blocked him.

Today her friend/our coworker came to our office to chat, and it quickly devolved into hushed crying, talking about depression, upping dosages, etc. I tried really hard not to pay attention but it’s an incredibly small office - they were about 5 feet away from me. I found it really distracting, so after about 20 minutes I decided I’d take a lunch away from the office, got up and left. While I was gone, I sent the following text message:

“Hey, it sounded like [employee] could use some private time to talk so I left to grab lunch. I’ll probably be back in 20 minutes. If the conversation is still ongoing, do you think you could please take it to another space? Thanks :)”

When I got back the crying employee was gone, and then after a few minutes my coworker said she was going to take a lunch too. When she got back we talked a little bit about what happened and I told her it made me really uncomfortable so I left but in the future could we agree to take those conversations away from our office to another location?

She told me that the coworker was clearly comfortable talking about it in front of me and that she thought I was selfish for not providing a safe place for her to let it out, because we share the workspace together and she should be able to use it too. She also told me that if I was really uncomfortable I should have taken my laptop to another room or to telework.  Plus, where could they go to have a private conversation? I suggested a car, the outside of the building has a secluded area as well, and she told me that she wasn’t going to be able to get the employee to leave, so either deal with it or leave.

450,Not the A-hole,"My partner (30M) and I (29M) live in a building with dozens of apartments. As soon as we moved in about a year ago, our next door neighbors immediately started harassing us over every little thing. There's a leak - must be us! Something's wrong with the electrics - must be us! There is a noise - must be us! They have complained about how loud, often and long we take showers, they are bothered by how loud our AC is, they have questioned us about how many people ""actually"" live in our apartment after we had some friends over and so on.

I thought they were just crazy annoying old people at first, but a couple of months ago, I overheard them in the hallway and they used very colorful (homophobic) language to talk about us. So instead of continuing to walk on tip toe and turn off the AC and not have people over, we decided to have audible sex. We only do it before 10 pm and quietly enough so that it's not an actual disturbance to other people, so they can't call the cops on us. Our bedroom, living room and bathroom share a wall with this couple's apartment, so they can probably hear us wherever we decide to do it.

We talked about this to several of our friends, and everyone accused us of being assholes (also immature - agreed). Our friends think we should have ""called someone"" as soon as they started bothering us, but seriously, who? The police? The old people's home? And tell them what, a couple of 70 year olds are bullying us? Anyway, our friends think we should stop doing it.

451,Not the A-hole,"My husband (DH) has a horrible relationship with his mother. By his account (and other family members), she was largely an absentee alcoholic, chain smoking parent- who started relying financially on my husband to contribute to the household bills by the time he was in middle school.

As he went through high school, college and his divorce she was not there for him to support him emotionally or financially. There’s a huge amount of negative history there. Some of the greatest hits: 

- Smoking around DH (even though he has asthma and allergies) and me when I was pregnant, despite being repeatedly asked not to
- cutting out or editing DH and I out of pictures with our son that we’ve taken, and referring to our child as “My son” “My baby”, etc. 
- tried to teach my son to call her Mama, and referred to herself as mama when speaking to my son until DH and I both confronted her repeatedly 
- At 63 yrs old, Dating a man DH’s age with 4 young kids, who is a doppelgänger for DH down to food preferences
- Using our Amazon Prime to buy a penis pump and lingerie for doppelgänger boyfriend 
- Constantly telling DH and I that she’s going to “die soon” but has no diagnosis to speak of that gives her limited time. 

DH and I eloped last week. We discovered at the same time DH needed outpatient surgery and a biopsy, as he may have cancer. After getting hitched DH broke the news on both to his mother. She was went ballistic. 

She reacted by disowning DH via text. DH is incredibly hurt and angry. Since Saturday she has refused any form of contact, despite knowing the surgery is tomorrow. Our son and I have also been treated as if we no longer exist. Hell, she won’t even like the status change on Facebook (and she LOOOOVES attention on Facebook). 

After all of the shit she’s done, I have chosen for my son and I to go no contact with this woman and DH firmly supports that choice. 

DH says he’s the same, but seems unsure for how long no contact will last. When I asked him about the surgery, he said he’s unsure if he even wants his mother to have updates or information of any kind. 

DH isn’t sure if he wants her to have any information about biopsy results or anything else. After the procedure he won’t be in the proper mindset to make any kind of decision until anesthesia wears off, and even then it’s questionable what he’ll be up for. His mother is a crazy hypochondriac, and I can see her easily changing her mind and then spamming my phone and DH’s during the surgery and afterwards during his recovery.

Personally, I feel like giving his estranged mother any information or attention during this is only going to make an already difficult situation worse and impede DH’s rest and healing by stressing him out and upsetting him.

453,Not the A-hole,"My neighbor across the street runs a B&B, which he lists on AirBNB.  His original 5-year permit (which I could have appealed, but did not) expired, and he submitted a request to renew.  This time, I did appeal.

We live near the end of a small, quiet cul-de-sac.  Because of this, street parking is very limited - there are about 4 stalls available.  The listing allows for a maximum of 6 occupants, but only includes one parking stall.  This usually means that guests of the B&B end up parking on the street in front of his house, preventing actual residents or visitors to residents of the neighborhood from doing so.  He's also had several loud and/or rowdy guests over the years, which had been an annoyance to my wife and I.  All of that was the basis for my appeal.

Our city regulates B&Bs as a home-based business, and there are zoning requirements that need to be met.  I didn't know at the time (I'd never seen his actual permit variance), but it looks like he hasn't been complying with the requirements he was given.  He's allowed a maximum of 4 guests, and must provide 1 on-site parking stall for every 2 guests.  He's allowing 6 people, with 1 stall.

He also only enforces quiet hours past 11 pm, but our city has noise regulations in effect 24 hours.  I start work early, so I'm typically in bed by 9:00 or 9:30 pm.  My daughter is in bed by 8:00 pm.

454,Asshole,"I am, obviously, considering taking a vacation day from work but not telling my wife about it and instead taking the day to go do what I want in peace.

I currently work a flex schedule where I have every other Friday off so twice a month my wife and I get a week day date just the two of us. Sometimes that is running errands together and sometimes it is going to lunch and just spending time together. So we get lots of us time.

I also happen to travel a lot for work so when I am home she is very prosessive of any time we can get together her and I or as a family. This has translated to it being very difficult for me to do things like see a movie I am interested in that she is not (like John Wick 3 or a certain recent movie of super proportions) or visiting stores that sell stuff for my hobbies. She is also a picky eater who refuses to go to some of my favorite hole in the walls.

So I have been contemplating taking a vacation day and not telling her. Leaving the house at my normal time and treating myself to my favorite breakfast and lunch places, foing to a movie, visiting my favorite hobby stores. Just going and taking a me day.

If she were to find out I know she would be hurt. At the same time with as clingy as things have gotten it is impossible for me to get the time I need for self care.

Just to clarify for all those telling me to talk with her about needing time. I have. For 10 years I have been trying to get her to underatand the importance of self-care for herself and for menas an important part of remaining healthy.

460,Not the A-hole,"I'm F, early 30s. My friend Bethany is F, mid-30s, and I've known her for years. Recently, Bethany had a basal cell carcinoma removed from her face. BCC are the most common type of skin cancer, especially for people who've spent a lot of time in the sun. They can be disfiguring if they're left untreated, but they don't metastasize like other cancers, so they don't really pose a huge risk to your life or health. I've known a couple of other people who have had BCCs, but after initially panicking at hearing the word ""cancer,"" they tend to get it removed without much fanfare.

Bethany, on the other hand, has been posting on social media about living with cancer, the fear of receiving the diagnosis, ""surviving cancer"" and self-identifying as a ""survivor."" She hasn't been specifying what kind of cancer she had, either, so many people are understandably worried. I also know some people who have (or have had) real, capital-C Cancer, the kind where you do chemo and write letters to your loved ones in case you don't make it, so I found Bethany's posts pretty tasteless.

With BCCs, you can get them removed in 10 minutes at the doctor's, usually using topical anesthesia that numbs the area. The day before Bethany was going in for this, she mass-texted our friend group and said she was scared for her ""surgery."" I privately thought she was overstating the procedure a little by calling it that, but I rushed to reassure her. I validated that it was scary, but that she'd be ok, and mentioned something about how I was scared the year prior when I'd had a tumor removed from my abdomen; for context, it was not a malignant tumor, but it was causing problems where it was, which is why they took it out. I had to go into the surgical center and stay there half the day, get prepped, go under general anesthesia, care for the incision site wound for the next few weeks, the whole shebang. Bethany responded to me referencing that experience by saying, ""that's doesn't count. It wasn't cancer."" I didn't want to make a thing of it when she was dealing with her own worries, but that comment *really* rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like I may be taking it too personally, though.

I haven't said anything to Bethany, and I'm not going to, but I've been nursing this intense irritation over the whole situation. Am I a huge asshole for privately policing my friend's language around a medical event that is genuinely frightening to her, especially since it's really the first big health scare of her still youthful life? Am I being too snotty about essentially gatekeeping cancer? Is it petty of me to think of her social media posts as attention-seeking, or to think that they trivialize other people's battles with cancer, given that she does, medically speaking, have a type of cancer? I can't really check my thoughts on this with anyone IRL, so I'd really like a check either way: is this a reasonable thing to privately grumble to myself over, or am I TA?

Edit: I'm kind of surprised by how heavily the comments are leaning toward NTAs, and it's making me think maybe I wrote the post to be too one-sided. I wanted to add a comment I wrote in one of the replies for more context:

I think I may even be understating my irritation in this post. With some of her social media posts that I've felt misrepresented the gravity of the situation, I've felt something closer to--I guess, rage? (That's still too strong a word, but it's sometimes closer to the rage neighborhood than the irritation neighborhood.) It seems like a huge overreaction on my part, and it really did get to the point where, when she would bring up her cancer, it was like a big numb screen would slide over my emotions, like I was fatigued of hearing about it, and I'd just feel annoyed. It got to the point where I would instantly assume bad faith on her part when she'd mention it, assuming she was trying to milk it. Like something inside me would just go, ""oh boy, here we go."" And this is someone I love and care about. It's a bit scary to feel that way, to be honest. And even though I haven't said anything (and I've tried really hard not to let my irritation show in facial expressions, etc.), the fact that I feel this way at all makes me think I may be TA here.",201,621,0.97

Plus I'm a woman so there's always something we're told is terrible about our bodies. But as I got into my 20s I realized my worth more and have really been working on my self esteem. 

So this friend has only known me a year but we met on a dating app (yes we're just friends, no romance) and this is how it began--""wow you look so much better than your pictures! you're so pretty but just not photogenic."" Then as he got to know me, he mentioned that he thinks my professional headshot I use isn't very good. (This one stings a little because I paid for those and tried so hard to look good!!) Selfies I put on social media he says are also not very good. He always criticizes how my smile looks fake or my angle is bad or whatever. Little comments here and there, and I've gotten better through my 20s at shrugging and brushing off this type of criticism. ""Toughen up, it's not a big deal I'm just kidding,"" like my mom and sisters used to say when they teased me about my acne or facial hair.

Today I was complimented on my makeup by a woman I don't know. It made me feel good, so in my refreshed sense of feeling pretty I quickly snapped a selfie and sent it to some friends saying that a stranger just complimented me. All of them responded with their own selfies and ""omg what a babe"" or whatever. Except this one guy! He says ""with all your intelligence and artistic sense, I'm amazed you take such bad pictures."" ""You look like a random stranger, what's up with that smile."" I brushed each comment off but he sent 4 in a row and that tipped me over the edge. I just went off on him, asking him if he considered how that makes me feel and then we got in an argument.

So now he's made me feel dramatic and like I overreact. He says I'm projecting my insecurities on him. I admitted I have embedded insecurities, but he initiated it today! He singlehandedly tore down my good feelings from the compliment (I know, I shouldn't give so much power to one person...). He says ""you're pretty you just take terrible pics""...but I have a hard time accepting that because the pictures *show how I look* and I've done everything I can to be more photogenic but to no avail. So......AITA? Am I oversensitive?? Where is the line between teasing and being mean?

463,Not the A-hole,"So this actually happened a while ago but my parents still say I was in the wrong for doing this so I'd like a second opinion. My son was born a while back, and when he was still pretty young (around 3 months) my parents started expressing their concern over the shape of his head. We took him to all of his regular doctor's appointments and they assured us he was fine, but my parents seemed to think the back of his head was flatter than it should have been. As a note, my parents have always had this mentality of ""you're our child so you should always listen to us 100% because we only want what's best for you so everything we say/do is for your benefit even if you don't understand.""

&#x200B;

Despite the fact that I told them what the doctor said, they (especially my mom) did not relent. She started saying things like ""as someone who had two kids I can assure you that the doctor is wrong."" Then she started sharing diagrams and clinical photos of babies with messed-up heads, saying that my son looked like those (he didn't). I kept telling her that he was fine, but she continued to post more and more stuff. This went on for an entire morning, around 3 hours. I told her not to send me any more stuff, but even then she just kept going, not honoring my request at all. If anything, she didn't even seem to notice that I told her to drop the issue.

&#x200B;

Finally I couldn't take any more. I didn't swear at her or lose my cool or anything, I just flat-out told her that if she won't honor my request to leave us alone about the issue, then neither she nor my father would be allowed to see their grandson again. I then blocked them on all social media and removed them from the photo album of my son without another word. My wife and I also returned every gift they ever gave him. I kept them in this state for around 2 months. Eventually my sister called me and said that anytime either I or my son was mentioned in a conversation, my mom would just break down sobbing.

&#x200B;

That's when I called my parents and told them that I would let them see him again. My mom pulled the ""I just wanted what was best for him"" card, and she also told me that what I did was vile and evil. I was ready to reinstate the block just for saying those things but my wife insisted that I make peace. To this day, my parents still don't understand. My dad told me that he thinks we blocked them because we were uncomfortable with them giving him lots of gifts.

465,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR My best friends didn't go to my b-day party and then asked me to 1)Take us 2)Pay 3)Make the reservation for the movie they ""invited me"" to go after not going to the party, WIBTA for stopping to talk to them?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I have two very good friends (Andy and Gabriel) who we've known each other for about 7 years, we've traveled together and slept at one's houses countless times. But as we've grown things have changed, I got into uni and they haven't, so now they study full time for the SATs and I study and have an internship. It's normal for the daily contact to diminish, I get it.

My birthday arrived and so I invited them to a pizza party, none of them confirmed they would go and they were the only non-family members I had invited. I was bummed because I told them about 1 week prior to it that I would do it. Before I called the restaurant to make the reservation, I gave one of them a call and asked if he could go, he answered saying that he and the other friend would try to go. I got pretty disappointed, first because they probably wouldn't go to my birthday celebration (which is something I rarely do) I had told them about a week prior; and second because if there was something else they were giving priority to the other event (so they would try to go to mine); and third because they were doing it together.

After that I then invited 2 friends I hadn't seen in a long time about 2 hours before the party and they accepted on the spot, the party was great we talked a lot and it made me value more the people who value me.

Next day Andy sent me a message inviting me to go to the movies along with Gabriel to celebrate my birthday and they were sorry they couldn't go. I was happy they were trying to redeem but sad cause they didn't care much not to post pictures of themselves in a barbecue the night of my birthday party on IG. I accepted the invited because why not, they fucked up but bthey are trying to do something.

The day of the movies is today and first they asked if I could take them, I hesitated but ok no problem it's a ride I've given them countless rides. Second they ask me to see where we are going and what time (by now I'm angry, c'mon you invite someone and don't even bother to pick the place? It's a famous movie so most tickets are sold out). And last they ask me to PAY for the tickets. I was furious to see this message. I've paid their tickets and they've paid mine before, but sometimes they don't pay back the things I do for them, I let go because they are close friends, but I always pay them back. After that, I told them I didn't wanna go and stopped speaking to them. I don't wanna lose their friendship but this was really tough for me.

466,Not the A-hole,"My partner passed away 3 years ago. We were together for 15+ years and after a short illness, he left this world and his estate was passed along to his children. He didn’t leave me anything at my urging, as we had enough time to get his will in order and all I wanted from this man was his love. His children (all in their late twenties and thirties) got his home and car, as well as his bank accounts. 

The only things of my partners that I had were his clothing, most of which was in my home at the time of his death. In a spur of goodwill, my partner asked me to donate all of his clothing before he died as it was all expensive and in good condition. I did as he asked but kept a few of his old raggedy t shirts that he used to sleep in. 

My partners eldest daughter visited me over this Easter period, which she will often do once or twice a month. Her dad came up in conversation as he passed very close to the date of her visit, and in a stupid move on my part, I mentioned I had kept some of his sleep shirts and we took them out and reminisced, cried, and hugged. 

Over the last week, I’ve had nothing but numerous calls from her brother- who has always resented and disliked my presence in his fathers life. I met my partner long after he and his children’s mother divorced, but since childhood he has hated me. This has never been resolved. He insisted that I give over the shirts, and accused me of basically being a wicked witch who’s holding on to the last emotional vestiges of his father. 

I called my partners daughter who I’ve always had a very good relationship with and cried to her that I literally have NOTHING left of their dad and the shirts are all I have. She agreed with me and was very kind and said I had a huge right to them and they were mine. She also apologised to me for telling her brother about the existence of the shirts, which I readily accepted as I don’t think she meant any malice. 

However her brother will NOT let up and is insisting I have no need to keep the shirts and he called me in tears begging for the shirts back.

468,Not the A-hole,"I'm still I'm college and got an internship with a small company over the summer. I got through the interview with flying colors and was offered the internship on the spot. I'm super excited because I finally get to work in my field (electrical engineering technology), which is much better than the retail job I have now.

As soon as my mom found out, she started telling me that I should get my brother a job there too. He's in high school, also doing engineering. I told her no, I would not vouch for him, and that I wouldn't even offer his name to my company for two reasons.

The first reason is that I haven't even gone in for orientation yet. I've had the interview, but that's it. She asked me to get him a job there BEFORE MY FIRST DAY.

The second reason is that he had a job at a grocery store, but got fired because he didn't show up to work. He would lie to my parents and say he wasn't scheduled or that all the hours were going to college kids. He would instead play on his Xbox with his friends and no call no show his shifts.

My mom told me that I was being mean and not offering him a chance. She pointed out that I had issues in high school as well, but with school work. 

I told her that I had clinically diagnosed ADHD (my brother has no such disability), which significantly impacted my ability to function as a normal human. I'm not using my ADHD as a get out of jail free card for getting less than As, but ADHD really does make it really hard to focus and do homework.

 I also told her that I was usually at school until 7 every day in the school's nationally ranked science program AND worked weekends at the same grocery store my brother got fired from. I had many more things going on, but I NEVER missed a shift at work, no matter how tired I was.

She's insisting I'm being unreasonable with not helping me get my brother a job at my internship place. She keeps going on and on about how nice it would be if we could work together and that she would drive us to work and home.

I don't want to put my name or reputation on the line for somebody who, in my mind, has proven himself too irresponsible to bag groceries. Plus, I'm 21 and being driven to and from work with my brother seems like my mom is trying to keep an uncomfortably tight leash on me.

For the past few months a girl in my school has brought her dog into the school with a service dog vest fake ids.
At first it didnt mind as i also have a service dog and it was a cool thing to see someone else have one until she let people pet the dog that is. (Thats not the only thing that she has done) When i would pass her though and see people petting the dog i would get mad but i would try to tell her that her dog has a job and people shouldnt be able to pet it. She became defensive and started yelling at me that it is her dog and people can pet it. Later that week the dog would come up to me and smell me and jump up on me. The dog is a small dog so i didnt notice until it barked and i would tell her to control her dog she would again get mad and yell at me. Recently her dog has been using the bathroom in the hall ways and the school said they couldnt do anything without proof that the dog is fake.
So i asked my brother in law who trains service animals if her vest and badge was real. He said they weren't and sent me photos of real vests and badges and the website she bought them from along with proof that the website wasnt a real service dog website.

473,Not the A-hole,"So my boyfriend and I currently live with my mom. He has two siblings who are severely irresponsible and are constantly asking for help, despite not making any efforts to better their situation. They have not been trying to find a job but they mooch off of the family. He has two other siblings who actually have their shit together. We’re moving to the city where one responsible and one irresponsible sibling lives. My boyfriends mom will have a room in our apartment for when she’s in town. She’ll be paying a smaller portion of rent. 

My boyfriend was on the phone with his brother who lives there. He was telling us how their irresponsible sister, husband, and three kids are supposedly getting evicted. We don’t know if it true or not but it’s a very huge possibility. They lived with him for two months and completely drained him of money and personal space. During that time neither of them got a job and just stayed as long as they could and “saved” money that they got from people. I’m truly horrified that that might happen to us when my boyfriend and I get our apartment. 

So after the phone call, I told my boyfriend “They are NOT moving in with us whatsoever. I don’t care”. He agrees in a way but he has this family matters mindset. There’s nothing wrong with that and I wish my siblings were like that but I refuse to house a whole family in a small 2 bedroom apartment. 

Now we’re kind of talking about it with his brother. His brother is saying how he wishes he would’ve said no. He’s still recovering from the financial damage. He had to pay 3x the amount of money for food and utilities and it ate through his savings. 

Anyways, I told my boyfriend how I’m worried that their mom will be the one to invite them to our apartment, since she’s paying some of the rent. I’m worried that his mom will immediately tell them to come live with “us” if they get evicted. They all know that his brother will not do it again, neither will his girlfriend who also lived there. 

So I told my boyfriend that if they are getting evicted, our apartment isn’t welcome to them. I told him I love them but we can’t take on their responsibilities because they refuse to try to make a better life for themselves. 

He got offended because we’re always helping them so I guess he didn’t expect such a harsh reaction. Now we’re not really talking about it because he doesn’t want to argue. He’s keeping to himself. I don’t want to argue either but I feel like this is definitely something that needs to be discussed AND prevented.

Edit: They spend twice their rent on weed. $30 EVERY day. That’s about $900 a month and their rent is $465. They can easily pay their rent if they can pull $30 out their ass to spend every single day.",55,233,0.97

I've taken the last little while to enjoy my time and explore my career options, while my girlfriend continues to work full time. We've discussed going on vacation quite a lot during the time I was still employed, but with a rather large expense coming up (that I will be covering 95% of), I wanted to make sure we would be financially stable before planning any trips.

We were looking at vacation packages as there are some decent sales going on, but as I am still technically unemployed, I'm hesitant to set anything in stone. We looked at quite a few options and I could tell she was getting really excited at the prospect of spending a week on the beach somewhere, but when she was not forthcoming, I asked if she was intending to split the cost (i.e. pay for herself) and she said no.

I just told her that I'm disappointed in her and that I'll be going for a walk as I personally dont understand that mindset, especially with her working fulltime.

We have a prenup that excludes the rental property from marital assets in the event of a divorce. I was/am totally OK with this. Just because people are going to ask, we both have full-time jobs and I make more than he does (by quite a bit).
 
Recently, there was some severe water damage to that rental property and it needs quite a bit of construction to fix the damage. He wants to use some of our marital savings to pay for the construction. I said absolutely not; it’s his property so he needs to pay for it with his own personal savings. He didn’t like that and argued that since we are married we are a team so we need to conquer this together. 

I do not agree. If our marital house had this same damage, I wouldn’t think twice about using marital funds but don’t think it’s fair to use them on his property. He made it perfectly clear that the property was not marital property so I have a huge issue in spending marital funds on that property. I argue that I receive no benefit by putting my money into his property (I will never see a return nor receive my money back) so I will not allow the expense. I’ve instead offered to loan him money (interest-free) via a contract with structured repayment period but he won’t agree to that as “I’m making it more complicated that it needs to be”.

Context: My (f18) boyfriend (m19) and I have been dating nearly two years. We attended the same highschool together for six years. Last year, I attended most of his graduation dates. I stayed at his rehearsal for graduation, attended the senior chapel, and his graduation. 

We have never had any major problems in our relationship except his inability to schedule or be on time. A recent example is our senior prom. 

For his senior prom, I showed up to his house three hours before when we needed to arrive. I asked him to be ready to leave for class pictures when I got there. I arrive and he is showering. We miss class pictures, and nearly miss our reservation required dinner as well. I let it slide because it was his prom and he had freedom to do whatever.

For my senior prom, I let him know the date months in advance so he could ask off work so we could do pictures and have a rolling schedule because that's what works best for us. He didn't ask off for work because he forgot about prom. He let's me know a week before so I have to reschedule our pictures and not attend our class dinner. I really wanted to attended the dinner because I have a class of 17 students and we are very close.

Cut to today. Last night he let me know that he forgot to let his dad know my graduation dates so they wouldn't plan a trip overseas during that time. So he is missing my senior chapel, senior breakfast, graduation, and graduation party. I let him know how upset I was and that I was mad at him. He asked me to ""give him some slack ... it was a human mistake.""

I had let him know many times when my graduation was and how important it was for me to have him attend. I sent his family announcements to my senior breakfast and graduation and I talked about it a lot. Am I the Asshole?

This whole week S has been crying and bitching when ever someone talked to her. Telling everyone that it's ""unfair"" and that her teachers are the reason she did so bad.

The first time she started crying saying that her teacher was mean to her I went and talked to him. The ""verbal harassment"" was sitting down with her during his office hours to tell her she statistically cannot pass his class due to not even showing up to the midterm.

She has failed 6 of the 8 classes she took and the ones she passed were with c-. Because of this she was suspended for 1 semester and cannot fail again.

488,No A-holes here,"My school is terrible about discussing mental health. So me and my friend became ambassadors for ‘wellbeing’ of students. This means we do mentoring with younger years, set up talks and sessions and I aim to be accepted into a program where we teach years 7 -10 about mental health and its importance. 

The well being Officer- the teacher above us, sets up talks and gets in speakers. She’s lovely but very pc. She asked my friend to make posters but since I’m an art student, my friend passed the task to me. I did it happily. No payment,  I love to help. 

One poster was for mindfulness discussion. So I drew a very simple side angle of a head with the brain on show. As well as all the information. My friend loved it and I moved on to the second. It was a talk on body image. One part of my a level is EPQ where you choose what you learn and make a course work based final project on it over 2 year. I chose mental health in teenage boys and how it’s treated differently to girls. While Researching for the poster I noticed that most body image company logos and associated pictures were of female bodies, despite it being a male issue too, though lesser. Thinking ahead I decided to draw the bathroom signs- male and female- and use a blue and pink colour scheme on both posters so that no one felt like they couldn’t go to the talk....

My friend loved them. Even gave me a Toblerone for my trouble, but the teachers response really annoyed me... she said- quoting her email- ‘i am mindful about gender normative assumptions’ and said I should change the picture so that there is a non-binary person in the middle.... keep in mind we’re a very small faith school. In the school’s history there have been very few ‘trans’ people. One is my best friend, who left the school after not feeling welcome from other students. She’s non-binary (And uses the She her pronoun before anyone goes tumblr on my ass) the other  other I know of is a kid in year 9 but they’re completely trans. 

Wouldn’t the kids just identify with whichever?do I really need to add a third gender to my poster to possibly please a very small minority? I have no problem with trans or non-binary.... I just think it’s ridiculous to change something I spent a long time on to make its less ‘gender normative’.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to change it?

(Edit: I am going to change the poster. It’s frustrating and I’m a little reluctant but it is my friends task and she wants to me the teacher happy. Thank you for all the comments informing me a little better on trans people and the spectrum of gender)

(Edit 2: okay so the teacher emailed me again nit picking further and it’s frustrating me more now. I’m not allowed to use the word ‘discussion’ and must use ‘safe space’ for the body image talk because it can put people off? Please tell me I’m not insane for thinking this is strange. I also wanna clarify that I don’t hate trans or non-binary people. I just didn’t think a single poster with both the universally known male and female body on a poster for a body image ‘safe space’ really needed a third gender. I wanted to show boys that they should come to the session.)

(Edit 3: I’ve seen a couple comments confused on the purpose of the poster- it’s for body image. Talking about how it can lead to anorexia and bulimia and how dangerous they are. The issue of gender arose when I put a male body on the poster as well as female in order to encourage boys to go to the talk as well. Obviously if the talk was specifically LGBT+ then I wouldn’t have a problem, but the talk isn’t about gender. At all. It’s about your body and the self harm of eating disorders)",114,252,0.87
489,Asshole,"Obviously at first glance this sounds bad, which is why I made this post.

Compared to my friend group, I’m a big golfer. None of them had really ever had interest in it in the past other than me. I still rarely ever played but if anyone within the group was considered the golf guy it was likely me.

Recently I’ve had a few different friends ask me to go to the driving range with them, after a few visits I saw a membership discount card where you pay an upfront fee and get cheaper balls, after about 20ish visits it pays for itself and you’re getting cheaper balls. It was a gamble since I didn’t know how much I’d really go but I bought it.

After I bought it, I buy a bucket of balls for $10 ($14 without discount) to split with them. When asking for payment I charge them $7, and I “charge myself” $7 as well. This way we each contributed $2 to the cost of the card. This is how I planned on paying for the card when I originally purchased it, although I did not tell anyone. If I go alone, I charge myself $4 for the bucket to go towards the cost of the card. My plan is that after 20 visits, I’ll have $100 from overcharging and the card will be “free” for everyone to enjoy, meaning that once its paid off I’ll only charge the $10 price to split. 

Now some of my friends have said that it’s not fair that I’m basically expecting them to pay for my card. I see where they’re coming from, but they’re paying the same price they would have had I never gotten the card, and once it’s paid off they’ll be able to enjoy it with me for free. Given that I have to be there to use the card I’m already contributing the most, and I also go alone sometimes too.

Ultimately I see where they’re coming from, but I feel like what I’m doing is better for everyone. I know it was my decision and I didn’t consult anyone but I feel like since it didn’t change anything for anyone upfront, and eventually we all get cheaper balls that it’s better for everyone.

That being said, he really is not a fan of unnatural hair colors. I am a natural brunette and love to experiment and play with my hair. I have in the past had pink and teal hair and he has hated it. He has even said that he is embarrassed to be seen with me when my hair is a crazy color and made frequent jokes about it (like calling me ""anime"" or saying it looks silly on someone over 30). It hurt my feelings, but he did say upfront that he wouldn't like it and I want to be attractive to him and both times I've gone back to brunette in under a month.

Well, I really have been wanting purple hair for a while now. I am a stay at home mom, so I feel like this is a time in my life when I can get away with an unprofessional look. I even have been looking at dark purples that may not be as noticeable with my dark roots. I think it would look super cute.

AITA if I dye it purple? Right now I have brunette roots and a golden blonde ombre (that the purple would go on). I don't think fun and colorful hair has an age limit, but also don't want to look foolish. Help!

I do just want to point out that I truly don't think he is saying he's embarrassed to be seen with me out of cruelty.

493,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway because I'm active on my city's subreddit and people would instantly know the school I'm talking about. 

We have been sending our kids to a pre-school for the last 4 years. It shares (we thought) our values, we like that it's mostly outdoors, the kids run around barefoot, they are taught about nutrition, they raise chickens, build tree-forts, and on and on. It really is a wonderful place. They also do wonderful nights for adults as well and for example Elizabeth Warren, Alexandra Occacio-Cortez and several local progressive politicians have hosted meet and greets at the school and we love it. 

Early this year there was a new mom who's kid was accepted into the school. She is single and very much struggling so the director made an exception and reduced her tuition since the school saved her almost 1.5 hour commute in dropping her kid off. I like her a lot. But she is very ""cute,"" she also very much looks like she learned how to be ""hippy"" from Instagram which I think rubs a lot of the real ""hippies"" in their 40s the wrong way. There is no doubt that she gets way more glances from the dad's driving in her topless jeep than the rest of the moms do. 

I slowly started to notice that the director and other moms were making comments behind her back. This bothered me to no end but I figured it was none of my business and the most I could do would be nice to the new mom. Well yesterday I dropped my kids off and found the new mom crying in her car. I told her I was sorry to interrupt but wanted to make sure she was ok. She said that her kid loved the preschool but she just wasn't fitting in and she was thinking about leaving. I asked her why and she said this lady named ""Hope"" had come up to her and told her directly that her dress was drawing the ""wrong kind of attention"" (the new mom is first grade teacher and was dresses like...a first grade teacher) and she was sick of people just being ""mean."" I told her how sorry I was and she drove off. 

I went to talk to the director and the director told me to my face ""if she doesn't want to be treated like that, maybe she shouldn't act like that."" I was knocked off my feet. I asked her to clarify. She said ""she shouldn't look like she's wearing mommy's dress up clothes."" I told her this a single mom we're talking about not a TV show character. Director told me ""well hopefully she figures it out and she won't have to worry about it."" I told her that this isn't what I expected from this school, she said she's never had to ""deal with"" a mom like ""that"" before. I left furious. 

I am livid and so disappointed. I never want to set foot inside this school again. My husband is on board but our kids would be devastated. They love the school and the program does have value, plus their friends but I feel like I'm in the middle of hypocrite city here.

494,No A-holes here," I want to get one thing out of the way - Islam goes against everything I stand for. I'm a bi ex-muslim woman and as you can probably infer I don't think highly of Islam. I don't really care if I get downvoted or called Islamophobic or whatever, it's sad but the truth is is Islam is higher than homosexuality on the oppression Olympics.

&#x200B;

 I want to provide some background: I was raised in the US as a Muslim, lost faith and discovered my sexuality at 13, came out as both ex-muslim and bi at 18 and was kicked out immediately after. I've found my footing since then and made a lot of connections with other ex-muslims. When my ex husband and I met he was a Muslim on paper only, he didn't pray, drunk alcohol, and had sex. He had no problem with the fact that I was an ex-muslim & bi and said he was only step more religious than me. We got married and agreed any children we have will be raised non-religious. 

&#x200B;

  Everything went fine, my son was born, the topic of religion barely came up again but a year ago I asked him what would happen if our son turned out gay. He dodged the question but I kept pressuring him to answer till he said it would go against his religion and he wasn't going to turn out gay because he'd ""raise him right"". That was the first nail to our marriage. He got progressively more religious over time, started praying, stopped eating pork, etc. The last straw however was when he tried to recruit me to Islam again by saying I'm going to hell (for being bi, I've only kissed a woman once but sure). Fuck that.

&#x200B;

  I filed for divorce and got main custody of my son. He has him every other weekend and we did our best to cooperate for our son. However come today my son asked me some questions about religion and when I inquired he said his father had been teaching him about Islam and telling him he's a Muslim. I called my ex and he didn't try denying, he just said that he has a right to raise our son as a Muslim and had the nerves to accuse me of infringing on his freedom of religion. I sat down my son, explained there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, and that no he wasn't a Muslim. 

&#x200B;

 I don't want my son to be a battlefield between us but fuck no he's not going to be raised a Muslim. I've talked to friends about this and all my ex-muslim/atheist friends agreed with me but everyone else said that I was an asshole (one even called me a bigot - he isn't a friend anymore) and that my ex has just as much right as me to raise our son as whatever religion he wants. Technically true sure, but I still don't want our son to be raised a Muslim. I realize I'm biased against Islam however and a friend suggested I post here, so please tell me if I'm being unreasonable or not.",727,2365,0.9

Firstly, thank you to everyone who gave advice regarding this situation. Here’s an update: 

I started by arranging a meeting with him, we had a serious talk and it seems that he really wants to be involved the kids lives. After thinking through everything, I’ve decided to give him another chance

There was one meeting with him and the kids so far. I feel that it was a success? We both cried and the twins were happy to see their dad. He was super sweet to them

496,No A-holes here,"I have this friend who I love to death, but she is one of those people who is constantly saying she’s broke when I know she’s not. Her definition of broke is being over budget for spending money this month, but she still easily pays her bills and has thousands in her savings acct. my definition of broke is breaking down in line at the grocery store because I only have $7 to my name until my next paycheck and I already maxed out my credit card (thankfully I haven’t been that desperate in a while but I still live paycheck to paycheck and haven’t bought myself a new clothing item in literally years). She is always buying nice handmade clothes and decor from fancy artists, or tickets to events that cost hundreds. She gets takeout often. Still, she sticks to her budget with godly precision so if she doesn’t want to pay for something like going to a bar on the rare occasion that I can, instead of simply saying no she’ll complain (like full on groaning) that she’s so broke and has no money for going out. She’ll go into long rants about how much something cost or a loan she’s still paying back. 

She has always been financially secure, partly due to good luck and mostly due to being great with her money. So I’m happy for her that she is so successful because she deserves it. And the real part that has me conflicted is that she’s really generous with me. She knows I will never ask for anything so she will randomly buy me gifts or surprise me by paying for a big night out. Or offer to pay me for a small job she needs help with. So she clearly is thoughtful and does a lot for me. I try to pay her back here and there by doing small things like making dinner for us or buying our drinks, but I’m never anywhere near able to break even with her.

But it still really aggravates me when she incessantly turns the conversation to money when her and I are both well aware of each of situations. I already always feel bad about how much I owe to her and I don’t know why she feels the need to use words that suggest she’s poor the way I actually am.

500,No A-holes here,"So I’ll start by saying that I am an Occupational Therapist specialising in paediatrics and part of my current job, is to assess a range of children for different disorders and development delay. I have a friend at dance class who brings her 3yo son and I have been becoming concerned over his behaviour and her own mental health. Her son shows some delayed development for example, he is not yet speaking, does not engage/respond with other people - only mum, does not respond to his name, he falls a lot, he will only eat McDonalds, refuses to drink water and is extremely attached to mum that when she leaves the room to use the bathroom, he will begin crying and will take a long time to resettle when she returns. At times, he is unable to resettle and mum will often leave before the class has begun. Her son has been attending the dance studio for almost a year now so it’s not an unfamiliar place. 

One of the other girls who is a student studying early childhood has also expressed concern to me however, she felt it was not her place to say anything as a student. 

In my professional opinion and based on my experience, I believe that my friends son has a developmental delay and he would greatly benefit from early diagnosis and management. By telling my friend about my concerns, I am hoping that she will be able to get the extra support he needs and that this will lead to more positive outcomes in the future for both of them. 

My friend has said previously that she does not know ‘what’s wrong with him lately’ as well as said she will need to stop dance classes because she needs energy and time to focus on him. I am not sure whether she has seen a doctor or therapist yet for him or if she knows that he needs support. 

I am not sure what to do as I do not have children myself and don’t want to come across as if I am saying that there is something wrong with her parenting or her son. I also don’t want to overstep my boundaries as we are not very close friends. 

So WITBA if I told my friend that I am concerned about her son’s development? 

TL:DR - A friend at dance class has a son who has shown signs of developmental delay and I think he would greatly benefit from professional support. Should I say something?

Edit: Thank you so much for your responses. It’s been really helpful. I’d like to clarify a few things. The reason I brought up that my friends son only eats McDonald’s was that we see a lot of children with sensory aversions who will not eat certain colours (usually green for vegetables) or textures but will eat fast food. I guess I was putting in my own assumption here that it is possible that he may a have a sensory aversion and that’s why he will only eat McDonalds. However, of course, I would not be certain unless I delved more into it with my friend. Again, I mentioned that my friends son becomes upset when separating from her. We see a lot of children with separation anxiety who miss opportunities of development, growth, socialisation and incidental learning in places like playgroups, childcare and kinder because they become upset when leaving their parent. This again, is an assumption and further assessment would be needed to see if there is something else going on. So I apologise if I sounded judgemental in my post.  Again, thank you all for your responses!",255,1174,0.97

503,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and moved in together a year ago. I really do love him, but living with him has been driving me crazy and I don't know if I'm being reasonable, or I'm being a jerk.

As important context, not only do I have OCD but I grew up in a family where everyone had their own things. We shared space, but I had a different shampoo from my sister - she would never use mine and I would never use her's. There were always snacks in the cupboard that were specifically for kids' lunches - my parents would never eat them - and I would never eat anything I knew my parents had bought specifically for themselves. We only ever shared personal items (clothes, toiletries, snacks etc.) with permission: you would always ask first. That kind of thing. 

My boyfriend is an only child and everything they had was shared. He and his parents used the same shampoo, soap, toothpaste. There was no ""my snacks vs your snacks"" and if he needed to borrow a shirt he could just grab one from his dad's closet. And this has translated into us living together.

If he runs out of soap? He uses mine. If he forgets to do laundry and has no socks? He borrows mine (and stretches them out!) If he's hungry he eats whatever he can find - even if they're granola bars or something that I purchased specifically to take in to work and there are multiple other snack options in the house. He needs change for the laundry but has none? He'll go into my purse, get my wallet and take some. It's not just personal items, it extends to anything I bring into the house. I bought some microfibre cloths to use for cleaning, specifically I bought three: one for the bathroom, one for the kitchen and one to use for dusting the books. He took one because he wanted it for the back of his chair? It's just sitting there I don't understand but when I asked for it back he said he was using it and I can't have it. So now I need to get another.

I think it wouldn't bother me so much if he asked, but he doesn't. I would never have described myself as a hugely private person but I feel uncomfortable when I find him wearing my socks, knowing he's dug through my drawers. And I would have never described myself as possessive but apparently I am because I get so annoyed to discover that the snack I had set aside for my lunches has been eaten. 

We've talked about it before, and his attitude is basically ""what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine and everything in the house is shared."" This sounds reasonable to me, and I get it, but that doesn't stop me from getting annoyed. But because it sounds reasonable I've never really expressed how much it irritates me, because I don't want to seem like I'm being a douche.

Now he wouldn't have gotten 6000 dollars if it wasn't for me. My tuition tax credits were applied to his return. He also got me as a spouse, so around 3000 of his return was due to me.   

AITA for wanting atleast some of the money that was returned to him? I feel like I don't want to say anything because it's his money, but on the other hand it's also because of me that he got such a large return. The government automatically assumes that because I don't earn income that I am a dependant to him, but I pay for myself, which he is aware of. I have debt that I would like to pay off, but he said he is just going to pay his credit card, which is debt he acquired with his ex girlfriend. 

I have a 1500 dollar credit card that I would like to pay down, all which was acquired while we were together, but I don't know if it is assholish to ask for his tax return.

I usually do not order much since the coffee is already quite expensive and I take a long time to finish one. I ordered a medium size coffee and went to work. During the three hours I sat there the waiter asked me two times if I wanted anything else, even though I had not finished my coffee yet. I felt a bit pressured and decided to leave.

So during checkout the barista said to me: ""Please pay attention to how much you are spending, we ask you to order at least 1 drink per hour"". Me, being quite surprised about that comment and having visited that place quite often without them ever telling me this just said: ""Oh, sorry I did not know"". Afterwards, I thought it was kind of unfair because I did not even spend that much time there and drinking one cup an hour seems ridiculous.

I honestly do feel guilty at times for sitting in a cafe for a full day with only one coffee, but this seems a bit too much.

So AITA for not ordering more than one coffee when working at a cafe?

**EDIT**: So a bit more info about the cafe. They do not have a lot of employees, so usually you just order at the counter. The waiter is also the barista. They ask you if you would like anything else when they come and clean up. The place promotes itself as a flex work spot, so it really is not like a fancy cafe. Everyone there is working on their laptops.

I live in Rome and it's really hard to respect the rules when everyone does not give a single fuck and traffic is crazier than animals running in a fucking zoo.

I wasn't nervous and didn't freak out at all because I was paying attention and I saw him perfectly on time, so I started breaking and I completely stopped like 2 or 1 meters in front of him (he was crossing the street DIAGONALLY, so he also came closer to me walking his direction)

This dude is watching me and seems serious or upset so I look at him in a way of ""I'm listening, what's your concern"" and he tells me that I should have started breaking much earlier.

I don't do stuff that he wouldn't approve of (that often), but it still feels a little bit overbearing when I get home and sometimes he knows exactly where I've been.

I sort of forced the issue a while ago by creating my own Apple account (I had always used his in the past because of app purchases I didn't want to give up, etc.) and he almost immediately noticed and made me join his Apple Family or whatever it's called. I didn't put up much of a fight since I didn't really feel it was worth it at the time, however now I can barely leave the house without feeling like he is looking over my shoulder. He told me that despite me being an adult, while I still live in his house, he will be tracking my phone, so that if something happens to me or my phone they'll be able to help quicker. I appreciate his concern if it's genuine, but I don't feel like that's a valid reason to be actively monitoring me whenever I leave the house, so I'm wondering WIBTA for pushing this issue further.

Also, even if I do push it, I highly doubt it would end well for me, so I'm wondering if I should just bite the bullet until I go off to college.

EDIT: My dad pays for my phone and the cell bill, but I have expressed in the past that I have been willing to pay for it myself.",44,103,0.95

509,Not the A-hole,"So Yesterday I went out with a couple of girls to the club. We were chatting, and since we have a lot of mutual friends. Since I'm gay they asked if I could (Lets call him Sponge bob) have slept with sponge bob. They asked if I thought Sponge bob was hot. They began encouraging that I should hook up with him, and I refused to answer, he's one of my bros, and he's not even gay, why in the world would I do that?

Then after declining, I jokingly said that (Lets call her Rebecca) Rebecca's boyfriend was pretty handsome. She laughed at first, but then suddenly they all left the club building without telling me and talked to someone. Later I got a message from Sponge bob (He's best friends with Rebecca's boyfriend) saying ""The girls, think you're annoying, could you avoid them?"". Then when they came back I try to talk to Rebecca but (Let's call her Jill) Jill grabs my arm and says: ""You shouldn't have said that, she's really upset. Could you just not hang out with us? This was really just a girls night out.""

The rest of the night they looked at me in disgust. I almost just got there, and since I am poor I didnt want to waste the enterance fee. So I spent a good 30 minutes alone, but since I am a damn god when it comes to making drunk friends, I ended up in the VIP lounge.

I mean like, all I did was give her boyfriend (Who wasnt even there) a compliment, is that so wrong?",25,26,0.75
510,Asshole,"Roughly one and a half years ago I got new neighbors. They moved into the apartment right below mine (I live alone), with a newborn baby. Shortly after they moved in (Oct '17) the baby started screaming, not just crying, screaming several times a day, every day. You should know, that I grew up in a big family. I'm used to noises around me. Even really loud stuff never really disturbed me in my peace.

&#x200B;

At that time I worked full-time in retail, which meant that most of the time I worked all day and when I came home I was super tired and just fell asleep right away. In other words, I didn't notice the screaming very much. That changed as soon as I started studying (Sept '18). I was more at home and the time I spent at home wasn't just for relaxing. I have to work from home quite a lot. So not only did I notice the baby more, it also felt as if the crying became more frequent and (I don't know how else to describe it) more painful. The crying didn't just sound like ""I'm cold"", ""I want my mom"" or whatever, but more as if the kid was in pain (I'm pretty sure the parents didn't actually do anything to their baby, that's just what the crying sounded like).

&#x200B;

It got so far, that I simply couldn't work at home anymore (Dec '18). I got myself a membership-card for a really nice library nearby, where I at least could study.

&#x200B;

Sadly the baby would start crying at (seemingly) random times every day and night. Around February this year I got so incredibly annoyed and irritated by the non-stop mayhem downstairs, that, whenever the baby was having one of it's episodes, I simply started shouting ""PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP"". But that degraded to a simple ""SHUT THE F\*CK UP ALREADY!"". I know this definitely wasn't the best approach, but to be honest, I just couldn't take it anymore. What made it even more irritating, is that the screaming didn't stop until I made myself heard. Almost as if the parents didn't care about their kid, until they realized that someone can hear them, but that's just speculation.

&#x200B;

For me it got to far, when my sleep schedule got heavily affected by the constant screaming, and I actually failed one of my exams because I didn't get any sleep the night before.

&#x200B;

Today I decided to call the Department of Children and Families \[DCF\], because I'm genuinely not sure whether the baby is taken care of, plus I'm simply desperate.

&#x200B;

The guys from the DCF came right away, and only minutes after they left, the mother came knocking on my door. I opened the door, she asked me if I reported them, I said ""Yes"". She was obviously pissed and said, that she tolerated me long enough (excuse me?) and that they will move out. I don't know what really happened between them and the people from DCF and if that has anything to do with their decision.

&#x200B;

It never really was my plan to get them to move, but now that it's actually happening, I can't say that I'm upset.

511,Not the A-hole,"okay so my brother is great and all but he has the worst fucking habit of sleeping in and not doing anything at all. 

I'm talking coming home at 6.30pm and sleeping when he knows that family dinner is at 7. and it's the only family time we get and my parents always get angry and disappointed because they just want to see their son. because he never spends time in the living room, and he just locks himself in his room unless he needs food or he's going out. I barely see him for a cumulated hour in all 7 days of the week.

and his excuse? ""I'm tired from school. I don't click well with my parents. I have nothing to talk about. I just want to sleep."" or not waking up in the morning and missing trainings and family events. and he gets pissy and bratty and all around selfish when we wake him up and this has went on for YEARS and my parents just gave up. 

his lack of discipline disgusts me and its constantly a topic where my parents still defend him??? 

anyway, to the topic where we crashed at a friend's and we were all going out for breakfast, but when I woke him up, he gave me the worst attitude and told me to ""fuck off I want to sleep I don't want breakfast."" ok fine. went out and then he texted me ""can you buy me breakfast?""

I lost my shit and told him to fuck off, over text. My reasoning was that if I said yes and bought him breakfast, he would just take it as though he could just ask people to do things without his own effort, which worsens lack of self-discipline. I want him to fucking learn that he can't just expect everything to revolve around his selfish ass. 

My parents found out and they were like ""how could you do that. he is your brother."" like that changes anything?? and he's completely pissed and he's not looking at/talking to me. lol AITA???

512,Not the A-hole,"Before anyone asks... I don’t usually believe or seek the services of clairvoyants. 

I received a Facebook msg from a lady one day, who claimed she was a clairvoyant. She told me that she types random names into Facebook, and the person that she feels a connection too, she will offer them a free reading, as long as they are willing to offer feedback. She says she does this in order to practice her skills, 

Anyway, she told me a whole bunch of stuff regarding my boyfriend that was freakily accurate. She said that my boyfriend has a scar on his chest that he’s super self conscious about, that he often stresses over work because he’s a manager in construction, that he has been cheated on before and has trust issues, that he’s insecure about his height... all this stuff was 100% true and stuff that I’ve actually picked up on and have been thinking about. It freaked me out. 

She said that it’s likely my boyfriend will dump me in three months because he has a tendency to jump into relationships without thinking, deep down he has a fear of commitment because of his past history of being cheated on by his first love (he did get cheated on, and he still sometimes talks about it). 

I honestly started to wonder if I should break up with him, we have only been dating for a couple months. Before I did, I asked the “clairvoyant”, a question in order to test her claims. I asked her what is one weird thing about my boyfriend that only few people would know, she replied saying “he has impulses to pull out his body hair on his arms when he’s nervous or anxious”. I was gob smacked and convinced. 

She said some stuff about me too that was pretty accurate, about how I’m concerned right now about decorating my house. She said I was looking at neutral colours for the house and she’s right. 

Anyways, I showed my boyfriend and he kinda freaked out. He admitted that most of its true and that he’s had commitment issues in the past. We had a long talk, and I told him it’s over. 

I’ve been fine for the most part, however his friends have been pretty cold towards me. Which has me thinking I’m the asshole, 

What makes things worse, is the “psychic” actually ended up being his ex girlfriend, trying to manipulate me into breaking up with him. She made a fake profile and guess she hunted around enough to gain knowledge about me and the house. My boyfriend knows, but he said that he doesn’t want to be with me anymore and he’s moved on quickly (within two weeks!) with someone else. 

So yeah, sucks. It’s all so fucking crazy. 

So AITA?

EDIT: a lot of people are saying I’m gulliable and naive, which is true, however I do want to explain that this lady went to incredible lengths to be convincing. She linked me to a website that she pretended was hers, the lady on the website was the same lady in her fake fb profile. She also asked me to place feedback or a review on the website. It was all pretty convincing.",127,62,0.69
513,Not the A-hole,"This is a bit of a long story- bear with me. Sorry for formatting and typos, I'm on mobile. TL;DR at the bottom.

Ok so, back story. Names changed for anonymity. We have a new girl(we can call her Amy) at work, and she overheard a manager call me by my name(let's just say...Sarah). She asked me, ""Wait, Sarah...Hughes?"" And I said, ""Yes... Do I know you?"" She told me I didn't know her, but her fiance, ""Derek Fisher."" 

I froze in place. This guy is an ex of mine from 6 years ago. Normally I wouldn't care, but he was emotionally abusive. He allowed his friends to try and touch me inappropriately. He controlled me and everything I did, and he treated me like a cheater because a ""friend"" of mine assaulted me, in the worst kind of way. After I broke things off with ""Derek,"" he tried to assault my dad for protecting me. And after I blocked him on all social media, things got worse. He would drive past my house daily, show up at my job, message my friends asking me where I am and what I'm up to.. I went to the police but they wouldn't grant me a restraining order because, while he did all those things, he never confronted me or entered my property.. so it wasn't enough... He eventually turned to drugs and blamed me if he ever killed himself. A whole bunch of fucked up shit basically. And he had his mom text me saying his problems were all my fault. Yada yada.

Ok back story over. So after the initial shock, she kept assuring me he changed. And told me she knew I worked here because HE told her. I'm just wondering how he knew when he's blocked everywhere and I don't talk to any of his friends. 

So now, she thinks that because we have something in common, I'm her new best friend. It's all, ""Derek did this, Derek said that."" And I don't want to hear it. I don't want anything to do about it, but I feel like I will come across like a bitch if I say something. 

Tonight at work though, everything came to a head. He shows up to hang out(I work at a bar). Now, I know she can't possibly know everything he did to me, because if she did, she would know how inappropriate it is for him to even come there. He eventually moved to my section too to play pool. So he was basically right next to me while I was talking to my tables..

This whole situation is extremely uncomfortably and I don't know how to navigate it without being an asshole. Because in her frame of context for him, he's a great dude that she loves. But to me, he is/was a terrible fucking person. So reddit, WIBTA for telling her to stop talking about him / having him hang out at work?

TL;DR: New coworker tells me her fiance is an ex of mine from 6 years ago who was abusive; now won't stop talking about him because he's common ground. He shows up at work, and this is just an awkward, uncomfortable situation to be in..",45,156,0.96

515,Not the A-hole,"I live on an Island in the Pacific. My husband is really into freediving and spearfishing and got me into it as well. His best friend and dive partner (BF) has a boat we take out regularly. 

Since his friend got the boat, I've always gone topless on it. It's not like I'm laying out in a g-string topless, it more when we get out of the water we all take off our wetsuits and put on board shorts. 

My husband and his best friend aren't bothered by me going topless at all. I once asked his friend if he had an issue with it and he responded ""if I don't have to wear a shirt why should you?"" 

Cue a recent dive trip. My husband's BF brought a friend who is Mormon. Mormon didn't have his own gun so I let him borrow mine. He could barely get past thirty feet. Had no clue what he was doing. He was a total kook.

We dive at one spot for a while and decide to go check someplace else. I get out of the water first, change into board shorts and start helping my husband and his BF get their guns and gear back on the boat. 

The Mormon guy doesn't come back on the boat right away. I go to store some stuff and my husband comes up and says ""BF asked nicely if you could put a top on, Mormon is uncomfortable."" I asked if he was serious and he said yes, I needed to put a top on. 

I put a shirt on (I didn't even bring a bikini top), but I was not happy. I went to the bow of the ship, pulled up a book on my phone and skipped the next dive. My husband could tell that I was upset, but I was polite to everyone the rest of the day and no one else noticed I was pissed.  

Later that night my husband, BF and I went to dinner. BF casually mentioned me having to put a shirt on. I told him and my husband that they discriminated against me because I'm a woman, to make a Mormon guy, who apparently thinks tits needs to be hidden, more comfortable. (Note: I know it's not actionable illegal discrimination. Also, there is no law against female toplessness where I live). That it wasn't cool.

They are both very liberal guys. Both denied it was discrimination. I argued that it's even though it's not in the same world as what some people face, and as far as discrimination goes is relatively harmless, it was still sexist and discriminatory. They continued to deny it was discrimination in any way shape or form. I said that we were all wearing the exact same outfit, but I had to change mine, solely because I'm a woman. That makes it discrimination on the basis of sex. 

I told my husband that if Mormon goes again I don't want to go. 

Husband and BF think I'm being an asshole about it and I should just put a shirt on since it doesn't hurt me. I think husband and BF are being assholes by forcing me to change my behavior to make some other sexist asshole more comfortable.

516,Not the A-hole,"My mother-in-law had moved in with my husband and I to help out with the kids after I went back to work. We get along very well most of the time. 

The one thing we argue about is hair washing.

On some days during the month (I’m never sure exactly when because it depends on the lunar calendar), she forbids us to wash our hair. My MIL believes in some form of Chinese superstition and washing our hair on certain days is very bad luck. My husband and I are both Chinese although my parents never observed this tradition (if we can call it a tradition?). 

The first time she told us not to wash our hair that evening, I thought it was strange but to be polite I didn’t wash my hair that night and took a morning shower the next day. 

Some time last month when we were having dinner, she told us that night was no hair wash day again. I was getting irritated since I like wash my hair daily and usually shower in the evening so I don’t have to rush in the morning. Once in a while is OK but this seemed to be becoming a regular ritual. More importantly I simply don’t believe in this nonsense.

I told MIL politely that I didn’t believe in this tradition. She said it doesn’t matter if I don’t believe in it but she does and if I don’t want to wash away the family’s luck, I will not wash my hair that night. 

That night, I washed my hair and MIL knew since she heard the hair dryer. For days, she didn’t speak to me and if she needed to say something to me, she would tell my husband to “tell your wife that...” even if I’m right there with her. Maybe after a week or so it thawed out, and things went back to normal until...

A few nights ago, you know it, no hair wash day again. She told me last time I did it because I didn’t know better but that it was very important to her and to the family’s future that I didn’t do this again. I said I’m sorry but I don’t believe in this. She was furious, said I had no respect for her and don’t care about the family, got up and walked out of dinner and locked herself in the room.

It’s been a few days, and she’s still not talking to me. I overhear her some times talking with her friends and other family members, saying how I don’t respect her. 

My husband thinks it’s nonsense too (he doesn’t care about HIS hair), but asks if I can just wash my hair in the morning on these days in the future.

I am feeling conflicted about this. I want to keep the peace and I think if this was once in a while it would be OK but this has become a regular occurrence. I know this is something very important to her, but i just don’t believe in this nonsense and think it’s utterly irrational.

Today, she put a picture of her and her friend popping their asses towards the camera with a caption talking about their asses. This is not something she would normally do so it came by me as surprising. 

I asked her about it in a very non confrontational and non-sexist way, mainly stating that it’s somewhat bothersome to me to be publicly sharing something like that especially when she’s a relatively sought-after girl in our peer group. I pointed out that it sends somewhat of a message to former lovers and guys who are into her. 

She immediately got defensive and said that it’s her body and social media to choose what to do with and I agreed that, yes, the decision is ultimately hers, I would hope that she would afford me the same respect that I know I would give her in the same situation.

I’m not trying to be regressive or controlling or chauvinistic, it’s just not my favorite thing in the world and it makes a statement about the level of selflessness/respect I have for her opposed to that which she has for me.

519,Not the A-hole,"So yesterday I went to go see a movie with a friend of mine at a fairly quiet theater in our home town. Pet Sematary. (Yeah, we waited forever to see it.) They had just gotten new seats and those touch screens to choose your seats when you get a ticket.

So we pick up our tickets early, grab a bite to eat, and go back to wait for the movie to start, popcorn in hand. We go in, and realise we're the only 2 people in the room.

Literally 2 minutes before the lights dim, 2 other lady's walk in. So we realise there's only going to be 4 people in the whole theater watching this movie. Awesome, no interruptions. Then we see them walk over, 1 row ahead of us, 2 seats to our right.

I have no idea what possessed these women to choose seats right in front of the only 2 other people in the whole room, but they did. They talk, laugh and giggle their way through all the movie previews. No problem, it's only previews.

Then the lights go dark, movie starts, they quiet down a little bit but don't stop talking. We finally get to the point where my friend and I were getting agitated when they kept talking through all the tense/spooky bits early on in the movie.

About half way through the movie, they start full on laughing loudly at some cheesy joke and I get pissed. I hand my friend the popcorn, move over between their seats behind them, and speak up.

""Hi there ladys, we're trying to watch this movie, same as you. It would be absolutely fantastic if you could SHUT THE FUCK UP. Thanks."" I move back over to my seat and sit back down. They stay quiet for the rest of the movie.

During end credits, as they're walking out, they made a comment. ""Next time, you could be an adult and just ask us to be quiet."" This sets me off a bit. ""I shouldn't have to say anything at all. You're not on your mom's couch in front of the TV, you're in a public theater. Act accordingly.""

She looked scared and walked out quickly. It made me wonder if maybe I was a little harsh. But then again, they killed most of the tense parts of the movie I payed money to see with their loud conversation. So, am I the asshole?


Tl;Dr - Went to the movies, only 4 people in the room. 2 were being loud, so I yelled at them. Then felt like I was slightly too harsh. AITA?

Edit: Seems like quite a few people are saying ESH. That's fair, I'm not going to argue against it. I did feel I was a bit harsh afterwards. I probably should have said something a little more polite first, but decided being harsh might get the message across more effectively. Thank you to everyone for the feedback, good or not.

He also treats the immigrant custodians like garbage calling them racial slurs in languages they don't understand and making fun of the way they speak. Anyways there's a new girl who started working a year ago (relatively new) and she's 15 years younger than me and just got out of university. I don't have an issue with her, she's pretty cool but she's inexperienced and doesn't know exactly what she's doing. SHe's comptentent but she's not ready for the promotion the boss decides to put her in. He puts her above me as my supervisor like wtf. The whole time I'm basically teaching her how to do her job and doing her job. I told my boss that she's not ready for the position and should take it. He told me to STFU and  that I'm an ungrateful twat. She even told me she was scared to be in that position and i really do feel bad for her.  later i find out they updated the website and a page about diversity at our company and they brag about all the female heads and minorities. She's up there and it goes on about how she's a strong woman who is a role model and a leader etc. Its clear my boss either has some bullshit diversity quota he has to fill or is just pandering trying to make our company seem ""woke"" for good PR.

I never even formally quit, i just stopped showing up to work and ignored all the emails and calls my coworkers sent me. The girl couldn't handle the business deal by herself and didn't know what to do so the constructionists actually went to my competing company omfg and i set up the business deal there earning them the 22 million euro profit. I eventually told my coworkers i quit and i was done with them and i got a lot of hate mail calling me a traitor, incompetent and also sexist because i couldn't handle a female boss and that strong indepdenetn women scare me. my boss at my new firm is a woman loll.

521,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 29F, my boyfriend is a 30M. We've been living together for two years in a little studio in a very expensive, big US city.

My boyfriend grew up rurally, with lots of space, enough to collect all kinds of things. He collected action figures and video games and all the normal kids' stuff when he was young, but as he grew older, he became interested in more unusual things. As a teen, he had eight guinea pigs, of different types from different breeders. Since Tide Pods were released seven years ago, he's saved one of every kind of Tide Pod. He's got a big box of an international variety of electric insulators, those little ceramic hats that power lines wrap around on power poles.

He's not a hoarder. He's usually neat, just used to having lots of space for his bizarro collections. At his parents' ranch, he has two big rooms full of containers of weird (and impressive!) things.

He recently became interested in Yogurt. He's always hated dairy products, until about a year ago. He not just started drinking milk and sharing ice cream with me, but he's found a love for yogurts. So he now collects them, of course. The problem is that they're perishable.

So, until earlier today, our little 550 sq foot studio contained about 2100 cups of yogurt. It comes in tons of varieties. Different types, flavors, textures, containers, made by different companies in different countries. This is like crack to my boyfriend. So he tried to pretty much save a sample of everything he could find.

He filled our fridge, bought a new fridge, and then another tiny bedside fridge (he said he didn't want to walk to the fridge at night, but it was obviously a ruse to get more yogurt space). These fridges all filled up with his yogurts, and if you keep them for long, they smell bad. Sometimes the packaging breaks. So our apartment was smelling like rotten milk for the last two weeks -- and my boyfriend's attitude was ""oh it's fine"" and ""just deal with it for a little longer"" until I pulled the plug and threw it all out this morning. I was looking at my groceries, which I had to put beside the fridge because there was no space, and everything smelled like death, and then I kinda snapped and threw it all away.

My boyfriend is understandably upset. We've been arguing about whether I crossed a line by throwing away his stuff. And he's especially upset because he (of course) had rare yogurts that were hard to find -- in particular, he had some Cuban and Iranian yogurts that you can't get in the US. But I know that we have trade sanctions against Iran and Cuba, so I don't know if it was even legal for him to have them? I asked where he got his Iranian yogurt, but he kept insisting ""the Iranian Yogurt is not the issue here"" and that the real issue was me throwing out his precious yogurts without his permission.

Fed up I went to his room which was unlocked and dumped it on his bed directly. He came back and freaked out and said he was going to take it out but needed to put it somewhere temporarily. AITA?

524,Not the A-hole,"A quick backstory; my significant others sister got into a fight with her boyfriend and asked if they (Her and a 4 and 2 year old kid) could crash at our place for a while (This was a week ago). I don't mind them visiting, but the last couple of times I noticed the 2 year old boy has been extremely whiny, cries for everything and is extremely loud while the 4 year old girl is the calm one who only becomes loud when her younger brother gets on her nerves, so I was reluctant to them staying over, but we still did.   


Welp, we have a spare bedroom with two beds in it, so accommodating them is not a problem, and she has money so if we ask her to pitch in she does it happily. Problem is... those kids are feeling the whole ''where is dad'' thing after 3 days and have become incredibly loud to the point where if you tell the little boy ''No'' he will scream bloody murder and not stop. They will also go to bed extremely late (way past my ''bedtime'' of 11pm) and I have been talking to my SO and told her I am having one heck of a hard time falling asleep, and I am not even able to take naps when I get home from work because all hell is breaking loose when I do. But she has not talked to her sister about the noise. I understand they are kids and they will be noisy, but the amount of screaming and uncontrollable crying is really taking a toll on my rest.   


Two days ago, I came home from a 12 hour shift and came to our living room trashed in toys, dirty with food stains on the coffee table and remote control, and just broke down and yelled at my SO's sister and asked her to clean all their shit, she did but she talked shit to my SO when she came home. We went upstairs and had a discussion about when they would leave, and my SO said she didn't know, and ended up calming down, but as soon as I was about to fall asleep the little kid started screaming and crying and I snapped, grabbed my shit, and told my SO I was gonna go sleep somewhere else until she was gone because it's our house and it should be our rules and conditions and I was not ready to jeopardize my sleep because she can't tell her sister to leave the house.

Anyways, this woman comes in and orders a foot long turkey. However, after the turkey is put on the entire bread, the customer demands a new loaf of bread. Why? Because she’s vegan and the turkey touched the bread. She only wanted half the bread to have turkey and the other half to only be veggies, but didn’t mention that until after. Whatever, a little annoying, but my coworker gave her another bread. Afterwards, she asked for cheese on the entire sandwich, which made my coworker and I side eye one another.

I proceeded to finished the sandwich, and didn’t say anything to the customer about the cheese. My coworker didn’t either. Afterwards, the customer after her commented that cheese wasn’t vegan. We all kind of chucked about it, but another customer said we were rude for not mentioning it. I think the reason we didn’t say anything was because the customer was being rude to us.

When I'm around them all I will act civil and keep my mouth shut about my own personal beliefs about ghosts, spirits, and the paranormal, which are completely opposite to theirs (I dont believe in any of them and dont believe ""psychic mediums"" have the abilities they claim to). 

Sometimes its hard for me to sit there and listen to their conversations, especially when the mother is rattling on about how she talked to certain spirits and saw certain things in visions etc. In my honest opinion I believe that she is a scam artist who lies to people for a career, and is setting a bad example for her children, especially since she feeds them these fantasies all the time. 

My girlfriend is aware of this, yet she can't understand my lack of respect for the mother. In her opinion, my beliefs and opinions are just as valid as anybody else's and I should accept that others believe in the paranormal. Since it doesn't affect me specifically she doesn't see why I'm concerned about it.

532,Not the A-hole,"I’m on mobile, so if there are formatting issues, sorry. 

For starters, I’m a PM for a large contractor in CA. I regularly make residential visits for inspections. In today’s case, I was in the bay area of CA, in a neighborhood where crime is a bit higher than other neighborhoods. 
I arrived ten minutes early, as I always do, and parked on the street in front of the home in which I had an appointment. 
The clients agent had not yet arrived, to kill time, I began to respond to some work emails on my phone. 
I had the feeling I was being watched, so I looked up, and right there at my drivers side window was a young woman, just standing there, staring at me. Smoking. (Not particularly relevant. I’m an ex-smoker, I typically tried not to invade peoples space while I smoked). 

I rolled the window down and asked a bit apprehensively if I could help her, and from the get go she was a bit animus and hostile:

Her: “Who are you?!”

Me: “my name is X, again, can I help you?”

Her: “uh, I’m a resident of this neighborhood and I’m asking who you are”

Me: “I’m a contractor, and I have an appointment at this home”

Her: “this home? This home is vacant” 

Me: “that might explain why my appointment is with a realtor...”

Her: “people have been breaking into homes here and I don’t believe you, show me your identification” 

Me: “ absolutely not. You can have one of my business cards if it makes you feel safer” 

Her: “just forget it, I’m not the cops and you’re obviously going to be a dick about this. I can’t make you “ 

Me: “that’s correct”


At that time, my clients agent arrived, and the hostile resident began shaking her head, muttering something inaudible and walking away. 
I grabbed my tools and clipboard, stepped out of my truck, and hostile resident looks back at me from across the street. 

At this time I asked “is this sufficient proof?”

To which she responded “you’d feel differently if it was your home being broken in to” 

I said “you’re right, but I also wouldn’t immediately and rudely accuse every unfamiliar individual I see” 

Her final comment struck me off guard “oh so now you’re going to be a typical white male and brutalize me? Fuck you”


I get her position, if she’s being truthful anyway. 
But I believe she didn’t do herself any favors in being an absolute dick in the way she decided to ask. 
If she had been civil at all, I may have even obliged her request for ID, but given her accusatory and hostile tone from the on-set, I wasn’t in any mood to actually comply.

533,Not the A-hole,"I’m 22, and before anyone says: My mom stopped working a year or so ago. I had my own apartment but it was destroyed by a hurricane and I moved in with her temporarily. She asked me to stay and help out around the house, but “help” turned into me paying 84% of monthly bills. As the essential bread winner of the household and the only one who does any chores or upkeep I feel like I have a say. The deed to the house has my name on it. 

As title says, I have sex toys. Quite a few. She went snooping (our rooms are two floors and all the way across the house from each other) and found them. Afterwards, she started going through my texts (via my laptop). As I got home from working a 14 hour shift, she greeted me by saying “I’m glad you’re still a virgin but absolutely disgusted by you having this under my roof.” While *holding* my favorite dildo. Just feels all kinds of wrong. 

It turned into a huge argument about privacy (she admitted to listening to my phone conversations) and I suggested that I move out. She got hysterical and started saying how I was horrible for leaving my aging (?) mother alone with no help and I told her maybe she should get a job, even just part time, and I would split costs to hire a housekeeper 50/50 even after I move out again. That wasn’t good enough either. I’m at my wits end and she’s telling EVERYONE that I’m trying to abandon her.

Edit: I drained alllll of my savings getting a new car (last had severe water damage) and I have to replenish it to move out and I’m only at $2k. I’m moving out regardless, but I’m beyond afraid of karma getting my ass because of “abandoning” all of my family. Also, of course I had a password on my laptop. I grew up with the internet.

535,Not the A-hole,"So I worked at a bowling alley/arcade from September up until early April. This place, simply put, fucking sucked. They constantly scheduled me against availability, didn’t send out the schedule until the day before, wouldn’t give me break during 8-10 hour shifts that are required by my state, and I honestly just didn’t fit in. The real kickers are as follows:

We had a guest who was VERY clearly lesbian. Like... there with her girlfriend. After they left the area that my coworker, manager, and I were in, the coworker calls her a dyke and they laugh. When I express discomfort (I’m bi and was in the closet at work) they start calling ME a dyke ‘teasingly’. That was when I decided to give my two weeks when I found a new job. 

About a week later (during spring break) we were slammed, but I unfortunately got a nasty fever (102) and went to my manager to ask if I could go home early. He says that they really need me (as far as I could tell they didn’t bc there were two people per station including fucking bumper cars), and he sends me to laser tag for the rest of the night.

541,UPDATE,"[Original Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/)

My wife went yesterday to collect our winnings and they shorted her $500. My wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. They gave the rest to Jessica. They made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and Jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and I. This was all bogus.

We made a post on our community Facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. I guess Jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

Jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. They found it condescending to give Jessica a prize just for having ASD. It was a joint decision between Jessica and her parents.

We talked a bit and learned Jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an Asperger's Syndrome organization. She's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. Part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as ASD/ASS and hopefully win, of course. We didn't know any of this at all, and I guess this is why the organizers wanted good PR.

My wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. She's going to help out where she can or if Jessica needs assistance. Things like editing, photography, etc. I guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

542,Asshole,"For some background, I'm 24f, and my fiancé is 28m. We've been dating for around 3 years, and we met at a yoga class I taught.

My fiancé comes from amazing wealth (compared to my family at least), and for some context, his family owns several million dollar homes, including a couple that he technically owns.

He's really been cagey about only one thing (and we're nearly perfect on everything else), which is paying off my student loans. Due to some poor choices on my end, I ended up with nearly $100,000 in debt which is a huge burden for me to carry.

Given the circumstances and the ridiculous rates I have to pay, not to mention its effect on my credit score and upward mobility from a career perspective, we've largely agreed that he'll pay things off once we settle down which is his family's way of telling us to get married.

With the wedding less than 3 months away, he's getting cold feet. His dad is fine, but he doesn't want to go behind my fiancé's back. I'm aghast and indignant that he's suddenly pulling out of something we'd talked about. And it worries me about the future where in marriage, he's going to be strict with *his* money and *my* money which is not what I have in mind. Given his family's wealth, I will be signing a pre-nup of sorts, and have spoken to a family friend who is a lawyer who agrees that it's not an onerous thing.

So, my girlfriend and I have been dating for three years now. She is two years older than me and has been in college for a year already. Last year, I applied to colleges for the spring of 2019. Luckily, my dream college and my love life would line up perfectly. Despite this, I would apply to numerous other schools out of redundancy (or so I thought). I was surprisingly denied from my dream school but life would go on. Girlfriend and I agreed to continue long distance as we both have intentions to marry once we get more settled into life. While we were both devastated, we knew it would work out in the end.  

&#x200B;

The college had an appeal process. Certain nothing would come out of it, I filled out the appeal for a laugh without telling anybody. AND I GOT IN! But I had been given a chance! This is my dream school and I was dedicated to becoming heavily involved in the campus-lifestyle: clubs, projects, making new friends!

Days not spent together are filled with phone conversations that make it as if we've never been apart. There have been days where our calls have filled close to twelve hours.  If I want to spend a day apart or get off the phone for something that is not seen as necessity, there are questions. I always feel guilty having to step back every once in a while. I didn't want to have the guilt following right behind as I tried to get the most out of my college experience.

&#x200B;

Selfishly, I thought the ends would justify the means: I lied to my girlfriend and said I was going to a different college in another state when in reality, I would arrive on campus just hours after she did. The campus is big enough that we never ran into each other.  I lived with two guys that I have become great friends with. I have to stress: **I DO NOT have intentions to cheat on my girlfriend**, I am not even remotely in the market, and I would never do anything she would not approve of. But this semester has been amazing! I joined two clubs, I made a bunch of new friends, and got amazing grades (final are coming up but I'm not worried)! While my girlfriend and I called a lot, I never felt like it got in the way. Truthfully, I think my lie made this semester great by allowing me to dedicate time to myself.

&#x200B;

While I've loved every minute of my 'independent' college experience, I can't help but feel a bit guilty about what I've done these past few months. This is the first semester of many and I'm not sure how I want to proceed. With the internet being an unbiased third party, I want to hear your thoughts.

553,Not the A-hole,"So one of my (29M) best friends A (30M) got married in November 2018. For about a year and a half since November 2016, when he was dating his now wife (let’s call her B, 30F) things were going well. I became good friends with her too and all 3 of us hung out regularly. 

I started noticing changes in B’s behavior toward me as their wedding approached. We were at a party, she approaches me, tells me she finds me irritating and before I could ask for an explanation or elaboration she walks away. I never brought it up, she was clearly tipsy at that point and I let it be.

A month after this incident, I went to her hometown for their wedding and she was openly rude multiple times in front of friends and even in front of her family. I again didn’t confront. Didn’t want to add any extra stress to the event. 

After their marriage A was hanging out at my place (I had a couple of friends over and we lost track of time). It was quite late, she sent me a couple of angry texts on how he should come home right away and he didn’t tell her he was going to hang out at my place until after he reached my place. His phone was dead apparently and he wasn’t responding to her texts so she decided to unload on me. 

After all these instances, I decided to keep my distance and hang out with my friend only on social dos because every time I tried hanging out, B was with him and I didn’t want to ask him to not bring her. (nothing untoward happened during these hang out sessions, she was well behaved but I just didn’t get the sense of camaraderie with her anymore). 

He feels I am avoiding him and spoke to B about this, she texted me saying I am being a neglectful friend and I should take initiative, now she has taken up on herself to make us spend more time together. I am dodging these requests, this is surely affecting my friendship with my friend and I feel like an asshole here. What do you guys think?

Edit: so a common question I am being asked is whether I spoke to my friend?

Yes, I did. After I received the text from B where she wanted me to take more initiative and to stop being a neglectful friend. I informed him that I have not being hanging out much because, at times, I find B rude. He didn’t ask for details. He just assumed that I was talking about the times she had been rude to me in her hometown and he had witnessed a couple of those instances. He urged me to give her another chance because she was stressed out due to the wedding, I didn’t give him other examples where she had been rude.",29,103,0.97
554,No A-holes here,"Happened a decade ago. My mom had been DNR for quite a while, she went to a lot of trouble to get that legally enforceable. I was her power of attorney.  Mom wasn't afraid of being dead, but she was afraid of dying (I knew this since I was a kid). My mom was always in pain from various problems that doctors weren't able to help her with. I get a call from a stranger.  Mom is very confused, doesn't know where she is, wants me to come pick her up. I ask her lots of questions, and she can't answer any of them. She can't tell me an address or a location. I ask to talk to the stranger. She gives them the phone. They give me the address.  I drive to the location not knowing quite what to expect. Mom is even more confused than I had realized, I think she is having some kind of stroke. I take her to the ER entrance, but she makes it clear she doesn't want to go in. I am so confused about what to do at this point. I argue with her that she might not die from what she has, and that she should at least let the ER figure out what she has so they can mitigate her suffering, and see what the treatment options are. The emergency personnel are at my car, and my mom is exhibiting much confusion, but is shaking her head no to them. I explain to them (truthfully) that she doesn't want to be treated. They might not have understood clearly if I hadn't translated her wishes. They tell me they can do nothing without her consent. I then ""trick"" my mom to at least go into the ER while I go get my wife to help me decide what to do. She agrees to sit in the waiting room while I go get my wife.  I am kind of losing my mind, and I start driving home with my mom ""abandoned"" at the ER. I drive away for about 2 minutes, and I realize what I did was wrong, so I drive back to my mom immediately. By the time I get back, she was admitted. I went to mom's side and stayed with her the entire visit. She gets some tests, and needs more care than the current ER is capable of. Mom rides in ambulance to a hospital (with me) about 100 miles away. She is there for about a week (I visit every day). She agrees to a biopsy. She has a brain tumor (same thing as ted kennedy), given 6 months to live. She goes on hospice, and is happy , because she is finally free from pain with the medicine that hospice gives her. She refuses treatment for the tumor, and of course I respect her wishes. She lived at my home with me and my wife carefree for 3 amazing months before she died, and I don't think I had ever seen her quite as happy as when hospice relieved her constant pain. I still feel guilty about tricking her that day.",28,144,0.94

556,Not the A-hole,"&#x200B;

Background: We (early 20s M+F) have been together for a year. We have an amazing relationship aside from this incident, he's brought up marriage, etc. 

&#x200B;

The dirty: My boyfriend broke his leg while horsing around with his friends on a boy's trip. He was discharged from the hospital and a surgery to repair the break was scheduled for a few days later. When he got home, he proceeded to *ignore* nearly all of his discharge instructions (elevate the leg, ice it, take painkillers, stay in bed) and insisted he felt fine. Of course, he was in a crazy amount of pain the next day and I had to leave work to take care of him. He's since had surgery and has continued being a terrible patient.

&#x200B;

He's fallen *three times* on his newly repaired leg, each time from doing something risky (going up stairs on crutches, trying to see how fast he can go on his mobility scooter, taking a shower alone), and each time he blames me. Yesterday, before he fell in the shower, I asked him if he wanted help. He told me no and shut the bathroom door in my face. A few minutes later, he called me down from upstairs. He was very irritated and told me he had fallen in the shower, and that I was a ""terrible caretaker"" and that it was my fault. I calmly reminded him that I offered to help him shower, and since he locked me out of the bathroom and refused my help, that there was no way that I could have prevented him from falling. He threw his crutches on the floor and ranted at me while he dried off and went upstairs. I was so frustrated that I cried.

&#x200B;

I haven't slept more than 4 hours at a time since his accident, since he wakes me up when he needs pain pills during the night. We've probably spent close to $500 on UberEats in less than two weeks since nothing that can be made at home is good enough for him. He requires lights to be turned on and off, blinds to be at just the right angle, gets cravings for strange foods at peculiar hours. I feel like I'm taking care of a pregnant woman with no support system and no maternity leave. Some nights, I don't even have time to shower. 

&#x200B;

After his shower tantrum, I told him that he was being a b\*tch, making life extremely overwhelming for me, and that I wasn't going to cater to all of his needs anymore. I told him that I was done catering to him and potentially done with the relationship if he didn't change his attitude. He seemed shaken and was upset that I went that far. He also took issue with me calling him a b\*tch and said that my approach was rude. I did apologize, but I also feel like I was justified in saying what I said. He disagrees. 

&#x200B;

I feel conflicted because he clearly trusts me and I understand that having a broken leg must be difficult for him, especially since he's a fiercely independent and physically active guy. I love him and am sympathetic to his situation, but I feel like his behavior is seriously out of line.

563,Not the A-hole,"Apologies for poor formatting am on cellphone.

We are throwing a large birthday party for my son’s 8th birthday. We are inviting his entire class, plus all the kids from the many extra curricular activities be partakes in. Probably 100+ people. We are going all out for this party, as we are also doubling it as a “schools out for summer” party, so no expense is being spared. We are well off (relevant). On my son’s invitations I wrote “please no gifts! Just bring yourselves and your swimsuits!” My reasons were as follows:

1- many kids in son’s class and activities are well off but many are not, with a few being downright poor. I really don’t want anyone to incur an expense to come to our party and i CERTAINLY don’t want anyone to put themselves out and spend a lot of money getting us an extravagant gift because they’re going to a “rich people’s party”.

2- my son doesn’t care about toys. All the boy likes are books and sports, of which he has the best of. We’ve had smaller parties with gifts and he never even played with some of the stuff he got. Just seems wasteful.

3- son is on board. I told him his family would buy him whatever gifts (sports stuff mainly) he wanted and that it wasn’t necessary to put people out and that it would be nice of us to do something for everyone to celebrate him with no strings attached. He said “fine with me as long as I get my baseball bat!”

4- lots of toys are plastic, not sustainable, afterthoughts. Not my main reason but it just seems so wasteful especially considering they’ll probably just be thrown or given away.

5- not asking for a charity donation because I think its tacky and it defeats the purpose of a no strings attached event.

When I told my mom she was horrified, says I’m robbing son of a wonderful experience of opening his gifts at his party (IMO TACKY!!), and that she will be getting him lots of presents anyway (I don’t care, obviously if someone brings a gift we will accept it graciously).

These last two weeks have gone by extremely fast. I'm writing this as a show of appreciation for this sub. Also, a couple of you asked for an update. It's been one huge life upheaval so far.

A quick overview:

\- My wife and I started seeing a therapist (had three long sessions already), who is a true miracle worker. She's been pretty neutral, which I initially found odd, concerning the response I got from a few mutual friends of ours and on Reddit. She does allow her a lot of room to lay out her troubles and concerns. She helps translate these in a way that has offered me a fresh perspective on this troubled relationship. It really comes down to creating a level playing field, where my wife has an opportunity to be heard. Communications gone haywire. Our therapist also signalled that I sometimes seem a bit overbearing. My wife has never put it this succinctly, but she could certainly agree with that statement. She reached a boiling point and could no longer play along with my 'fantasies', while she had to take the brunt of child rearing. That sounds more than fair. I now wish A. she would have told me much sooner and clearer and B. I wasn't so emotionally detached that it disallowed me coming to this fairly simple conclusion myself.

\- I also ended up listening to Cats in the Cradle by Harry Chapin. While I had heard the song before, I never dwelled on its true meaning. It hit home. It really reminded me of my relation with my own father. Hopefully I'll be the one to break the vicious cycle.

\- She told me that she still loves me and that she would like me to remain part of family life with the kids.

\- The deployments remained the dealbreaker and she made it clear that if I left on another three month assignment two weeks from now, I would have lost my final chance. I ended up conceding to her on that point. Mutual compromise is indeed something that requires both parties to give something up, and I hadn't really done much of that lately. She nevertheless agreed to me getting a job shoreside at a local port, even if it entails us moving.

\- I started negotiations with my employer and ended up offering them something of an ultimatum myself. This did not go over well. I won't get into details because of the character count of this sub, but I'm currently somewhat out of a job and probably have a lawsuit coming my way. The terms weren't as lenient as I had expected. Goodbye oil industry. Hello dredging... I've set my sights on a career in GA and hopefully get to be part of the Savannah Harbor expansion project.

It seems like things are going in the right direction for now. Maybe not financially, but at least emotionally. There is hope for my marriage and my capacity as a father.

Finally, I'd like to thank this sub for showing me some 'tough love' and helping me find the right attitude to go into therapy with.",30,459,0.99
570,No A-holes here,"There is a very clear distinction that I would like to make here that I told her I don’t like pictures of just vaginas. If her face is in it or she’s touching it or in porn if it’s being used I love that stuff. But just a picture of a vagina doesn’t do it for me.

I told her this preference so I didn’t have to lie an seem insincere and I felt she should know what drives me sexually, but after this she became super insecure accusing me of not liking her vagina specifically.

She said that it would be like her saying she didn’t like my dick and I responded it’s like me sending a flaccid dick pic. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s not in motion so to speak. If I sent her a picture of me hard that’s in motion that says I’m aroused and I feel good about you and myself. A flaccid dick pic is just borderline nasty as is just a vagina shot. 

Ultimately I didn’t want to lie to her and say that I was aroused when I wasn’t. I don’t know what I can do at this point because she now feels really self conscious about it. Was I the asshole for not lying to her and should I have lied to make her feel better? That’s what I’m leaning toward, but I can’t take back what I said.

572,Asshole,"Girlfriend's friend Tanya was at a party with us Friday.  She was complaining about her relationship with her boyfriend Josh of 3 years.  According to Tanya she has to withhold sex from Josh in whenever he doesn't treat her right.  When pressed she said that ""treating her right"" means two date nights a week to expensive restaurants, at least 2 flower deliveries to her office a month so her coworkers can see them, and 2 vacations out of the country a year.

Now Josh and I aren't super close but we are close enough that I've hung out with him before and heard him complain about Tanya.  Based on what Josh has said and what Tanya was openly admitting it is pretty obvious to me that she is super high maintenance and obsessed with wealth and status.

Well as Tanya keeps talking she eventually switches gears to complaining that Josh will basically plan the date night, have dinner, sex, and then disappear afterwards.  My response to her is where I think I was an asshole.

Me: ""Of course that's what happens.  You've turned sex into a transaction in exchange for him spending a bunch of money on you.  You require money for sex.  When you act like a whore don't be surprised when you're treated like one.""

Before anyone could respond I turned and went to a different group to talk about something else.  Tanya left soon after that.

575,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because at least a few of the people involved know my main account. 

So, about two weeks ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of about a year. There was a bunch going on there, but to try to keep it to the relevant bits: I was kind of terrible at being his girlfriend, and he wanted to move a lot faster than I was comfortable with (and yes, we’d tried talking about this, but things didn’t improve). So I ended things with him as politely as I could, but he took it hard.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I’d had a rough day and was feeling kinda down, so I used an app and arranged a meet up at a bar. When I got there and met the girl I was there to meet, it turned out that she was a coworker of my ex (I didn’t know this going in). She made a comment to the effect of “wait, aren’t you [Ex’s Name]’s fiancée?” I said no and told her that we’d broken up, and she told me about how a couple of weeks ago, he’d been showing everyone the ring he’d bought and talking about how he was going to propose on Easter. At that point, things got kind of awkward, so I ended up leaving alone.

Yesterday was the first time she would have seen him since then, and last night he called me drunk and crying, telling me how inconsiderate I was to be moving on so immediately like that, and how I should have considered his feelings and given him time to get over things before I started going to bars looking for hook ups. I ended the conversation there, and told him that if he wanted to talk when he was sober, I’d consider it, but that I wasn’t gonna talk to him when he was like that. I haven’t heard from him since, but I did have a mutual friend check up on him and he’s hungover but otherwise fine. This friend (who thankfully isn’t taking sides here) did relay to me that he’s taking all of it — both the break up and the fact that I was out again so quickly — very hard.

577,Asshole,"So backstory, my sister and I were both fully vaccinated. We are heathy adults now (thanks, modern medicine!), but our mom, who moved to Florida about ten years ago, has become an anti-vaxxer. She breeds Doberman show dogs and got really into essential oils. She stopped vaccinating her dogs for all but the ones they need to show, and that has apparently morphed into full anti-vax beliefs. 

The last time she visited me, she told me that had she known better, she never would have vaccinated myself and my sister. I replied that I’m glad I didn’t use the use of my legs to polio, and we haven’t talked about it since. 

In our family, we generally donate to charities in each other’s names for gift giving holidays. With Mother’s Day coming up, I have been reflecting on the privilege that I have as a mother in being able to provide for my son and think about others who are not able to do the same. 

I believe that children should be given every advantage to succeed, and vaccines are a huge component about that. I would like to be able to provide that for other mothers. I know it is definitely passive-aggressive, but if I donate vaccines in her name, would that be a dick move?

578,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I broke up a few weeks ago after I caught her planning to cheat on me with her ex and also flirting with a few other guys on facebook.  Well shortly before the breakup two of her friends asked me to look at a phone and laptop that weren't working.  I work in IT so this type of request is common for me.  I said I'd take a look, but before that happened the breakup occurred.

Well these friends obviously sided with my ex after the breakup and publicly stated that I was overreacting and was more at fault than ex in the breakup.  Well the next day I returned the devices to those two explaining that I wasn't going to fix them.  Since then I've gotten numerous messages from them, my ex, and a few mutual friends telling me that I am being petty and childish and needlessly punishing them for my ex's behavior.  A few have also said I am obligated to help since I promised to look at them and the breakup doesn't absolve me of that responsibility.

I personally think this is all bullshit, but the fact that so many people are coming after me on this is making me doubt myself.  Was I the asshole here?",44,176,0.9

580,Not the A-hole,"Hello, so last night. I was hanging out with my friends and this guy. He's been acting funny, he insisted he sit by me and he even kissed me a few weeks ago. We all went out for dinner. Me, him and like, 6, of my friends.

 he told me he liked me and wanted me to go out with him. The problem is, i have a boyfriend. I told him this and he was a little mopey. But i told him to cheer up, we could still be friends and the whole ""Other fish in the sea"" line and he smiled.

I thought that would be it, but he just kept hounding me. He kept asking me ""Joe? What's so special about Joe anyway?"" (Joe is my bf). ""Just tell me what you see in that loser?"" I told him to stop. But he kept making fun of him and mocking the way he acts (he's a bit geeky and always does things like cosplay and things). Or the fact he has to wear special inserts for his shoes.

I told him to please stop. I even tried to distract him with trivia (the restaurant we were in had these little tablets with games on them.) I loaded up a question and asked him one. He said the answer and i told him he was good at this, then he told me ""Yes, i am. And i have other good qualities if you'd give me a chance.""

But he just kept hounding me. The whole time, he'd either insult Joe or say how i should date him. He even said i was ""lucky"" someone like him was interested in someone like me.

 ""Why do you like Joe? What's so special about him? What's wrong with me?"" 

I told him that it was nothing personal. I just don't feel that way towards him. But he started going off again, listing off his qualities that Joe doesn't have (he's a bit short and more plain looking). ""Is it because i'm tall? Because i'm not ugly? I can't help that i'm more intelligent then that oaf, Joe."" I told him to stop, but he kept laying into Joe and demanding i tell him why i don't like him.

At that point i had enough. I started shouting at him. I called him obsessive and narcissistic and that he was a jerk. That he was bitter and annoying. And told to leave me alone and not talk to me anymore. But he started crying.

I felt bad, i told him i was sorry and we could still be friends. I just don't want to date him.

But am i wrong here for yelling at him? I mean, all he did wrong was have feelings for me.",49,98,0.96

582,No A-holes here,"A little backstory here:
My sister is 9 years older than me, and she has two children. Over the last few years, she has decided to hang out with people that do drugs and has started using meth, which has obviously put her in a bad situation. Baby daddy drama, kids being taken away from her left and right, her car being stolen by her “friends” who are also on meth, etc. It’s a mess. When our mom was alive, she would move in with us and leave her kids with us while she went out and do whatever. She would start to get better while living with us, and we would all get hopeful that she would turn her life around, and then she would again get involved with the same people and move out. Well my mother died so she’s not here to pick up after my sister anymore, and my sister has had a rough time trying to pick her life up because she has nobody to co-sign for her a car, nobody to take her to find a job (not that she could keep it), nobody to live with, and her kids keep getting taken away. She seems to only call me when she needs something. A few months ago, she calls me up talking about how much she misses me and how we should get together and have lunch, and I’m like yeah, this is great sure. Then after our phone call, she proceeds to text me telling me that she meant to ask me for $50 and she also wanted to use my car so she could drive around and look for a job, go to her DHS appointments, and “try to get her life together again.” When I told her not only no, but *hell* no, she FREAKED OUT and started sobbing. She told me she has been struggling with BPD, she blames our mom for her lifestyle today, I had it so much better than her, you name it, she cried about it. I told her to get out of my life. That I had my own life to live and I had been pretty much taking care of her since I was 14, and I was done. The only reason why I never did it sooner was because of her kids, but I have reached a point in my life where I can’t handle doing this anymore and dealing with her drama.

584,Asshole,"For non US people, it's customary to tip people that serve you, whether it's a waiter/waitress in a restaurant, delivery driver, or shuttle driver etc. 

&#x200B;

My policy on tipping is to only tip when I'm receiving something additional that I'm not already explicitly paying for. A waiter serves me? I'll tip. I order food and pick it up at a counter? I won't tip. A delivery driver gives me food from Uber Eats or similar service? I won't tip because I'm already paying a delivery fee. To me, it seems like if I'm paying something like a delivery fee and a driver expects a tip because they aren't seeing the delivery fee, then that's an issue with the business, not my responsibility.

&#x200B;

When I told my girlfriend a little while ago, she kinda looked at me like ""you don't tip??"". Not really anything more than a look but still made me wonder, so AITA?

Edit- overwhelming I'm the asshole. I'll tip my delivery drivers from now on. Genuinely curious what you guys think of not tipping Uber drivers like just the driving service. Also not sure why people are getting really really hostile about this.

To those saying that delivery drivers depend on tips to survive, I understand that, and I'll tip them moving forward, but I still think that's more of a reflection of our society and employment regulation than a reflection on my tipping.",135,81,0.84
585,Not the A-hole,"So at the end of march my roommate said he wanted to stop smoking, but that he finds it hard to do. So I made this bet with him that for every cigarette he smokes, I get one euro (to have a little bit of a backstop). I'm currently on 20, so he's not really trying that hard. However I heard from a friend of his (I know him to and speak him every so often) that when he's at his house, he always smokes multiple cigarettes and doesn't tell me. I find it okay if he forgets 1 or 2, but it's estimated by his friend that he's smoked almost a pack in the times he's been there.

Today I confronted him a couple of times on that and he starts freaking out at me how I'm ""on his nerves"" and that he ""never lied to me about it"". So now I just asked him fair and square how many he has kept silent and now he's angry at me. AITA for not trusting him and asking him about it a couple of times? I mean, it is for his own good eventually. HE said he wanted to stop smoking and I only wanted to help and keep him to his promise. I don't need the money anyway (and I'm probably not even going to ask him when the bet is done) and he knows that, but I'm just wondering if it's all that fair that he's angry at me.

586,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I moved 2 hours away from my extended family a few years ago. In that time no ones come to visit me, although I’ve made the travel multiple times. My grandma broke her ankle a few days before my son was born and obviously couldn’t drive until her ankle had healed. 


Since having my baby 3 months ago, I’ve received multiple messages from my mum asking when I’m going to bring the baby up so they can all meet him. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable driving my newborn that far being a FTM and thought it was only fair they make the effort to come and see us. I told her I was a bit upset no ones bothered to visit or even message me to see how we’re going, and I felt like the only support I’ve received is from my partners family. She got defensive and said my grandma couldn’t drive that far and it’s not fair she hasn’t been able to meet her great grandson, she also said my partners family weren’t important and my grandma shouldn’t miss out. I genuinely felt bad and was considering traveling up until I recently found out my grandma has been driving to see my Aunty who lives half an hour from me. I asked my mum why my grandma could drive over an hour away to her daughters house, but couldn’t add an extra 30 minutes onto her trip to meet my son. The excuse was her ankle gets sore if she drives over an hour but the distance to my aunties house was ok for her. There’s been no excuses as to why the rest of my family hasn’t been up to see me or messaged to check in. 


Now even though I feel comfortable doing longer drives with my baby, I’m refusing to do the 4 hour round trip until they can make the effort to come see us. So far it’s been 3 months and it doesn’t look like they’ll be meeting my son any time soon, AITA?

I have 2 daughters from my previous marriage, they are 8 and 11. I love them but I would say my relationship with them is kind of rocky.

Naturally, I have a better relationship/connection with my son (3) in my current marriage - I obviously would never tell them that. 


My son and daughter have birthdays that happen to be 2 days apart. The plan was to celebrate my sons birthday and then spend the weekend with my daughters. It was exciting for all of us because I haven’t seen them since last summer 


The weekend comes around but I realized I couldn’t make it. We had just thrown a big party for my son and I was extremely exhausted.

588,Not the A-hole,"My husband works a standard 40-45 hours a week job. I am a stay at home mom. 

We made the decision for me to stay home, with the intention of me going back to work, at least part-time, when our youngest starts school full time. 

That time is this upcoming fall. 

Around the house I do 85-90% of the cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids. Basically everything, as it should be, since I stay home. 

My husband and I have had countless arguments that the work should be split 50/50 when he gets home because he’s still a parent and an adult living in the home and needs to contribute. 

We’ve been married 9 years and it’s never changed. No amount of arguing, having civil conversations, marriage counseling, has ever helped. He can quote my same argument by heart, he knows it so well. In fact, he did so this weekend to ‘prove’ to me that he listens to me. 

My husband says this is the way he is, he is a slob and I knew this when I married him, and that when he gets home he wants to relax. 

The ending never changes and I’m resigned to this fact. And yes, divorce has been discussed before but it’s not a logical solution to the problem. 

Anyway, when I go back to work I’ll be working 9am-2pm so that I can still get the kids ready in the AM, take them to school and be able to pick them up from school and get their homework done and dinner ready. 

The thing is, I am sick and tired of feeling as if my husband takes advantage of the fact that I do and will continue to do everything. It’s my fault, I know this, but once I start working too I am refusing to do his laundry.

I have been slacking on the laundry at home this week and last night he didn’t have a work shirt. 

Instead of doing his laundry he said, I guess I’ll have to go buy more shirts after work tomorrow. It wasn’t a joke, more of a threat. 

We are living paycheck to paycheck (soon to change once I go back to work) and the kids actually need summer clothes and here he is threatening to use that money for himself because he can’t be bothered to wash his own laundry. I told him so and he brushed it off. We just spent over $300 on work clothes for him since he started a new job about a year ago. He doesn’t need new clothes. 

This morning he texted me, “I love you have a good day please take out the trash to the curb since it’s trash day.”
 
I texted “ok love you too. I’ll make sure the wash is empty when you get home so you can wash your laundry and have a work shirt for tmr”. 

He texted back, “I’m not sure why you are angry.  I’ve been at work all morning.  I didn’t do anything to you”. 

I plan to stick with this laundry thing, but does that make me the asshole? Should I just do his damn laundry? I do mine, the kids and towels, sheets, and bedspreads....not sure if this is the hill to die on.",186,286,0.94
589,Not the A-hole,"For context we’re all in high school  so like chill and Claire is the trans girl.Btw she still has a penis if that helps. I also wanna say that I’m not against trans people. I support the LGBT community and I’ve always treated her the same as any other person.
We’re all females 

My friends and Claire all planned to sleep at my other friend’s house. She has another bed  that fits 2 people and I called dibs on it. Claire decided to sleep on the sofa. We all had fun watching movies until Claire wanted  to sleep on the bed  with me.  I felt too uncomfortable because she has a penis and Id personally  rather not share a bed with anyone who has a penis and Im also talking bout cis men too.  I  told my friends what I felt also keeping in mind to be polite to C. I even offered for my friend K to sleep with me and for Claire to take her place. Claire refused and called me transphobic and then started screaming at me and calling me a POS and all of that.  EDIT- K had an air mattress ok

My friends told me to apologise bc I was being mean. However I don’t think I was obligated to share a bed with her. Yes mentally and legally she is a woman but biologically she still has male body parts and even with cis men I wouldn’t sleep with them.   They told me to apologise but I said only if Claire apologised for screaming at me. Long story short they kicked me out. 

Tbh I would have left anyways because of the unfairness they showed and how they had no RegArd for my feelings. They didn’t even bother to hear what I had to say and what I felt uncomfortable with.  I offered a solution to the problem yet Claire still refused even tho we coulda have fixed this ages ago. 

I’m always trying to learn and become a better person especially to trans people but seriously I politely declined and she still screamed bloody murder at me. I do understand that trans people go through hardships however what was I supposed to do? Share a bed with her even though I felt extremely uncomfortable. And btw if she had transitioned I wouldn’t have cared as much 

I feel like my friends and her loosely tossed around the word transphobic and I didn’t do anything but I also feel like her and I had a right to feel what we felt.  However AITA?

Also like can y’all not hate on me


EDIT- I’m not saying she is not a woman like whatever you identify as CIS/TRANS if you have a penis then I’m not sharing a bed with you.  Seems to forget that I have my own personal boundaries  too. Just like everybody else.

y’all are probably way older than me so how can u expect me just to have Somebody with a penis in the same bed as me.

EDIT- It’s the next day and this is what I’ve decided to do. I will agree that I was TA for not offering to sleeping on the air mattress instead and I will apologise to Claire for that only since the bed could fit 2 people. I will not apologise for being uncomfortable with sleeping with her. It doesn’t matter what gender somebody is, I won’t sleep with anyone who has a dick. It’s my body and my choice and I don’t understand how I am a transphobic. I would be a transphobic if I wouldn’t sleep with her bc she has a dick but would sleep with other cis men. ( not saying she is a man). I completely understand why she would be offended, my intention wasn’t to offend her. Instead of listening to what I had to say, my friends and Claire overlooked my situation and basically didn’t even care. Believe it or not this actually hurt my feelings especially with Claire screaming at my face. I said I was uncomfortable and I can’t believe that I am faced with backlash for not want to share a bed with somebody. My friends wouldn’t care if I declined sleeping with an actual cis man so why is claire a trans woman any different.",537,161,0.74

591,Asshole,"I have a small office on side street with a parking lot in the front. Next door, there's a vacant commercial property. It faces the main road and has a partially wooded area in the back. Basically, the front of our office looks out onto our parking lot, the side of the building next door, and the wooded area. 


About a month ago, a woman in an SUV started parking in either our lot or the wooded area of the property next door. She does this every day and stays there for hours at a time (at least 3 or 4). She always has a small dog with her and gets out to walk it every once in a while. The rest of the time, she just sits on her phone. 


During the first couple of weeks, people in my office tried to say hello or ask if they could help her. She straight-up ignored them. But she did stop parking in our lot and began only parking behind the building next door. 


After about 3 weeks, we called the police to report a suspicious person. They came out and talked to her, then talked to us. They told us she has a valid license with no outstanding warrants, so there's nothing they can do because she's on private property and not obstructing a roadway. She told them her sister lives in an apartment close by and she's been staying with her. However, the sister's apartment doesn't allow pets, so she comes up there to walk her dog. 


After the police visit, she stopped parking there for a couple of days. But now she's doing it again. At this point, it's been just over a month total. I thought she would find a new spot after the police came out, but she hasn't.


It makes no sense. There's no free Wi-Fi access around and no easy access to a bathroom. There's a library, fast food restaurants, and grocery stores all literally within a mile of our office.


I do think she's staying with the sister because her vehicle isn't loaded down with possessions. My best guess is the sister won't let her stay in the apartment by herself. Maybe the sister doesn't want to get in trouble if management comes by and hears the dog barking and she isn't there. 


This situation has just gotten annoying. We're tired of looking outside and seeing her big SUV in our direct line of sight. She doesn't pick up after her dog, and it's getting warmer outside. We occasionally leave our office door open to get some fresh air in nice weather, but we can't lately because of the um, aroma. 


I know which apartment complex her sister lives in. I also happen to know the owner of the property next door. So, my question is WIBTA if I either notified: (1) the apartment complex that one of their tenants has someone with a dog staying there (and give them her vehicle description and plate number); or, (2) the owner of the vacant property so they can have a trespass warning issued against her? Which of these would be the better option? Or is there a 3rd option that would be better? I'm not trying to get her in trouble, but I also don't understand why she insists on parking there.

I have a tattoo of a veve, which is a Voodoo symbol used to represent or summon Loas, which are Voodoo spirits. I got the tattoo because: 
-I spent five formative years in New Orleans and wanted to commemorate my love for the city with a tattoo. You see these symbols everywhere in New Orleans. 

- I’m obsessed with arcane symbols and consider myself somewhat of a collector of them. All six of my tattoos are symbols of this nature. 

- I love learning about different systems of belief that deal with unseen forces in our world. Researching and learning about them is a hobby. I also loved the story and lore of the Loa whose symbol I chose. I felt moved by it. 

I am an atheist and didn’t think getting this symbol was any different than getting a cross or ichthus tattoo.  I wouldn’t think twice about someone who wasn’t Christian having one of those tattoos for whatever reason. 

My coworker was joking around but it got me thinking. And maybe this is shallow, but it’s got me feeling a little self conscious, wondering how it makes me appear to other people. Would I feel differently about having this tattoo if I were in say- Haiti? I didn’t do any research about whether or not this would be acceptable for someone who did practice Voodoo. Am I being disrespectful or dismissive by treating this religion like a fantasy or fairytale that I might borrow a symbol from? I can still recognize the importance of a fairytale and it’s lessons and respect it even if I don’t believe it, I think? It’s got me thinking of cover ups for this tattoo.

This has been a reoccurring problem and I never really confronted her on it until now.

So this morning, I wake up early to drive my girlfriend to one of her final exams. On our way out the door, she tells me we are gonna take her friends too. No problem, they live at the same apartment complex and I have plenty of room. (Keep in mind I drive my girlfriend \[and her friends\] to school nearly every day when she is perfectly capable of walking (15-20 min walk) or taking the bus that drives directly from our apartment complex to campus. She reciprocates sometimes, but its usually a problem/argument - still, not a big deal. She is way busier than I am so I get it.) Today, we get in my car and when I turn the engine on, she comments in a \[probably lighthearted\] way ""WOW oh my god I hate this song. 156843 always plays songs that I hate just to annoy me."" -no big deal. Slight chuckle from those in the back. Usually when she makes people laugh she tries harder to do so again and so then she says ""did you all like my video of 156843 yelling at the computer last night?"" Story: I had a few beers yesterday afternoon/evening and was playing a certain FPS game (BF3) that I hadn't played in months (I don't have time for gaming anymore) and I got really into it and was jokingly yelling at the game. she was laughing at it but then also decided to send a video of me doing it to her snapchat group of friends (same ones I drove to school this morning). When she says this in the car on the ride over I make a quick joke about it (kinda laughing at my self for doing it) and then shake it off. On the way over we almost get hit from someone driving like a maniac and switching lanes at the last moment as I am taking a right at a red light. She then comments something along the lines of ""we might make it there but itll cost a few lives"" and ""156843 is just trynna kill us this morning"". We had to take a detour to avoid traffic and she commented ""OMG where are we going??!"" Again, no big deal. I arrive at campus, and I realize this is a bit ridiculous and I get slightly annoyed at how she tries to always get a few laughs at my expense in front of her friends. Instead of calling her out in front of her friends, I wait until they get out, then send her a text:

""You act different around your friends""

Her: ""What do you mean?"" - Within 10 sec after receiving this she calls me. I tell her ""You act very differently around your friends and sometimes you try to make them laugh at my expense. Not a big deal, just a little annoying sometimes.""

I guess this triggers her and she is now accusing me of calling her annoying and distracting her before her exam. She said that she wont talk to me until I apologize to her. We had an exchange over text which might or might not be relevant. If it'll help I can post a transcript. She is now demanding an apology or threatening to break up (this is always her go-to when we get in a fight) even though I know for damn sure she does not want that.",76,187,0.96

I suggested going to a doctor if he's in that much pain and he said it wouldn't help (he hates going to the doctor). 

Every time I suggested something, he shot it down saying things like ""bitch please"" and ""shush negro"" (neither of us are black, so I don't get this one). 

He keeps groaning and yelling about any small movement, though he still seems perfectly capable of making these movements. He's also snapping at me a lot and yelling at me and grabbing me uncomfortably tight. I mean, I get it, pain sucks. I have a lot of chronic pain/illness due to my physical disability. I get how being in pain can make you a bit crabby, but I don't lash out at him like that. 

I told him if he wasn't going to try to do anything about it, I don't feel that bad for him, and that being in pain doesn't excuse him from being a dick to me. He told me I am being an asshole by not caring/being more sympathetic to him since he's hurting and still had to do things to help me (being disabled, he does help take care of me and takes me to work and stuff) and I should be more grateful than that.",282,480,0.93

601,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account just in case, she knows my main account.

Basically, I listen to a lot of modern rap: Kanye, Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, etc, and my girlfriend has an entirely different musical taste to mine. When she's at my house or in my car, she often get's really upset with the songs I listen to, as she says a lot are misogynistic and disrespectful to women, as the lyrics often talk about cheating on them and revolve around things like money and killing. I was listening to a Playboi Carti song and she heard this section of the song - [https://imgur.com/a/M7HKasY](https://imgur.com/a/M7HKasY)

She got pretty pissed off and started asking how I can listen to music like this and still love her, and complained that I'm so open about liking this type of music on social media that people might get the wrong idea about my relationship with her (i.e. that I cheat on her, don't respect her, etc.). I tried explaining to her that I love this type of music and that it's a release for me, has the ability to relax me or hype me up, and that it's a genre and type of music that I love and is part of who I am. Along with me reassuring her that I love her and that just because I listen to music with lyrics like that, doesn't mean I'm going to cheat on her or disrespect her.

She asked that I stopped listening to it, and suggested that if I *have* to listen to rap, that it be something less misogynistic and more ""meaningful"", but I told her that I see it as corny and while I respect how she feels, I can't stop listening to music I love just because she has asked me to.

603,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post ever/I’m on mobile, sorry about any formatting. 

I have a best friend named Ian. He was my roommate in college (we have graduated by now though), has been there for me through a lot of things, and is just generally a good guy. Since we both graduated college, I don’t get to see him as often anymore. 

He has been dating a girl for about 8 months now, let’s call her Morgan. At first I was really happy for him because they seem so happy on social media and every time I talk to him, he has so many good things to say about her. It was a little annoying that he would bring her up in our conversations so often, but I was genuinely happy for him so I let it go. 

By now, I have met Morgan maybe 4 times. Each time we hang out, I am in pure disbelief that she treats my buddy with such blatant disrespect. She will tell him that his shirt is ugly and he should change, comments on what he orders and says he should watch his weight, curses loudly in public, interrupts him when he is speaking to me, and she is just generally unpleasant. 

I wanted to like her so badly. After every bad experience with her, I told myself that she can’t possibly keep her attitude up, or that mr friend will soon realize that he deserves so much better than her. But they just get more and more serious as time goes on, and the other day he told me he was thinking about proposing when they go on vacation in a couple of months.

I know that it’s not my place, but I couldn’t hold it in any longer, and I finally told him what I thought of Morgan. I told him that she is rude, crass, and that it hurts to see how she treats him. I told him that I wanted him to be happy, but I don’t know if she would make him happy long term. 

I should have seen this coming, but he flipped out at me. He said things to me that I never would have expected from him, and I told him I feel like Morgan’s bad attitude is rubbing off on him. I eventually apologized and he accepted my apology, but things are still strained between us. Not to mention, Morgan has now deleted me as a friend on every social media platform, so he obviously told her what I said, thus ensuring that Morgan and I will never be able to be friends.

I feel really badly about the whole situation, but the way she treated him was borderline verbal abuse, and I couldn’t take it any longer. Things been Ian and I are tense, and I’m worried that my friendship with him is over forever, which would really really suck. So, AITA for telling him how I felt about his girlfriend?",32,112,0.96

Don't get me wrong, i know it is socializing and i am not in favour of sitting quietly for 80 minutes. I'm fine with the occasional comment and also make a remark myself sometimes. (\~3 times per hour) but lately they have been continuously talking trough the show, like half the time i cannot hear dialogue because one of them is talking over it.

It is usually the same inconsiderate guy, who then starts making fun of me for being irritated about it. The last episode it was so bad that i said i was going to watch the rest of the series by myself and now they say i am overreacting.

610,Asshole,"TL; DR- I’ve only ever had one name picked out that I wanted to name my baby one day, told my sister, she used it. 

On mobile so apologies for formatting issues. 

This happened around a year ago but I recently discovered this sub and figured I’d ask since the topic occasionally comes up in my family still. My sister and I are both around mid 20s. She’s married, I had a boyfriend at the time and have always intended on having children. Names are changed in the post. 

My older sister (D) has been married for about 4 years and currently has two kids. When she was pregnant with her second boy, she said she and her husband were planning on naming him a name that was intended to be shorted to two letters (think TJ, MJ etc). Initially this wasn’t an issue because they picked two names I had no intention of ever using (not the actual name, but let’s say they said they were going to name him Matthew John).  Months later, D mentioned they had decided to keep the letters the same but decided to use “Michael” instead. I told her that was the only name I’d ever actually had my heart set on naming a child one day. I asked if they could just keep their original idea so I could still use my favorite name and I’d liked for years and that they had just decided a few days ago that they wanted to use. 

I talked to her and my mom about it. D countered with them being set on it and there was no way they’d go back to the other name. They both said I could still name my kid Michael one day. I said I didn’t want to because I thought it would be weird to have two kids in the same family with the same name. She said everyone would be calling him MJ, so if I just named my kid Michael it wouldn’t even matter since they wouldn’t be going by the same name. She also said that because I wasn’t even married yet my opinion didn’t matter as much since they were having their baby soon and they liked the name. 

D has the baby, names him MJ with the name I wanted. Calls him MJ for a while. Then she starts calling him Michael often. Next thing you know, MJ is never used (by anyone) and it’s Michael every time. I mention that they don’t call him MJ anymore and how she said they were going to which was a big part of her justification on why I could still use Michael. She brushed it off as “he just didn’t seem like an MJ and Michael fits him better”. 

I understand she was actually about to have a baby and I wasn’t, but since I told her right after they decided to change to the name I wanted I feel like she should’ve at least been nicer about it or even considered changing it back or to something else. But she instantly shut me down with a “too bad, we picked it” attitude. It’s caused a bit of a rift between us. My family is very close, so i see my nephew all the time and it kind of irks me that he has the name I always wanted. I’m also kind of hurt that my mom took her side no questions asked. 

So, AITA?

*Edit* Michael isn’t the actual name. The beginning of the post states the names were changed. The actual name I wanted is pretty unique/unconventional so it would definitely be odd to have two in the same family. Just to clarify.

*Edit 2* I’m sure I mentioned the actual name to her at some point, I just don’t remember any exact conversations. I’ve liked the name for years so I’m sure it came up. But regardless, it appears I’m the asshole here. Thanks for your opinions.",329,982,0.94
611,Not the A-hole,"Background: I have this friend Mandy who I guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" She has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

Recently Mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. Mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

This was about January and Mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and Mandy has actually gained weight. Mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

I was helping Mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge Tupperware bin the back of her suv. I assumed she wanted it unloaded but as I moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. I asked her about it. She got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. I asked her if this why she's gaining weight. She told me to fuck off. I texted her husband because in the heat of the moment I was furious she had spoken to me like that.

Her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so Mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. Mandy is blaming me, am I the asshole here?


Edit: I accept my judgment and I won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and I don't want to he part of this anymore. No I don't want to have sex with him. Nor did I ever imply or infer that. Enjoy your day.


Edit 2: based on some responses that said I was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which I accept) I called and told Mandy that I was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. She said that I am just another person oppressing her and that even the Avengers were oppressing her these days. I asked her what she meant (won’t spoil the movie) but I explained to her that I was acting out of frustration and Avengers is just a movie and now I was really concerned. She said I could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we’re done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. Thank you for participating but I think it’s a dead subject at this point.

613,No A-holes here,"My fiance and I are 30 year old gay men. We both have normal, non-homophobic parents and our families have known about our relationship since the very beginning.

We've been engaged for about a year, and as soon as it happened, both our mothers and all of our sisters and sisters-in-law decided they want/need/MUST help us organize the wedding. We said we wanted to wait a bit, because we were busy, yadda yadda, excuses excuses, but the truth is we have been planning on eloping this entire time.

Both our parents offered to pay for the wedding but nobody gave us any money yet so we can't be accused of spending their money to have a wedding without them. But here's the deal: they bought us the house we live in now.

We talked to our friends about this and they ALL think we're assholes exactly because *my* parents bought the house, and *his* parents pitched in with a lot of the furniture and some construction work the house needed before we moved in. They spent *a lot* of money and helped us out immensely. (Btw, we asked them for a bit of financial help, but never to finance the whole thing. When they offered, we accepted because we were both in student loan debt.) 

However, this was THREE YEARS AGO. Not only that, but we've both gotten amazing jobs since then and offered to pay them everything back. They refused, so we just get them and our siblings and niblings expensive gifts now (like a Kitchen Aid, 4k TV, bicycles etc.). Of course, we haven't paid it off yet but I still don't understand why this would mean we owe them our wedding. They're expecting a huge affair. Like a 200 people thing. One of the first times my MIL talked about her plans for our wedding, my fiance half-jokingly said we would elope, and his father said something like: ""Would you really do that to your mother?

614,Not the A-hole,"So she'd been living at mine for a few months. I love her, I still do but we have our down moments.

&#x200B;

On saturday we went to view a property, we were running late so I suggested getting the bus (5mins) whereas walking would be 20, my girlfriend started to argue saying why bother we'll be there soon, why can't I just walk. I got frustrated because we were just walking down this street and she was shouting at me and then I just kind of snapped and said 'stop shouting at me, I understand we're late but don't talk to me like that'. I'm a bit passive most of the time which leads to me apologizing but I felt in this case I needed to stand up for myself. She then walks away and says she doesn't need this. 

&#x200B;

I go looking for her, see her on a bench, then sit next to her, She then goes 'why couldn't we just fucking walk, I don't need this, we are through and this time I fucking mean it""  she then continues to start shouting at me, people start staring and I just got up and walked away. 

&#x200B;

She has said about breaking up before but says it's on emotions so she doesn't mean it. I told her the previous time that if it happens again, I will take it to heart and I will take it as her wish so this time it really hurt. I walked away and went to work 3 hours before my shift started. 

&#x200B;

She calls me at work and says how sorry she is and she didn't mean it. I came home and she stayed up late to see me, she had made some food and did my laundry.

I said hi to her but no one really said anything so I just laid on the bed because my shift was busy as hell. She then gets upset at me because she made all this effort for me and I didn't appreciate it and walked outside to the balcony. We argue and then apologised. But i feel strange the entire time. I still love her, I still joke with her but I still felt strange and worried. She calls me when she's at work a few days later asking why I'm so strange now and asks if I want this, and I just say I don't think we should do this.

&#x200B;

I know I should have said this in person, but I've been worried since she said about breaking up. We're about to sign a 6 month contract for a flat and she can easily say about breaking up when shes upset but then take it back? That shit is scary.

624,Everyone Sucks,"Using a throwaway for privacy. Not giving real ages, but we're both in our 20s.

I married my husband a year ago. Even though I've always had it drilled into me that anyone wanting to wait until marriage for sex is hiding something, I stupidly agreed to wait until marriage because I never learn from a single mistake.

As it turns out, my spouse is essentially impotent from childhood medications (ADHD). I didn't know the full extent of this until the honeymoon. Suffice to say that that honeymoon was one of the most depressing weeks of my life. We tried to seek medical care for it, but Viagra and other ED drugs wouldn't be safe for him to take due to some heart issues, which I completely understand.

I was at first trying to hide the issues from family/friends but as things declined, I had to be more honest. He slowly stopped trying to show any affection to me, and we haven't slept in the same room for over a year now.

My mental state has been on a slow decline, so a friend of mine offered to have me come out to her state for the weekend to get away. I wasn't planning it, but while there, I ended up having sex with someone at a club. Sounds gross, but it was GREAT.

Of course the aftermath has been very harsh. Most of my family understands that I'm extremely sexually frustrated and have been put in an impossible situation, but obviously a good deal of my ""social network"" thinks I'm a *slur*. They hold that with the exception of severe abuse, marriage is forever. 

I'd like to try to be okay with an asexual relationship, but honestly it's incredibly hard. I didn't marry to stay a virgin and sleep alone. I don't know if I have a high sex drive, or just A sex drive. I had a pregnancy scare from it and realize that I deeply want children one day, which obviously can't happen in this situation. 

I'd like to try sex again, but obviously that's not happening. I'd also love to have a sexual high without a crash of guilt afterwards. Everyone else gets that, why am I held to an unachievable standard?

My spouse doesn't want to accept an open relationship, not that we're talking much these days. In my state lack of consummation isn't reason for an annulment, so I'd have to prepare for a full divorce. I make more than he does and our condo is in my name, so he could take a great deal away from me.

Am I really in the wrong here?

Edit: 

I've gotten some preliminary advice that I should offer him a flat settlement to sign no fault divorce papers (say 10k plus I pay his moving costs, or even just a flat 15k). It sucks, but it would get him out of my condo quickly, prevent further legal battles, and end this quickly and quietly. With a ~2 year marriage, no kids, and the fact that 10k would about cover every financial contribution he made in the marriage, that actually looks like an amazing deal for him in front of any judge.",491,912,0.91

626,Asshole,"Since I got home from my sophomore year of college last week, I have been watching my kid brother (14, freshman in high school) spiral into bad grades, and I knew my mom would never be tough enough on him to really make an impact.

I fed him at 7:00PM and then I interrupted him playing video games to complete his homework. He had weeks’ worth of grade recovery packets for math, English and history that weren’t done and he only had until Monday at 3:00 to finish.

He cried several times. Every time he told me he wanted to go to bed or stop, I told him it was this, or commit to being a D-student for the rest of his life.

I never helped him, but I checked his work to make sure it was correct. If it wasn’t, I’d mark where it was wrong and hand it back.

We’re currently on vacation together with her parents. We were all on a fairly empty beach by our rented bungalow. My girlfriend fell asleep, and because it was sunny out and my girlfriend is very pale, her dad suggested that she should be brought inside. He carried her inside which is the first thing I thought was weird. He came back out for another half hour and I spent time with him and her mom. Then he said he was getting tired, and he was heading inside for a nap. Her mom and I just kind of nodded and continued chatting for awhile before we went back inside as well. When we went inside, he was sleeping with her in the bed, spooning her. This is something that we do so I couldn’t help but feel kind of creeped out. Later when my girlfriend woke up and her parents weren’t around I explained to her that I thought it was bizarre they were sleeping in the same bed. She insisted that I’m making the situation something it’s not and that it’s not weird at all. I told her I found it “inappropriate” and she called me an asshole for it. AITA, or is it just weird?

Edit: Some people are asking for more info.

We’ve been dating for a year. I’ve met her parents on several occasions and we’re all just about close enough now that we’re taking a vacation together. I always knew she was a daddy’s girl (not that she self-professed this title, it’s just what I picked up on), but I feel like this is what crossed the line for me. They’re not really “weird” otherwise, but they’re obviously very close. A little too close IMO. They’re super cuddly. When we were waiting to enter a restaurant the other night she leaned into her dad’s chest and he started stroking her hair. Other than that there’s nothing super unusual. Just typical exchanges of parental affection like hugs and sometimes kisses on the cheek. I have yet to see her cuddle her mom the way she does her dad. 

My train of thought is she’s 20, a fully grown adult. Past a certain age cuddles with your dad shouldn’t be such a public display of affection.

Some more info: 

She’s typically mature, which is why I find her behavior around him unusual. Until now if I had to describe her, I would say she’s independent. However, when they’re together, she seems dependent. Her behavior is almost regressive. She’s not the mature adult I’m used to being around, but more like a child. When we’re all crossing the street together he says “wait” or “careful” and sometimes holds his arm out in front of her. She isn’t bothered by this at all, where 99% of adults would be. He babies her to the point where she can’t even carry a bag by herself and he’ll pick up everything for her. Again, no objections. Meanwhile, if I were to do anything like this, I have no doubt she would tell me not to worry about it, that she can do it herself.

Yes, she is an only child.",2170,8300,0.9
632,Not the A-hole,"
My parents visited at the end of last week and brought with them a big chocolate bar that said “Happy Easter” for our 4yo son. I’ve been letting him have a square from it every night after dinner as long as he’d been behaving himself for majority of the day. Tonight was the last square, so he was pretty excited to finish it. He was extremely well behaved all day. So when he finished dinner and asked if he could finish the chocolate bar, I excitedly said yes and told him he really earned it. As I walked toward the kitchen, my husband asks what our son asked me for, so I tell him and he asks if it was the gold wrapper in a ziplock bag, I say yes, he whispers “I threw that away, I thought it was trash”. 

I was on my way up to put our baby to bed when this all was going on, and I obviously knew 4yo was going to be pissed, so I told my husband he had to break the news. I hear “I accidentally threw away your chocolate, so it’s gone, there’s nothing I can do” then he just walked away to watch TV while our 4yo starts scream-running around the house shaking and crying “nooooooo”! So I tell my husband he needs to apologize and calm him down, he has a right to be upset, that was a big deal to him! Plus I didn’t know it was gone and had just told him how he earned it. But husband refuses to apologize, saying “I don’t need to apologize to a child” and “what do you want me to do? Shit out a new one?” (to me, not our son). Then he continues to say that “[our son] had a great day, now you’re ruining it by doing this”, as in by telling him to apologize. He also added that if I hadn’t left it on the counter, he wouldn’t have mistook it for trash. I figured since it was in a baggy and clearly was our child’s chocolate, that common sense would tell you it wasn’t trash. 

I ended up getting our son a popsicle as a replacement and told him that his dad didn’t mean to do that, all was settled. I said to my husband on the way up that that’s all I expected him to do... come up with a solution to calm our son down and tell him he’s sorry for accidentally throwing the chocolate out. But he just went on about how I’m ruining his day by expecting that and he will never apologize because “it’s stupid for him to be that upset over chocolate”. I typically wouldn’t care but this was a “gift” in his eyes and something he was being rewarded with for good behavior, it’s not like he’s just being a spoiled kid expecting candy. 

Edit: when I came back downstairs, 4yo and husband were cuddling on the couch and he did apologize. I did reply to a few comments below with more detail but basically, my husband and I have differing parenting styles and occasionally it leads to these situations where I feel like he’s being TA and he thinks I’m trying to make him seem like TA when in reality, I’m just being soft on our 4yo.",118,184,0.92
633,Not the A-hole,"My mother has been a stylist for years. During the last 10-15 years, her business has been mostly focused on wedding events. As such, she mainly works with brides and bridesmaids to style their hair and makeup. For one reason or another, she does not style many of the men at these weddings. I don't think this was her choice, just how things have worked out with the clients that she books. 

&#x200B;

Over the last 5 years, I have avoided my mother when it comes time to get a hair cut. This started after I received several haircuts that I was not happy with. She says she likes to ""experiment"" with different styles with me but I'm the one who has to live with the botched hair.  I was convinced this was simply because my hair style was not the typical style of work that she accepts. With that said, she would always be upset when she saw that my hair was cut by someone else. I tried telling her that it was not personal, and that I just wanted to try different looks. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now and I have moved away from the city my mother lives in. My younger brother still lives with my parents and my mother does cut his hair when he needs. The last two haircuts my brother got have been really terrible - crooked lines the forehead and sides, and a terrible fade. When I saw his hair, I told him that it looked really bad and he should go to a different stylist. My brother told me he agreed but did not want to go anywhere else and wanted to make my mom happy. My mother heard this and was upset at me. She claimed I was being mean and resentful towards her. I don't like to argue with my parents and told her it was not personal, but that I think that she has a talent for weddings styles more than modern male hair styles. She said that she is an expert in all hair styles and that my brother's hair cut was very professional looking. This was several weeks ago but she is still upset at me about it.

634,Asshole,"A little context. My cat wasn't doing so hot before she stole it. A pretty severe heart murmur the vet said would only get worse. I was heartbroken. She would get stressed in the slightest (think a light spook, like walking around the corner when she wasn't expecting you, or excited to play with a toy) and give a helpless yowl and just... Fall over over the spot, breathing heavily. It hurt me seeing my baby hurting so badly. I decided I'd rather she didn't suffer and scheduled an appointment to have her put down after seeing no improvement for about a week.

My mom offered to take her (with her husband) to the vet to have her put down because the choice was already killing me. I agreed, and they picked her up that day. I know it was cowardly, but that's the decision that was made. 

Then, a few hours later, my mom texts me to say that since she was loaded into the car, she had improved. She wanted my permission to take her to her house in a town 5 hrs away and possibly nurse her back to health. Elated, I said yes, overjoyed to possibly get more time with my baby of, by that time, almost ten years. I would later learn it was at this point (admittedly I'm getting this info from her, so she could just be using him as an excuse) her husband said he didn't want her back in the environment that was my house, because ""obviously"" the stress was killing her. 

As an aside, I had previously lost the cat that was her son four weeks earlier and bought a new boy in hopes it would reduce the stress of not having a friend. If it had been brought to my attention in a reasonable timespan, I would have found him another home to have my girl back, as it had only been about 3 weeks by this point if I had an inkling he might have been the cause or that it was the reason they kept her from me. I mourned her here, as she informed me she wouldn't be coming back. 

Now FF 4, almost 5 years, and my mother texted me that her health was declining. I politely informed her ""she's your cat, not mine."", and said nothing more on the subject. My mother hasn't spoken to me in almost a week now. I don't have anything to say to her. She has taken the joy she could have provided to me, and left only the agony of knowing she's dying now. It feels cruel to me. AITA?",43,96,0.83

so she talked about how her phone was taken off her at 8.00 every night. 
he mom would only buy her thrift store clothing. 
her mum had the naughty chair, it was the chair you sat in for 10 minutes if you where naughty. 
she did not get treats after dinner 

she then went on about how sometimes she was starved, so I asked how long that could last. she told me that she was not allowed to eat food an hour before dinner. and midnight snacks where banned. 

I asked if she bad ever been hit, I also added that she can refuse to answer a question if she does not want to answer. 
she had never been hit and her mum never called her any names or yelled at her, unless she was being naughty. 

i asked if there was anything else and she said no. 

that all seemed pretty normal to me. 

I then said, that's not abuse, all the mums i work with at the church group do the same things. 

she got megga pissed and left and is refusing to speek to me.

637,Not the A-hole,"This evening, my girlfriend and I were hungry and craving wings, and we ended up placing a $80 order on one of those uber eats type apps. 

However, when placing the order, we forgot to add a tip for the delivery driver after cancelling the predetermined tip (in order to place a bigger one than the 10% that is default). 

Instead of cancelling the order that was already sent out to the restaurant, we decided to just wait for our food to arrive and then tip the delivery driver with cash at the door. 

When the driver arrived, however, he came up to our doorstep glaring at us and just dropped our food on the porch before we even had the opportunity to hand him the tip. At this point I was kinda pissed so I just closed the door instead of attempting to run him down and hand him the 20. 

We told our friends about this and they insisted that we should have cancelled the order and made sure to give the driver a tip through the app, so now we feel a little guilty.

638,Not the A-hole,"My friend Kyle \[M23\] and I \[M21\] have known each other for a few years, but started hanging out and drinking more in recent months. Something that he likes to do is tease people, but lately he's started to get kind of intense when we're drinking. Since I'm Asian (Chinese-American) and short (5'8""), he likes to make small dick jokes about me, asking how I can please women with a small dick or that I work out (I'm kind of buff) to overcompensate. It's kind of becoming annoying and I think it's even lost me some potential hook-ups...but I don't say anything because denying it would make it seem like the truth (it's definitely not--I'm doing pretty good down there), but going along with it just adds to the dumb stereotype. Usually, I just laugh.

&#x200B;

Now this is where it takes another turn. I'd invited Kyle to come to the gym with me before work a few times, but he always had some excuse. Last week, I decided to go to a different location in the morning since I had a meeting in another part of town. I got done working out, headed for the shower area, and hung up my towel, and who do I notice at the swimsuit drying machine? Kyle was standing right there, fully naked, and I got a full view of his dick. It was TINY, like you could barely see it. He notices me, and it looks like he's seen a ghost. I completely ignore the...elephant?...in the room and make small talk. Eventually we decide to shower and get out of there, but I didn't bring it up the whole time.

&#x200B;

This past weekend, Kyle, myself, and some more friends decided to hit up a bar, and here he goes again with the small dick jokes. So I decide to hit him right back with ""I don't know Kyle, if I'm small, you'd need a microscope to see yours"" (it sounded way more clever when we were drinking). Everyone kind of chuckled, but Kyle got really, really red. Then, he found an excuse and awkwardly left after a few minutes. I wanted to make sure he was okay, so I messaged him the next day and he hasn't said anything since. Was I the asshole? Should I apologize?",40,84,0.94

When we first started dating she told me her dad died before she was born. Obviously this  is a sensitive topic so I didn't bring it up much but maybe a year into our relationship my dad was in an accident and was in the hospital for a long time and she was really there for me during his recovery and  she emphasized how much she envied my relationship with my father and repeated the claim that her's died before she was born and she  "" always wish she had a father.""

&#x200B;

2 days ago one of my best friends found an article online from 2006 basically about a guy convicted of murdering his girlfriend and was sentenced to life in prison and and it mentions her mom's name as a former girlfriend of the guy who had a kid with him. He claimed he found it because he was bored and started randomly googling his friends' names but regardless of how he found it this completely shocked me.  I kinda thought it was fake. I showed my girlfriend the article and she started freaking out basically confirming it's authenticity.

&#x200B;

I was a little angry. She has basically lied to me about her dad for the whole relationship. It's not even like he was convicted of murder when she was a baby or something. We are 24 so so this all happened when she was 11. I told her all of this and that I feel deceived, especially because she often talked about growing up without a father. My ex was basically a pathological liar and I hate that shit. She got super defensive claiming that she barely knew him even before he went to jail and that it's hard to have a father like that, and people look at her differently. She then accused me of ""cyber stalking"" her and being emotionally abusive. The argument got heated and she basically ran off and I'm guessing is staying at her mom's.

We asked them if they could quiet down but the guy responded ""mind your own business moron"". After some time Jupiter finally rose high enough in the sky to be able to look at it so we aimed the telescope at it and took turns gazing.

Mom asked me to post this here because I mentioned a different AITA thread. She barely knows how to google, let alone use reddit. Pretend the title was written in third person about my mom.. but you know, sub rules)

My mom has been in the basically same position at a school district for 25 years, but in 3 different buildings (all the schools are on the same massive campus). Friday the 26th was her last day. She has been telling everyone since February (when she found out she has been hired for a new position where she won't be working with any of the teachers anymore) that she doesn't want any kind of party, no big send off, etc, and that if they did it, she would walk out. She hates being the center of attention like that, and is only friends with a few people in the building out of like 100 faculty members anyway.

On Friday, when she arrived, her immediate supervisor gave her a goodbye card, which she accepted gracefully. A bunch of other teachers started following her down the hall while she was on her way to morning bus duty, cheering and filming. My mom tried to ignore them, hoping they'd give up and leave her alone. Soon they brought out a boombox, started playing loud 80s dance music and yelling at her to dance (all while still filming on their phones) . She handed her clipboard to another teacher, walked inside, told the assistant principal she was leaving and why, he said fine, and she left. 

Now a bunch of them are mad at her, of course. She says if they wanted to say goodbye to her, they could have done so quietly like her immediate supervisor did. 

I feel like they didn't do it for her, they did it for themselves (especially since they were recording it). She told them her wishes clearly and repeatedly, and even said she'd leave if they did anything. The people she was/is actually friends with all took her out for drinks and only one participated in the dance party ambush.

649,Asshole,"Kind of a petty one here, but it's been the cause of so many stupid arguments.

The story: SO's mother very nicely invited me over for easter dinner knowing I would be spending it alone if she didn't. I am grateful for this.

In her house, the ""rule"" is; person who cooked doesn't have to wash up.

Honestly super fair rule... If her cooking didn't involve using anything and everything to create a meal. One pot meal? She's used three and you'll have no idea why. Making sandwiches? 5 different knifes used, like it truly doesn't make sense.

Anyway, on to dinner, roast chicken, some veg and some potatoes. As soon as I was invited in to the house, without even asking I cracked on with peeling, it's the shittiest job and I want to be helpful. Took me like 10 minutes, honestly, not a big deal.

A couple hours later, dinner is ready. We eat, it's a nice meal. I walk in to the kitchen... I'm not even joking, I wouldn't use this many pots and pans if I were cooking for my entire street. 

""SO's mum, I do really appreciate what you've done but this is... Like how did you manage this? Sorry but this doesn't seem that fair."" 

Her: I've been cooking for two hours, the least you could do is clean up.

""As I said, I do really appreciate this... Wait... Did you just say you've spent two hours cooking? If I made something in my slow cooker, could I claim I cooked for 12 hours?""

Her: no, that would be stupid, you just put it in there and left it.

Expecting the penny to drop here I backed off a little... No penny dropped. She HAS SPENT TWO HOURS COOKING, regardless of the fact I did the most annoying part of it and literally all she did was place items in an oven and then watch TV until it was done... No... She's cooked for two hours. I have to wash up after someone who has no regard for anyone else involved and her justification is completely fine but if I were to use it, it's invalid.

I washed my plate, SO's plate, and the items that could be reasonably be used to create the meal, and left the other like 12 items and left.

Am I the asshole? I'm all for being helpful and I greatly appreciate everything, but I just felt like there was no consideration for anyone else apart from her, and the fact that the justification only applies when she uses it really hit a nerve.

Tell me straight, AITA?

Edit: I can't answer any more questions until I have a better connection, it's becoming quite stressful writing an entire comment and having the page refresh and it disappearing. Hopefully gave enough information in comments.

General idea I've got is: ITA because I knew what would happen and still went through with it, that couples with my shitty attitude, and I'm perfectly happy to accept this. Thank you everyone for helping me see the error in my ways and I'll be communicating with my SO more in the future to hopefully avoid repeats!

Edit 2: /u/Dragonlover18 suggested I post this reply since it explains a bit more
>After discussing with my SO we've come to the conclusion that there were dishes and stuff from previous days that she hadn't done, only other explanation is she threw grease on to random stuff and placed it on the side, which really doesn't seem like something she would do, or anyone...

I'll take being called a petty bitchboy, you wouldn't be wrong, what I did and said was petty as fuck and I acknowledge that fact in literally the first line of the post, but judge me on my actions please, not me as a person.

To the people who said NTA, thank you but I disagree. People have let me see I was the asshole here for my attitude and pettiness and maybe in different circumstances I could believe you guys, but not these ones. Read the comments also please... It's becoming clear people aren't.

Have since called and apologized, if you still haven't scrolled to find out.

If anyone's interested, phonecall consisted of me apologizing for my behavior and an attempt to extend my gratitude as far as I could over the phone. She wanted to make it very clear that she doesn't want to be spoken to how I did, but actually completely understands where I was coming from because ""You are a guest in my home, I expected SO to help you but if someone had asked the same of me(full implication: asking someone to wash up not just that days stuff, but also things that have been there from the past X days too), I'd of probably said the same thing, albeit maybe a little nicer.""

We seemed to be pretty into each other and was kind of hoping that as the night went on that it would end up with us together. 

All of a sudden as I’m talking to this girl, I hear someone behind me say my name. It’s a girl, Renee, that I used to sleep with sometimes. 

She’s really drunk and starts saying things like, “Oh what are you doing here? Are you here to fuck me again?” and she tries to kiss me. 

I kind of push her off and say that she is thinking that I’m someone else. She keeps coming on to me and I eventually tell her to fuck off and find some other guy to sleep with. Renee’s friends eventually come around and drag her away after this. 

Meanwhile the girl I’m talking to has heard all of this and asks me if I slept with that girl before. I told her no and that I’ve never seen that girl before in my life but she doesn’t believe me and says that she wouldn’t have cared if I had slept with another girl but the way that I handled it “makes me seem like an asshole.”

If someone says they have a stomachache, I will immediately panic and start giving them distance.

After awhile, they both became severely shut in and stopped leaving the house, leaving all household chores (cooking, cleaning, getting groceries etc.) to their children, also while shutting us in as well. We were never allowed to have a social life outside of school, and when complaining about the issue, we were either told we were being selfish or we weren’t honoring our mother and father for being disobedient. 

When growing up, I had come to the realization that I was gay and no amount of prayer or self hatred could change that. I had to come to terms with this part of myself all alone, because with all that alone time spent with my parents at home, I’ve seen and heard them become disgusted by same sex couples on tv and were quite belligerent in letting us know that “that lifestyle” was not ok. 

Now I am older, in my third year of University and most of my siblings have left home (I am the second youngest btw) all that is left home is my younger brother who is in high school, an older brother who left college for some time, and my parents.

While home for this past spring break, my parents and I were talking about the recent (at that time) R. Kelly, Gayle King interview. I mentioned how I thought R. Kelly would further incriminate himself (which did happen) and my parents went on this HUGE tirade about how in the eyes of the Bible, and that this whole trial was bs. This then somehow turned into a lecture on me about how God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve (my name is Stephen btw pronounced Steven) then proceeded to stare at me as if they already knew I was gay. 

As I am about to graduate somewhat soon I’ve been thinking about what kind of life I want to live after college. It’s made me question my role in life and ultimately I’ve been pushed away from Christianity because of their faulty logic on how R Kelly should not be prosecuted. I’ve saved up some money and planned on moving away from my family, but don’t think I have it in me to confront them about my feelings towards them and their religion.

My only concern is even though my parents have done some fucked up things to me, I still feel as if they love me in some weird conditional way. Now that they’re getting older, they’re nest is getting empty so no one would be there to take care of them, I would be the only one of their children to graduate from college which would potentially put me at a higher paid position than any of their other children someday. I can’t shake this feeling that I’d be leaving them high and dry to fend for themselves.",17,38,0.9

Since the weather has been super warm I get a lot of runners, bikers, walkers, etc that pass through. This particular individual looked suspicious. He passed by my house about 4 times and that scared me. I don't know if he was doing laps around the subdivision or casing my house and my neighbors. 

I decided to call the police non-emergency number and told them. Long story short they sent a car out. I don't know what happened after. I told some friends and they freaked out cause the guy was black. I told them I would do the same if he were white, mexican, etc. Him passing by my house 4 times made me uncomfortable.",169,158,0.75
661,Asshole,"Throwaway since the sub supports it.

So this all took place over the course of the past two days, my (22F) college was having a drag show night set up by the school's program board. I'm a member and usually involved in DJing, announcements, narration, that kind of stuff for the events we set up. It was our first time doing this kind of event, and I'm much more used to our other events like trivia night or casual sports nights. I'm very inexperienced when it comes to this sort of stuff, never been to a drag show or been interested/involved in the community. To my surprise there were men and women contestants, and we had a pretty good turnout. I was nervous but my team members assured me that it would be easy and to simply call out the member's names when they came up according to our list, and get the crowd riled up.

Given the title, you can probably see where this is going. So the night is going smoothly, and eventually I get to a very male sounding name, let's say Tyler. Now along with their names, the list has a little bit of information again to help get the crowd going. So I narrate something along the lines of ""Now this is Tyler! He's a CS major from (a very rural/out in the country town). Everyone give this country boy a warm round of applause!"" Tyler steps out with a grimace on their face, and glancing over to the table where the judges and I were sitting. They come out, say a few words, do their thing, and return with seemingly little issue. Afterwards the night wraps up pretty quickly, and we all eventually head home.

The next day in the afternoon however, the college's program board group chat is flooding me with messages. Apparently that morning Tyler sent a very fiery email complaining about the DJ that misgendered them and apparently using their dead name (The name on their student ID/the info given to us, mind you. I'm still not sure what they prefer to be called but for simplicity sake we'll just keep saying Tyler.) They demanded ""that DJ"" to apologize for humiliating them, and that it should've been obvious the minute they stepped out that something was wrong with calling them that. And now we get to the point:

WIBTA if I said no? It's a drag show. Everyone looks feminine, no clue how it was supposed to be ""obvious"" that something was up. And second of all, we simply used information that was on their public student profile, things like their legal name, and major. I expressed that I had no desire to go out of my way to apologize to a random student, and that it's finals season and we should all really be focusing on that. I was told that it would be kind of a jerk move since it was our mistake, but again, I don't see how it could've been prevented at all.

EDIT: Had to repost due to title reasons, should be good now! Longtime lurker but didn't realize there were so many rules lol  


EDIT 2: To clarify, I had no part in actually collecting the names. That falls onto the head of events and the organizer for the event. I simply narrated off a list that was given to me by the head of events.",108,42,0.73

Me and Girl 1 didn’t click due to some miscommunications so we stopped talking and she’s currently with another person. F and Girl 2 continued talking and are now dating. 

So a few days ago I called F  and asked him if he wanted to go out with “just the guys “ that night. Unbeknownst to me he was also on the phone with Girl 2 and she had heard what I proposed.

It's gotten to the point where I am breathing through my shirt for part of the day because I find the smell so overwhelming, it's absolutely distracting from my work.

I don't see how there's any way to bring this up or discuss it without it being at least somewhat awkward.

I (23F) graduated in May of 2018 and wanted to spend a few years working before heading to law school to save money and gain experience. I found a great position that I love a lot. My company knows that law school is something I want to do in the future, just not immediately.

I very recently found out that my dad is sick, and the long-term prognosis isnt looking too great. I decided to attend school this fall while I still have the support of both of my parents. This is sooner than I anticipated, but I want my dad to see me graduate. I applied and got a great scholarship to a good law school.

However, I just found out that my manager is leaving the company and I am being promoted to a higher position. Her departure is pretty big for my company, so there is a lot expected from me. I'm excited to take on more responsibility (and get paid more). But now I'm leaving in August and my company has no idea, and I feel bad for leaving so soon.

671,Not the A-hole,"Yeah, it doesn't sound good, I know... And my conscience is not clean about it, but I really didn't find another solution, so let me begin...


My ex and I broke up early this month and I was feeling kind of lonely, so I decided to play a little on Tinder... I found a seemingly nice guy and we started chatting and things were good. I made it clear what I was going through and he told me he understood and agreed to go slow.

After 2 weeks talking we went on a date that was great I was starting to feel a lot better about my break up. The only problem about him is that he was overly cheesy and clingy, it wasn't thaaaat bad, I could handle for the attention (I know, bad :[).

On the second date we had sex... Well, I have a high sex drive so I wanted, but emotionally I still needed it to go slow, and I tried my best to make it clear.

The problem is, besides getting even more cheesy(saying he really felt something special and out date wad one of the best he ever had... I never responded because I didn't want him to get the wrong impression), he started to get sexual out of nowhere. I told him I was getting uncomfortable with that and he asked to give him some time to adjust. I agreed, he truly seemed good.

But then a week later we were text and I sent him a meme and his answer was ""I want to suck you so bad"". As I was nowhere near horny at the time I just made a joke about it... And he kept going how he wanted to give me a lot of hickeys... Still not horny I tried to change subjects and his answer was once again ""but really, I want to suck you so daamn bad"" and I just stopped answering... He tried one more sexual comment and I gave up at all, haven't been answering since then as I thought it to be creepy af...

672,Asshole,"My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty.

The issue: Today the three of us were sitting on the bed and we were playing with the baby. I had my hand on the baby's knee and was keeping her from rolling over since we were close the the edge of the bed and it was kind of cute and funny how she'd respond to it by growling and kicking her legs, she was smiling and laughing at the same time so I know I wasn't doing anything horrible to her. He told me I was being mean. So I blew him off and put the baby down on the floor to play and I went and sat in another area and watched the baby play. It hurt my feelings for him to say that because already I feel like I dont get to have any fun with her. I am always the one that feeds her and changes her ect while he gets to have all the snuggles and play time.  He came around like 2 hours later and said he was sorry for teasing me, but he didnt feel that it warranted further discussion. I told him that It was fine and that I probably just got bent out of shape because I felt like it was rude to call me mean since I do 90 percent of the baby care if we are both home.

Our curriculum is broken down into ""blocks.""  The block that we are currently in is the second-to-last one of the year (running from 04/08 to 05/10) and has a reputation as being the hardest block of this academic year.

Part of what makes this block so difficult is that we have quizzes every Monday that are designed by the faculty to be ""very challenging.""

678,No A-holes here,"I do not have any disabilities.  This happened a few years ago, I was a mid-twenties guy with a medium build. (that is to say, I don't look disabled in any way.) I drove a 12+ year old lower end Mercedes sedan.

My college town grocery store parking lot was pretty crowded on the day this happened, but while I was looking for a spot, I found that the best spot in the parking lot was open.  This spot is literally right next to the entrance for the store. In fact, it is closer to the door than the two accessible spots next to it, and based on the paint pattern, I'm  guessing at one point this was either an accessible spot or an access aisle for the spots next to it. It might have been changed because it didn't meet the handicapped parking standards for my town. When this happened, all handicapped stripes have been painted black, and the spot has no special markings denoting it as an accessible spot. It simply was not a handicapped accessible spot.

I parked in this spot. It was early spring, and this store sells plants to put in your garden outside this time of year-- so I meandered through this area right next to my car for a couple minutes. I then went back to my car, grabbed my reusable shopping bags out of the trunk, and began to head inside. A man in a large white van had stopped and put his blinker on for my spot, and I waived to signal that I wasn't leaving. I then went inside. I believe this man was the husband of the woman who approached me later. I don't remember seeing anything on the van denoting handicapped access, but I am confidant the van was marked in some way.

About 10-15 minutes later inside I am standing at the butcher counter when a 50-60ish year old lady comes up to me with a picture of my car on her phone. These aren't her exact words, but the gist of what she was asking:

Her: ""I've been trying to find you--this is your car, right?""

Me: ""yes-- uh oh-- what happened?"" I asked, slightly panicked that something happened to my car.

Her: ""My husband has \[disability\] and can't join me in the store because you took the last handicapped spot. I didn't see a tag on your car, did you leave it at home?""

Me: I just started stammering ""Uh... but... I...""

Her: Continues talking about the impact this has had on her and her husband.

Me: (Finally) ""It's not a handicapped spot.""

Her: ""It's not?""

Me: ""No. There's no sign, there's no ground marking-- the other two spots next to it are handicapped spots, but this one is just a regular spot.""

She then left, and I had a flood of adrenaline.

In retrospect days later, I wished I had offered to move my car, or had told her that if she/her husband had asked me to when I was parking, I could have moved.

Was I the asshole for taking this spot, and was I the asshole for not quickly offering to move so her husband could park and come shop with her?",19,57,0.84

I got the ring for her and proposed. She said yes. And I was really happy. We discussed about making it official and she agreed with me. I wanted to make it a bit special, so I decided to tell our family on her birthday.

On her birthday, we hosted dinner for our families. It was a very small gathering. So, after dinner, I announced that we were getting married. Everyone was happy for us. At this point, idk what happened. She started crying and told me that she had second thoughts about getting married. Everyone was really shocked. She removed her ring and gave it back to me. It felt like a slap in my face. I just left. She later told me that she was really stressed and depressed and apologized. Things became lukewarm between us. 

Now, her sister called me and told me that my girlfriend was going to propose on my birthday, which is next week.

He payed for my ticket to SITW which was $300 for a 3-day pass, and I went with my nursing school friends. I spent most of my time with one particular friend and her boyfriend.

Yesterday he kept trying to ""search"" for me through the crowd. He was texting me all day asking me where I was, I kept giving him the same exact location description. I was near the stage so I understand it was hard to get up there. Although, there was a point when he was 5-7 people behind me and I signaled to him. He saw me, but decided to turn around and walk back past the ocean of 3000 people when he was already so close to me. He said he would be back for Chris Brown, but let's be real, that wasn't happening.

&#x200B;

I get that he shows me love through money, but when has that ever fulfilled anyone? When has money ever made anyone truly happy? Anderson Paak got on stage, and he played ""Make it Better"". The song was fire, all the couples were slow dancing, love was in the air. I didn't really give a fuck, I still enjoyed myself, but the lyrics made me think so deep about my relationship. It's been 2 years, and I still have to act closeted when I'm around him. I came out after high school, and in the 1 year that I was single before I met him I never felt freer (is that a word?). Do I want to live the rest of my life like this?

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I love him a lot. I'm just really disappointed and angry at myself, him, the world, life. I woke up this morning wishing I could be a straight man and live a normal life. But when has anybody been able to change their sexuality at the snap of a finger? No one. So here I am, hurt as a bitch, feet swollen from standing for 12 hours, alone...

He spent money on me though, a lot of money. I feel like I owe him everything. Am I the asshole for feeling this way after he spent \~$800 on me? Am I the asshole for feeling this way regardless? I just feel like I'm indebted to him.

**EDIT**: To clarify, I'm not his sugar baby. When we first started dating we had no money, I was just starting nursing school, and he had his own issues. He makes decent money now, so he regularly spends money on me. The best way to describe our relationship is that we're each other's best friend but we have sex and we tell each other that we love one another. The issue here is that it's all behind closed doors. He hides this gay aspect of himself to the public. I have to switch to ""closeted/straight"" mode when we're in public because he doesn't want to be outed. It's just not worth it anymore.",24,25,0.84

 Like sure. Not at all a problem I don't have any other plans today. Fine. I ask why out of curiosity and I get told it's bc her staff has an appointment somewhere. I'm sorry, what now? So I say something like ""she's got an appointment? She's working. Can't it wait?"" 
But ultimately I let it go. And agreed to the earlier time. If she had said later I would have lost my shit bc I'vd not eaten breakfast since it's a buffet we're going to and i dpn't want to not even be hungry bc apparent lunch is at like noon for my sister. Like i don't eat that early.

I'm thinking I *should* tell the staff that running personal errands while on the clock is unacceptable behavior even *if* your client is ok with it.

I told her that I didn’t think it would be appropriate and that she was going to have to learn how to deal with it on her own. She asked me one more time saying that this had nothing to do with our relationship and that she was scared and couldn’t be alone. I felt at this point like she was trying to manipulate me so I told her that if she didn’t want to be alone then she shouldn’t have broken up with me. She didn’t respond to me for the rest of the night or in the morning even though I tried texting her. She said she had the worst flashback of her life that night and that it was cruel of me to tell her to just deal with it which I don’t think is fair. I just don’t think it’s my responsibility anymore. She told me that she thinks I’m spiteful and that my definition of love is selfish. So I told her some things I probably shouldn’t have and blocked her. But, I still don’t feel like I’m in the wrong. Does anybody else agree?",571,1371,0.94
684,Not the A-hole,"  So basically I don't know whether I'm being an entitled bitch but I feel quite annoyed as it's taken me (13m) to save up around £250 in Amazon vouchers.
  I was talking to my father and realised he hinted that he had spent it whilst trying to build a new house.
  When I talk about having £250 my parents always shut the convo down quickly.  If I complain that I can't spend it my mum says that I should have made my own Amazon account and not put it in the family account. If I talk about having the money or spending it they talk like I'm being entitled. 
AITA for being annoyed or am I being a little bitch.


Edit- Thanks for all the advice. I do love my parents and they are genuinely good people but I just think they've been really stressed out with building a new house and have beentrying to get money to finish it as it's been a 5 year project and its still not finished.

I've decided to leave it till after my exams (which are in a few weeks) and sort it out from there.",26,103,0.94

686,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I are in our mid thirties and have been married for ten years.  I'm (very obviously) expecting our third child but we've been going through quite a rough patch.  Last week my toddler and I brought lunch to his work (this is the first time we'd been there) and ate with him in the cafeteria.  A few people he knew came in and he said hi and talked briefly.  Then his boss (male) came in and my husband introduced me as his girlfriend.  He actually said it twice.  His boss said something along the lines of ""Is this your wife?"" and my husband responded with ""she's the girlfriend.""  Twice.  I was too surprised to do anything but give a small forced laugh and make some small talk.  When I later mentioned to my husband that I found it hurtful (especially in light of our recent difficulties) he said he was just joking and finds that sort of thing funny because of how absurd it is.  I said that it wasn't funny to me.  His boss and him aren't even particularly close that they would be making this sort of ""guy jokes"" with each other.  He finally sort-of apologized after I brought the issue up a few times, but I don't think he understands why I found it strange and hurtful.

I need some perspective.  Am I just being overly sensitive or is it weird to introduce your wife as your girlfriend?

Edit: We are having problems, but the statement was meant as a joke, Not to hide cheating (at least not from his colleagues, but I am quite sure he is not cheating).  His boss and colleagues know he is married, has kids, and is expecting a baby, so it was obvious I was the pregnant wife.  To me it just seemed like one of those jokes that aren't really jokes, like he wasn't really happy saying I'm his wife. He also said it was funny to him after, not really recognizing why it might be hurtful to me.  So I could just be sensitive and guys make this kind of joke all the time.  Hence the need for an outside perspective.",161,1152,0.97

689,No A-holes here,"I want to start by saying that I love my Dad and want him to be happy- and I was worried about him being lonely after Mom died somewhat suddenly (6 month illness) in the middle of this March. They had been married 40+ years. 

Last night Dad told me that he was “back in the dating game,” and that he had signed up for eharmony account a month ago.  This made me feel like I had been punched in the gut.  He signed up for a dating site... a week or two after Mom died??  I know no one knows the ins and outs of someone else’s marriage, but I cannot understand this.  But I sat and listened to him talk about his matches (hes actively corresponding with SEVEN women) and tried to be okay with it. 

But then he told me one of the women is 33 years old, and I about hit the roof.  Dad is in his upper 60s, and I am 36.  I have a whole other set of issues with him dating someone this young (what are her motives?) but that is probably for another post. 

He then shows me an email that he had written one of the women (he had printed it out and kept it in his pocket, so he clearly knew I might have an issue with this and wanted this printout to help him explain himself).  It talked about how in the last few months of his wife’s (my Mom’s) illness he had disconnected emotionally and was just immersed in being a caregiver, etc and how it tore him up inside to see her like that. The email even referenced me, “daughter doesn’t know how hard this has all been on me, just thinks of me as Dad who doesn’t show emotions.”  The email even referenced his feelings of love for this new woman. He just stands there while I read it, and says that he hopes it helped me understand where he’s coming from.  

I did not yell or cry or anything, but I clearly wasn’t giving him the reaction or support he was hoping for.  I told him that this all made me really uncomfortable, and that I REALLY had a problem with him dating someone so young. He was kind of put off and said “well it isn’t up to you, literOcola.” 

I know everyone handles grief differently, and that I cannot control his dating life.  But Mom’s headstone isn’t even finished yet.  I want to be supportive of him but I am REALLY struggling.",72,192,0.95

&#x200B;

To put a long story short, I won't be here for long (think sometime October this year but it could be sooner, it's not easily predictable) and me and my husband have agreed that we would make the best of the time we had left together. I didn't include my family or my husband in making this decision because ultimately I felt like it was something I had to decide for myself. I told my husband first since he knows how to handle news better and is generally more supportive of my decisions whereas my family would be hell bent on me making it past October.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing, I've lived my life. I know that I'm young but I've seen it all really, hell, I've been through it all, the good and the bad, the highs and lows, and I'm ready to leave this place. My husband (although very sad to hear this) respects my decision and will do everything he can to support me. We've decided to live normally (still working our day jobs, because I love mine very much) and also to the fullest (planning out weekend vacations, doing everything we have wanted to do together, etc).

&#x200B;

I have known since late January (2019) and made my decision by mid Feb, told my husband before we eloped in March but have yet to tell my family. I feel withdrawn lately and have been enjoying the last of my time here that I don't know if I want to spend the remaining time I have left ending it on a bad note with them - because they will not respond well, most likely be overbearing and potentially cease contact (as they have done in other situations in the past where they could not understand or support my decision). I haven't always had a good relationship with them and we were always a dysfunctional family but now we have grown to be in a good, respectful place.

&#x200B;

I understand that they have a right to know as my family so I do plan on telling them, I suppose the most opportune time would have been to have told them immediately but then I thought I could do it in person when I visit them in summer but plans have changed and it's possible I don't have that long.

692,Not the A-hole," tl;dr at bottom

I have science class with a kid named Jeff. I was pretty nice to him and we have a few mutual friends together and the same interests, but before we knew any of that, I barely knew his name and that  we have class together before he started to act like we we're best friends. He was friend requesting me on Facebook, bringing tech for me to fix, acting really clingy, etc. Keep in mind that we had only been ""friends"" with each other for for a 2 weeks tops.

Fast forward a couple weeks, our science teacher assigned a group project. We could choose our group. My group was assemble, and Jeff wasn't there that day. The day he was there, he begged the teacher to be in my group (which was already beyond maximum capacity). All he did was sit on his phone for the allotted class time and outside class time we used to work on it. The entire final project for the term (which was the deciding factor for an A or a D). Fell on me.

A couple weeks went by and he kept asking the teacher if I could take him to the counseling office because he was sad about his aunt who passed away. I had nothing to do with that.

 I later found out he was just trying to get out of class because his Aunt had died well over a year ago. Just to confirm this, he would ask to go to the bathroom or the nurse's office because his arm hurts (when it would mysteriously be better outside of class), then we would just sit outside the bathrooms on his phone until the last few minutes of class.
 
Last night I decided I had enough when he added me to a 28 person Facebook chat. I looked through the people in it, I only somewhat knew 2 people in it. After talking with some people in the group, it seems like he was thought it would be funny to add a group of random people.

Tl;dr: I barely know kid, kid becomes obsessed. Uses me to get out of class. Takes advantage of me. Uses me for A grade on group project. Fakes sadness and depression to get out of class.

I'm in two minds about the whole thing and it's difficult for me not to read negative things into the lack of help or gifts. We said publicly we didn't expect anything and gifts are superficial really but on the other it does mean something, especially from the new parents in law, right? 
I'm feeling pretty conflicted about bringing it up but I think it's something which might affect my future relationship with them. So, would I be the asshole to ask them about it?

697,No A-holes here,"So I rejected this guy in middle school for no particular reason other than the fact that my parents didn’t want a middle schooler to start dating (good call tbh). I did tell him at the time that I like-liked him because we were so close as best friends, we told each other everything. The thing is, my parents don’t want me to date til college/after college. 

However, the next year, I was like “fuck it” and I dated this amazing guy for 5 months because I was lonely lol. I digress that yeah that was kinda an asshole move of me. At that time, my best friend started distancing himself from me (biggest heartbreak of my life) My bf and I broke it off though because he was going to a different school and I didn’t want to do long distance.

So fast forward, I’m in high school and I have been trying for a while to reconnect with my best friend again. We play Tabletop Simulator on the weekends now :). But it’s clear that our friendship will not be like what we had, which is real sad. 

The spring fling of our school is coming up, but would it be a bad idea to ask my friend out despite rejecting him?

Edit: I really appreciated the replies and I think I have somewhat of a consensus. Furthermore I must confess something...I’m definitely not his first when he like liked me back in middle school. The story is a bit complicated so my wording may not be crystal clear. basically back in middle school, he was trying to choose between me and my really really good friend (the three of us were basically a trio friend group) and while yes I liked him back, I knew he was happier with the other girl (In hindsight, I was right. Him being with her was prob the happiest I had ever seen him) 

However, my best friend had to break it off with her for the same reason I broke it off with my bf; school troubles. So it wasn’t like I left him in the dust buttttt I still agree with the people that said that I was the asshole back then. Completely true. 

The great thing about our friendship was that I helped him through his breakup and he helped me through mine.

I feel like me and him drastically changed and have become more mature since those middle school days. My consensus is that I’ll give asking him out a shot but I don’t want to pursue a relationship. I want to wait until way later if me and him are still friends and I want him to be cool and comfortable with a relationship. For now, consider us friends.

698,Update," In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bek79b/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_about_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I (27M) asked you if I was an asshole for not telling my boyfriend of 10 months that I did drugs from the age of 14 to 25. Most of the answers were that I was being an asshole and that I needed to tell him about my past if I wanted our relationship to go anywhere. Some of you suggested talking to my therapist and my friend (who called me an asshole in the first place) about it, and to write down everything in a letter and give it to him.

So I took a week to write and rewrite and rewrite the letter again, and I brought it with me to two sessions with my therapist. She gave me some more advice (btw she didn't know I was seeing someone that seriously, otherwise she would have advised me to tell him sooner), I rewrote the letter another couple of times, and I decided Saturday would be the day to do it. I also decided to actually read the letter out loud to him, instead of having him read it.

On Saturday I almost changed my mind, but when he came over, he could immediately tell something was the matter because I was jittery as hell, so I did it anyway.

I won't go into extreme detail here, but the jist of the letter was that I used to do drugs for ages, I relapsed and overdosed several times, my mental health issues that I was seeing a therapist for are not my actual diagnosis but symptoms of PTSD, I told him what caused the PTSD and how it led to me turning to drugs, and finally that I want him to know exactly who I am before committing to me, and that I understand if it's too much to handle.

He started crying and said he was sorry for the things that happened to me and that I did to myself, and that he was happy I trusted and loved him enough to share all of it with him. He said he does want to stay with me because the person he's known for 10 months has never made him feel anything but happy and loved, and that he's prepared to take a chance on me. (He said a bunch of other things that I can't even remember because I was so distressed and we were both crying a lot, but it was all positive.)

And that's it, we're still a couple, I don't have any dark secrets anymore and I'm looking forward to being in a loving and honest relationship with an amazing guy. I truly feel like I'm luckier than I deserve to be and I'll do my best to make it worthwhile to him. I'm still a bit shakey because it could have easily turned out much different, plus I've always had low self-esteem, but I'll try not to get in my head about it.

Thank you all for telling me to get a fucking grip and deal with this before it was too late, you're nicer than people give you credit.

700,Not the A-hole,"Hear me out. I'd known him (ex friend) all through school and like a lot of my friends saw him as close family. I didnt have the best home life as a teenager so I became very attached to my close friends. He was one of the closest people to me and I trusted him completely - and vice versa.

We ended up living togther in a flat. Everything was 100% fine for about a year - until I became single. Once I didnt have a boyfriend everything changed, he acted completely different. 

It was around week 3 of being single, and I suggested a road trip up to our old town we went to school in. I had already mentioned the week before *again* that I wanted to be clear that I was only interested in a friendship with him. This trip was to show that im willing to still stay friends dispite how he was acting and me being firm about it. 

After a great day on the way back he says ""I cant be friends with you anymore, this is to hard for me to deal with and I dont want to anymore."" In which my reaction was furious. He didnt say it in a nice way at all, infact it felt cruel.

So I said ""fine."" (after about an hour arguing with him) and asked him if I can then see his friend (his other best friend) whom of which I really liked, and he liked me back. (That my (ex friend) 'forbaid' us from even thinking about dating eachother previously). This was seeing as he wanted to completely cut me out of his life (again dispite living together).

He said 'fine.' Then after we got home (still living together) cut us both off completely. Instead of cutting just me off he cutt off his other best friend as well. 

I then very cautiously dated this guy, who turned out to be a very serious deal. I glazed over the details but essentially, its a very healthy and happy relationship with him. I still live with my ex friend but im moving out shortly to live with the now boyfriend (the one who was also best friends with him) 

To be clear on two points, firstly I had always been 100% clear i did not have any romantic feelings for my ex friend. I was always afraid he would be hiding something from me so i very seriously told him many times it would never happen to avoid this type of situation.

Secondly, Yes his other best friend and I were both told previous to this that he wouldnt want us seeing eachother for many reasons - and we both agreed to it at the time. We said we would stay away from eachother for him. We didnt keep that promise after his confession.

I always demand for school to come first. Good grades = privilege of going to auditions and being in plays, bad grades = none of that. Every time he would argue I told him that if he ever wanted to pursue a different career one day he would need it.

It worked for a time but now he got offered a role in a TV show that actually looks decent (I took him to the audition, I just never thought he would get such a big part and it was supposed to be just ""practice in looking good during auditions"" as he called it himself) and he wants to take it.

His wife, my aunt, sorted through what she wanted to keep and what she didn’t, and put what she didn’t want up for grabs. What she didn’t want included some of his shirts that I imagine she thought were ugly while he was alive.

We’ve gotten long sob story texts about how much his shirts would have meant when they were kids, and we were being selfish because he was their family not ours.

712,Not the A-hole,"My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.

The theft: 

On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.

Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. 

I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?

Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",2868,22954,0.9
713,Asshole,"I am the child of two EXTREMELY narcissistic parents. You can google it for more info, but in short they have been extremely abusive towards me for my entire life. Furthermore, my fathers abuse towards my mother makes her lash out at me. I spent most of today locked out of the house because he came home in a bad mood, and that pissed her off and she took it out on me by locking me out of my room when I came out and leaving for about 8 hours. My 14 year old cat was in my room this whole time with no access to food, water, or her litter box. I have been planning to move for quite some time. I just don’t know if I should take my things with me. 

The things I bought include my tv, their tv, a shoe rack, and various other things of mine that they don’t let me have even though I bought them. I feel like I am entitled to these things because I bought them, specifically the shoe rack and the TV in their room. They only use the shoe rack to store their old shoes they won’t throw out, and they barely watch the TV. For some reason, they’d both rather watch the TV in the living room with a huge blotch on the screen than the 65” I got them. 

I talked to my sister about it and she says I would BTA in this situation because I’m taking things I got them. I just want more opinions.",62,253,0.96
714,Not the A-hole,"So a few months ago, I (F14) ordered a pink kanken (backpack thing) off a site and the wait time was a few weeks. My little sister (F11) also wanted one, Kankens are expensive but I worked my ass off to save up $140AUD for one. Yesterday, I noticed that my kanken hadn't come yet, so I complained to my little sister about it, to which she replied our mother was going to get her a pink one for her birthday, red flags but I decided to wait until today. 

Earlier today, I contacted customer support while she was at school (we have different starting dates, as we go to different schools) to ask about the bag, they gave me proof that it was signed for by my mother. Obviously I was confused and decided to confront her about it, proof and everything that SHE signed it and she denied it ever coming, I even had the exact date and time it came.

Well, little sister gets home, she wants to play with me, I say no so she complains to my parents about it, they say if I play with her theyll give me a 'surprise'. 

That surprise was my bag, I put two and two together and became super fucking pissed at them (not showing them obviously, Id get a slap upside the head). Little sister becomes extremely jealous and has a tantrum, to which she complains to my mum. 

""Well ask Solitary to give you hers, she can get another one"" 

I told her no, to fuck off I wasnt going to give her the bag I earned because I so desperately needed an upgrade, especially considering that it was in a colour she didnt like and my mum wasnt going to pay for another one. AITA?

TL;DR: Bought a bag with my own money, parents take it before I can get to it so they can give it to my younger sister for her birthday, I complain about not getting said bag so they cave in, sister gets angry and demands to get a bag.",163,1130,0.95
715,No A-holes here,"My sister and I never made a great team. We respect each other, that's about it. We see each other only a few times a year and that's fine for the both of us. We live in some kind of ""separated peace"".

&#x200B;

Last week, she asked me to attend the baptism of her newborn son. It's her first child, I don't (yet) have children myself.

The baptism takes place the first week of July, but we already planned a week of holiday in Germany. We booked everything, including hotel, tickets for an eSports event and some other activities. This put us back a few hundred of freedom dollars per person, most of it is non-refundable.

&#x200B;

My sister is a bit upset and wants us to attend, because she ""asked in time"". We also missed the gender reveal party because of earlier made plans (yawn) and this would be a second ""big moment"" we would be missing.

I think I should not cancel my plans, because organizing a baptism in the peak period of yearly holidays is a bad idea, certainly when you only inform people two months in advance.

In addition, I'm not a big fan of baptisms (I am a convinced atheist) and I'm not willing to cut my vacation short (or even cancel it) to attend.

My girlfriend is in doubt, and suggests we return back home a few days earlier.

716,Not the A-hole,"Apologies in advance as I'm on mobile. TL:DR at the end.

So my mum has no sense of boundaries. She's one of those people who's like 'what's mine is yours' and I'm all for sharing but this is getting ridiculous. We're the same size in shoes and clothes so naturally sometimes take things from each other's wardrobe, but not often. But she's taking it too far. I can't have makeup on my dressing table as it'll go missing, and when I find it in her bag she just says 'oh but we always share!' when it's been completely used and I've not had chance to even wear it. She does the same with food - if I buy something nice to eat for later, I'll come back to it and it'll have been eaten or put in the bin without me knowing. 

It's gotten to the point where I have to hide new purchases to stop her from taking them. If I buy a new top or an expensive perfume, it goes missing! I recently bought a gorgeous new pair of shoes for my birthday, and she's already told me two events she wants to wear them to. The final straw was the Easter eggs, and it's pretty petty tbh.

So at Easter we had a few Easter eggs, and we've both been eating them. My boyfriend got me one, and my boyfriends parents bought me a big Easter egg which I was trying to savour as it had some lovely extra chocolates. She ate it. She ate it and didn't tell me, and I'm pissed off ngl. She could have had any one of the other eggs but no, she had to have the one which was a gift. I have to lie to my boyfriend and tell him how good the chocolate was and how I really enjoyed it, when I haven't had it. I kinda feel like enough is enough, it's petty I know, but I'm sick of having to 'share' my belongings when if I take something of hers I get yelled at or told I'm not allowed. She's not my sister, she's my mother, why can't she just have her own things and let me have mine?

I feel like an asshole for having to hide my purchases from her but it's the only way I get to enjoy them.

TL:DR - My mum thinks 'sharing' is the same as taking without permission, and I have to hide my things from her to stop her from using them.",43,149,0.96
717,Not the A-hole," At about 9 a.m. one Saturday morning, my phone rang. A woman identified herself as Jane Smith, and asked if I could put her and her husband up for the night. I recognized their names because they had sent me a birthday card every year since I was an infant. I told her that I have only one bed and that I couldn't accommodate them.  She said that she and her husband were in town for the football game, and no rooms were available. In my town, it was common for the hotels to sell out or require a two-night stay on weekends where there were home (Division I) football games. I repeated that I had nowhere for them to sleep. There was some back-and-forth where she tried to persuade me to put them up for the night, but I kept saying no and hung up on her.

&#x200B;

I got a letter from her a week or two later where she said that she would have liked to have found out what kind of person I had turned out to be. The birthday cards stopped. What I couldn't get her to see was that I hadn't seen her since I was a child, and that was only for a minute or two.  They were going out to dinner with my parents while they were visiting from out-of-state.  I didn't remember this until after I hung up, but one reason that my parents didn't have anything to do with this couple after that dinner was that they had expected my parents to pay for dinner because they were ""guests"", even though they had invited my parents to dinner.",40,485,0.96
718,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, I got this new neighbor next door who makes my family's life a living hell. For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:

&#x200B;

\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch

&#x200B;

\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face

&#x200B;

\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.

&#x200B;

\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.

&#x200B;

\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to

&#x200B;

\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling

&#x200B;

He's done more stuff but you get the picture.

&#x200B;

So this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me ""its my yard I can do what I want"".

&#x200B;

Now i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.

&#x200B;

Then he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).

&#x200B;

He looked shocked and all he said is ""how dare you use this language in front of my kids"" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Today however, the dog knocked through my locked door. (I have double doors which you can easily push through unless it’s locked, in which case it takes considerably more effort but is still possible.) The dog rummaged through my room and ate the low THC edibles that were on the ledge next to my bed which I put in a ziplock bag.

My roommate came home before I did and saw the dog and took her to the hospital. Upon coming back she was irate and demanded I pay for the bill. 

However I told her I wouldn’t pay the bill because after all, the edibles were in my locked room and on a ledge above my bed and it wasn’t really my fault. This didn’t really go over well. 

Am I the asshole? I feel terrible about it but it wasn’t really anyone’s fault in my option.

UPDATE: I told my roommate that I understand it’s expensive and we are both still in college so I offered to take on some of the responsibilities she has regarding doing the dishes and such this month while she focuses on working to pay off the bill. I know it’s not my fault but I know what it’s like to be in a pinch for cash and feel stressed and alone while still managing school and chores.

So for background: BF loves to smack my ass. I don't mind it as long as we are in a private place with no one around. But I've told him repeatedly that slapping my ass in public or with family/friends around is totally inappropriate and makes me feel uncomfortable.

Okay, so present day: my BF and I were at an expo all day. Being around all those people made both of us very tired and a little bit irritated. 

The plan after this expo was for us to go back to my place, have dinner, and he would spend the night. 

We park and are walking to my place when he slaps my ass out. I give him a look like seriously bro? I was willing to let it slide because all I wanted to do was sit down. 

Then he smacks my ass again and I tell him to knock it off. 

He says there's no one around anyways, and he smacks my ass AGAIN. I tell him to knock it TF off.

But no, he just had to smack my ass a third time. By this point we are at my door. I tell him that if he smacks my ass one more time, I'm not going to let him in. 

I turn around to unlock the door, and he waits a few seconds before he smacks me again. 

I tell him to go home. He's like wait seriously? I'm like yeah, go home. I don't want you over anymore. He laughs and starts walking to his car, looking back expecting me to change my mind. 

I unlocked my door, waved goodbye, then went and had a nap. 

I woke up to a call from him. He told me he was sorry, and that he took the ""teasing"" too far. But he said it was a dick move of me to ""kick him out of my house when we had plans"".

He hung up angry because I'm not willing to apologize for my actions. But I honestly don't think I should have to tell him to stop four times after I've expressed my discomfort.

727,Not the A-hole,"For context, I live on the lake in a small, quiet neighborhood.  Half of my neighbors are retired, the other half are still working and have school-age kids, but the majority of us live here ""full time'.  One neighbor, who lives 2 doors down, is a ""weekender""... he lives elsewhere, but allows his teenage kids to come to his lakehouse for unsupervised weekends.  

So neighbor's kids throw a massive party this past weekend (not atypical; they always bring dozens of other kids along). But by 1am it sounded completely out of control... They were jumping off the roof into the pool, and screaming things like ""fuck you!! I did it motherfucker!!"". They were loud enough that I could hear them from *inside my own house*.  As soon as I grabbed my phone to call in a noise complaint they shut everything down.  Okay, perfect! I went to bed.

Today, I was talking to my neighbor on the other side of Kids Gone Wild, and found out that the kid having the party was the youngest child and is still in HIGH SCHOOL!! (I thought they were at least all college kids. Nope!)

Good Neighbor tells me that she's met Weekend Neighbor only once in the last 8 years... Weekend Neighbor told her that the kids come out from time to time, and if there's ever a problem to call *HIM* (the dad) not the police.  

I've never met Weekend Neighbor, but I don't feel like I should have to call Good Neighbor and get her to call the dad when his underage kids get ridiculous.  Also, Weekend Neighbor lives an hour away!

So would I be the asshole for calling the cops during the next party?  I'm not just irritated at the disruption, I'm scared one of them will die falling off the roof or driving drunk, etc.

728,Not the A-hole,"  

I can’t believe this is all happening over some stupid thing; an AITA post where a girl talked about posting herelf onto porn sites while dating someone. For those of you who know what post I’m talking about, I honestly have no care on the matter, and I’m not going to try and be an expert of porn production in relationships. It started today with my BF just RANTING about the post and him sending it to me earlier. This is the pointless convo that transpired:

Him: I can’t believe she would post herself online for other guys to jack off to. 

Me: Ok

Him: That’s so gross, I can’t fathom thousands of dudes jerking off ot you

Me: Ok

Him: The worst part? She went behind his back to do it. What a fucking whore.

Me: Ohhhkay..

Him: Don’t you agree

Me (well, since you asked for it): Well, when you watch porn, do you care or check if the girl got her partner’s consent?

Him: What?

Me: Let me rephrase: If you chose a porn video and before you got to business, I stopped you and said “Hey, this girl is doing this porn behind her boyfriend’s back”, would you actually give a shit and choose a differnt “ethical” video?

Him: Uhh \*silence\*

Me: Exactly. Not saying I agreed with what she did, but is what she did really THAT bad? You act like she cheated. If that makes her a whore, how come you guys would have no problem jerking off to girls like that? You can’t make a HUGE about a situation where the girl gets naked for other men to jerk without her BFs consent, but have no problem being one of those men. Guess we’re all hypocrites in this. 

Him: Jesus, you sluts are all the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I understand most of his emotions behind using the term “slut” was for that woman (although, I don’t get why he is taking a stranger’s actions so personally), but he DID include me in the term. And to me, that was way over the line. He can disagree with me all he wants, but insulting me was uncalled for. Plus, I have never done things to remotely be called a whore. So I told him to get out. 

He has always been a bit of a hypocrite and misogynist, particularly when we started dating.. Ie saying things like “Women are tricky, they mainly just use men and throw them away”, and constantly checking women out because “that’s how men are.” Yeeeeettt, if a male friend of mine at Uni even waved at me, he’d give me a stink eye. 

However, I largely brushed things off to him being raised a certain way and he had largely been very sweet and kind to me. I think today I reached a boiling point and I just told him to get out of my place. Note, this is MY place. He does not live with me, just spends a lot of nights here.

I am refusing to talk to him atm (I will eventually), while him and his friends have messaged to tell me what an asshole I am and how much I overreacted. Not sure if I handled things properly

729,Not the A-hole,"I'm a furry artist in highschool- all my my content is sfw and I do it for fun! I really do enjoy myself, but due to the stigma around furry art, the furry community, etc, I like to keep my interests relegated to online forums and communities.

(The boys at my school have a habit of harassing any account they deem cringeworthy on social media)

Fast forward 7 months and she comes in with a few friends and some dude I’ve never met, who she says her and her friends always questioned if he’s gay. So her and this dude are standing in front of my well (and she’s more drunk than normal) as I’m doing my thing. I notice this guys hands are all over her. Like for an extended period of time. Touching her sides, waist, ass. Ok, I don’t do or say anything. They go away and later dance in these elevated platforms. (She used to be in a dance troop) the dancing is overtly sexual. Grinding, dropping her ass, his hands are still all over her. Coworker comes up to me and asks “are you and so&so still seeing each other?” And I look up and see all this.

Needless to say I wasn’t thrilled and we had words. Starting with “wtf are you doing” & “what are you talking about what’s wrong”. Ultimately I chilled out bc If he’s gay then whatever. But still quite aggressive touching for liking another sex. I have never touched a gender I’m not interested in like this.

Fast forward. She comes in again with a bunch of old coworkers and I take care of them. Don’t see much of any of them as it was packed so I assume she’s dancing. When I did see her on the dance floor she’s dancing with some dude doing the shit she does with me, dropping her and bringing it back up on my dick and grinding on me and shit. Ok. Now I’m getting irritated. 

Argument starts after she leaves “what the fuck did I do this time?” I’m like are you kidding me. I know I said I don’t care about you dancing with other dudes but where’s the line? There’s no difference between how you’re dancing with him and with me”. Responding with “oh that’s just so&so’s friend he’s my old dance choreographer” or whatever.

733,Everyone Sucks,"I am currently 7 months pregnant with my ex boyfriends baby. Our relationship started out amazing, I love him very much but recently being with him has been trying to say the least. A couple months ago he relapsed on meth after being clean for 6 years. I don’t know why or what happened but he’s been telling me he was going to get clean ever since. Instead, as expected, things have become much worse. 

A couple days ago he put his hands on me and I had to call the cops. He’s been arrested for various things a couple times right before this happened which was why we were fighting. He’s probably going to prison for quite a while. I’m fine with raising this baby on my own. I’ve already grown to love her and my kids from my previous marriage are very excited to have her in our family. But I don’t want him in my life anymore. There’s no way I can trust him again and no way that I want him around my current or future kids. 

I have a friend in a town over that I visited around the time I got pregnant. My boyfriend was always skeptical that things weren’t platonic between us and I’ve talked with this friend about everything that’s going on. He not only wants to help me but once my ex is in prison he said it would be okay if I told my ex that he was the father. I think this would solidify my ex out of my life for good and I can raise my family on my own. 

If I went through with this there would be no going back. And I am fine with that. My kids will always be my first priority. But would I be the asshole?

Edit: Well, there has been a mix of feedback but more than anything some questions have been raised that make me think this option is not the right one. I don’t want my friend to be at risk. As much as he wants to help I don’t think I could live with myself if anything happened to him. Also if started off my relationship with my unborn child with a lie as big as this one, I don’t think she would ever trust me again, and I wouldn’t blame her. So I guess having a crappy father is better than not knowing one.

The problem is, she must have noticed I was acting off because, about 3 or 4 hours before prom, she texted me saying (and this is as close to a word for word quote as I can remember) ""Glenttastic if you're going to break up with me please just do it before prom, otherwise it won't be fun for either of us."" Naturally I freaked the fuck out and didn't know what to do. I responded with ""maybe we should just go together as friends"" (but understandably she avoided me most of the night).

They said that they wanted to start going by ""egg/eggs/eggself"" pronouns. Look, I don't even mind using ze/zir pronouns or whatever, but I draw the line at using the word egg as a pronoun. I told them that they shouldn't do that and just go by they/them because that seems the most simple. They responded by saying that I was being really hurtful and that pronouns are the most important thing to trans people and that me saying that really upset them. I basically just said ""look, I'll address you by your name if you don't want to go by they/them anymore, but i'm not calling you an egg ffs"".

she refuses to cross the road if she can see any cars driving on them, so we have had to wait 5 minutes before we can cross. 

she will text you exactly where she is if she wanders off while hanging with you. so if she goes to the bathroom I get a message every 30 seconds where she is, so if she is r word her location is there. even if I can see the bathroom she will do it. 

she will not catch a bus if she can not sit next to me, we have been late to so many things because of this. 

she will throw food away if she looks away from it incase a man drugs it. I dont know how that's possible. 

we where hanging out and and a guy looks over at me because I had a Metallica shirt. he mentions that it's a nice shirt and before I can thank him she interrupts and tells him that he is being a creep and how rude he is. 
I apologized to him and he nodded and walked off. 

I turned around and said in the most calm voice I could muster while being kinda angry, look I get that you want to be safe but that does not mean you get to poilice who talks to  me. if your that paranoid that you will be r word you should see a counselor or just stop being so paranoid.

739,Everyone Sucks,"I was chatting with my friends today and mentioned that I needed to leave soon to get the bus to go to the gym. They asked why I wasn't I going to the gym in the college. I said I only have a 1.5 hour window during the weekdays to go to the gym and the college gym's women-only hours cut into that window so I have to go to another gym.

&#x200B;

This started a discussion between our friends as to the ""fairness"" of women-only hours in our college gym. The college forces each student to pay for the gym (I'd prefer an opt in situation). My position is that if the college really cared about the safety of women while exercising, they'd make 2 separate gyms (one a female only gym and one a male only gym). If the college wanted to have women-only hours, I'd prefer for the college to charge the women more for the gym, since they are allowed to use it more frequently. Women-only hours definitely has a sexist implication but, if it allows women to feel safe when exercising and encourages more women to exercise, then I'm all for it. However, I strongly disagree with being charged the same rate for a service as someone else but not being allowed to use it as frequently solely due to what's in between my legs.

Half the group strongly agreed with me and the other half said I was a major asshole, which has led me to asking for a second opinion.

741,Not the A-hole,"throwaway account, just a tad bit paranoid. on mobile, not sure about formatting. yadda yadda yadda. :)

I am a senior in high school, and I’m fairly well known around my school. I’ve always been friends with the upperclassmen- well, when they were at the school anyways. I’ve never *not* been friendly to someone, and I usually make friends pretty easily. 

Last year, this man- I call him that because he’s 21, I think, and I’m 17(F)- added me on Facebook. I didn’t realize his age when I added him.... so I ended up adding him back. Mostly because I saw that we had 30+ mutual friends and I figured I had just forgotten about him at school. (Later found out that he graduated my freshman year.)  

Big mistake. IMMEDIATELY, he messages me. Okay, fine, people are allowed to message me. No big deal.

Except.... since that day, he’s messaged me multiple times a day, every day, for about a year. He spams my phone, calls me (who tf calls someone they don’t know? Wtf?), and comments on my pictures. His comments are usually along the lines of “You’re beautiful.” Damn near harassment. I’ll get more into that later.

I’ve messaged a few mutuals about it and I’ve come to find out that he’s mentally disabled. im sorry if that’s not the PC term, I don’t know what else to say. I’m not sure what he has, probably autism? I’m not sure. I don’t want to ask him. I think that’s rude.

Now, his messages are very frequent. He usually starts off with “Hi, Eve.” (That’s not my name, but you get what I mean. Unimportant.) I HATE leaving people on read, so I usually respond with just a polite “Hi, James.”  He takes this as an invitation to spam my phone some more. Message after message after message. If I reply even with the driest of texts, he takes it differently. He calls me his best friend. “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had, Eve.” I’ve never actually had a conversation with him EVER.  I don’t even remember going to school with him!!

He calls my phone every day. He does it, and when I reject the call, he calls again. “Are you busy right now, Eve?” He always asks. I always give him a reason why I’m busy.

Note that this is a grown man, and I’m underage.  He always asks me if I have single friends, or if I’m dating anyone... kind of hinting that he wants to date me. He asks this even though he knows I have a boyfriend. 

If I had known his age- and what he was like- I wouldn’t have added him back. I know it’s my fault for accepting a friend request from someone I didn’t know... but I didn’t think it’d end up like this. 

I don’t want to talk to him. Now, I don’t know how to do this without being mean or hurting his feelings. Would I be an asshole if I just blocked him? He doesn’t have ANY friends, and he seems really dependent on me. What do I do? Do I just ignore him? Can this be done politely? I’m very non confrontational. Any advice is welcome, I really just don’t know what to do, and if I’d be the asshole for blocking him..",30,31,0.84

744,Not the A-hole,"Every summer my community has a cookoff competition. Usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. It's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. This year it was pasta sauce. I've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and I moved here but this is the first time I entered as a competitor. It was earlier today.

One of the other competitors, I know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and autism. I don't know much about this condition evidently. I'll call her Jessica. I guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. We've never had this before as far as I know.

To make the story short, I won the competition. And $1,500. There's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. My wife and I were in shock because I like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? We were tickled pink. 

We celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. You might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to Jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". They said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. We obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. So they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with Jessica. Likewise we said no.

I guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. Apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. After a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

I’ve been working there from the beginning, took on shifts after my class as I’m still a college student, worked everyday for two months straight because two of the girls quit at the same time, and trained our two new employees.

I’ve found out I was pregnant a little late but my boss and I discussed me taking the whole summer off starting at 37 weeks pregnant weeks ago. Our boss is relatively new, she’s a manager that looks over many sites. One of our employees have been MIA due to her dad having cancer and her elderly parents living in Florida. 

Our other employee got into a car accident and I agreed to take on more shifts after class but lately I’ve been feeling used. I don’t mind the extra money but this third trimester has been pretty awful. I’m already anemic and the baby makes it worse. I almost passed out dealing with a baby twice.

I’m getting really impatient with my boss not hiring someone at this point and letting the MIA employee go. She’s clearly not in this state, not coming back anytime soon and i really want my time off to spend with my baby and work on myself. Now, my boss wants me to make myself available anytime in case our one other employee can’t go in. 

Our conversation yesterday:

Me “No. We agreed that I could have the summer off”

Her “Well I don’t have anyone else”

Me “I already agreed to help train someone new before I leave for maternity leave.”

Her “I don’t think you understand how hard it is fire someone and hire someone new”

Me “I understand I can’t help you with the hiring process but I’m totally willing to help train that person so they can replace me and MIA employee. I really like the time off since I’ll be a first time mom and the dad will continue working after taking two weeks off”

Her “You’re not being a reliable employee right now. I’m gonna need you here until I can find someone”

She didn’t show her face, but she showed up to the top of her lip, they looked eerily similar, and they had very similar body shapes. I texted my group chat of friends and asked “hey, do y’all think this is (let’s call her Emily)” and they said it indeed looked like her. We all joked about how weird it was because she was the LAST girl we expected to post her nudes online, but then that was that.

Come Friday, **everyone** knew about the nudes. She posted very explicit captions and pictures, and all of my (non-friend; more like sports and clubs) group chats literally exploded in her all her posts. Everything’s been since deleted, but someone made a backup, and it’s everywhere. People were tagging her in GroupMe saying things like “I can be your Daddy ;)” and “Let me see how much slut you are” and other pretty offensive things. She didn’t show up to school Friday, and it’s pretty much all everyone in our school is talking about.

My girlfriend and I have been together for like 3 years. She's been stressed lately and has had a lot of end-of-semester work, but over the past month or so the slight fuzz usually above her lips has gotten to the point where it's visible from the angle my height gives me over her, and when we kiss I am extremely aware of it.

I pay for their baseball, football, hockey and other activities. Her oldest (12) got big into bicycling last year. I pay for all his gear, spin classes, bicycles (any idea what a carbon fiber road bike costs? It's a lot) and even bought a camper van and trailer so my wife can take him to events. I give these kids everything they could want.

I have had several reproductive issues. Please also note I have Pmdd for those who don’t know is basically very bad pms which can cause depression and worse in some, among other things. Which it does for me. Being on birth control eaSes most of the debilitating issues

I had a miscarriage when I was 22. I had to have a  surgical procedure to help pass the fetus because my body would not recongnize I had a miscarriage. I have taken every precaution I can not to have pregnancy in the future. I had Mirena for 4 years. It was starting to get less effective  and I switched to depo provera for almost a year , the depo provera made me have anixety and depression. My body is extremely sensitive to the pill, if I take it a minute late I start bleeding. I am now back to Mirena. Have had it since Feb and I am have pms symptoms without the period. The past spring 2018, I was diagnosed with pre cervical stage 2. I had to have several painful biopsies and a laser surgery to remove the abnormal cells. thankfulky I am cancer free. I got another Mirena after getting the all clear. It was hell to get in as they manually dilated my cervix. I was in pain for days 
 
I am tired of being the one solely worried about preventing pregnancy. I am refused a tubal because I have no kids and an considered still to young at 28.  My doctor says most women who have a tubal still get periods and wind up getting Mirena to stop the periods anyway.

My boyfriend sees the debilitating things I went through. The surgeries, biopsies the Mirena pain. Right now my breasts hurt and I’m moody. I have explained that a vasectomy is much less invasive in a man and easier to obtain. He flat out refuses. He said “ he has no reason to, the thought of it makes him feel uncomfortable, he doesn’t want to.” He also said him saying him saying no should be good enough answer. I agree with that sentiment that no is enough.  and would never bully or leave him just because he doesn’t want to. Part of me is still angry though thinking “ he’s seen me suffer enough; he could do something to ease it for me and help and he flat out refuses just because he doesn’t want to do it.” I have not answered it because I know I’m hormonal and don’t want to explode. I am very sad because I feel like he has the ability to help me be off hormones which are badly affecting my body and won’t .

EDIT : I physically do not get a period. I get horrific symptoms like cramping, mood swings, breast and nipple tenderness, bloating. A period never comes. This sometimes lasts for weeks. I have tested for pregnancy and it is negative every time.

edit: I am not opposed to condoms. I do not trust them alone as a sole method of contraception due to human failure rates

Edit: I love my boyfriend dearly. He is my rock and sacrifices a lot and does a lot for me to support us.  I appreciate him. We have a good relationship and this is the only real issue we have. I am trying to find ways to make us both  healthy and happy. I am not the best VeRsion of myself.

I am willing to try a copper iud but is there a way to see first if I have inherited an allergy to copper before insertion. I already kno I’m allergic to the shit in cheap earrings which I believe is Nickel

Final update: my boyfriend texted me and said he is open to using condoms. We agreed to see if my body will calm down in the next few months. I have changed from depo to Mirena in feb and my body may still be adjusting. If I don’t feel better in the coming months we will re evaluate the situation.

I'm pretty sure I'm TA, but some outside perspective will help. Basically I (30f) was raised by a single mom, and my biological father wanted nothing to do with me. 

My mom was unknowingly the secret girlfriend, and when she got pregnant he threatened her repeatedly, then left with a third (entirely different woman). Shortly after I was born we moved far away and didn't really look back.

I started asking questions about him when I was six, and by chance she happened to get his work number. He agreed to meet in a pizza shop back in our home state, I got one awkward photo, and then a week later he basically moved his entire company into hiding (changed the name, moved addresses, changed numbers). My mom was in tears - I think she felt like she let me down. While she's always been the Lorelei to my Rory and I didn't really need anyone else, it still messed with me hard.

So for a little more context, I have three older half sisters via bio dad. One is only three months older than me, and actually went to school with and was best friends with my cousin. I could have easily gotten their information and told them - even in the last ten years, I've stumbled upon their social media accounts, and still never reached out. 

The last few months I've been really considering getting one of those Ancestry kits. Part of it is curiosity for my family tree (big Irish family, our reunions are gigantic, would be cool to see who else is in it). But if I'm being totally honest, a bigger part is to just leave a potential land mine for my bio dad to find. 

I never asked for money, or a relationship, but he treated me like a disease to keep hidden, and I want him to feel some kind of consequence. A letter telling him how well I did without him wouldn't cut it, he doesn't feel remorse for his actions.

They asked why we weren't getting her baptized and I said it's because we're not religious so we don't see the point. I mentioned that if she decides she wants to be baptized when she's older then that's fine with me. My parents argued that we're all Catholic since we were baptized so she should be baptized as well. I said again that my fiance and I both aren't Catholic so we're not doing it to which my dad replied that since we were baptized we ARE Catholic, we're just not practicing Catholics.

I told them again that I don't believe in God and we're not religious so until our daughter decided for herself we weren't doing it. My dad said ""well what if you're wrong? I won't even say what would happen then"". Then my mom made some insane comment about ""where do you think humans came from?"" and ""if we evolved don't you think they would've found fish dna in humans years ago?"".

I replied ""how much does it mean to her then if she'd be embarrassed about it?"" and my dad started going off about how I wasn't giving him a good enough reason and he'll just have to take her to get baptized.

We had planned on spending the summer driving around the area where he grew up in Northern Louisiana so he could show me where he was born, where he went to school and on and on. I am beside myself that among everything else we won't be taking this trip and I'm in the middle of cancelling reservations and have to explain that my grandfather died over and over to hotels and airlines. It's just a constant reminder of how sad I am. This comes after planning a funeral, going to the funeral, dealing with hundreds of people telling me how sad they are and on and on. 

My fiancé had been really great through the whole process and was a lot of help to me and my dad. I have to give him that. But this morning I was literally on the phone with United Airlines trying to explain why we won't be going on the trip, asking if ""proof of death"" is really necessary. 

In the other room I heard my fiancé on the phone with someone and he said ""I am so fucking excited about game of thrones tonight, I haven't been looking forward to something like this for months!""

I lost my shit, like literally hung up with the airlines and started screaming at him that not only are we getting married and he should be looking forward to that and plus what the fuck, my grandfather just died and he has the nerve to be pulling this shit with me now. After all I'd been through in the past two weeks to hear him say that the thing he is ""most"" excited about is a fucking TV show? I kicked him out of the apartment and told him I never wanted to see him again (which of course isn't true). 

He just texted me that he's giving me some time to chill out and he'll come home whenever I'm ready to see him again. Now that he said that and didn't get mad at me, I feel really bad. Am I an asshole or am I just not thinking clearly because of grief?",342,857,0.87

765,No A-holes here,"(REPOSTING THIS BC FUCKED UP TITLE LAST TIME, DO STILL ACCEPT ALL JUDGEMENTS FROM ORIGINAL!)

Obligatory disclaimers; have been Reddit lurker for long time, saw videos about this sub on YouTube, finally made account to post this. On mobile, so shitty formatting is shitty.

I'm a young single dad (22 with a 5 y/o). Kiddo's mum is, to put it kindly, a deadbeat drug addict who flip-flops between actually attempting to be a decent mother and having absolutely zero contact with our daughter at all. I have full custody and mum gets supervised visits when she can be bothered to show up but aside from that sees very little of our girl. I'm also a uni student and I'm pretty fucking proud of myself for managing to buckle down and do so well in my degree while raising a kid at the same time. I'm blessed that my university provides free childcare for students with kids and that I have an absolutely wonderful upstairs neighbour who is generally super reliable as a babysitter if I need to be anywhere in the evening.

My sister identifies as ""childfree"", which is whatever. She doesn't want kids, that's her choice. She's always been quite standoffish with my daughter and doesn't particularly enjoy spending time around her alone, however she's promised me before that she'll take over in an emergency. A couple weeks ago, I had a night class that is compulsory attendance on my course. My neighbour ended up not being able to look after my kid for this as she had a fall and had to go to hospital (she's much better now if you're worried!). I was stuck for a babysitter last minute, believed this constituted an emergency and asked my sister if she'd watch my kid for an hour or so while I attended the class (class is \~45minutes and it takes me \~10minutes each way to get too and from uni.) She flat out refused saying I ""knew how she felt about kids"" and that I should've been more responsible in finding a backup babysitter. I rang a couple friends but nobody could take my kid on such short notice, and she was sick with a pretty bad head cold at this point so I didn't want to take her to class with me. Ultimately, I ended up having to miss my class. I won't fail because of this or anything, but I will lose attendance marks and it'll bring down my overall grade.

I'm pissed at my sister. Not like furious, but pretty annoyed. I get that my kid is my responsibility and as a parent I have to make sacrifices, but my sister was home and not doing anything at this point and my little girl was mostly sleeping the entire time I would've been at class anyway. I know she's not fond of kids, but I wouldn't have asked her if I thought it was a legit emergency. She thinks I'm a dick for being annoyed, I think she's a dick for not helping me out. AITA here?

ETA: wanted to add a couple of potentially salient points. Not trying to sway anybodies judgement here, I get that it's my bad for not having a back up plan, but these are just a couple of things I feel I should've included originally.

* there aren't any grandparents in the picture who could've helped. My parents are both dead and the maternal grandparents, of their own volition, have met kiddo a grand total of twice in her whole life, both times when she was a baby.
* I definitely should have sorted a plan B, even if it's finding a local teenager who does babysitting or something in case my neighbour can't help. Didn't bring it up in the post originally bc I'm not trying to have a pity party here or anything, but I don't have much of a support system at all. As I said, kids mum is a drug addict and so was I until I knocked her up. We both agreed to get clean when we found out she was pregnant. I stayed clean after kiddo was born, she hopped straight off the wagon the second she was out of hospital and has no desire to get back on it. All that to say, I burned a lot of bridges and my support system is shitty at best so I struggle to find people to help out with stuff. As I said, not saying that for pity points or to sway anyone's judgement, just clarifying *why* I don't have a Plan B (will definitely take steps to make one in future).

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I've commented this to a few people now, so I feel I should add it here as I guess it provides some further context to this situation that I skipped bc character count: my sister has *never* liked children. Like never. She's 10 years older than me and didn't play with me at all and barely spoke to me when we were kids until I was like 7 or 8 because she didn't like little kids. She also told me the first time she met my daughter, a few days after she was born, that she wants to be as uninvolved with kids as far as possible. Basically meant that, unless there's an emergency, she won't babysit for me (as established here), she won't lend me money for anything towards my kid unless it's putting food on the table (to be clear I don't expect financial support, but there was a time when I was truly desperate and needed it and she helped me only with bills and feeding myself - was getting nappies and formula from food banks. I'm not complaining or trying to be ungrateful for the support she gave her, just giving an example), and I don't take anything emotional or mental health related to her if it's to do with parenting struggles, only if it's something outside of that. This was well established when kiddo was tiny, so I knew what I was getting into, but this is just to prove the steadfastness (is that a word?) of her child free-ness.",519,521,0.91
766,Not the A-hole,"I kind of have this rule where I don't date guys who are into anime, like if they watch one or two really popular shows or the well known movies that's one thing but the ones who watch a ton and new shows every season that's another. 

I mostly just do this because it wields out the weeaboos who'd fetishize me for being half Japanese. Usually I ask this relatively early on and with the guy I'd been seeing the last two months I had too, he then had acted like he didn't know much about it and mentioned how he had seen the Ghibli films though. 

However recently I found out that he's actually very much into it. I wasn't snooping but accidentally I found on his computer a folder with a lot of rips of shows and another one where he had saved art of anime girls and stuff like that. Save to say he's pretty into it but lied to me about it because he knew it would make a bad impression, and he's right as I do have that rule. 

So I decided to break it off, mostly because he lied to me but to be honest if he had been honest I wouldn't have dated him in the first place.

It wasn’t bad or anything, however afterwards he refused to kiss me. We kind of had a discussion about it.

After a bit of nagging on my part he finally kissed me although he didn’t seem to be thrilled about it.

So reddit, AITA?

Update:

As there are quite a few more comments than I had expected I thought it would be nice to give you guys some extra info and an update.


First I wanted to say that me (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for over a year now. He is the best bf in the world and I love him very much. Both of us have not had any previous relationships, so we still encounter new things regularly and we are still learning.


Secondly, I understand that not everybody likes cum. That’s why I had already flushed my mouth with water before I came back for a kiss. Especially since I know my boyfriend can be quite squeamish sometimes. After this I just felt kind of rejected because the idea of kissing me disgusted him so much.
I asked him after reading the comments if he felt like I pressured him into something he didn’t want to do and I apologized. Pressuring him was definitely not my intention, I would never want to do that to him. He said he didn’t feel that way and that he was sorry too for making me feel rejected.


Whatever your verdict may be, thank you all for your comments!",2496,11668,0.85

I told my daughter in law directly that she is the one staying home, so she should be doing the cooking, cleaning, and child rearing, not dumping the kids off on my son at the first convenient moment.

770,Not the A-hole,"So in order to save some money I’ve been using my apartment’s washers and dryers to save $600 a year. Now usually I take up one or two at most and usually try to do them at times when people aren’t around. But today I had to use them and someone had taken up all 4 dryers, had they’re laundry supplies all over and had used 2 washers. At first I figured it would be okay because there was more time that my clothes would need to be washed so I thought there would be a free dryer as I only needed one.

Well when I came back my clothes were done and all the dryers were still taken and completely done. In college it was always an unspoken rule that if someone’s stuff was in the dryer and there was no sign of them, you’d put it on top and use the dryer. So I waited awhile contemplating about whether or not I should take one dryer before finally saying fuck it because I had no idea when they would be back and I needed to get this done and their dryers had been done for at least 20 minutes now. So I moved their clothes on top of the dryer, put mine in, started the dryer, and waited to take out some of my clothes that didn't need to go the full cycle. 

So of course 5 minutes after I’d already started the dryer I took, the guy comes in and I immediately apologized for moving his clothes but he responded with “yeah but I just don’t like people moving my clothes.” And I said I’m sorry again and said that the dryer had been done for awhile and that they were dry to which he replied with “yeah but they would’ve just been done.” And then continued to huff and puff and sigh while moving all his stuff while we just awkwardly stayed their in silence until he left. I do understand where he’s coming from because I also wouldn’t like to have my stuff moved but on the other hand, I feel like it’d be common courtesy to leave at least one free machine open for others to use, especially if you leave.

771,No A-holes here,"My BF's parents passed away in an accident about 6 months ago, he was their only son and obviously this was extremely devastating for him to put it lightly. Me and my family supported him heavily and he took an extended leave of absence from work which he's still on. We are both 22 and been together for 3 years now, he obviously was extremely depressed and crying all day for months. I tried my best to always be there for him and I moved in with him for a few months to help him out. I also got him set up with a therapist and he's been seeing her frequently, the thing is progress is very slow. We haven't been on a date since the accident, sex life is almost non-existent because he can't stay hard and he's crying a lot still and is depressed most of the time. He works out still and we go on runs together but other than that he's curled up in bed watching netflix and crying/eating. I'm trying to help so much, I look after him like he's my son basically now and its super emotionally/physically draining. The only sexual contact I've had with him is going down on him and him finishing quick and rolling over and sleeping. I get that he' extremely depressed still about his parents deaths and I try and cheer him up daily and check in on him, make sure he's seeing his therapist, come over to his place almost daily. And I just feel like a caregiver now and not his GF. 

&#x200B;

With all this in mind and weeks of thinking about how to end things, I did last night. I went over to his place and said I can't be with him like this, I need to feel loved and taken care of as well which hasn't happened at all in 6 months and I feel burnt out. I've never seen a 22 yr old man cry this much but he started crying so much he puked and begged me to stay but I know I had to end it. I told him that I'll be here for him still and he's always welcome to come to me or my parents for help but I just can't be in a romantic relationship with him anymore. It was extremely difficult to do and I still do love him, but I just know I can't take this for much longer and will end up hating him. I know this sounds cold but its the only way I could have done this. I feel terrible but needed to do whats best for my happines, I made sure he had his therapist appts set for another few months and told him to discuss this with her. He just sat there motionless and I left.

774,Not the A-hole,"I live in a duplex and my neighbor (say his name is jack) that lives below me has a wife (say her name Mary) and kid. He sometimes travels for work and this last week he was gone almost the entire week. A day or two after he leaves some guy (say his name is Jodi) shows up and stayed the night and came over a couple times, and one night when I was came home Mary and Jodi were laying on the couch together and he had no shirt on. And I'm sure he slept in bed with her also because I came home late one night when he was there and nobody was in the living room and everybody was clearly asleep by then. Now jack is home and and Jodi hasn't shown up again.

I talked to my girlfriend about it and she told me not to get involved because I would be an asshole for getting into their business.

775,Not the A-hole,I live in a rural part of Canada. I was going down a dirt road (under the speed limit) when a dog suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I got of my car to see what has happened and I discover that I have hit the dog. The dog was still alive but was in a lot of pain and I put him in my car and took him to the vet (1.5 hours away). The vet knew the owners of the dog and he called them and told them what happened. I was going to leave the clinic but then the family of the dog arrived (I waited over 1 hour for them before deciding to leave). They thanked me for saving their dog and I left. Today they called me (got my number from the vet probably) and demanded that I pay over 3000 dollars for the medical bills. I thought that this was unfair so I refused to pay the money. The dog had already damaged my car and made my car's seats bloody (spent 500 to repair the damages). My wife thinks that I should just pay them the money but the problem is that I only make 2000 a month so that's a lot of money to him. The wife thinks that I should take a loan out of the bank just so I can pay the medical bills for the dog. I told her that is unreasonable (bank charges a lot of interest) and she refused to talk to me and I slept on the couch. So I decided to give the family 1000 dollars (all of my savings) and promised to give them the rest of the money when I got more money. Now that I think about it I can only pay the 2000 dollars by eating one meal (instead of two a day). The dog's family are extremely rich (drive a Mercedes and a nice home) so they can afford the vet bills easily. Right now I am planning to get a second job (I already work 60 hours of a week) to make 500 dollars extra this month and pay the vet bills. That way I would have paid 1500 (50 percent) which I think is reasonable or should I just man up and work the second job for a little longer and spend less money on food so I can pay the full bill. I don't want them to sue me and they keep on calling me everyday to ask where their money is so I have to pay them as quick as possible. So AITA?,68,82,0.89

He initially lied to me about the cheating when I found out, but after I confronted him again he eventually admitted it. He spent weeks telling me he loved me, wanted to fix our relationship, and I didn’t have to worry about the other girl. She was nothing, obsessive, and a nonissue. 

Well it turns out that he had been lying to us both about the other. He was juggling us to see who he wanted more. I had to go get tested twice because of all the lying. He spent weeks gaslighting me, laughing in my face, mocking me, blaming me, had no remorse, etc. He had changed into a completely different person than the one I knew. He admitted to using my anxiety against me. My therapist warned that his behavior was abusive and I should cut contact ASAP.

He said that he only acted nice and did nice things so that people would think he’s a good person and make up for what he did, he meant none of it. I found out he actually still bullies people. When talking to people about what happened between us, and the shock from people over him seeming “so great”, I would bring that up among other things to back myself up.

 When I told her about how it is unfair because I would have to cram all my revision ( Mid Year Examination is due) and my homework in one night, she screams on how its my fault for not being able to manage my time and how I am being selfish/ungrateful for some reason. I know she is just looking out for me and really dislikes my dad because he is irresponsible and doesn't do his duty as a father when we were young.

  I find that really annoying because she doesn't know the quantity and quality of homework I get in a day and how stressful it is. The weekends is usually flooded with homework and I just feel like crying whenever I have to cram it all in one night.

Sometimes, I go on to play a game, telling my dad I'll eat when I'm done or I'll notify him when I want to eat since he wants to make food for me. I'm ok with it, and I'm actually really thankful for it. I can make food myself though, but he insists he makes it for me. We don't really have set meal times either, ex. sometimes we eat lunch at 11:00, sometimes 2:00.   


The problem is that sometimes I'll tell him I'll eat later explicitly, and 10 minutes into a match, he calls me down for food. He will not stop yelling and raising his voice until I come down and eat the full meal. I have to tell my friends I'm going to eat, but I also feel for the other people on the team. Abandoning teammates results in a bad game experience. I go down in fear of being yelled at, and verbally harassed ( its happened before) but I get all my friends telling me I'm the asshole for leaving the match. It also causes problems for the rest of my family as it escalates into bigger things, so I think I've conditioned to dropping whatever I'm doing and going down to eat.

783,Asshole,"So first a little background. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a month. Things have been going pretty well until fairly recently. The last few times we have hung she has been texting this guy, let's call him Matt. Whenever I glance at her phone while she's texting this Matt, she'll cover up her phone, and when I ask why, she'll get super defensive. Well recently I confronted her about this (I've been cheated on before, and I know the signs) and she said that she would cover it up because she and him were talking about personal things. She didn't give a reason for being defensive when I asked about it though. Who's the asshole here?

Edit: We've been official and exclusive for about a month, we did have a but of a thing before that, she won't tell me anything whatsoever about Matt, like not even how they met, and in theory were going to talk it out today around 6:30, I'll tell you all how it plays out

Edit 2: The guys real name is not Matt, I did that for anonymity's sake, sorry for any slip ups, I'll correct them if I make them

Edit 3: Thank you for all of this, all of your comments and opinions have helped, I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, I'm talking it out with her now, and am gonna talk to her about it tomorrow in person

Edit 4: We talked it out, she agreed that what she did was suspicious, and I agreed that I was kinda projecting my fears onto her. There's still some distance, but that seems normal considering the circumstances. Anyways thank you all for your help, and if there are any new updates I'll let you all know.

EDIT 4: GOD DAMN WAS IT WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. She was cheating. On her other long-distance boyfriend. With me. Granted it wasn't the person in the post. She just told me about it and broke up with me like that. She lied to me about how she felt for the entire relationship.

Now, both of our names are on the lease, which doesn’t end until October. We are not on bad terms thankfully, and since she knows we can’t break the lease, she is keeping up with her half of rent until the lease is up, even though she isn’t staying in the house. I’ll be honest, most of the stuff in our house belongs to her; the furniture, bed, Xbox, etc. Because of this, and out of respect for each other, we agreed to not bring anyone expect family over. But I’ve been thinking. Isn’t a bit unfair how she is off doing whatever she pleases, yet I have to abide by these rules we set in place? She doesn’t even technically live here anymore, she’s just helping with the rent because all her stuff is here.

They have decided to keep them all in 10' x 10' pens with 4 to a pen in the woods which I initially didn't have a problem with until they decided to set up a pen right behind my house in the backyard, right beside where I keep my one dog in much bigger lot, and put 4 puppies inside of there. When I asked my mom why they were putting a pen right there she said it was because they were afraid of the neighbors saying something. We had just gotten two of the puppies out of my own house where my mother was forced to take care of them because my brother wouldn't and now they're sitting in the backyard right outside the window. Well today I went outside and now there are two additional adult dogs along with the puppies. I got angry when I saw this because why are they at my house and not their own? They have plenty of space there to put them but instead they cram 6 dogs into a tiny lot on a hill in my backyard. The dogs look so pitiful there crammed into the lot with only a tiny doghouse and no toys. When I threatened to call animal control both my brother and my mother told me I shouldn't and that I should just keep my mouth. So am I the asshole for wanting to call animal control and report the dogs in my backyard to them?

Edit: His girlfriend claims they're hunting dogs but I haven't seen her training the puppies at all for that

786,Asshole,"So for some backstory: My mom cooked dinner for the family the other night and I didn’t eat it right then and there. So the next day I ate about a quarter of my plate and put the rest of it up so I had something to eat after work. So then when I got off work I noticed my plate was missing and I asked her if she’d seen it. She told me she gave the rest to my brother and then hung up on me. So I flipped out on her and told her I saved the rest of it for me after work and told me that I was making a big deal out of it and that I was jealous of my brother then wanted ME to apologize for it. Since then I’ve been giving her the cold shoulder not really speaking to her because I’m not mad that my brother ate my food, it’s the fact that no one told me until after I got off work.

My wealthy father asked me to take time off of my job to install floors in my bros house he just bought him. I told him no making him cry.

Background: my father and stepmother have always shown him more favoritism I'm a girl so obvious. They kicked my out when I was 14 because I was lazy and difficult after my accident ( am partially handicapped) they didn’t want my bad attitude around their son, understandable. They were kind to me and still paid for my bills, So they still cared for me I was just not allowed in their home, but bought me an apartment and I could live there! I don't want you to think they didn't have reason I was a bad kid who started drinking at 11. I lived with my biological mother before that and she was a bad person which is where I get it. My father still tells me that she was a very kind and good woman until she was pregnant with me, I turned her evil. Eventually I was taken from my mother and place with my father because my mother unable to care for me.

&#x200B;

I am jealous of my bro, I know I shouldn't be but they have bought him a house, a car, paid for a very good private high school and have paid for his full college. It is their money that they have earned through hard work so they can spend it how they like. An education would have been waist on me any way as I am pretty stupid. But knowing he's now an electrical engineer who lives in a rich area, while I struggle to pay bills hurts a lot, they evicted me a week before my 18th birthday and I have been supporting myself since.

&#x200B;

Well when my father called to ask if I could come help (I don't talk to him much), I told him no. You might think this is fair as I have health problems and they have not always been fair. But the jealous snapped and I wanted to hurt him. I was very cruel and told my father every terrible thing my mother had done to me not leaving out any detail (it's very very bad), then I told him every terrible thing that ever happened to me after he kicked me out. I laughed at him and told him he was terrible and I was glad I hurt him. In case you don't believe me my bro has told them that they have treated me very badly to their face before. I hung up on him and my stepmother called me back screaming about how awful I was to do that to my father and how he was crying on the floor and would not get up. Now I feel very bad for him and for not helping my bro. (I am 32, and my brother is 26).

788,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the weird title, couldn’t really think of anything better.

Last month during spring break, I was feeling pretty low after my boyfriend broke up with me. I made a tinder just to mess around, and ended up meeting a guy I liked. He seemed pretty cool, had all the same interests and music taste.

His mom took us out to dinner, I had an okay time. Told the guy we’ll call Andrew that his mom made me a little anxious because she was so overbearing. Well, he told her what I said, and made her dislike me. I was upset, but whatever, he apologized and that was that.

Fast forward a little later, I was asking a friend for advice on what to do because I didn’t think I liked him “like that”. I felt bad because he told me how much he liked me and I just didn’t feel the same. After getting his advice I made plans to tell him tomorrow. The mistake that I know I made, and shouldn’t have done, was I let Andrew put his fingerprint in my phone. I was thinking “maybe I should delete these.” And then my second thought was “no, I trust him not to look through my phone.”

Well, he did. He read the messages between my friend and I. While I was sleeping. He left my apartment at 3AM, and drove 45 minutes back to his house. His friends were calling me every name under the sun in the Discord he added me to. His reasoning was he had the right to look through my phone because I let him enter his fingerprint.

790,No A-holes here,"I [27M] recently started dating again after coming off a broken engagement. I’m not ready for anything serious or exclusive, and I have communicated that. I’ve asked friends (male and female) and a counselor if it’s okay to date/sleep with other people if you haven’t talked about exclusivity, and they’ve all said yes. 

Recently, two women that I’ve been seeing found out about each other on different days, but they both had the same reaction. They called me an asshole, said I was a liar, started crying, and said they had felt used. I tried to say that we had never talked about exclusively dating, but that just made them angrier. Then they started demanding to know more about the other woman, whether or not we’d had sex, etc.

My understanding is that you’re free to date/have sex if you haven’t agreed to be exclusive. Telling the other person every time you do feels unnecessarily hurtful. But they both asked a ton of questions like they had the right to know.

791,Not the A-hole,"This is a bit of a long story.

&#x200B;

I (23F) just moved to Canada about a year and 10 months ago from Saudi Arabia. (If you didn't know at this point, it's really hard for a Saudi woman to leave, regardless of her age. She needs consent from her male guardian.)

&#x200B;

I lived with my father until then. He's always been physically and emotionally abusive. He was a broken record, constantly threatening me and telling me how worthless I was. He hit me for things like having friends of the opposite sex and being polite to a barista (that was a man. I was just trying to be a decent person - not that it mattered because even then, I was an adult).

&#x200B;

He really damaged me to the point that I'm still struggling to function as a normal person in Canada. I keep subconsciously getting into bad situations (I know better but it's hard to think when you think someone needs your help or something, at least for me. I promise, I am making progress though.)  


We stopped talking months ago. I just tried to maintain communication at that point because he's old and I felt bad for him. He demanded I go back to Saudi, and I said no. He pretty much told me to go fuck myself and I figured it was his loss because I didn't have to deal with the stress he constantly put on me and I have always had a lot to offer - just not the shit he was demanding

799,Not the A-hole,"Gonna keep this short. My gf and I, both 25, have traveled extensively through SE Asia in the past 2 years. I love Asian foods and exploring night markets trying different street foods is one of my favorite things. 

Last year we had a big blow up while we were in Bangkok at a big night market. I wanted to try a fried soft shell crab and my gf thought it was disgusting and unclean. I said there were tons of people here, including foreigners, and I want to be able to try something. I then wanted some fried squid and snails and she said the same thing. After a while I just said fuck it and ate it anyways because we were there for only one night. She got incredibly upset at me. 

We’re going to Hong Kong in two weeks and she brought up last year’s incident. She wants me to promise that I won’t eat anything she considers too gross, unrecognizable, and foreign. I say no and she asks me why I’m being so stubborn over this one thing that bothers her so much. She says it nearly makes her retch watching me put that kind of stuff in my mouth in some street alley. She says it’s the one habit of mine she finds extremely unbearable.

AITA if I just say no and keep eating the things I want? I get that it grosses her out but I feel like she’s being really controlling by making me agree to ask for her “permission” for everything I put in my mouth.

800,Not the A-hole,"I’m a 21-year old University student, going on 22, and I’ve been drinking alcohol since 17-18, though I don’t drink very often, no more than two or three nights a month. My circle of friends all drink far more often than I do, and therein lies the problem.

Of my group of 12 people I would call my close friends, all who have been a close group for many years, 7 out of the 12 or so literally cannot drink alcohol and control themselves without it turning into some sort of miniature disaster, every single time. Since November, we’ve had three broken bones across three different people from stupid decisions made while drinking. For a few of them, going to a bar and accidentally spending an inordinate amount of money, and then waking up the next day and wondering where their grocery fund for the week went, is a weekly occurrence. There hasn’t been a time where we’ve gotten together and drank where more than one of their number hasn’t ended up spending the night getting closely acquainted with the toilet. I am totally immunized to vomit of any variety because it is essentially a guarantee, what isn’t is if they make it to the bathroom first. 

This kind of stuff happens constantly, and it’s been happening for years. My friends at 21-22 are making the same self control mistakes they were making five years ago when they first discovered alcohol. I don’t understand how acting like this is even any fun! I have grown very tired of having to play the responsible babysitter on every occasion we hang out, because I’m usually the only one at a given time who respects his own limits if I choose to drink at all with them. So recently, I’ve stopped drinking with them altogether. I avoid hanging out with them when they do it and don’t go out to bars with them as a group anymore. Their behavior has actively reduced my passive consumption of alcohol. 

And when I choose not to drink, it gets noticed. And then when  I’m asked to explain myself, and I do, they get bothered and defensive from it, nothing that’s broken a friendship or anything, but still they know what’s up. I still hang out with them on other occasions, so it hasn’t burnt any bridges, but the sentiment is known and starts arguments occasionally. 

Am I simply a jaded prude? I would really appreciate some adult perspectives on this issue. It’s very tiresome thing to deal with and I don’t understand why many of my friends continue to act this way, other people don’t. Other people have caught on to being responsible.

So we talked on the balcony, the two of them sitting on the couch and me standing up. A habit of mine is to bend down to talk to them instead of just sitting with them. So I did that, not really thinking about it, and nobody said anything.

When the guy was gone, my mum pulled me aside and talked to me about the way I dress and that her boyfriend told her it makes him uncomfortable to be forced to look at my cleavage when I bend down with loose clothing.

Sadly, I was put on the spot when submitting my 2 weeks at work and got convinced to stay. Now I will work 80 hours a week for the next 3 or 4 months including weekends. Bummer, but Im new to my field and gotta git dis bread. I let my brother know that I might not be able to go, but either way I will still pay for him and his friends and they can just have a fun roadtrip down without me.

Note: He was raised by his rich father, and tends to air a bit on the spoiled side.

He started guilting me about how he picked his open house date around this trip and how I let him down and whatnot. I told him he can still go, and if I have the time I will go, but I dont believe I will. He then said that he is just disappointed because he just wanted to spend time with me. So i said if thats why youre upset lets hang Saturday of that weekend and do something really awesome in-state. Problem solved right? Wrong. He told me that he doesnt want to see me that weekend anymore and that he'll stay home instead. He also blocked my number, so that I couldnt call him.

I went through his dad to get him to talk to me, only for him to tell me he didnt want to see me, even after I caved and said I'd take him.

His dad is paying for his college only, but my college fund in addition to his scholarship should also* cover his room and board for the next four years. 

With how shitty hes been about this whole thing, I really just feel like teaching him a life lesson that you cant just have everything you want and give him nothing for his graduation. If he has to work a part time job to pay for his housing so be it, maybe he will learn to be thankful for what he has.

A couple of times I have literally had to say,"" no, she (my daughter) didn't say that"", "" that's you talking"", ""remember grandma's voice isn't your voice"". Sometimes I've straight up ignored my MIL when she says something and I react totally differently than her ventriliquism suggest I should. Like MIL will say ""oh no mommy I'm busy!"" as my daughter is literally coming to me, so I'll say ""obviously she isnt. Come here baby, oh I love your hugs!""

Stuff like that. I'm getting irrate just thinking about it.

I can be slow on reaction times though. Today my daughter was waddling into the den as her grandpa was opening the doors for her. And MIL says ""grandpa, you open those doors right now! That's right open them, shoot, im coming"" in a ""cute"" baby voice but still so fucking rude. MIL can be a rude, bossy and defensive person btw. Afterwards I was like oh mother fucker, that's why my spidey sense was tingling. You have to understand that after living with her for almost two years it can be easy to just ignore her antics at this point cause they come so often.

813,No A-holes here,"I'll try to be succinct - My husband (38) and I (33) have been married for almost 4 years, we have no biological children,  I am my nephew's (8) guardian (l share legal gusrdianship with his father), and I am unlikely to carry a child to term. My husband knew long before dating (we were friends for years before) that I would be unlikely to have children,  and I  have had several miscarriages since we married; we made the decision to stop trying. 

Even before agreeing to stop trying,  we had talked about possibly fostering/adopting.  Although we have the financial means for a private adoption of an infant, we decided to foster (with intent to, hopefully, adopt an older child). 

Many older children in foster care will have some mental health issues and patience is needed; as psych clinicians,  we both know this. . .This child ,""Matthew"", has been with us for a bit over 2 months.

In short, it is not going to work. I do not want to foster this child, let alone adopt him.  Although,  there is no documented history of it (or any other behavioral/mental problems)I strongly believe this child may have conduct disorder/oppositional defiant disorder (note that it is within my scope of practice to diagnose and treat mental disorders). This child goes from calm and well-behaved to horrible tantrums where he hits, bites, breaks objects etc. It is very difficult to determine what sets him off. Even when calm, he sometimes lies and attempts to manipulate us. He is cruel to my nephew, he ""accidentally"" injured one of our cats, and he ""found"" one of our birds dead. We have taken him to a psychiatrist and psychologist - they both suspect ODD or CD. His intelligence is normal,  no signs of ADHD, no signs of any learning disability.  . .

I'll be frank, I simply am not willing or able to take on this child. My husband agrees with the assessments, he is aware the child is volatile and possibly dangerous.  However, he simply does not want to give up on him. He feels that the child is likely unadoptable and that if he stands a chance , it would be with people like us - people who have the financial means and skillset (my husband is a pediatric neuropsychologist and I am a psych nurse practitioner). 

My husband wants to give the situation more time; I do not. AITA?

Edit: I was afraid my post would go past 3000 characters, so I kept it short. But, here is a bit more info -Matthew is 11. He has been in one foster home previously, his records indicate no behavioral problems/physical violence in the past. He was fine for around the first 3 weeks, and then began lashing out. The destructiveness, tantrums,  lying,  I can deal with. But, I cannot handle the physical aspect. He has injured my nephew hard enough that his school contacted us about the bruising,  he has broken my glasses, he has bitten husband and I hard enough to draw blood, I'm 99% sure he hurt the cat/killed the bird. . .He is taller and weighs more than me; I cannot safely restrain him.

I don't see them regularly, as we live in different cities, but we have gotten together a number of times for dinner and general catching-up. We do not discuss their daughter or her new guy, but they have told me they would like to remain in contact with me. I feel similarly. My ex's sister lives in the same city as me, and we still get together (only as friends - never anything 'like that') once a month or so. I'm closer to her than my own sister and she's one of my best friends.

&#x200B;

My new girlfriend (or at least 'girl I'm dating regularly,' as we haven't had the talk yet) isn't comfortable with this and has made this clear. She hasn't directly asked me to stop, but she wonders why I am still in communication with them at all, and I can see her point. I know she wants me to let them go and move past that entire chapter of my life, but I genuinely care for them and don't want to give them up. AITA if I stay in touch with my ex's family?

815,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I (34f) stopped being friends with my supposed best (31f) of 29 years for not going to my wedding?

I understand this requires a little backstory. It’s going to be a bit long so here it goes. Here mom used to babysit me when I was 4 and she was 1. Ever since then we were pretty much inseparable until I moved to another state. But even then our parents would drive us to see each during summer break from school. 

Fast forward to 2009 and her mom had a stroke. She was put into a medically induced coma. BF was 21. I stayed at the hospital with her for 3 days. This lady was like a second mother to me. Of course I would be there. Plus she was like my sister. It was a no brainer. It wasn’t a second thought. BF has to make a choice to pull the plug on her mother 3 days after Christmas. I was by her side at the services. I had her back. I was the only one of her friends that showed up. A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant, in January with my second child. In the beginning of March I found out my dad had stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I scheduled a c-section so my dad could meet his only grandson. Out of 11 grandkids. Only that wasn’t what happened. I had to say goodbye to my dad the night before because he took a fall that Friday morning and hospice came in. Saturday was the day of my c-section. He died 2 hours after my son was born. She didn’t come to my sons birth or any of my dads services. I was at my dads military services 6 days after having a c-section. 

A few years later she gives birth to her first born. I’m there to talk her thru labor and watch her give birth to him. I was at his baby shower a few days before. She married his dad 7 months later pregnant with her second. I was there for that. I travel constantly an hour and half, one way to see her and her 4 kids. 

I am getting married in 5 days. It’s a small intimate wedding. Only 7 people invited to the actual wedding and 20 people to the after wedding dinner. She is one of the 7. She was excited at first. But about a week later she has been coming up with crazy excuses as to why she “may not be able to make it” she had 5 months notice. Now she won’t return texts or calls. But she likes posts about it on Facebook. 

I have been there with her for every huge mile stone in her life. I feel like as we became adults this friendship has become one sided and in light of the current circumstances it really bothers me. I only want her to come to this one thing. That’s it. This is the one and only time I have been married. I want her here for this. WIBTA if I ended the friendship if she didn’t show up?",64,164,0.96
816,Everyone Sucks,"I am a senior student at a prestigious business school here in California. When you're in your final year of business school, you are in a lot of groups, doing a lot of group projects. I am taking an International Business course that required us to argue against another group and prove that our country would be a better place to expand a cosmetic brand into, blah blah blah boring school stuff.

&#x200B;

Anyway, the final project is pretty extensive, with lots of data, research, and overall time that goes into it. I am in a group of 5 people, including myself, and we have been killing it all semester. 95% on our first project together, and we all had been getting good individual scores on our individual papers. At the end of each group project, we would have to rate each other out of 10 categories, 10 points each.

&#x200B;

I am a pretty easy going going guy when it came to these grades. As long as you did your research and showed up to present it, I would give you a 100%. However, when it came to our final project, we had not heard from one of our partners in weeks. He stopped showing up to class and stopped responding to text, mind you we are seniors at this point and most of us are graduating after this semester.

&#x200B;

THEN, TWO DAYS before our assignment is due, he drops a message along the lines of, ""I was diagnosed with panic disorder and will not show up to present on Wednesday."" Basically hurtling his huge part of the presentation on us. Now in his defense, he did generate his own slides with their own information, but we had to integrate it into our own parts separately. We basically had to go through his research and formulate our own way of presenting it. I understand anxiety very well, but there is no excuse to doing that to your team. 

&#x200B;

Now back to the peer reviews, I rated him a 38/100 which adversely effects his grade. I did not discuss this with my group before because I figured they would have been on the same page as me. So, presenting day comes, we kill it, and immediately after we are done, our professor comes up and expresses our missing group members concern about passing this course (he needs it to graduate). She asks us up front if we think he deserves; no credit, partial credit, or full credit. My fellow three group members agree to give him full credit, and I was the last one who was asked. I hesitated and said, ""I got to go with my group on this one so give him full credit."" This is before she had read my peer review.

&#x200B;

Fast forward about a week, she post grades for the presentation. We scored a 98%, but at the end she posted a note that is directed towards me. It basically says, ""I am sorry for putting you on the spot like that, I have taken into consideration what you put in your review and have adjusted his grade accordingly.""

And really, that's all he's been talking about. Whenever he finds someone to listen, he always bitches about being unemployed, why nobody wants to hire him, how nobody is buying his paintings, etc. And it gets tiring really quickly to hear Dennis blame everyone (employers for not hiring him, random people online for having 'no taste' and not buying his paintings, even the government) and not take any responsibility. Add to the fact he now shares a room with me but doesn't clean, is super unhygienic, and sits around all day, I'm really annoyed with him. So today when he started complaining, I cut him off and told him to stop blaming everyone else, and that if he's failing, it's his own fault: if he's unemployed, it's because he chose fine arts instead of something with a higher employment rate. If his paintings aren't selling, it's because either 1) his art isn't good 2) he isn't marketing himself well or 3) all of the above. Etc, etc.

826,Not the A-hole,"I love my wife with all my heart, and her and her mother do not get along *at all.* It wasn't always this way...she was always the kind of person that would say, without a hint of irony, that her mom was her best friend (at least until we got together and married, anyway). Long story short, about 8 years ago her younger brother and only sibling passed away in his sleep at the age of 22. Her parents kept the real cause from her for years, and told her it was due to an undiagnosed medical condition he had, which led to my wife getting tons of expensive tests to make sure she didn't have it...well, turns out her brother was secretly using heroin and overdosed in the middle of the night, they didn't tell her because they ""didn't want her to be mad at him"". She's obviously pretty bitter about this, and I don't blame her, but that's just one piece of a whole jigsaw puzzle of fuckery in their mother-daughter relationship.

Her mom was a stay-at-home mom, and the three of them, plus her maternal grandma, did *everything* together. When her brother died, my mother-in-law pretty much lost her mind, which is to be expected. She puts up a composed front for everyone else in her life, but with my wife, they simply cannot have a conversation where her mom doesn't steer it towards how she has no reason left to live anymore (pretty awesome telling your surviving child that, am I right?) and is pretty much just waiting for The Lord to take her to her dead son. When my wife tells her mother that comments like that pretty much make *her* feel completely worthless, she tells my wife she'll never understand because she hasn't lost a child...because losing a brother is just like, 'whatever' in comparison, apparently.

I've told my wife she needs to stop fucking calling her mom; they talk, and since her brother died, often fight, every single day...they've spoken every day since she learned to talk, no matter what. It's causes problems in our relationship because she'll be fine, call her mom, then next thing I know there are tears streaming down her face.  I regularly spend an hour settling her back down, and it's emotionally exhausting to me.

I'm in a new career that is very stressful in itself, and lately when I've come home from work and my wife is all upset because of another fucking conversation with her mother, and starts bawling the minute I walk in the door to tell me about the newest shitty thing she said to her today. It's pretty clear to me now that her mom doesn't really want to be normal where her daughter is concerned, and I've told her time and again that she needs to stop letting her mother dump her shit on her. I lost it the other day and told her I didn't want to hear it anymore because she brings it on herself and she fell apart.

827,No A-holes here,"I’m a female college freshman who was assigned a group project with two other people: a guy, and a girl named Ann. I am normally a good student; however my depression got very bad the past month, I had some family issues crop up (that I kept private from my peers), & my efforts dipped. I became one of those dreaded group slackers & regret this a lot.

I had previously barely known or spoken with Ann & had known very little about her, other than that she’s very religious. Even during our project, I conversed with her very little. She messaged me saying that she wanted to meet with me at our library to discuss the project. I showed up, & she beckoned me to a private room.

She told me that she’s noticed I’ve been making very little effort, & I was very apologetic. She continues (her face/voice getting very dramatic/emotional) about how she knows I could do so much better, how she sees great potential in me & how disappointing it is to see me “wasting my wonderful potential.” I start to say how I’ve been going through a rough patch, but she interrupts, “\[OP\], don’t. Everyone has an excuse, but few have the ability to look at their behavior, and choose to better their lives.”

Ann continued, “you are the bird that could soar to the highest point in the sky, but cowers in the shadows”, & proceeds to make a zillion other, “you are the…” analogies. She starts holding my hands, telling me over and over I need to “blossom.” She began **crying**, & expressing fear that I am “not blossoming.” “Most people have blossomed by your age, but you haven’t. I’m worried for you, \[OP\]. I want you to have a wonderful life, I want you to be the bird that soars high in the sky, but...you **have** to turn things around.”

15-20 minutes of this went on. She continued her dramatic gushing, & started referring to me as “a beautiful bird.” She finished by telling me, in tears, to “blossom into the beautiful flower that God intended you to be,” & that she’ll do all of my part of the project (due in 2 days), so that I can have time these next 2 days to think about what she’s told me. I adamantly refused, telling her I’ll do my part. She insisted, telling me to “accept this wonderful gift.” I did the project, but when we came to class I found she’d still done my part. I replaced her part with mine and turned the project in.

I had a private conversation with my professor & told him how extremely uncomfortable & violated Ann made me feel. I would have **way** rather had a group mate who was an asshole, than one like her who gushes over me, cries and violates boundaries. He seemed concerned, & told me he’ll be speaking to the dean about it.

My son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. The kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. My son was diagnosed with ADHD and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. That said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. Because of that I did not send in a signed permission slip or money. 

The day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. After school I pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. He said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. 

He was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. That is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. Yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? So since it was after school, I messaged his teacher asking about it. I have not gotten a reply. I tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her.

My Dad had missed a few birthdays and Christmases (as I was living abroad for some years) and offered to pay for a nice hotel suite for the wedding night in lieu of the missed days - I'm very grateful. Otherwise my husband and I paid for everything else...... Until.........  a few days before the wedding when my Mum gave me some money that paid for the cake and wine and half the dress (I had a cheap - but perfect - wedding) she gave about £400.

And then on the wedding day my Dad and his new wife (did I have to mention mum and dad are divorced?) gave me a wedding card with a cheque for £700 in it (but the cheque was just for show, not usable) he said he would transfer the money soon. 

My husband and I were speechless. Tried to say it's too much, but he was like no it's fine, I'm doing well at work (a bit braggy if I'm honest) so we accepted it... as he said, he could afford it.

Since then I've mentioned it a couple of times in Skype talks, but not lingered on the topic because - ya know - rude! 

Fast forward 6 months still no transfer. He visited me and my husband for a holiday for two weeks, we organised and planned every thing of the trip. They just organised their return flights home.

Last week, our school held its annual prom and one of my friends went with all of his friends. Before prom, almost all of the couples or groups  take a lot of pictures, and my friend and his group decided to take pictures at our local botanical garden. 

After taking pictures, he and his friends destroyed a fence of bamboo and pulled out a Japanese maple and arranged the bamboo in a pentagon. I know this because he arrogantly bragged about it to me at school two days after prom. 

Yesterday while looking in the local newspaper in the police and fire section, a big box saying “Botanical garden vandalized” took most of the section up. It said that a $500 reward will be given leading to the arrest of the vandals. 


This particular friend isn’t really a good role model. He is a big weed/juul dealer at our school and he’s been caught 3 times. After each time getting caught he always said, “Don’t worry guys, I’ll change.” Every time he said that, two days later he would post on his snapchat story saying “hmu if you want some pods tomorrow”.


I really want to turn him in to teach him a lesson and get a free $500, but I’m a minor and I’m not really comfortable dealing with the police. Plus, if my friend finds out I reported him, he will surely never forgive me. He also hangs out with some sketchy people which makes me more uncomfortable.

842,Not the A-hole,"My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I’m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it’s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. 

We have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband’s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. 

From that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He’s even said on occasion things like, “3 year old is my favorite.” And, “I don’t like baby.” It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. 

Now to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, “What does it matter? He’s already ruined it.” I responded with, “funny story. It’s actually 3 year old who broke it.” 

My husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn’t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, “you’ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don’t like baby!” He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won’t even talk to me or be in the same room with me.",916,3046,0.96

I really like him but if my parents ever found out I liked a white guy I’d literally be sent back home. They are really strict Asian parents and catholic to boot. I know my life in America would be over. My mom especially is really nosy and I can’t deal with dating on the DL at least until I’m in college cuz she already makes my life hell. 

I don’t want to hurt his feelings especially bc I like him SO MUCH. I want to be honest and say  ‘my parents are bigots and I’m not allowed to date white guys until I’m in the position to be independent’ ... or do I just lie and say I’m tryna focus on class atm?

845,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys, first post on this sub.

So for background, I workout at a rather well known gym, think of the gym Arnold made big, the locations in my town all have attached half court basketball courts, one of the primary reasons of mine to join said gym.
Now when I signed up, a few years back, I made sure to ask if there was any black out dates in the court, for classes and the likes.
My old gym had set times where the courts were used for silly fitness classes, even with them having two perfectly fine class studios on site.
They said no, the courts are open play 24/7, this was almost 4 years ago I think.
Now last week I went to ball on Wednesday and it was a great day, busy court, lots of people for running games, probably 15 people or so, I got there around 5:30. Around 6 this lady who works for the gym comes in and says we gotta to, cause the court is closed because of some kettlebell class.
Apparently this is gonna become a regular thing, Monday and Wednesday from 6-7 (prime time for running pick up games), the court will be closed for that class.
I poked my head into the gym cause I was curious about the class and how large of a group it was, and I saw all of 6 people in the class. 
Am I the asshole for complaining to members services for that?
The gym even has a single fitness studio which is reserved for classes exclusively.",13,30,0.83

850,Not the A-hole,"First time poster so apologies for any formatting errors. Apologies for the length but it's a complicated situation.

&#x200B;

So this past year I \[21F\] moved into a house with my 2 best friends \[20F\] \[21M\]. I lived with the girl freshman year in dorms and with the boy last year in an apartment but they didn't really know each other prior to us moving in. Long story short, me and my best guy friend started dating but broke up within the first few months of living there. At first, we tried to stay friends and move past it as we were still in the beginning of our lease but it devolved into fighting everyday and passive-aggressive encounters. Things became too toxic and unhealthy for everyone so I thought it'd be best for me to move out. Because my parents live relatively close to the city I was in, I decided to move back home for the semester to reset. I let my roommates keep everything I brought until I needed it again eventually. Side note: I initially found the house, set up electric, gas, and water, got the renter's insurance, applied first and helped the others apply. I also brought the vast majority or things for the home including the couch, rug, kitchen table, tv stand, lamp, baker's rack (pantry), misc. dishes and silverware and glasses, drying rack, bathroom and cleaning supplies etc.

&#x200B;

I left almost everything for them besides my personal belongings and spent a lot of time trying to find a new roommate that they could get along with to take my room. Eventually we got everything worked out, I moved and we all were on relatively good terms. But things devolved from there as me and the ex were fighting about petty things from the past and the girl roommate started dating his friend so she ghosted me as well. It got to the point where I wasn't friends with either of them which was really hard since I had known both of them for years and spent most of my time with them.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a couple of months, I texted the girl roommate asking to pick up some things because I was planning on moving out again to be closer to school and all I got back was a ""No."" I only wanted some small things like the baker's rack and some dishes. I initially said I didn't need the larger furniture pieces for another month or so so they could have time to look. So I asked for them to pick a time where I could get my things and if they wanted to be there or not it didn't matter to me. After some short, passive-aggressive texts between us, I decided to just get the rest of my stuff without warning them. I thought why would I let them use all of my things (without some sort of liability or payment) when they both ghosted me after moving out and treated me like garbage. I know its petty, but I thought if I had given them some more notice they would do something to my stuff on purpose.

851,Not the A-hole,"Long story short my sister is very emotionally abusive person that has been yelling, screaming and crying at me for ""ruining her life"" and stuff like that for almost 15 years now. (we live 500km apart in diff cities)

2 years ago I finally decided to break out of that because I was really in a bad place because of all that shit. Someone yells at you that you are mentally handicapped long enough you start believing it eventually. So I stopped answering her calls and it was all ok until our father died 1 year ago. 

She was pregnant at the time so I decided to keep in touch with her for the time being. It was all good, few calls a month just regular talk, im not looking into her life, she not into mine. 

Than few days ago she calls to tell me that she and her family are  planning to come to visit for a few days. I very nicely said that I am super busy, (working 30 days a month from home) and when I finish with work I just want to relax and not have guests that include small kids that run around yelling and screaming. I suggested they postpone their trip.

And she just goes off like she used to, saying im ruining her life and all the stuff from before. I live in our childhood home (i inherited it) so she says I cant forbid her to come to her home and that she just wants to go around the city and wont bother me. They just need a place to sleep.

So I decided to stand my ground and just tell her to sleep with some other relatives we have in the city and do whatever she said she wants to do since it does not include me.

She has a great job with stellar pay in the private sector, while I make slightly less than her at a non profit. We do a very good job at keeping our personal interests and personalities our own because even though we are together and in love, we fell in love with each other, not ourself.


Anyway, Whenever we go out to eat/drink/activities, she never goes for the bill when it comes time.   I even pay for groceries 90% of the time.


It came up early in the relationship and she says she EXPECTS me to pay every time. When I ask her why she claims “I’m very old fashion and think the guy should take care of the girl every time.” She also went on to say “I use the extra money to buy clothes and makeup to look good for you” 


She is beautiful on her own and she doesn’t need expressive clothes or makeup to look great.  I put my foot in my mouth telling her she looks good for others girls, not me.

854,Not the A-hole,"Obviously when cheating is concerned lots of back story but I don't want to bore anyone. 

January my wife takes a ""girls"" vacation, says she needs to get time away. I say cool. But in one of her friends facebook posts I see just a hint of my wife in the background with a guys hand on her leg while in a beach chair. I zoom and swear its a friend of a friend. I check his facebook and sure enough he's at the same resort. 

I went over to his house on the one in a million chance that he's home and it was just a coincidence that they were there at the same time. As I'm knocking on the door a neighbor comes over and asks if I know the owner. I say yes, he tells me that the dog has been barking nonstop since January 5th (the exact day my wife left, it was now Jan 11th). The neighbor and I go around back and find the dog with several 40lb pound bags of dog food shredded open, water only in a puddle from rain and the dog ecstatic that someone was paying attention to it. 

I don't know exactly what I was thinking but it was along the lines of ""fuck my wife, I take your dog."" So I took the dog home, gave him a bath and he's essentially become my best friend. 

Of course since my wife had been banging this dude for about 3 months she instantly recognized the dog when she popped through the door with ""honey I'm home, I'm so refreshed and...what the hell is Adam's dog doing here?"" gotcha b!tich. 

So divorce is proceeding and come hell or hi water I don't want to give the dog back. I saw how fuck wit treated him which to me was abusive. The dog adores me, sleeps with me, gets to play and cuddle with the neighbors dog when I'm at work.  Fuck wit has threatened to go to the cops but I have this little golden bullet of being able to make the divorce harder on my wife if he pulls any shit because really I just want to split and not bring up the affair. 

If this dude had kids or anyone else the dog was attached to I'd give him back but to me, the guy was just a prick and fuck him.

856,Asshole,"Long story short, I fired a woman recently for stealing cash straight out of my register. I have it on video.

I don't have the time nor energy to take her to court over $130~, but other than the fact that she's lost her job here she has pretty much gotten away with it. 

So, WIBTA if I sent this video of her stealing to her other employer.

Edit: In regards to ""it's illegal to be that specific about a termination:"" It's perfectly legal to disclose why an employee was fired. Most companies have their own policies stating to only reveal the bare minimum to reference checkers in order to avoid potential defamation/slander/libel lawsuits, but it's not illegal to say so-and-so was fired for stealing so long as it's truthful. And I'd be protected against claims regarding falsehoods because I have her dead to rights on video. 

Granted, this only applies to when a prospective employer specifically calls me for my feedback. I don't know if the legality changes when I freely volunteer that information. 

But anyway, I'm not going to contact her other employer.

857,Asshole,"Hey. 

So I work in an office space with cubicles. Some of the cubicles have printers in them and some do not. As a result I was sending my prints to my colleague’s printer and sometimes other people from other floors would send to hers too if theirs are down or something (hers works the best). 

I do not like this coworker because she has spread rumors about me before to people including my supervisor and spoke about me in a poor light when I had just started working there; it was weird because she didn’t and still doesn’t even know me. I’ll also mention that I’m 23 and she’s 45 in case that matters. 

So she had stepped out for a long while this one day and her computer was up and my other coworker and I both went to retrieve prints from the lady’s machine and that’s when we both simultaneously saw it... the screensaver was slideshow of the photo album, which had pics of the lady in her bra, her bare a**, other suggestive photos, inappropriate memes and what could have been a failed vag photo (couldn’t really tell but it’s likely). We just stood there shocked and watched pic after pic, holding onto each other and screaming after each photo (lol). It was a trainwreck but also hilarious to me that I of all people saw it given my relationship with this lady. 

My coworker (who I’m friends with and is also my age) asked me if we should stop it and I said no while stopping her from moving the mouse. l said whoever sees it, sees it. It’s weird that she has ANY personal photos on the work computer in the first place tbf, but especially semi-nude and nude ones. I don’t feel sorry for her if people had seen it. 

Other people had gone to the cubicle to get prints too - idk if they saw any of the risqué ones or what but if someone did see it I know there would be plenty gossip since they are so chatty around there. 

My sister asked why we didn’t at least turn off the monitor, but that lady is evil in my books so eff her and whatever happens as a result?

What do you guys think? AITA?

edit: Just want to clarify a few things.. this was not a scene that we made and nobody else saw our reaction to this. There are no cameras by the cubicles. Also I may have verbally “stopped” my friend from ending the trainwreck, but she could’ve stopped it if she wanted to. Neither of us feel any guilt over this situation because this lady is horrible. I didn’t go into details of why I called her evil, but a few of them:

Her lies about my character stopped me from being able to transfer to another section because the other supervisor got wind of said lie and rejected my request to join her section though she initially accepted; my other coworkers were initially icy to me and I wasn’t sure why and I found out months later that it was because lady evil told them I spoke negatively about them. I’m cool with the rest of them now because I’m not the witch the tried to make me out to be, which they eventually learned just interacting with me; the other present coworker had to report her on a prior instance for releasing confidential information that present coworker dealt with - she could’ve lost her job over that. I also have no interest in having a relationship with this coworker because she’s lazy and fake: I heard her call her work “friend” ugly to someone else and she said another emp. dressed like a whore. I don’t know how she gets away with many things and I reported her recently for screaming at another employee. That’s the kind of person she is and that’s only some of the things. Given that it was two people she wronged who saw it at the same time, it definitely felt more like karma if anything.

She doesn't like the same type of music as us, she dresses and acts differently than us, and honestly she has the type of personality that doesn't really fit in considering the area we're in. She has the super stereotypical ""white girl"" personality. Super peppy, sickly sweet, Starbucks in her hand every day, on her days off if she comes in shes wearing frilly dresses, doesn't listen to any rap just taylor swift and stuff like that, and she has a very specific way of talking, like it sounds like shes asking a question at the end of every sentence. Also, you don't really see people like her in this part of the city, girls like her usually are in the ""nicer"" areas, we'd look really weird if we were seen running around with her. 


Simply put, shes just not the type of person we want to hang out with. However, we do all hang out together, have a group chat, and plan events, but without inviting her. Since we usually talk about it at work, and we might discuss the plans or ask who all is able to make it, shes very aware that shes the only one of us who isn't invited.

863,Not the A-hole,"We are both 27, she is in the 2nd trimester. I knew when we got married that she had some mental health issues from some traumatic childhood/adolescent experiences. She’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety by an actual doctor and took medication for it through high school. After high school she had a major surgery on one of her legs and I guess the pain meds messed with the anxiety/depression meds so they took her off the anxiety depression meds and she never went back on. She’s been functioning pretty well without them ever since, she got through college, graduated, and now works in a very good IT job. She has dark days for sure but she’s able to get through them with a little support. 

The last few months, however, have been especially bad. I think the hormones from the pregnancy might just be overloading her but I’m afraid that with the possibility of post-partum depression and the general difficulty of raising a newborn baby, she’s not going to be in a good place mentally when the baby is born in a few months. 

My biggest concerns are the way she’s interacting with her friends. We’ve had things like the baby shower planned for a while and little get togethers we scheduled, but people have bailed last minute or just not given her a great reason why they’re not coming. Normally she’d shrug that off as just “people are busy, oh well” but now she openly confronts them and calls them shitty friends to their faces. She’s confronted people about not “checking on her” and gets really angry over minute details like the way someone words a text or how they respond to a request to hang out. She’s convinced all her friends hate her and that when the baby is born, our only support network will be our immediate families. Honestly those relationships have been strained. 

She’s blocked people on Snapchat/other social media that were good friends of hers for a long time over very small disagreements. She’s basically told all of her old bridesmaids that she doesn’t want them around when the baby is born. But then she turns around and cries to me that she has no friends and no one truly cares about her. And if I don’t agree 100%, I get the brunt of her anger as well. 

I really want to tell her that she needs professional help, but I’m afraid she’ll get angrier than ever before if I do. Obviously medication is out the window until after we’re done breast feeding, but I also know that if she did see a therapist it’s going to dig up a lot of old darkness that’s going to truly upset her and stress her out before it gets better, and I don’t know if it’s safe to do that while she’s still pregnant.

867,Not the A-hole,"A little bit of background. I'm in my 30s and have two children, ages 5 and 2, both girls. We live very close to my parents' house, and they spend a lot of time with their grandparents. On Easter, the younger one was sick with a fever, so she had to miss the festivities. In the morning, we were going to brunch with the family at a place where you had to dress up, so the older one was wearing a dress. She told her younger sister that she was going to a ball, which just made everything worse. Since my husband and youngest weren't coming, we carpooled with my parents to the brunch. It didn't help when grandma came to the door and the younger one realized that we were going to a place with her grandparents. The two year had a huge meltdown because she wasn't going. 

&#x200B;

Due to the rush of getting ready, I hadn't had the time to address the fact that the 5 year old told her sister she was going to a ball (which she knew was not true). So, once we got into the car, I asked her about it and why she said it. I asked if she understood that she made her sister even more upset. My dad interrupted me and told me that it wasn't a big deal and that the oldest shouldn't worry about the younger one and that the younger one needed to learn to deal with disappointment. My dad has always been super close to the older one since she's grandchild #1. I replied that I disagreed and that since I am their mother I get to decide what is appropriate behavior. My dad then called me a snit and continued to insist to the older one that she didn't do anything wrong. I told him to stop and repeated that I am the parent. He called me a snit again. I then told him to cut it out and to never contradict my parenting in front of my child again. He started to say something else derogatory, and my mother told him to cut it out. I continued talking to my 5 year old who actually learned something about empathy through the discussion we had. 

&#x200B;

So, AITA for telling my dad to back off and let me do the parenting? I should add that this is not the first time he has done this, but it's fairly infrequent and this is just the most recent time it happened.",80,774,0.96
868,Asshole,"Hey guys. I just need some perspective here. Because my wife, daughter and sister think I'm an asshole because I'm giving up and leaving them. 

I'm diagnosed with cancer( don't want to talk about it ). It revealed itself after my doctor found something wrong with me during one of my check ups. Yeah, sucks for me. 

So I shared this news with the only person I can share it with. My wife. She immediately starts crying and googling about what to do. The thing is, I don't think I want to do chemo. I think I need to make the best out of the time I've got. It's not even 100% curable and I'll have to do many sessions. I don't want to see myself decline and feel helpless. I think my time has come.

But a couple of weeks ago, I was really surprised when my daughter ran to me, hugged me and started crying. I asked her what's the matter and she told me that I should fight for my life. She's quite relentless now. Writes me letters, texts me, and tells me the same thing every time. I wake up to her and my wife crying everyday now. I think we are simply ruining the time I've got. 

I got into an argument with my wife about this. She tells me that our daughter has a right to know because she has a right to have her dad in her life. I don't see it that way. Why give her trauma? What was the point of telling her? Even my twin sister thinks I'm being selfish and an asshole. AITA here?",161,446,0.95

I chose to bring my own sunscreen because I try to use cruelty free products where possible and wasn’t sure what she’d have. 

We were heading to the beach when she declares that she didn’t bring sunscreen on the trip and plans to pick it up at a shop by the beach. Surprise surprise, turns out that buying sunscreen at the beach is marked up from what she could have brought from home, so she opts not to buy it and instead asks if they can use mine. I didn’t want to let them burn and hear them moan about how it was my fault the rest of the trip, so I acquiesced but made it clear that I was annoyed and that the sunscreen I brought was also expensive. 

They put it on and made of a big deal of being stingy with it so as to not use too much of my ExPeNsIvE sUnScReEn and now they’ve walked off and are playing in the water without me (someone has to stay with the towels and bags). They’ve been out there for nearly an hour and haven’t yet indicated any intention to take turns so I can experience the beach too.

One of my friends who's also kind of his friend through me will be having a girls' night and I'm invited. My parents want me to take my brother because otherwise he'll just sit at home playing games on his tablet or bothering my parents.

If he just keeps hanging out with me, he'll never become independent and his classmates will just bully him even more.

I feel weird about bringing my brother to hang out with my girl friends now that we're older. It's supposed to be just time for me and *my* friends.

874,No A-holes here,"Baity title but it basically sums up the situation.

My cousin and I are both M(19) and we were out to eat at a popular local restaurant. We split some wings, and after we were done eating we went to go wash our hands. We walked through the back hallway to where the bathrooms are located and entered into the men's restroom. The bathroom was a one person, so there was only a toilet and a sink with a lock on the door. We figured it was no big deal if we both went in to wash our hands and talk with some privacy for a minute while away from our friends who ate with us. 

I locked the door so no one walks in on accident and we start washing our hands. We arent in the bathroom more than 15 seconds before we hear 3 pounding knocks on the door. Figuring it was one of our friends messing with us, I let out a deep voiced ""HEY"". All of a sudden the door bursts open and some bearded guy with an angry face(who turned out to be the owner of the establishment) comes in and starts berating us. 

I was pretty sure I locked the door, but he must have used a key to get in. He bursts in asking ""wtf are you guys doing, holding hands in here?"". My cousin and I both look at each other in shock and confusion. We both turn and just stare at him because we are caught so off guard. It's bad enough when someone walks in on you and it ends with a quick, mumbled ""Oh shi- sorry"" and a pang of embarrassment. It's a whole different experience when someone walks in on on you and THEY start berating YOU. 

Anyways we shuffled out of the bathroom, still confused as to what the problem is. Obviously we know the bathroom is meant for one person, but we were just using the sink. We tell him we were just using the sink, and his explanation of his reaction to both of us in the bathroom was he's seen guys piss in the toilet and the sink at the same time. 

We left on good terms, the owner claimed he wasn't trying to cause any trouble with us and that we were all good, but his tone of voice and actions struck me as rude.

I feel his reaction was unwarranted, we were in the bathroom for less than 15 seconds before he barged in. I don't see what the big deal was, they have one sink and we went to use it at the same time. I know I was embarrassed to be chewed out by the owner within view of everyone in the restaurant.",58,93,0.87
875,Asshole,"So as most of you know this weekend is Stagecoach in Indio. It’s a huge country music festival and is so much fun. I’ve had a miserable year and have basically been counting on this as a way to turn things around and get happy again.

I’m 32 and I came with some friends from work who are a bit younger than me. Last night we went to the shows and the youngest one basically wore the lowest cut top I’ve ever seen without a bra you could essentially see her entire boob and if she moved right her nipples popped out. I asked her if she knew that and she said “I’m trying to get back stage! Wooooo.” I told her that this isn’t Coachella and during certain shows there might be kids and families. She literally took another shot and ignored me. 

I sent a group text out that maybe we needed to have a chat about what is and isn’t approriate for our group and said “having your tits on a platter just isn’t cool.” Apparently this offended most everyone because they ditched me and I had to walk to the show by myself. At the end of the night I caught up with them and they said I needed to steer clear of them for the whole weekend (we also had a minor argument on the drive up over gas money) and they would make sure I got back to Albuquerque but they didn’t want anything to do with me. So this really sucks. I do have a friend that is driving down from Vegas so I won’t be totally alone and I’m thinking about driving back with him and just flying home on Monday.

876,Not the A-hole,"My friend is obviously gay. He does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on YouTube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. He also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up K-Pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

We (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. Nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

So we're at school, it's lunchtime and we're all chilling in the cafeteria. He suddenly comes out of the closet and announces (to the guy-table) that he's gay. We're playing cards at the time, and our responses ranged from: ""Cool,"", to ""Finally...,""

Well APPARENTLY, we didn't show enough support because he seemed upset that we weren't caught completely by surprise.

Him: Why can't you people just accept me for who I am?

(We stare at each in confusion)

Me: Uh... we don't care. You're gay? Fine. It's none of our business. (shrug)

Him: It's 2019. It's not okay to hate on gay people anymore. (he storms off)

Girl 1: (kicks my leg) What the hell's your problem?

Me: Everybody already knew he was gay.

Girl 1: SOOOO??? You could've showed that you were happy for him! GOD! (kicks my leg again)

Me: Kick me again, I dare you. (Spoiler: she doesn't)

881,Everyone Sucks,"My brother is 14 and a high-functioning Autistic, he has Aspergers but apparently that’s not a diagnosis anymore and it’s just ‘on the spectrum’. He lives at a boarding school but I took him out this weekend to see a movie.

He has a thing that he does, where whenever he isn’t being entertained or someone isn’t doing shit for him he stands close by and just says “I’m bored.” If I’m shopping and it’s not at a game store, if we’re eating dinner, if I’m in the lounge room and there’s nothing good on tv. He says it so many times every day and it just gets annoying.He has two phones, he has a laptop, he has an Xbox, he can entertain himself. 

Today I’d just had enough of that phrase and turned around and told him to go away. He looked straight at me and said “I’m bored” again so I told him to fuck off if he didn’t have the brain cells to say anything else.

I got lectured by my grandmother that he’s Autistic and that it’s just something he focuses on but at times he does say it to get a reaction, she said it’s like having Tourette’s which I don’t agree with because he can fix it by doing something to entertain himself. I told her that if I have to accept it I’ll just not take him out of boarding school and she can go pick him up and spend all weekend with him saying that while I go do something else.

My frustration is that he is old enough to entertain himself, he’s got things to do to stop himself from being bored but apparently I’m an asshole for not just accepting that he says the phrase nonstop. I know it’s just a phrase but after like two years that goddamn phrase is like fingernails on a chalkboard.

So am I the asshole for snapping at my Autistic brother?

Edit: I’ve realised I’m snapping at him because since his mother shoved him off to boarding school four hours away from her and twenty minutes from me I’ve become his caregiver for things the boarding school won’t do.

Also, he has 2 phones. 1 is his new one and the other is his old one that he has all of his music on because he couldnt transfer it (he doesnt use itunes or spotify he just uses a music app). Its also important that hes lied alot during our relationship and is currently trying to better himself by not lying to me. 

Now, this morning i went onto my boyfriends phone to send myself a photo of our daughter and when i got onto the photos i saw nudes. At first i was livid but then i realised they were actually my nudes, but they were photos of the nudes on a different phone screen. After zooming in to see which phone it was i realised it was his new phone. I was confused because the photos were on his new phone. 

I asked him about it and he said he took them on his other phone and because its all connected through icloud theyre also on that phone. I asked why he would use his other phone to take photos of my nudes on his new phone and he said “to keep as copies in case you ever told me to delete them”. 

The way i see it is, he intentionally set it up so if i ever asked him to delete them he would say he has but really he had them on a different phone, so hed lie about deleting them. Thats the only way i see it right now. He done it so he could lie about deleting them. He said all guys have back ups of nudes theyve been sent, i asked if he had backups of nudes from his ex, people whos sent him them when we were broken up and he said no he deleted them when we got back together. I dont know if i believe that part. 

I told him he completely betrayed my trust by doing that especially since he was going to lie about it, he said it doesnt matter and i should get over it so i broke up with him. I then deleted all of my nudes off both his phones. 

I told my friend about this and she said theres no need to break up over it and i was too harsh by doing that. 

Am i really the asshole here?

AITA for ruining Easter? My 8-year-old daughter & I joined my girlfriend’s family for Easter break at their house in the countryside. My daughter is from a previous relationship that ended 5 years ago & where I have joint custody. My girlfriend has been in the picture 1 year. My girlfriend & daughter get along as do her parents & my daughter.

The Easter weekend weather is great, & we are having fun introducing a new dog that has been donated to my girlfriend to the existing dog pack. The family are hunters & own a lot of hunting dogs. The new dog is not trained & being 3 years old, risks not becoming a good hunting dog. 

On the last morning, we are outside playing the donated dog. In the course of conversation, I ask my girlfriends mom, if I wanted a dog of my own one day, what would be the best way to get one? She was upset & replied that I cannot be thinking about a new dog, & must focus on this dog, supporting my girlfriend in getting it trained. I agreed with her & left it at that, a little surprised by her aggressive tone. My girlfriend takes the dog for a morning walk alone. The rest of the family, including my daughter & I go in for breakfast. 

What follows is a verbal lashing about how insensitive I am & how irritated and upset it makes her. She was aggressive, direct & yelling. The most severe talking to I have had in my adult life, in front of my daughter. I choose not to argue with her, apologized & hoped she would end soon. My daughter, who is very sensitive, bursts into tears & walks out the room. I leave after her to console her as she went outside the house. Ten steps behind came my girlfriends’ mother in tears, rushing past me to pick up my daughter. She apologized. My daughter fought back her attempts to be hugged, trying to get away, but was held tightly. I was upset & hurt. In a direct & matter of fact tone, I told my girlfriends mother that; in my family we do not talk to each other like that & that she was wrong to talk to me that way. She apologized which I accepted. Some time passes & the scene calms down. My daughter does not want to go back into the house for breakfast, so we opt to stay outside until my girlfriend returns from her walk. 

Discreetly, I explained happened to my girlfriend returned. She was upset. Having seen her mom raging like that in the past, she was not surprised. I worry about my daughter. How does she feel about the fragile connection to this other family, her sense of security & safety to be around this family? What have I put her in & what kind of support could I give her to make sure she feels safe? What of these emotions are mine & what of them are hers?

At first my fiance and I tried to accept it (even though it was hella weird) but then everywhere we went, they would introduce us as brother/sister.

Basically, he was my friend before we moved in and we’ve always had a great relationship. We were college roommates too, but when college ended I bought a house and needed roommates, so I asked my friend who needed a place to live if he wanted to move in. I charge him the bare minimum to not go in the negative on the mortgage, which is hundreds less than any other property in the area. He has not once paid his rent on time, despite having lived here for 5 months now. The first few times, I reminded him to pay and he would give excuses about needing to transfer money, Venmo not going through, phone not working, etc... He always pays somewhere between 5-10 days late, which means i usually have to shell out more of my own money for the mortgage. I was laid back (like a friend, but still stern about rent being due on the day of, and not late) about it the first month... and then the second... and the third and so on. But today, I confronted him about it and told him it needed to be on time from now on. He gave the usual excuses, and I got angrier. I suggested he set reminders in his phone, or write it down somewhere, to which he said “why don’t you just start reminding me a week before since it’s your house,” in a tone that sounded more like “not my problem, so i don’t give a shit” and I absolutely lost it. I screamed at him at the top of my lungs that he, as a 23y/o adult needs to stop acting like a child and that it wasn’t my responsibility to parent him. We were stuck in the car for an hour so I turned the music up loudly so that we wouldn’t have to talk to each other, but now there’s been dead silence between us for a bit. My other tenant/friend/roommate was in the car as well and he hasn’t said a word to either of us (as far as I know) so I’m worried that I was a little too harsh.

I mentioned it a couple of times to my SO, but I told him that it was up to him if he wanted to do it or not. I was not able to donate due to financial reasons, but didn't worry about getting a gift because our friends totally understood and were happy to have us even be able to come down for their wedding. Just before we left my SO asked if we needed to bring a gift and I replied ""No, it's costing us a lot to go down there and our friends care more about us being there then gifts."" and he agreed and left it at that relieved that we didn't have to get a gift.   

We all show up to spend the night at our friend's place and well it turns out that they gave up that room they had available to a friend who moved in with them and they kinda forgot to let any of us know. There was also a giant party being held which I knew nothing about since I hadn't checked the group messages for months at this point. My sibling was the only one who knew that it was going to be happening and they didn't mention it at all. We're all tired realize that we don't really have a place to sleep and that there's now 6 other people also sleeping over. I start rushing around trying to fix things and get a space for my SO and I in our friends room and start getting the air mattresses blown up. My sibling had managed to get a space for them and our roommate to sleep as well. Honestly it was a rough night everyone was grumpy the next day.  

We're at the reception and I leave to go to the bathroom and when I get back my SO looks pissed and my roommate and sibling look guilty. SO tells me that he's mad that we didn't bring a gift. I'm caught off guard and so I go talk to the person who organized it. They tell me that they were going to say that the gift was from everyone anyways and that we can donate still if we want. 

I pull my SO off to the side to tell him what I found out, but he just starts yelling at me saying it's my fault and that I'm a liar. That I never told him about the crowd funded gift, that I knew about the big party and that I left him and our roommate alone with a huge crowd of people. I defended myself and we both ended up needing to walk away. But by the end of that long miserable weekend I was told that it was my fault and that I had lied by my roommate and sibling as well.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/birzcc/update_aita_for_dismantling_the_bed_and_taking_it/

This happened over the past few hours. So my wife and I started bickering because I forgot to buy her favorite kind of ice cream both times I went grocery shopping this month. I told her I'd go out and get some but she started yelling at me. She works a really stressful job so I just figured it was that.

She didn't want me to go and make a trip to the store just for the ice cream where our local food store is about an hour and a half away (living in a rural place sucks). I insisted, she said no, I said I wouldn't worry about it then. She got mad and said she would go get it and that I could sleep on the couch. I told her ""I'll be godamned, I bought the bed and if you have a problem, you can sleep on the couch"". She countered with the fact that her name is on the lease so it's her roof and I wouldn't be sleeping on the bed under her roof.

by this point it's escalated pretty bad just because of a childish quarrel. But I decided to take it a bit further. While she was gone, I took apart the entire bed and drove it to my friends house.

I'm currently laying in it and I'm about to turn my phone off to avoid the oncoming storm.

I am not a health care personnel but my job is to teach patients and nurses the use of diabetes insulin delivery devices and glucose monitoring. 

I have been working with this girl, 15 years old, who has had type one since she was 7. Naturally her parents freaked out with her diabetes diagnosed - pertrified she was going to die in bed from low blood sugar and consequently have been running her daughter high, high enough that by she is 20 she will likely have an leg amputated( I mean like 270 mg/dl is okay for her!!)

I met them yesterday to start them on a new therapy - overbearing mother wouldn’t let the child talk and kept answering every question. I was trying to get a gage if the child was giving insulin for meals, I could see from reports she wasn’t but the Mum insisted she is, 

I had enough and basically said to the parents in front of the child... ‘if you don’t stop making excuses for your daughters diabetes management she is going to be dead in your hands before you know it... how would you feel about that’ 

Mum got a bit upset at me, and I just told her she needed to here it. 
I spoke to a colleague about the confrontation.. she said I was too harsh and a bit of an asshole. 
I agree that it was harsh, but am I really the asshole?
I’m looking out for the child’s well-being. 

I work with adult patients as well and I can see the effects of long term high blood sugar and it’s devastating. This child has access to the best technology, which makes life managing diabetes a lot easier than what it was 30 years ago!! 
Don’t get me wrong, I have T1 diabetes too and I know it’s a shit disease

About a year and a half passes and I discover she was cheating on me with multiple people on numerous occasions. I promptly ended that garbage and moved on.

I haven't paid her back a dime based on the sole purpose of

    Her cheating on me

    No proof.

We have been separated for over a year now and she drunk texts me demanding 1400 because shes quitting her job. AITA for saying I don't owe her anything and refusing to pay?

AITA


Edit: when she loaned the money, I said I'd pay her back in 2 weeks, to which she replied ""I'm not worried about it."" Stayed this way for another year until I broke up with her and then she demanded the money.

Also, I received the security deposit of 650 back. She will be receiving this.


Edit 2. Got off the phone with her. Shes still drunk

Told her I'd pay her 650 tomorrow and asked if she is okay with a payment plan of 200 a week until its paid off. She seemed happy.

I'm happy that I can just get this all taken care of so I don't have to deal with her anymore. Thank you for all the feedback. Morally it is wrong not to pay her and I believe in karma. I appreciate you all",58,53,0.88

900,Not the A-hole,"I'm on mobile and venting. Sorry about the format.

My (20F) sister (18F) has been looking for a prom dress for the past couple of months but she wasn't able to find the ""perfect"" one. Everyone in my family, including my 10 year old brother particiapted in finding my sister's dress. We knew the jist of what kind of dress she was looking for but had trouble finding it.

Finally, after weeks of searching, she found a dress that she thought looked the best on her. We went to a prom dress store but the dress was $400 (which I understand is normal for a prom dress but it was a bit out of our budget). So I searched all over the internet to find a similar dress for cheaper and I found it. I showed it to my family and they all agreed that it would look great on her and my sister agreed. 

This is where the problem would occur. I bought the dress on sale (it was $80 with the discount). The return policy for dresses that are NOT ON SALE is to be returned in 30 days starting from the delivery date. But since we got it on sale, it was 10 days. I triple checked with my family just to make sure that they understood and we needed to make a final decision before those 10 days. I insisted on paying for the dress because I wanted to be a nice. This happened about 3 weeks ago.

Then, about 2 hours ago, my sister texts me if she should get another dress. I'm kind of annoyed because she's been playing the ""should I get this dress or that dress?"" for weeks now and when we've finally had the dress, thought about all the alterations, and not being able to return it, she was reconsidering her dress. I told her that she should figure that out for herself. She then asks me for the return details but I told her that it was too late and should contact the company herself if she wanted more information. 

I gave her the cold shoulder the entire conversation.  My heart is broken because I was the one who bought her dress and I paid for it with my first paycheck (which wasn't a lot because it got cut off on the payroll date) before I could even get myself anything nice. 

I immediately text my mother telling her that I want my sister to pay me back for the dress. My mom tells me that she would take care of it and goes to my sister to talk it out. After about 30 minutes I hear my mom loudly giving my sister the ultimatum that she would not be going to prom at all. 

Then my dad calls everyone out to have a family meeting. My dad thinks ITA because I told my mom about the issue when my sister confided in me knowing that my mom would act this way. But in the end my dad also gave her the ultimatum that she would probably not go to prom because
1. she can't return the dress 
2. she's not going to wear the dress to prom because she doesn't like it 
3. we are not going to buy her another dress 
4. she has no money (or a job) to buy herself a new dress. 

So AITA?

ETA: the ultimatum didn't just come from the comment I made to my mom. She was being a real asshole to my parents and my mom finally had enough and made this decision.

ETA2: I only told my mom I wanted my sister to pay for the dress. I was being petty during that time because I was upset but I don't really expect her to pay me back. My mom actually didn't tell my sister to pay me back and tried to talk it out with her.",83,393,0.95

I am paying my own way for this trip, both my husband and I have been saving up for it, so its not a free ride.  I stated early this year that if they wanted to go, that was fine, and I was even ok with changing what areas we were staying in so that they could go, including a detour to Poland to visit Auschwitz.  However, I specifically said I did not want to go, and would be perfectly ok with doing my own thing while they went and toured the sites.   I came home today to find that my husband has booked a tour for us already for Auschwitz, and has factored it into the price of how much my trip is going to cost.

911,Asshole,"My wife and I are having apocalypse-level debates on a new pet peeve of hers. Twice in the last week, circumstances have put us on a tight schedule and have forced us to grab breakfast on the road. On Easter Sunday, I went to church with her and her family. She woke me up 1.5 hours early, then tried again 1 hour out and 45 minutes out, knowing I am hard to wake. Finally, we were down to the wire and I quickly got ready and out the door. I wanted coffee on the way to service and although she said she didn't want anything, I got coffee and breakfast. We were close to the service location so we arrived in no time. We were 15 minutes late at that point so she didn't want me to eat in the car and be even more late but was mortified when I brought it with me and ate as I walked into the church. The usher commented on my Dunkin Donuts bag as we walked into her parent's church and we proceeded to get into a stage-whisper argument in the church lobby about how embarrassed she was that I brought a croissandwich into church. Less than five days later, we are in transit to her sister's college graduation. My wife, knowing I'd want to sleep til the last possible second, went and grabbed breakfast and brought it home well in advance of departure time. I waited until the last second to get ready so she offered to drive saying, ""I'll drive so you can eat on the way to the event"" (20 minute drive). I was on my phone most of the drive and waited until we were in the parking lot to pull out my breakfast and proceeded to eat the fast food in the lobby of the facility where the graduation was taking place. My wife was, again, mortified. Understandably, she gave me the opportunity to eat in transit to avoid being upset; but I don't think it's that big of a deal to bring food into these events. She's concerned with etiquette and how it looks to other people but it doesn't matter to me.... AITA?

*********** EDIT ************

My wife wrote the above, and I would like to clarify on a couple of points.

For the church, I ate half of the sandwhich on the way to the door from the parking lot, bagged the remaining amount before reaching the door, and dumped it off at the nearest trash can upon entering the lobby. The door greeter made a joking comment, something along the lines of ""Dunken Donuts? Nice!""

For the graduation, we arrived an hour and half early. I ate in the lobby. I asked the door man if I could set my bag on a table near a trashcan. He said something along the lines of ""Go for it""

I would also like to point out that I believe the tardiness issue has been confounded with whether or not the eating incidents were socially babrarous behavior. The focus of this thread should be the quick eating on the go. Also, its not that it doesn't matter to me, it's just that I don't think it is that big of a deal or socially frowned upon. It's not like I was popping tots in the middle of the sermon, or gobbling down a big mac during the graduation guest speakers dramatic pause.",159,192,0.81
912,Asshole,"I’d really like some perspective. 

My husband and I are newlyweds (24F/M married for 1 year) and over the past few months we’ve been fighting.

I work as a waitress and my husband earns roughly 5x what I do as an engineer. I also suffer from generalized anxiety and depression which he knew since he met me. Two months ago I had a breakdown during my shift and since then my anxiety has gotten progressively worse every time I went to work. A few weeks ago I sat my husband down and told him I want to quit my job and just focus on my mental health for a while. I told him work was making me sick and the money I was making wasn’t contributing much to our household anyways. 

So I quit and have spent recent weeks healing myself mentally and physically. I do yoga in the mornings and meditate in the evenings. I have a good therapist and I can feel myself getting stronger and gaining clarity every day. My husband started off really supportive at first but not even a month in he has started to nag me and pick at me over tiny things in our home.

I tell him that I plan to get back to work eventually but right now I really need to focus on me. I can’t be any use to anyone if my mental health isn’t where it needs to be. He understands this to an extent but still managed to throw barbs at me, like getting annoyed at me if the house isn’t in perfect condition when he gets home, or if I accidentally leave clothing or makeup lying around and he sees it.

A few days ago we had a big fight because he was like “Why aren’t you doing more cooking/cleaning/laundry since you have so much time” and I told him that I’m not taking time off to be his stay at home wife and do his bidding. That I’m taking a mental health break doesn’t mean I’m suddenly his maid or mother.

We fought because I accused him of not understanding what I’m going through and resenting me simply because I quit my job. I said that if he were sick and I was the breadwinner I’d be more than supportive of his break for mental health. He called me a lazy and a leech and I stormed out the house and stayed with a friend.",132,41,0.66

She won't help outside. It's like there is an invisible forcefield where she says that anything that needs to be done outside is 'man chores' and 'guy stuff'. Mind you, that doesn't mean that she tells me to stop doing what I'm doing when I wash the dishes/do the laundry/vacuum the floors, etc, so I guess the gender based chores only applies to outside. We don't have a strict system of shared chores, we just do whatever needs to be done inside as it comes up, but her insistence on not helping in the yard means I spend a significant amount more time in the spring/summer outside doing things that need to be done while still holding up my end of the inside housework as well.

&#x200B;

I do the lawn, the trimming, keep the front flower beds weeded and put down new mulch in the spring, wash our cars, do oil changes, rake the yard, power wash the siding, etc. We have an electric lawn mower that is self-propelled and we have a flat yard, so its not hard to start or hard to push or anything, and all of our trimming tools are electric powered as well. Whenever I suggest to her that she take care of the yard for once she gives me this look like she's appalled and says 'that's guy stuff though'. Meanwhile she's gone over to my parents house before and saw my mother outside riding their riding mower and didn't comment or act like it was weird at all.

I just so happened to be watching my surveillance camera auto recording someone walking their dog casually slide a bag of poop into the plastic/metal/glass recycling bin then head across the street and around the corner.  

I rush outside grab the bag of dog poop from the bin and proceed to follow them and their dog. I get their attention and held up the bag of poop and asked them why they had left it in my recycling bin. They didn't say anything but he looked shocked more than anything else that they had been caught and confronted. The guy sat there frozen and stood still for a few seconds like an animal trying to play dead. Words were exchanged and I asked him if he would not dump his dog's feces into my recycling bin and if they could put their poop into their own trash instead. His body language looked like he thought I was going to murder him then and there on the sidewalk. I wanted to hand deliver the bag of poop to him personally. But instead he told me to throw the bag of poo at the ground near him and he picked it up while I kept my distance. I asked him how he would like it if I took a dump in a plastic bag and dumped it in his trash bin, how would he feel about that?

He starts walking away with his dog and bag o'poop in the opposite direction. 
When he gets his shit together and I start walking away he finally comes up with a lame retort. 
When I am about 20-30 feet away from him he says he's going to come back and poop in front of my house.

TLDR: Dude sticks his dog shit in my recycling bin. Gets caught. Knows what he did and won't admit it. I pull the poop out of the bin and return it to him and asked him not to do it. When I am far enough away decides he wants to talk shit. He walks home with bag of poop and threatens to poop in front of my house when I am far enough away.

When I need to breastfeed my youngest, I sometimes bring my 6 y/o daughter in there, but justify it with that she's a pretty well behaved little girl and it's intended to be a women's space. I've seen other women bring young children in there and never cared, I mean, I'm not uncomfortable around little kids. 

Today I was just in there with my 9mos old, and a woman waltzes in with a probably 2 or 3y/o, and what looked to be a 13-15 y/o boy. I started staring daggers in this woman... What the fuck?! 

She starts nursing away on this toddler and chatting with this boy--who doesn't outwardly appear to be mentally handicapped or anything of that sort. They were talking about how he missed his math class today and how he needed to get his things together to go to his lacrosse game after they left. 

I cover up immediately and tell her in no uncertain terms that he needs to get out. I wasn't rude about it, I didn't cuss at her or anything, I tried to keep my tone polite but on the inside I'm like, what the flying fuck. I quickly added that this is a woman's space, it's clearly labeled mothers only, and her teenage son needs to wait for her in the waiting room. For good measure, I throw in that I enjoy this space because it's intended to be private, and having a strange man right next to me (the room literally used to be a coat closet up until like 3yrs ago) while I'm breastfeeding makes me a little uncomfortable right now and I'm just trying to relax. 

She called me a bitch. She said her son has ""autism and it makes him anxious to sit by himself"" and that she ""didn't appreciate me sexualizing breastfeeding or sexualizing her son"", adding that he ""has a lot of respect for women"". She tells me if I feel uncomfortable with others, I shouldn't use the nursing room, I should use bottles to feed my kid. She says I should cover up. She says I have no business to try and police others in a public space, and I have some nerve calling out a ""disabled child"". 

I'm stunned into silence. I'm not trying to get called ableist and perverted and this that and another name, she clearly doesn't get it. I pick up my baby and my stroller. I go tell the nurse that some lady brought a teenage boy in the nursing room. Clearly the nurses were diplomatic about it, but they did ask him to leave. Meanwhile, I'm kind of on the fence about if I overreacted too much or not but I still think it was weird.

924,,"Hello everyone.

Right now there seem to be a lot of issues surrounding theatre etiquette because of the latest Marvel movie so all cinema related topics must be asked in this thread.

Top level comments in this thread should be AITA questions related to your theatre experience. 


**Examples of questions appropriate for this thread:**

- AITA for seeing Endgame without my wife?

- AITA for telling this loud guy to fuck off in the theatre?

- AITA in this interaction with a theatre employee?


**If your question is ""AITA for spoiling the film for someone"" the answer is yes.** You're the asshole if you spoil this film and there is no need for you to ask.


""What if I am spoiling the film for a RACIST HOMOPHOBIC MISOGYNIST though???"" You're still the asshole, maybe everyone sucks this time, but spoiling a film that is this important to so many people still makes you the asshole.

929,Asshole,"So, when my (F) children (M and F twins) were three, me and their father got divorced due to unsolvable issues in our relationship which were caused by me. Ever since I'm had them on Saturdays, now they are both teenagers. Two years ago I met a wonderful man I am proud to call my husband, he was vegan so I quickly became vegan and I feel SOOOO much better! 

So anyways, recently I've brought up Veganism with them, they didn't seem to care and just went back to looking on their phones. Now the thing is we don't really have much of a relationship, whenever they're at my house they just ignore me, they do everything with their step-mother and father, and we have nothing in common; so I thought so like if I got them to be Vegan we could have something in common and maybe have a relationship, I started gradually encouraging them to be Vegan, like baking Vegan meals and stuff, and for their birthday I bought them each a book about Veganism. Well my son didn't take it well and angrily told me that he has no interest in being Vegan, and my daughter agreed with him! So we had a bit of an argument...

Ever since the incident (2 months ago) they've stopped coming over on Saturdays, I talked to my friend who is a lawyer for this kind of stuff and he said that it would be a waste of time trying to get them to visit cause they're old enough to make that choice for themselves. I have no idea if what I did was right or wrong.",322,374,0.77
930,Not the A-hole,"One week before Coachella, I entered one of those ""tag your friend"" contests to win two VIP Coachella tickets for fun.

Keep in mind, I did not plan on going to Coachella at all due to being in debt and wanting to pay it off. But as luck would have it, I won that contest and found out that I would be going to Coachella 4 days before the event. The day I won was the day I started scrambling to change plans around and find whatever accommodations I needed for the weekend.

Because even physically going to Coachella is not cheap (lodging alone is pricey af) and not wanting to further go into debt, my boyfriend and I decided to intentionally sell our Sunday wristband to somehow make money back and keep costs as low as possible. That way we get to enjoy the free tickets and not spend too much money - a happy medium.

Turns out, my close gf wanted to go on Sunday very badly. So instead of selling the wristband to a stranger for a possible profit (I actually had someone offer to pay $375 for each wristband), I decided I would sell it to her because we are so close for cheaper than face value while at the same time recuperating some kind of cost from the trip.

Instead of what I thought would be a grateful response, she got incredibly offended that I would try to make any sort of money off of her despite selling it to her for less than face value. 1 Day VIP = \~$333 per wristband. I charged her $350 total for both wristbands so $175 each.

She claims that if it were her, she would have given them to me for free. I tried to tell her that not everyone is in the same financial situations or has the liberty to do that. And yes, she does know about my debt which I brought back up to her in this conversation. Thinking that would finally make her understand why I was charging her, she didn't and remained upset.

She works for a company that gives out free concert tickets in our hometown and brought up how she has taken me for free so I should give her these Coachella tickets for free which I thought was unfair because it costs at most gas money and parking to go to a concert in our hometown.

Even though she was mad at me, she still wanted to buy them from me; which felt weird because it wasn't like I was forcing her to buy it from me. I initially was going to charge her $400 but on the day she came to pick up the wristbands, I lowered the price to $350 as a gesture of good will. We made the exchange and she has not spoken to me since. To my knowledge, she still holds firm to her own belief that she is in the right because I should have given it to her for free because of our close friendship and because I got them for free anyways.

931,Not the A-hole,"My BF and I have been together for 3 years. We have a 3 months old girl. He has an 11 year old (Kylee), we have Kylee full time. We both get along with her mom,  she was genuinely excited for us when we told her about our baby. 

Kylees mother asks me if I plan to vaccinate.  I told her of course I do. She then starts to say some  condescending things to me about how I must not know anything about the research on vaccines and autism, she feels bad for my daughter, and she hopes I’ll take time to “research”, then sends me links to a bunch of antivax blogs. I said “You’re allowed to have your opinion, but I am absolutely vaccinating my child.”

That happened when I was 3 months pregnant. Over the next 6 months, it was a constant argument with my BF over getting Kylee vaccinated. Basically, if he can’t take the steps to vaccinate Kylee and protect our baby, then it was up to me to protect her. I moved into my folks house, he barely sees the baby. I have sole physical/legal custody. 

I had limited contact with Kylee after my daughter was born. She wasn’t allowed to hold the baby, she understands why (she WANTS to get vaccinated). There are now over 40 active cases of the measles in the county we live in. After the outbreak, I have gone strict no contact with Kylee. It breaks my heart. We love each other (she even calls me mom sometimes). But to me, it is not worth the risk of exposing my baby. She can’t get vaccinated for measles until she’s 1.

My bf sees our daughter for a few hours every week. The way he sees it, our baby will be fully vaccinated when she’s 2 years old, and “Waiting 2 years to live together again isn’t that long.” I ask him how he’s ok with missing out on the first two years of her life. He says “As much as I want to vaccinate Kylee, I’d have to take her mom to court, and that would ruin how well we get along.”

Basically he values getting along with his baby mama over me and our daughter. I told him that I won’t wait around for two years because of this, then just pretend like it never happened. I feel betrayed that he won’t take action to protect BOTH of our girls. He admits he is afraid of them getting sick, but he knows “Her mom would go psycho over this and it’s not worth the fight.” He also says “You knew how Kylees mom felt about vaccines, but I still chose to have our daughter regardless.” Was I supposed to abort because getting his daughter vaccinated would be a fight?

Am I being ridiculous? I am so scared of my girl suffering or possibly even dying because of Kylees moms opinion on vaccines. I know there hasn’t been a death from measles since 2015 in the US, should I just suck it up and take my chances? I am seriously struggling here. I feel so hurt that my family is torn apart because of something so fucking stupid, but I genuinely fear for my baby.

932,Asshole,"So I realize the title may need a little explanation. I am from New Mexico and like a lot of people from my state, we consider being born/raised there as a unique experience. We have unique food (that is not necessarily Mexican and calling it Tex-Mex is a near hanging offense), a unique multi-ethnic culture, a stunning natural beauty and geography. The closest I’ve ever seen is how people feel coming from Hawaii. 

I go to school on the east coast. We have a club for people who were born or basically raised in New Mexico. We have huge dinners of New Mexican food, share contacts and a bunch of us will drive or fly across country together for breaks. 

Recently we had a girl join who’s story just didn’t make sense. We let her hang out but it really became clear she was just there to get Instagram pics with this guy who used to fight MMA out of the Jackson-Wink gym in Albuquerque. Of course he liked her because who doesn’t love getting blowies in the library study rooms but to most of it, it was such a stupid thing to lie about we didn’t want anything to do with her. I mean why not just approach him outside the group? He’s a nice guy.

Well we are now split, I kicked her out. About 40% of people think I’m way too harsh and the group should be open to people who just “have an interest” in New Mexico as opposed to being from there.  Half of those people think I’m an outright asshole. I counter thad rhe reason we have the club is for contacts when we move home...that goes against “just interest.”

933,Not the A-hole," Let me preface this by saying that my BF has a strange sense of humour and has jokingly proposed to me several times in the past. Not super often, but enough for me to be desensitised to it, and while we both know we’ll get married at some point, I’ve always taken it as a joke.

So today while we’re chatting weddings come up, and he casually ask if I’ll marry him again. I jokingly respond “Only if you ask my properly”, so he gets down on one knee and asks again. I still thing he’s just messing around, so I just roll my eyes and say “I’ll need a ring first”. He then got upset and said “If I bought you a ring would you still react like that?”

934,Everyone Sucks,"21F here away on an internship and sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls. They’re nice, but I’ve come to find out that they’re total slobs, mostly in terms of our shared bathroom. They don’t care about the overflowing trashcans, dust on the sink, or dried water on the mirror. I’m a clean freak, and I, at first, always ended up always cleaning it up myself without a word.

The bane of my existence, however, was how much hair these women shed, and their lack of care for it.

This hair thing has become the root of my problem here. They all have a habit of letting their fallen hair go down our shitty little drain, and it has caused clogs, as you would imagine. The first time around, I suffered with it for a week before realizing nobody was going to do anything. I went out, used my own money to buy a snake and drain cleaner, and unclogged it myself. Nobody said anything. 

A few weeks later, the drain backs up AGAIN. Me being the kind, benefit-of-the-doubt giving person I am, hoped somebody would get the lead out of their pants and take care of it, but as you may have guessed, that didn’t happen. So I took it upon myself to unclog it once more. Now rustled, I snapped a photo of the nasty hairball I pulled out and nicely sent it to all my roommates with a message saying “Let’s all make a conscious effort to keep the hair in our drain to a minimum!” Because I have hair too, and of course I shed too, but the difference is I clean up after myself. I’m a good sport though, so I’m thinking that we’re all in this together and me finally being vocal about it will cause a change.

Well, wouldn’t you guess, none of my roommates responded to my kind message, and I soon found myself pulling ANOTHER clogging hairball out of the drain. I took a picture of that, along with photos of the messy floor and mirror and overflowing trashcan, and sent them with a much less kind, more stern message.  Nobody replied. I figured that just texting wasn’t going to solve the problem, and I asked for an in-person meeting to hopefully discuss creating a chore chart, and nobody ever got back to me about that either.

I’ve become the sole cleaner of that bathroom. I’ve tried to communicate, and it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. So I’ve started taking my sweet time in there out of spite. Even if I know somebody is home waiting to use it, that hasn’t stopped me. I’m at the point where I’ve come to believe that since I’m taking the most care of it, I deserve the most time in it. I’m aware that’s probably a mega-assholish way to go about it, but that’s why I’m here.

936,Asshole,"Okay, so, both me and my wife are filmmakers. We're in our early 30's and we've been married for a while now.

Recently, a professional contact, who would gain a lot from earning her favor, wrote her an e-mail about a movie she worked on that was effusive to an insane degree. I don't want to quote the entire thing but one sentence popped out to me. This person said that her movie is ""better or as good as anything that is out there (past or present)""

Now, I am encouraging of my wife and we frequently collaborate, so I swear this is not coming from a place of jealousy or something but that sentence made me burst out laughing. Her movie is pretty good but for this person to say that it is one of the best movies ever made ""past or present"" in the history of cinema... It's pretty crazy, to say the least. I told my wife that this person is either being insincere and swinging for the fences to gain her approval or he hasn't seen many movies.

At first we laughed about it together but then I could tell she got a little sullen and hurt. I didn't want to hurt her feelings obviously and maybe I overstepped. Was I being an asshole about it? I already apologized and we're good but I wonder if I should do more to make up to her.

938,Not the A-hole,"Some background: I’m a 20f and I live with my 57 yo mother. She’s a very busy person and part of the reason I still live at home is to help take care of her because she often forgets to eat and take care of herself. 
She’s a business owner and is regularly VERY stressed out, so I take a lot of precautions to not bother her while she’s in her moods. Bothering her can be something as simple as trying to speak to her, walking into the same room as her, or acting like I might talk to her. When this happens she’s very fast to snap at me and say that she “Just can’t deal with this right now!” So I make efforts when she’s like this to not bother her, including keeping my phone on vibrate, which is something she used to go off on me for because the noise of my phone ringing was just too distracting. 
So I’ve always had my phones on vibrate.

For the last couple weeks, every night after work my mother has been going out with a friend of hers (call her K) for coffee or dinner after work. Most nights she gets home around 8 or 9. Last night she went out for dinner with her friend K and was out until 11:30~. I had already gone to sleep because I was really tired last night and I had work in the morning. Once she pulled up she discovered that she had left her keys at her business and couldn’t get into the apartment. She immediately started calling me and texting me, but since my phone was on vibrate and I was exhausted, it didn’t wake me up. Until 2am. 
She was livid when I came out to let her in. I went out and let her in as fast as I could, and she was already chewing me out before I even had the gate open. Apparently, this was all my fault because my phone was on vibrate. She continues to go off at me for another 30 minutes, keeping her voice hushed for the sake of our neighbors. She told me that I have my phone on vibrate so I can “ignore the world” and “not participate in society”. I apologize as she chews me out and she threatens all sorts of things if I apologize again because she “just can’t stand it”. She then accuses me of neglecting her/our dog, which she had dropped off earlier that day. 
This morning she continued to threaten me and tell me I am never allowed to have my phone on vibrate again, and whines about waiting in the car and tells me that she was freezing. (We live in SoCal. It was a low of 59F last night) Continuously guilting me over “What if I was in a car accident?” and “What if I had fallen and DIED? Then how would you feel??”
She was berating me about it until she had to leave.

I feel really guilty about leaving her outside that whole time (about 3 hours). I know how little sleep she already gets and this just makes it worse. I feel awful about it but I feel like she overreacted a bit. 

TLDR; Mom tells me to keep my phone on vibrate, I do for years. She forgets her keys and can’t wake me, suddenly how dare I keep my phone on vibrate.",35,27,0.86

940,Not the A-hole,"I think I'm the asshole here, or everyone is, but I'd like your honest opinion.

&#x200B;

Background:

About a month ago, a bichon puppy (maybe two months old?) was wandering around on the opposite side of the road in front of my house. It's a fairly typical suburban neighborhood, with a small school nearby (and so a lot of traffic). I looked around for an owner and didn't see one, so I came outside with some treats (and after a combination of stopping cars momentarily and gentle cooing) I lured him over to check if he had a tag on his collar. No tag. I kept him inside and put up signs on our block ""FOUND DOG. CALL\_\_\_\_\_""

For two days, there was no call. I took him on a walk on the second day and asked neighbors if they recognized him. Eventually one did, and brought me over to a ""LOST DOG"" sign about three roads down. I called the number on it. No answer. I called for three **more** days, and no answer (mailbox full, no voicemail, argh). I kept him at my house during this time, and I was going crazy.

Finally, I purchased a month of Spokeo (service where you can look up numbers) and found an address in the neighborhood that came up with the phone number. I knocked on the door and a young guy (late 20s?) answered and said, ""Oh, you little jogger. Thanks."" and closed the door in my face. I knocked on the door again and asked if he could put a tag on the dog. He seemed annoyed and said ""Sure"" and closed the door again.

Cut to a **week** later and *the same dog is wandering around a street away.* He knows me and so he cheerily came up to me and my dog. No fucking tag.  I marched over to his house and gave the owner the dog and told him that if he didn't have a tag made for him, next time I'd take his dog to the pound. He said ""Stick up your ass, man. He's fine. Look: he's back.""

Three days ago, I found the dog again. The owner has just kept ""LOST DOG"" sign up, because, hey, his dog gets lost all the time. Now, here is where I might have become the asshole: *I took his dog to the pound.*

In my defense, they give the owners 72 hours to pick up the dog before they give it away. We got our dog at the pound (after showing up for a week straight, because you have to win a lottery because so many people are trying to get puppies... the adult pitbulls and rottweillers are not as lucky). I saw the ""LOST DOG"" sign and started to feel guilty and went to the pound -- sure enough, he wasn't picked up, but there were already people asking when he is available for adoption.

Signs are still up. I am sure he got adopted, but I have no way of knowing if he went to a **good** home. I thought he would get picked up. I mean, shit. AITA? I will accept your judgement and maybe suggestions on how I could have responded better.

EDIT1: Removed a word.

EDIT2: Yes, it's a kill shelter. They kill animals not adopted after at least two months and they also allow adoptions after 72 hours (to give the owner time to claim him or her). At 48 hours, when I visited, he already had 7 names signed (interested adopters). If there are more than 1, then they raffle the dog off, and if there are more than 10, then they auction the dog off (with limits on price). That's how we got our dog a year ago.",73,221,0.93

But this is where the problems begins: after two days I texted her on whatsapp to ask her if she already watched it (I wasn't sure just then and wanted to ask her again if she hadnt watched it) 

I think she got my message wrong.. After a few minutes she started texting about the ending, spoiling me the ENTIRE ending, instead of replying to my message.

After reading it I somehow lost control and immediatly blocked her. She should've known that I haven't watched it yet because I told her that I can't watch the movie untill next week because of my little brother and she damn knows that.

She came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. Apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. I was really pissed. My sister and my family supported me. But my wife did not. She later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer.

We've talked about this issue several times and he always argues that I'm setting him up for failure by not giving him enough time. I disagree because I think he takes far longer than is reasonable to complete simple tasks. I'm giving him days or weeks to do it, not hours.

Since my husband thinks this is a matter of me not giving him enough time, I decided that the next time I ran into this problem with a non-essential task, I would let him take as long as he needs to get it done and then point out how long it took for him to do it. I honestly feel like this is the only way to get him to understand my point.

We ran out of paper towels six weeks ago. I asked him to pick up some more next time he went to the store. It hasn't happened. We haven't had paper towels for six weeks. He complains about it constantly, yet he won't buy the damn paper towels. If he makes it to eight weeks without picking up the paper towels, I will do it.

I casually mentioned this to one of my friends and she think I'm being a cruel asshole. She doesn't see why I can't just buy the paper towels. I admit that I know I'm being petty here, but does that make me the asshole?

Edit: I realized after I posted that this may be important. The reason why I am unwilling to accept taking over these tasks is because our chore division is already inequitable.

946,Everyone Sucks," First off, I would like to say that I am not transphobic or homophobic in anyway

To tell you a bit about me

I TRY to be a very open person when I meet someone (Especially online). I try to show my vulnerabilities and I try to be as honest as possible.  
I met JUNE (we'll call her) about 3 months ago on a dating website. She only had FACE pictures which I already knew COULD be a red-flag but I ignored it. Honesty I thought that maybe she may be a bit overweight which is why she was not posting full body pictures. I personally am not attracted by overweight women, however I was willing to take a chance in meeting her.

Now on to the date

She requested a specific restaurant because of it's location. (easy acess, lots of people around, good service) A lot of people from the neighborhood go to this resturant, along with many of my old high school friends. (I'm 30 YRS OLD)

10 min passed and she still had not arrived. So getting impatient I started playing a game on my phone, and within a few min of playing she sits down. She introduces herself and this is where it all went wrong.

I immediately saw her face and realized although this is the same person, the pictures were very altered. Unfortunately, not expecting her to be a man, I screwed my face in a way that was very inappropriate. I caught myself doing this and immediately changed but she obviously noticed

June: Why did you look at me like that

Me: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I'm just a bit surprised. I didnt expect you to (and I briefly paused) be a man

At this point her face turned a bit red and I can tell she took my comment as disrespectful. and she replied with

June: I AM NOT A MAN! I AM TRANS!

Loud enough that people actually turned their heads.. Now I feel like we are the center of attention in the resto.

Me: Well you could've told me!

June: I don't see what difference it makes! I'm still a woman!

Me: NO! your a man! I am not gay, nor bi. I am not interested in this kind of relationship!

I Get up, and I leave. Walked out of the resto.

She texted me after that, and we continued to argue.

I won't go into full detail but basically her point was that me and her had good chemistry, and she felt that If i had taken the time to get to know her, and love her for who she is.. I would feel different and we'd get together.

I am not against trans/homo or wtv someone chooses to do with themselves. But I am also am not homosexual. I want to be a woman. I don't view transwomen as women. They are TRANSwomen. I don't want to be with a trans person and I honestly feel like I was catfished for 3 months. If she would have told me from a long time ago, I would have respectfully told her I am not interested..

Somehow she found my FB information and messaged some of my friends, who are now saying I am an asshole and I am too shallow.. I don't really agree.. So I need some advice.. What do you guys think?? AITA?",641,201,0.7

The title should really be are we the assholes but whatever. Throwaway because I’d rather she not see this and use it to mock me or some shit.

Our sons are 16 and 13 and our oldest, ‘Levi’, is stubborn bastard much like myself. Recently my husband and my brother were in the living room playing either Fifa or 2k19, I don't really care because either way my brother was getting his ass handed to him. He got mad and now he owes us a new TV because he put a controller sized hole in ours. The only other TV in the house is in our room (Levi wants to buy his own and our youngest doesn’t spend much time in his room to need one in there) so we have been spending a lot more time with the boys in our room the week watching tv or playing video games at the foot of our bed, we have no problem with this until it comes to my husband and I needing to talk privately. 

While our youngest will leave when we tell him to, Levi will just kinda stay there and tell us go ahead and have our conversation and he’d act as a ‘non-biased party’ just in case of an argument. He’ll have this shit-eating grin on his face. Normally just giving a look will get him out but he’s learned that just not looking at us is effective against it. My husband will wind up  just carrying him out after a few minutes and lock the door behind him but I came up with a new idea that requires less of a hassle. Whenever Levi chooses not to leave when we tell him to, we’ll talk about the previous night of sex and he’ll be out of the room within seconds, grumbling and huffing under his breath and then we’ll have our conversation without interruptions. I would be lying if I said I didn't find the look on his face hilarious. We never go into to extreme detail when we talk about it, just enough to get him out.

I told my friend today about how we get rid of him and she told me we were being pretty shitty parents and that we’re going to scar him forever and that what we were doing is just as bad as him walking in on us. I told her he’d be fine and we dropped the conversation but I’m still kinda wondering if she’s right or not.",257,1532,0.94

So, at work yesterday, my wife texts me that our 4 yo is sick. She threw up all over the bed, slight fever, etc. Some bug, nothing major. I come home from work, check on her, she's ok, but not feeling well.

So, I had some errands to run. Wife said she's not making dinner tonight. So, I take care of business and decide to pick up a bite to eat. I call the wife to see if either of them want anything. Daughter answers, I ask her, she said no, she doesn't want to throw up. Ask her to ask her mom, she says no as well. So, I ordered a burrito and brought it home.

I get home, and my daughter runs to me. I unwrap the burrito, and she's staring at me. I ask if she wants some, and my wife comes in and asks where is her (daughter) food. I said that they both said no.

Wife gets pissed, starts telling em I'm selfish, inconsiderate, etc. My daughter is on the verge of tears.

I gave half my burrito to my daughter, who takes two bites then goes and throws up.

Ended up sleeping on the couch.

Apparently I should have bought them both something despite their no's.

Probably too late at this point, but I do want to clarify a few things:
* We have plenty of food for her to eat at the house, BRAT stuff especially. 
* Yes, my daughter answered the phone; it's a smart phone and when I call it shows a picture of me. She's still learning to ready, but if Mom is right there, and she sees my photo, she'll often answer. I call on my lunch breaks, when I'm traveling for work, etc. She also knows 911, as my wife has health issues
* We have tons of rice at home. A fresh batch was made before I left (wife is Asian, there's always rice)
* Popsicles, toast, bananas, etc are also in the house. I didn't feel like cooking myself dinner after working 12 hours.
* Anyone in the Orange County area looking for a kitten?
* I asked my daughter to ask Mom about dinner. I heard her ask, and I heard her say no.
* We always share food in our house. Everything is family style, more or less.
* Yes, I'm an idiot, that's a given. I work in sales in an industry where I didn't even know the basic terminology when I started; for fucks sake, I'm definitely an idiot
* Kid is better today, she credits it to sleeping on my side of the bed last night.
* Wife seems ok, she's all dolled up and had dinner waiting for me. I'll atone for my side by waxing her car tomorrow then making tacos",669,2352,0.95

We're in that weird weather where it's not quite warm enough for the air to be on but still pretty stuffy in the house. My boyfriend wants to sleep with the 2nd floor windows open. I downright refuse to sleep with the windows open. Mainly, I'm afraid of someone breaking into our house. I'm a bit obsessed with true crime and I've heard too many true stories about women attacked (or worse) from leaving a window open or unlocked. (example: Golden State Killer). To add, we don't live in the best area of my city.   My solution is to just turn the air on. My boyfriend doesn't like that solution because my paranoia is costing him money.

Sophie didn't appear to make much effort to make my gf feel welcomed and the next day when I eluded to this with her, Sophie said that she just felt anxious around new people. Anyway, me and my gf hang out some more times with the friends and apparently have some argument. I guess we were really drunk and weren't thinking. I don't even remember it but apparently I shouted at a guy that was serving drinks and some people in the group felt uncomfortable, and so I apologised and said we'd drink less next time. That was in about November.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to New Years, Sophie messages me asking if I can come without my gf to a party. Sophie said it was because of that argument. I am shocked by this because the argument had clearly just been some drunken misunderstanding. I'm then put in a really awkward situation because I have to now choose between my friends or my gf. Of course, I go out with my gf and have to tell my friends that I can't come with them or Sophie because of what Sophie's said. Sophie feels bad about this and apologises and I end up accepting it because it was the first time she's done something like this and she'd been going through a rough time dealing with a breakup so I let it slide.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to Sophie's birthday in early April, Sophie pulls the same stunt. She messages me saying that she feels uncomfortable around me and my gf because she doesn't gel well with my gf and that we both together as a couple make her feel really uncomfortable. She said she feels like my gf doesn't like her so she doesn't want her coming. I get really offended by this as a few weeks ago she had asked my girlfriend if she wanted to come to the bday party. Me and my gf had even spoken to Sophie about which couples costume we could wear and Sophie seemed all up for it. But, again, she sends me a message a few days before the party saying how she only wants me to come. I get really upset about this as it would mean the awkward situation of having to tell my girlfriend that she can't come to the party. I thought about it and decided that there's no way I can go to the party without my gf, because it'll upset her if I go without her. My gf had booked it off work and everything; I wasn't going to go out to a party and leave her sitting at home; she's a really sensitive person and stuff like this upsets her a lot. I tell Sophie that I'm not going to go and she calls me selfish and says how I'm not thinking about anything from her point of view and even calls me a ""shit friend"". I haven't spoken to her since and honestly feel justified in ending the friendship because of this.

960,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago, but I still think about it.

I used to teach 8th grade.  I had one kid, call him Billy.  He was incredibly smart.  But he also just was a pain in the ass to be his teacher.  The kind of kid that people who never even taught him knew his reputation and who he was.   He wasn't a ""bad"" kid, but he definitely was a smart ass who purposely broke the rules whenever he wanted.   It was all for attention, because honestly, if he just came to my room to hang out before or after school, he was actually nice.

We had this ""behavior contract"" students and their parents had to sign at the beginning of the year.  Essentially after a certain number of detentions or suspensions, we started taking away 8th grade activities.   So the first thing was the DC trip, then it was the 8th grade awards luncheon, and finally it was graduation.  I had never had a kid actually get to the point where graduation was off the table, until Billy.  And this wasn't just detentions I gave, it was anyone.  So while I was his homeroom teacher, he had plenty of other teachers he interacted with, and their punishments counted as well.  He knew early on he wasn't going to DC.  And not long after that, he lost the awards luncheon.  However, he knew he was getting close to not being able to walk for graduation.  And he was fairly good for a while.  But it didn't last.  As it turned out, the detention I gave him, was the one to put him over the edge.   Since it never happened before, the principal actually gave me the final call on whether to take away this privilege (I was very upset as I think it should have been his call and he shouldn't have put it on me).  A lot of people I talked to, including my mom, said how graduation is really for the family, and taking that away would suck for them.  In the end though, I said no, he was difficult all year to all of his teacher, so he will suffer the consequences.  And I didn't let him walk.  I'm still not sure whether this was the right call

&#x200B;

Edit:  One thing I wanted to add was that there were plenty of other students who had the DC trip and awards luncheon taken away too.  So I didn't think it was fair to them to let him get away with going past the limit, when we didn't let them do so",160,694,0.96
961,Not the A-hole,"I've been practicing 3d Modeling and decided to use my friend ""John""'s twitch channel icon for practice. Didn't share it with anybody, just did it for myself. ""Debby"" is his girlfriend.

I worked for a few hours on a render and showed John, explaining why I was doing this (again, just for a practice subject, but wanted to share it with him since it's his channels icon) - he was thrilled and really liked where it was going. He encouraged me and told me that if I got it finished he would use it for something. I thought that was really neat and it motivated me to keep going and keep him updated. He then mentions that Debby was the ""original artist"" and that she really liked it and thought I did a good job.

&#x200B;

Next day and several more hours in, I've got it looking pretty cool, and I update him again - he responds that its looking great, but immediately repeats that ""Debby is the original artist, so you should discuss this with her"". Weird, but okay. Send it to her too, once again explaining where its at, and why I am doing it. She compliments it, but then it takes a turn for the worse.

She proceeds to remind me.. AGAIN.. that she is the ""original artist"", and then tells me that next time she makes any art for his channel, she wants me to ask for permission before deriving her art or doing anything with it. I was confused, and asked to clarify if I've bothered her with this and apologized. She confirmed that she was pissed off, but understood that ""I didn't mean to step on any toes"" and so things are ""okay"", and acknowledged that I was just doing it for fun / educational purposes, but then re-iterated that she doesn't want ANYBODY touching her shit without her permission first. She then told me that at some point John admitted to her that he should have shut me down sooner - leading me to think she whipped him for this.

I didn't want a fight with her, especially since she is also a part of my friend group, and immediately apologized again and told her I would cease immediately, finish the last render and hand over my source file and final image, to which she simply responded with ""dope, I'll give u credit for the 3d rendering part"" and had nothing further to say. John's reaction when I told him that I stopped because I realized I pissed her off was just ""Yeah but it's water under the bridge. You were using it for educational purposes. Besides, she loves ya - can't stay mad forever! "".

We recently moved to a new church, because we haven't been able to go to one for years. Then we met (and I'll call her this for privacy purposes, even if she isn't famous in any way,) *K*. *K* is mentally disabled. She's had many seizures, but she's still very social and mobile. You would think she was just a nice old lady, if she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me. I guess it's because I'm also disabled, and she has somebody to relate to, but I can't take it. She's extremely huggy feely and often comes at my worst moments.

 There was a time after church; I was trying to walk out the door to our car. The second I stopped to put my phone away (asking my mom for l-theanine tablets, as she's the one who has them,) *K* walks as fast as possible to get to me. I don't know where she came from. She only wanted to tell me about her seizures, and get my name for once. This was not the first time we've interacted. This was the 14th week. Now, there was a reason I asked for l-theanine. I was on the verge of a bad anxiety run, and I do awful in cars. I did not want to puke. *K* hugged me for at least five seconds, still talking, and that tightness in my chest skyrocketed. I could not possibly get to the car fast enough in the heels I was wearing. I barely made it home without getting sick, and I was left extremely uncomfortable for the rest of the day.

*K* does that a lot. *K* is also extremely ignorant to what she says. Before church, she comes up to my dad and talks about her pregnant daughter. She talks for a long time after that, holding up church--it had started (should have) two minutes previously. Then *K* turned to me, back to the daughter topic.

 She says, ""I prayed really hard to God so that my kid won't turn out like you.""

Now, I'm very apathetic in most moments, and I don't hold grudges unless it's fake and funny. I'll also say that my limb difference is an extremely stressing topic, and I often hate myself for it, despite how pointless human bodies are. This hit me hard. I wouldn't wanna be me either, *K*. I really bloody wouldn't wanna have my limb difference, so why on earth would I want to hear it out loud? I understand that she meant it well. I wouldn't want her grandkid to go through what I did, either. But *K* continued to go on about it, and it hurt. A lot. I broke down again when I got home.

I know that she's disabled, and I know that she wants a friend that she can relate to (even if I'm gross and 13), but I can't stand her.

We were going to tell everyone the party was for my 30th birthday which will fall around the same time, but then dress my son in a ""brother"" shirt and possibly put an ultrasound picture on display. 

The ""birthday"" cake would serve as a gender reveal for extra fun. 

In general I dont *love* the idea of preplanned gender reveal parties because I feel people are feeling obligated to bring a baby gift and it's a grab. This way that doesnt happen but we get to celebrate with our closest family and friends. 

The complicated factor here is that my sister is having some struggles with infertility, and has been TTC since Nov, had 1 MC and no other luck. She took the news of my pregnancy really hard at first (I told her already nobody else besides my husband knows) but she has warmed up a bit. 

I'm still really wary of oversharing or overdoing it around her, but I want to celebrate this baby the same way I celebrate my first.

2nd edit: thanks everyone for your insight. It seems like alot of people ITT and maybe reddit just dont like gender reveals. To each their own opinions. Every member of the party I'd invite would be *asking* me ""when will you find out the baby's gender? Let me know when you know!""

My mum has taken the line ""Wear whatever you're comfortable in."" To which I responded that I would wear my suit, which I wore to prom a year ago.

Seems to be some confusion, which is my fault. Forgot to mention that I don't wear women's clothing at all, ever. My parents both know this and my dad has expressed his wishes that I would wear more feminine clothes even though I've told him they make me v unhappy as I don't feel like myself (possibly something to do with gender identity related stuff.).

Also, theres no dress code at all. As i said, very casual wedding. My parents don't even really care about getting married, mostly doing it for the tax benefit. Mum has expressed that she disagrees with my Dad now, and wants me to be comfortable.

983,No A-holes here,"SO and I dated in her country for a year. Decided to move to my country where she doesn't have any friends, family and doesn't speak the language. We've lived here for 18 months, and we hang out with my family, my friends and spend most of the time together. She has had a job from day one.   


I hang out with my friends without her max once per week. Very often she gets sad / grumpy because this reminds her of not having her own family/friends around. I understand her situation and sacrifice but still think it should be okay to do stuff without her.  AITA?

Thank you for your thoughts!",27,46,0.96
984,Not the A-hole,"Typing on phone sorry! My SIL has never been very nice to me, which has never really bothered me because I know it’s her issue not mine. She is quite high-strung and has trouble forming quality relationships with family and friends. Because of this, I tend not to really engage with her because she doesn’t add any happiness to my life and her social problems are not my concern. She is quite rude to her mother and has gotten worse over the years as I have gotten closer with my MIL. Again, not my problem, just speaks to her personality a bit.

As fate would have it, we both got pregnant at the same time (both with boys). They had a hard time conceiving and ended up doing IVF with donor eggs after many years of trying. We were very lucky to conceive naturally and a little unexpectedly, and we made an extra effort not to emphasise this too much out of consideration for their difficult journey. We were genuinely happy for them and I hoped that it would mellow her out and bring us closer.

Unfortunately it didn’t quite work out that way, and a big part of the reason was that she insisted on telling me what I could and could not eat/do during my pregnancy. She never seemed to see an issue with publicly bringing it up if I ate or drank or did something she thought I shouldn’t. It got so frequent that at one point I just replied with “I’m quite capable of making that decision for myself” in front of a few other family members. She started crying and ran off, and I found out later that she had complained to her mother that she was upset because she “never had the choice to take risks like that”. 

So she was not only saying that I was KNOWINGLY putting my baby in harms way, but also making herself the victim of my ‘inconsiderate’ response to her unrelenting badgering. I’d like to mention that I’m an academic in the health/medicine field and so I had done some pretty significant research on these topics and definitely knew my baby was NOT at risk through my choice. The basis for my research was scientific journals, and the basis for her research was Dr Google.

MIL saw through it (thankfully) and simply comforted her until she calmed down and we continued as normal. That was the last straw for me and I decided after tolerating years of her passive aggressive impoliteness that I would stop making an effort to spend time with her. My partner agreed and even commented that we should have made the choice sooner. This has unfortunately coincided with the early years for both our sons and so part of the knock on effect is that they might not be as close growing up. I feel that I’ve given her so many chances and I guess the reality is I don’t want my son exposed to her toxicity. Am I being an asshole? Should I put aside my feelings to encourage the boys to grow up close?",32,232,0.95
985,Everyone Sucks,"My husband and I have been together 6 years, married 3. His daughter is 8 years old. He was never married to his daughter's mom, but they have a civil relationship and have shared custody where he has his daughter M-W or M-Th, and her mom has her the rest of the week.

When my husband and I met I made it explicitly clear to him that I am not interested in having children or being a stepmother. We tried to keep things casual, but ended up falling in love and I honestly can't imagine life without him. We've gotten around this by me keeping my condo that I had when we met. When his daughter is over, I go stay at my condo. I'm an introvert and have a very time consuming hobbies, so this works well for us. I get a break for a few days a week (we still chat and text) and then spend the rest of the week in our home with him.

I am aware that this is unusual, so I don't talk about it much to people besides family, but as his daughter has gotten older, she's become curious about me. We've never met but she knows about me and has never seemed particularly interested in me and is happy to have her dad to herself, but now that she's asked some questions about me, her mom, who was previously thrilled about our arrangement, thinks that it's selfish and weird. I think her mom is being hypocritical; I think she was thrilled at first that I was being 'sent away' when their daughter was over, but now she's finding a new way to resent me when she realized we're all happy this way.

Is it really that bad? I had a stepfather who I hated for all of my childhood and I would've been thrilled if he kept his distance.",146,98,0.8
986,Not the A-hole," 

I met this girl from my university. We talk to each other a bit through social media and we pretty much hit it off. This then progressed to us meeting up and hanging out. She opened up to me about a lot of things in her life like her depression, anxiety, eating disorder, how her family pressures her too much and that she had to transfer universities because someone had violated her while she was drunk and the administration did nothing to handle the situation. Basically, she has went through a lot of shit.

One day she finally confessed her feelings for me. She was expecting me to not reciprocate feelings so she was shocked about my answer to say the least. We talk for a couple weeks, and one particular evening after hanging out she messages me and says that she isn't ready for a relationship and that she didn't want to hold me back after graduation. She says that she always gets scared when things start to become really close, so she starts to sabotage things. I decided to remain friends with her because I still enjoyed her company regardless.

Lately, she has flown off the handle. She'd skip class, forgo meals, smoke pot almost daily and started snorting her Ritalin tablets. She would tell me about some guy she had a fling with in the beginning of the semester that keeps trying to get into her pants and asking for her to come to his room and stuff on a weekly basis. I keep suggesting that she ignore him or block him, and if he only sees her as a booty call then he isn't worth having around. Another thing she would do is send me screenshots of messages some guy would send her trying to get into her pants and asking for help and how to reply.

Today, She told me about how she's pulled the trigger whenever she felt nauseous after eating a meal, how she feels fat and, more recently , that she thinks she's pregnant because she and another guy had unprotected sex at a party (they were both drunk). She said he pulled out but is still worried that the pre-cum still could get her pregnant. I don't know how to reply to these situations, and to be honest, I think she should be seeing a counselor or therapist about these issues.

At this point I can't take it anymore, this has been adding unnecessary stress to my life that I don't need. I just want to fucking graduate at this point and I feel like cutting her out will get my closer to my goal. I feel like I've become an emotional tampon to her at this point. Lately, I've been more blunt with her about things she talks about and, admittedly, a little judgmental about her vices. But what's holding me back from doing this is that I'd potentially lose the friends I made through her in the process, and God knows how she will react if I tell her. That is something I don't want on my conscious.

So what do you think Reddit? WIBTA if I cut this girl out of my life weeks before I graduate?",41,143,0.96
987,Not the A-hole,"Short post, but to the point. Apologies for formatting issues. Using my Android phone to write. 

A few years ago, I was approached by my mother after leaving foster care and being placed into semi-independent living. I was told that my grandmother (who beat me as a kid due to her hatred for my dad who was never there) had died in hospital after her lungs were failing. She died after a few days on life support. I was approached a week or so later.

I was told about her death, and I didn't really feel any sadness. I actually laughed and told her ""The universe has balanced her karma."" My mother wants me to love my family, but I can't let go of the abuse.

Am I the asshole for being so bitter about my past that I laughed about my grandmother's death?

989,Not the A-hole,"I think I would be... looking if there are other opinions. 

&#x200B;

I'm 24M and I'm currently building my own house. I'd been saving pretty much since I was 18, so I had a 20% deposit to avoid LMI, didn't need my parents to go as guarantors, etc. I'm really proud to have managed to do this all by myself. 

&#x200B;

I've been with my GF for 8 months, and I think she's the one... not sure if that's relevant, but when you know, you know, right? Especially after a couple of years of bad relationships. Anyway, my house will take about 6 months to build, and I'm thinking by that stage we'd have been dating for nearly a year and a half, and it would be time to move in and see if we could live together. 

&#x200B;

So I was discussing this with my parents one night over drinks, when they said that I should protect myself and get my GF to sign a rental agreement before she moves in with me, so that she'd be 'renter' and I her 'landlord'. Just in case things so south. FYI, in Western Australia, once you've been together for 2 years, you are considered to be in a 'De-Facto' relationship, and get most of the same rights as a married couple, i.e. half the assets. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, I kind of agree with my parents. While I absolutely see this relationship going the distance (and I don't want to ruin what I've got , I've worked really hard to get to the stage of owning a house by 24, and I don't want to lose that after years of effort. But at the same time, I feel like if I got her to sign one I'd be saying to her 'I don't have a lot of faith in this relationship going the distance, so I'm putting a failsafe in place'.

He blames it on the games I play, but to be honest I don’t even play much on the weekdays anymore because once I take a nap, gym, shower, and dinner, it’s already late and I have to go to bed. 

The only problem with napping is the fact that I sometimes sleep through my alarm and wake up hours later, sometimes near my bedtime which happened today. I can see why he’s mad at me now but I normally don’t do this and it was just a mistake for me.

The day after invites went out my aunt supposedly called and told my mom they might have a vacation planned that week, Today she told me my great aunts/uncles/cousins aren’t coming because their all worried about not knowing anybody and thinking it’s too far of a drive, It’s 15 minutes from my house. Part of me wonders if she went and told them that my boyfriends family is uninviting or dramatized how far the drive was. 

She says that we’re going to have a party for my daughter at my uncles the day after her real birthday. (before the party I’m throwing her) and didn’t tell me about my family not coming to her actual party or her new party until today. I should also mention that separate family parties were discussed for my boyfriends divorced parents but we decided against it and wanted to have one nice party instead of 3.

994,No A-holes here,"I've (20F) been seeing this guy (21M) and we haven't had sex yet but basically have done everything else. We are more like friend with benefits. We met unintentionally as a music concert our college put on and hit it off immediately.  I recently found out today that he does in fact have a girlfriend. I don't have an instagram just for personal reasons however my other female friend does. I told her his name because I was telling her about him and she wanted to see what he looked like. As she was scrolling she found a picture posted a while ago of him and another girl on what seemed like a Christmas vacation in a city close to us (location tagged).

&#x200B;

I assumed they were a couple just from the dynamic of the picture but I didn't want to jump to conclusions as that was the last photo of them together on his instagram account and they might have broken up. So I asked my friend to message the girl to see if that was her boyfriend. As to not raise suspicion the message went something like ""you guys are such a cute couple, I've always wanted to go to \*city\*!"" just a simple message. The girl replied a few hours later saying thank you how kind and asked if she knew us since I understood she was probably confused of a stranger messaging her.

&#x200B;

So since she didn't deny it I'm assuming they're a couple now. The problem is next week is finals week and my friend said to wait until after to tell her because she'll be heartbroken and emotionally not ready to study and take her tests. I agreed but the guilt has been eating me up and I can't help but feel if I was on the other end I'd want someone to tell me immediately.  I haven't texted the guy I know and I feel like this is going to distract me from effectively performing on my finals. WIBTA if I told her before next week?

Edit#1: People have pointed out that if they were the girl they wouldn't clarify their relationship status to a stranger. I shouldn't have made the assumption.

996,Not the A-hole,"So to start, I am in a happy long term relationship. That being said, I have a friend let’s call A. I’ve known A for about 6 years but we didn’t become actual friends until about 4 years ago. A and I had a good friendship and not much changed when I started dating my SO. We sometimes all hung out together but nothing unusual. 

Within the last year or so I’ve noticed a change in how A behaves when we’re with my SO. A tries really hard to come off as very intelligent and “cool” in front of my SO and often at my expense; If my SO and I disagree with each other on something, A will debate me every time to just be on my SO’s side even when they’re wrong. A will argue with me on anything (even topics in my own career field) just to make themselves seem smarter than me in front of my SO. A will contradict themselves or back track something they said just to be in agreement with my SO. A also very often goes out of the way to talk to my SO about things in front of me that A knows I can’t contribute to like their mutual friends or movies they’ve seen that I haven’t. (Background, A and my SO knew of each other as children but have years between them age wise so they’ve never been actual friends until me.) 

Recently a reliable source told me that A was telling them how A and my SO were ‘such good friends’ before I came around, and that I have no place to find it weird for them to hang out together alone. I’m not comfortable with that at this point. I am not by any means jealous or concerned, I trust my SO completely.

997,Not the A-hole,"I (22F) took a 30 min ride in an Uber pool today. There were 3 other girls around my age. The driver was a late 30s/early 40s man.

&#x200B;

The first 15ish minutes were silent while we dropped the first 3 girls off. Almost as soon as the last one shut the door, the driver says, “where you going, baby?” I looked at him in the rearview mirror and said “excuse me?” He stammered a little bit, and said “um, so... where are you going?” (More sheepishly, I assume because he could tell I was insulted.)

&#x200B;

At this point, I realized that he wasn’t entirely fluent in English- I gave him the benefit of the doubt and softened up a little bit. I said (in a much nicer tone) “I’m just going home.” He asked the neighborhood and I told him, although I know he already knew because I could see the map on his phone. Maybe just trying to make up for making me uncomfortable; I let it go.

&#x200B;

15ish min later, my head is leaned against the window and I’m staring off into space. I’m in the back behind the driver. He looks over his shoulder at me and says, “Are you ok, baby?” I was pretty shocked that he would call me baby again after the first interaction but unsure of whether I should directly address it. After a long pause, I said “I’m ok.” He responds “ok baby.”

&#x200B;

5 min later we pull up to my drop off spot. The driver app uses audible notifications, and it gave the drop off prompt. I heard it, so I know he heard it. Before coming to a complete stop, he says, “this ok, baby?” And didn’t stop completely until I said “yup, this is good. Thanks.” He didn't move until another car pulled up.

&#x200B;

I gave the driver 1 star and reported him. There’s no option to report specifically for behavior making you uncomfortable, only unsafe, so I chose that and explained in the notes.

&#x200B;

Uber quickly emailed a pretty personalized apology. Here is a copy paste of one snippet:

&#x200B;

“Under no circumstances should a driver act in a way that makes you uncomfortable, whether that be flirting, making sexual comments, or otherwise.

&#x200B;

I will be reaching out to the driver to further investigate this matter. That being said, we will be completing a full review of their account to evaluate whether or not they will continue to have access to the Uber app going forward.”

&#x200B;

On one hand, I feel justified because EVERY single interaction I had with this man in the car included him calling me “baby"". On the other hand: I never EXPLICITLY told him not to call me that, mainly because that would have made the entire ride WAY more uncomfortable for me. This might be this man’s only source of income. And, there could have just been a language or cultural misunderstanding that I was too initially offended to consider until now.

and by in my face. He would put his face closer to mine, he would constantly get too close and once wrapped his arm around mine. He said I was his ""egg"" which I didn't understand what it meant at the time.

I constantly told him. I didn't flow that way, I didn't feel about him that way, and I don't like him that way. I try to be a very direct person, but he has been very persistant for the last month.

Well, last week was the end of it. He licked my cheek after I told him to back off and I just snapped at him. Completely screamed at him and told him to fuck off and that if he did it again I would punch him in the face.

All he said was ""You are in that stage, but once you hatch. You will understand how stupid you sound.""

This pissed me off. I didn't know what this whole egg thing was, but I found out from our mutual friend that in some trans communities ""egg hatching"" is when an ""egg"" refers to a person they believe is trans, but hasn't come out as trans yet and they start trying to coerce them into transitioning. (Called hatching/cracking eggs.) 

**READ EDIT AT BOTTOM FOR BETTER DEFINITION**

Needless to say I was livid. I freaked out at him. I told him not to contact me again. When I told our friend he was upset too. He has called me around 15 times now and I blocked his number. My discord messages are going fucking insane, and I just feel like an asshole for throwing a 3 year friendship out the window, but he just wouldn't listen. 

In our group of friends things have been sour because he has started talking to others about me, and some say I went too far and others said how I hurt him in such a difficult time in his life. I feel bad about it, but I just had to put my foot down.

Edit: in regards what Egg is

According to /u/7291 

>""It's just a trans person who doesn't realize they're trans. Usually you say it in reference to yourself. You can refer to others as eggs but there's no ""coercing"" involved usually not even telling that person. Just ""hmm.. X is totally giving me egg vibes"" or ""Y is totally an egg, we're taking bets of if they'll figure it out by next year"". The majority of the time it's more ""I can't believe when I was an egg I thought wishing since I was a kid that I had a penis was a thing all girls did"" or ""my egg cracked around January but I didn't really transition until October""

1001,Not the A-hole,"So as Im leaving the gym today, I see a girl back out of the spot next to my car. Shes in a large nissan pathfinder and mine is a 2006 corrola (nothing nice at all). Right before my eyes, she grazes the front right bumper against my driver side door. As im rushing over, she seems to be continuing backing out and totally ignoring the loud sound of metal on metal.

So when Im talking to her, i tell her to park and get out (im concerned shes fleeing). So she reparks and gets out. We check the damage, and exchange initial info and check shes okay. It really wasnt that bad a crash, but a fender bender. Im on the phone with a non-emergency police line to file a report. I know some may say its a waste of resources but ive had bad experiences with accidents in the past and for all I know i just saw her attempt to flee. Shes now on the phone with her parents, and shes a very young driver. The damage wasnt serious, it was a long sctratch/dent a foot long on the driver side door. 

Her parents get there, and they offer to pay out of pocket. I refuse and let them know ive had bad experiences in the past with drivers giving me the run around. Then the mom offers to go through insurance but tell the cops that she was driving, not her daughter. Presumably she doesnt want to pay insurance hikes for her young daughter (just got her license). But again, i refuse. From my point of view, 1. Cops are on the way 2. The young driver already was attempting to flee (appeared to atleast) 3. Ive had bad experiences with small accidents before. 4. I dont want to get caught in a lie down the road and get hosed

I totally appreciate their position and sympathise. I wanted to help them out , but the people were kinda dicks too. The daughter was crying and shaken up and the dad asked me if i threatened his daughter. Uh no? Shes just crying, why dont you ask her? And then the girls friend sneers at me and asks ""what are you staring at?""

Eventualy the cop shows and takes everyones deets. Cop tells us we dont need cops for damage less than 2000$ but in my experience this shit stacks up quick and id rather have a police report incase things get dicey down the road (my bad past experiences and all). The guy says again ""well i wish we could have handled that differently, but whatever"". Im happy with the outcome, but have a nagging feeling i was a asshole to them. I was 17 once and can totally understand their position but in my opinion their daughter made a mistake and i handled it in a way informed by my own past experiences. Was I harsh?

TLDR: New driver dents my car, a call (non-emergency) police to file a report and refuse to let the family lie and say someone else was driving. AITA?

edit: thank you for all the responses. When i checked the car this morning the damage is worse than i thought. The damage is about 2-3 feet long. The front right quarter panel is dented (probably needs to be replaced), and the drivers door may buf out but its scratched up. Im glad that I didnt lie to the police. I have an informal appointment with my insurance gal today and i will get her advice. I will explore the option of getting a quote/letting them cut a check before i go through insurance. For what its worth, my broker is a small time deal, theyre trustworthy, and were in a very small town so i trust them to make their assesment and take everyones best interests into account (including the young driver).",205,633,0.92

For the first ten years or so of my life, my father was practically non existent. (My parents were never together) He was in the military, and then in a band. He finally got his act together when I was around 11, and remarried when I was barely 13. We had a falling out shortly after that, and barely kept in touch until I was about 20. I knew he had had kids with his new wife, but never met them. We started talking more over the last two years of my life, just keeping in touch and trying to act like pals opposed to family. I finally decided I wanted to visit, so last year, I flew across the country, and stayed with my father, his wife, and their FOUR kids, all under 11 years old. 

I was supposed to stay for a week, I left on the fifth day. 

Seeing my father care so much for his other kids destroyed me. Even the little things, like helping them get ready for bed, and making them breakfast and putting their coat on before school. It made me feel so fucking useless and stupid. I never got treated that way. I never felt that type of love.  Where the fuck was my cute breakfast? Where the fuck was my Disneyland trip? What about me? 

I’m torn, because I’m honestly happy that he is finally a good father to someone, but I’m so upset that it wasn’t me. 

We still talk regularly now, under the same pretense of “pals, not family” but he feels hurt knowing that I’m not overly interested in his kids lives. I’m included in their prayers every night, they ask about me, and they want to talk, but I really have no desire to know them.

My girlfriend and John have gone out to hang out and do homework together several times after school. I was fine with this. Ome time she even went to his house and she claimed they were doing homework, but when she got back home she was still doing her homework. she was at his house for 6+ hours that day. 

That's the backstory, now, what got me angry last night.

My girlfriend told that she was going to ask John out to the sadie Hawkins dance, as I'm no longer in high school. I got upset and told her I was uncomfortable with her ASKING him. I told her I would be fine if they went together as friends but the whole ""asking"" part makes me uncomfortable.  she said AND I QUOTE,""I'm sorry you feel uncomfortable, but I'm going to ask him."" and that felt like a slap in the face to me. I got very upset, and we got into a big arguement. I want my relationship to work put but today she told me that after last night, she didnt know if she felt the same way. she said she wants to fix it but I dont know how we can.

1006,Not the A-hole,"My sister got engaged Tuesday, she's buying a house Monday, and is planning her wedding for the end of July. She also can't take any time off before the wedding. 

She asked me to help plan. I stayed on the phone for nearly 6 hours today while she was at work. She'd send me a link to a venue and say ""call them"" or ""see what they say."" I also asked a dress shop if a turn around was possible that quickly for a wedding that soon. No please or thanks but whatever. 

So there's a venue here in town and the website kinda sucks but the owner is an older guy who seems pretty nice. I swing by the joint snap some pics. I didn't have an appointment and he wasn't even there but I figured I'd take pics and send them to her. We can't look at venues this weekend because our mom is having surgery tomorrow, so I thought I'd send pics and ask if we should schedule for an appointment or just forget it if she doesn't like it. My mom rode along so she could stay in the car with my kid. She never actually saw the venue set up, just the driveway. 

Sis gets furious and says I had no right to do that, and that I have taken over planning her day without her consent, and that she finds it ironic that I'm fine looking at venues without the bride, but not okay for looking without the mom. 

I apologized for not considering that, but I also said that I felt there was a lot of ""do this, do that"" and even more of ""that doesn't line up with what I like, that's cheap"" whenever I'd make suggestions. I didn't feel appreciated, despite only wanting to help. 

I printed out all of the forms I had created for each venue, all of the emails I had sent, and all of the phone numbers. I told her this was the work I had done, she was welcome to it, and good luck. 

I feel like it was good to stick up for myself (I tend to let family and friends run me over) but I wonder... Am I the asshole? Or am I overreacting?",56,491,0.97
1007,Asshole,"Husband and I are having a moral dilemma concerning our kids. 

We have two kids (14F/16M). When they were 10 and 12 my husband and I both became vegetarians. Then last year we became vegan. We never forced our diet on them but we do talk to them about our beliefs concerning animal cruelty and animal products. They know that we’re serious about our new lifestyle and it’s not temporary.

Now our kids still eat meat when they’re at school and we’re fine with that. They know we only cook vegan dishes at home. But recently they’ve been lashing out at rules we’ve established concerning meat in the house. We don’t permit any meats or animal based foods in our house or fridge (they can eat whatever they want outside the house) but our kids think we’re being unfair to them. 

Last week my daughter had friends over and they ordered a pepperoni pizza when my husband and I were out of the house. When we got back and saw the boxes we told her she disrespected us and our rules and grounded her for 2 weeks. But now her and our son are both lashing out, calling us terrible parents and threatening to move out and live with their uncle. We don’t think we did anything wrong but I’m not sure what we could’ve done better.

1009,No A-holes here,"Ok so I was in ELA class today and were talking about culture.

We had a drill that asked ""Are you proud of your culture? Why or why not?"" I answered honestly, as I am a proud Estonian and I love my culture. I shared ti the class and said that I am proud of my culture because it is really important to me and it is interesting to learn about others.

When I said that, I got a lot of looks, mostly from the African Americans in the class. This one African American girl looked at me and stared for like 10 seconds with a very serious face. I didnt really notice why until later.

See, in ELA and Social Studies, we are talking about slavery. I presume that everybody in the class though I was talking about white history, and things like slavery, and how I was proud of it.

I asked the girl why she was staring at me, and she said ""Oh, ummm, um, I was just thinking. Yeah, I got lost in thought.""

My culture is not American, it is Estonian, and I'm pretty sure people at my school know that, as I am very open about it. Estonians have been through a lot, and with a population that knows our language of about 1.1 million (including me) I want to spread Estonian ideas.

1010,Not the A-hole,"This happened on vacation that we all took as a family a couple weeks ago.

So this was our last night, and we (my brother, my sister in law, and my sister) pooled up money and got some food from a place down the street.  I was really jonesing for shrimp (it was a tropical island vacation).  So when we get to the place, I make sure to put in for that.  No problem, a bunch of food was ordered (it was for six adults and two kids)

We get the food, bring it back, and we start digging in.  Apparently she was intending for us all to share around.  I serve up about 2/3rds of the shrimp from that box, and some rice.

At this point, she basically shrieked at me (in a manner that I've watched her do to her kids when she's pissed), and basically scolds me for being greedy.  I'm not interested in having a fight over food, so I hold back and just eat after putting some back.  

After we clean up, I find a moment to talk to her, and mention that while I don't have (much) issue with the content of what she said, that I did have issue with her scolding me like I was one of her kids (we are all in our late thirties, for reference).  She refuses to admit she did anything wrong, and starts going off about how much more she and her husband have been paying (not accurately, but I ignore the obvious bait).

I try to stay calm, but it ends with me angrily telling her that I have a mother, and she doesn't talk to me like that, and the next time, I wouldn't hold back, because apparently the only way I can get her to cut it out is to make a scene and humiliate her in public(not my finest moment)

Am I being a prick, or is it unreasonable to expect to be spoken to like an adult (I'm aware this is a loaded question, sorry.)

1011,Not the A-hole,"I have a roommate that I've had problems with, especially with the things he's been doing. At one point, he asked me to lie to his girlfriend about him cheating on her (and lie to the girls from Tinder that he brings over), hosted a party that went until 5am when I had work the next day, and stole from our supermarket right around the block. However, recently, this is what happened.

He and I live in a relatively small basement apartment unit with 3 bedrooms (another roommate not involved) and 1 living room/kitchen. We're college students. I'm not a party person, but he is. He's hosted another party before, after which, I asked him to tone it down. He agreed. However, this new party that happened two weeks ago, he invited about 30 people over, most of which were strangers either from Tinder or from other units of the apartment. I kept my door closed for the majority of the night, and at one point, I walked a drunk friend of mine home from the party. When I came back, my door was open, my bottle of Cognac was stolen, people drank my bottle of maple syrup from the pantry, people used Expo markers to draw on my bedframe, and my roommate threw up into one of my cooking pots (I bought all the kichen appliances for this apartment).

I'm not wealthy in any way, but I kindly help people wherever possible (and am generally very forgiving.) I've paid for many things for my roommate in the past, including $10 worth of chicken wings that he once stole from our nearby supermarket. The cognac, with about 33-50% remaining when it was stolen from my room with my doors closed (I explicitly told my roommate not to let anyone in), was worth $40. The maple syrup, which people opened and drank about 33-50% of (which was unopened in the pantry), $12. The whipped cream that people also emptied (which was in our refrigerator), $3. I asked my roommate to pay me back the total of $65. He asked to wait a few days until he got his paycheck. So I said yes. Over the past few days, knowing that $65 may be a lot for him, I even offered to cook and buy a few meals for him this coming week.

He got his paycheck. (This is now, as I'm writing this post.) A few minutes ago, he sends me $25. He explains to me that $65 is a lot of money and if he paid all that, he would only have $30 left for the rest of the week. I said that I can give him another week or two to fully pay all that money back. He further explained that he feels uncomfortable paying the full $65, since the bottle of cognac wasn't full when it was stolen and people didn't finish my whole bottle of maple syrup. His issue is that because the bottles weren't full, he doesn't want to pay the full $65. My issue is that he agreed this party would not go out of hand, my room got trashed, I've helped him out plenty of times before without asking for anything in return, and this isn't his first time doing something inconsiderate.

Should he or should he not pay me $65? And what other opinions do you have on this matter?",27,49,0.95
1012,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account

So I have been dating this woman, we’ll call her Jane for about 9 months up until the first week of April. 3 months after we met we decided to live together in my apartment after her lease ended, as she did not want to renew it. Everything was good for a while, no real problems, but we had never had sex once while we were together. Near the start of the relationship Jane told me she was not looking for a fling nor was she looking to settle down, which sounded exactly like what I was looking for. There were many times where I dropped hints during our time together that I wanted things to move a bit faster than they were, it felt like we were just friends at many points. Each time she would dodge the question or just say no, and initially I just thought it needed to be taken slow. However, after she had been living with me for 4 months I grew impatient. I paid for the rent in full while she would often help with groceries, gas and toiletries, but she never helped much with rent. I straight up asked her if she was even attracted to me, why was she even with me if she refused to sleep with me? She responded telling me of her early adolescence where she was occasionally abused by her elder step-brother, and because of this she was highly aversive to sex in general. I could understand that, and I had been patient, but I also had expectations that I believed I had made apparent to her, yet she made no effort to acknowledge them. So two months ago I told her I didn’t want to be together anymore, and that I would help her find another place stay. She responded by berating me for being an Apathetic person who obviously doesn’t know what it’s like to be abused ( I hadn’t been abused personally). She even told some of her/our friends, with some being more supportive of me than others. After a month of trying to help her find a place she was actively resisting trying to look for some reason. She asked that we stay together in my apartment as roommates and not lovers, to which I declined since the apartment is fairly small and we would be forced to be very close. Then at the beginning of April her friend stops by and helps her pack up to move into her place for a while, and before leaving they both sarcastically and venomously thanked me for being a typical guy who shamelessly threw out his gf when he didn’t get what he wanted.

AITA?

Edit: since I didn’t clarify on the financial aspect of the situation, I’ll mention this. I paid for the rent in full with the intent of having her gradually contribute more over time, as she had just started a new job that didn’t pay as well as her old one did when she had her own place (she is a caregiver to the elderly). She however never offered to help with rent and insisted on continuing to pay for other things instead.

Edit2: reading these comments made me want to clarify something else. I wouldn’t consider my ex to have been a leech, towards the end of her lease her job swap caused her to lose about 1/3 of her monthly income, she couldn’t renew that lease if she wanted to. I offered up my place because she was very stressed about the situation, and I gladly paid the full rent at first because I wanted to make things easier for her, and she did help with other things. I would say she paid for 1/3 of the household expenses on average. 

Final Edit: thanks for all your feedback, I have to say I really didn’t feel like the asshole in this situation but some of the things I was told by her and some friends made me feel like I could be one. I know 3 months was early to move her in but the situation was rough and it seemed like the best idea. I paid for most expenses initially bc i wanted to support my girlfriend. Prior to her moving in she told me that she would only have sex once she felt %100 comfortable, so I would drop a hint or question every few weeks to gauge her feelings. However, despite spending a lot of time together and really wanting things to work, she never overcame her aversion to sex. So I ended the relationship because I have physical needs and tried being patient, and didn’t want to live with a woman I wasn’t in a relationship with. Now I’m by myself and looking for another woman, and I’ll be certain to establish what I’m looking for clearly and early on.

TL;DR: girlfriend lives with me for several months, refuses sex despite communication and patience, is asked to move out, responds negatively.",365,530,0.83
1013,Not the A-hole,"A little context here, I was with a group of acquaintances, I had just gotten tickets to a show called ""FUN HOME"" based on the graphic novel by Allison Bechdel. A male friend in our group asked what the show was, I went on to explain it's about Bechdel's life growing up in a Funeral Home and discovering her sexuality. I mentioned he may know her from her comics, or by the famous ""Bechdel Test."" He stated he did not know either.  I began to explain the concept and origin of the test to him, but a female in the group jumped in to tell him what the Bechdel Test was.  
Since this was our conversation I simply said ""it's okay, I got this"" and I explained to him what it was and continued on talking about the show I was going to see.   
The next day I was told by another member of the group that after I left the woman I ""cut off"" was legitimately upset that I was ""mansplaining.""  
I have since apologized and felt bad that she took it that way, I was merely having a conversation with someone and wasn't even aware others were paying attention to it. But now if I say anything they say I'm mansplaining again. I'm sure it's all in jest and good natured ribbing, and I feel like explaining to a woman why what I didn't ISN'T ""mansplaining"" would COMPLETELY fall under mansplaining.  I've let it go and moved on and don't bring it up, but it still bothers me in the back of my mind. 

  
I guess my question here is 3 fold:   
Can a man actually mansplain to another man? And, was I wrong to continue my conversation, and not allow her to ""explain"" something to someone I was talking to?

1016,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone, 
First some background info. Me 22m and my gf 22f have been living together for about a year and a half now. We split cooking up between the two of us since we both enjoy it.
She is a Vegetarian and consumes almost no dairy. I respect her dietary choices ofc and will always cook something Vegetarian, we rarely have any meat in the house and i usually only get to it when we go out. I dont miss it too much and its mostly fine.

Today my Girlfriend was cooking for us and i noticed she was boiling wholegrain pasta, this is kind of a pet peeve of mine that i blame on my italian heritage and upbringing. For me a good plate of pasta is the most homely dish there is and wholegrain always leaves me disappointed. She knows this.

I then asked her if she could please not cook wholegrain for me in the future. I felt like she instantly got defensive and told me to suck it up, its still pasta and it tastes almost the same. I then asked her to please take my preference seriously as i do with hers to which whe basically said mine was less important because hers was based on ethical reasons.

I also want to add that me cooking seperate pasta is not really an option, since she gets pissed if i use more dishes than necessary because she has to do the dishes (i have eczema and im also a nurse so i have to minimize damage to my hands).

When we talked about it she mentioned that she felt i was blowing this thing out of proportion. Again i told her i just want her to respect my wishes. She said she would, if she thought they made sense. I then said thats the point, she should do that because she loves me, not because we share the opinion. 

Am i being a massive ungrateful asshole here?

EDIT: Thanks for all the insightful comments. Most people seemed to be under the impression that i use my eczema as an excuse to get out of chores. As mentioned in the comments it's a fairly recent diagnosis so i haven't been able to figure out a workaround and my doctor literally told me to avoid washing dishes.

EDIT: This is the girlfriend writing. Every now and then I have to use my boyfriend's tablet because I read papers for my uni on it. Then I noticed some comments popping up - well... 

First things first: I love my bf more than anything in the world. I'm vegetarian. I like wholegrain pasta. Maybe it's an aquired taste, but you certainly don't die if you eat it. 90% of the time I do cook normal pasta, especially when I'm making dinner for both of us. 

That particular night that my bf wrote this post, I thought I was making dinner mostly for me since he said he wanted to go to bed early and wouldn't eat much. He then took a shower while I was in the kitchen. After he was done he came to me and saw there was wholegrain pasta in the pot. He instantly started to complain. I got a little annoyed because he is always making such a big deal out of this and snapped at him that his choice to not eat wholegrain pasta cannot be compared to my choice of not eating meat. I personally like meat a lot, but I don't eat it cause I don't want animals to die for my diet when there are other options. I don't know why it escalated so quickly but I wanted to point out that I normally never make wholegrain pasta when I know that I'm making dinner for him as well. 

This was just one small incident and it was blown SO MUCH out of proportion. Gennaro, if you're reading this: I don't think you're a man baby, even though I have to admit that I was amused reading some of the comments below. I love you and I love making dinner for you. Nevertheless I will continue eating wholegrain pasta and if you want to join me, I'd be very happy cause it's better for your digestion. On the other hand: when I'm making dinner for the two of us, I will respect your preference about pasta. But please stop writing posts about our private matters. You can't explain the whole situation to strangers, there will always be something left out. I was a little hurt reading some comments saying that you shouldn't be with me anymore.",163,121,0.88

I'm completely against hyphenating. I think it's clunky and ugly, and would be a lot of syllables.

1018,Everyone Sucks,"Hi AITA. I am going to try to make this as brief as possible so I don't ramble.

&#x200B;

I dated Em for a year and a half. During this time I confided in her some personal secrets, which I don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. Because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that I am very sensitive towards.

&#x200B;

We did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. I broke up with her because I found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. Recently I found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. She basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information I shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200B;

I sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. She replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. That was the last straw for me, and I sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what Em sends me when I ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200B;

Her familly is quite religious and they lost it. Apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL:DR my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. I sent them to her family. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Well this blew up. I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:

&#x200B;

1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200B;

2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.

&#x200B;

3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200B;

4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.

&#x200B;

yeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",2140,19556,0.91
1019,Not the A-hole,"This sounds super petty. And I know it's super petty. And I'm probably being the asshole. But I really want an objective perspective.

My oldest brother Marshall and I have nothing in common. We're complete opposites and more than a decade apart in age. He lives out of state and I maybe see him once every 2 or 3 years. We don't talk. We don't even have each others' phone numbers.

My wedding is coming up and honestly inviting him never even came to mind, but then my sister asked if I needed his address and it was like ""oh... I don't know."" So I've been hemming and hawing on if I should. My mom and sister think it's a no-brainer (and my mom would literally be extremely hurt if he isn't invited bEcAuSe FAAmIlYYYY). My other brother doesn't care for Marshall either and says ""it's your day, invite who you want.""

So a few weeks ago or whatever it was ""siblings day"" and I posted a picture of me and all my brothers and sisters. Marshall must have seen it through my sister or brother being tagged and he sent a request to tag himself. So I sent him a friend request to try and break the ice and feel better about inviting him. And he declined.

That's fine I guess, and it's his right to be friends with who he wants on Facebook, but he's friends with everyone else in the family on Facebook. And it's not like we've ever argued or fought or had any issues beyond just not being similar people. 

And it's such a small thing. Like if he didn't have a Facebook I wouldn't care. But he does. And by declining the request (on top of the fact that we never talk and hardly ever see each other) it felt like ""He doesn't care about my life"". And I don't want someone who doesn't care about my life at my wedding.

1021,Not the A-hole,"I was staying at a hotel property that is “dog-friendly”. My first night was uneventful. This morning, however, was not.

At around 4:45am, a barking dog woke me. I checked, and confirmed it was coming from next door. I knocked loudly several times without an answer. So I called up the front desk, and asked if they can contact the owner. Half an hour later, the dog continued to bark. I called the front desk again and she informed me that the owner hadn’t answered. At this point I asked to speak with the manager. The manager was very apologetic and asked that I be patient while they try to contact the guest. This continued for another hour and by this time I asked the manager pointedly whether he has secondary contact information for the owner, and he said no. 

I asked for a solution and he told me very unfortunately that the hotel is fully booked, and that the only option would be to wait until guests checked out in the morning so they could move me to a different room. But that wouldn’t be until after 10 am at the earliest. He was unable to offer comps or points. By this time, a few other guests have lined up behind me asking the same thing.

I asked if he could at least check the guest room to make sure the dog isn’t incessantly barking for another reason. He refused, citing hotel policy. At that time, I let the other guests behind complain. Meanwhile, I called local PD to report a barking nuisance. The operator told me that there is a non-emergency nuisance complaint line I could use. I told her I had no idea why the dog was barking. The hotel staff refused to investigate, and I had no reason to rule out the possibility that the owner could be incapacitated due to a heart attack or a stroke, and ignoring this possibility could have fatal consequences and I wanted that on record since all calls were recorded. 

Hearing those words, the dispatcher sent officers to investigate. The PD escorted the front desk clerk and manager to the room and directed them to open it. The clerk was sobbing for unclear reasons. Inside they found the dog barking and running around without the guest and no water bowl, the toilet seat was covered. So I guess it was just freaked or thirsty. The PD gave the manager and clerk a hard time about their policy and scolded them for letting a guest leave the dog alone without any means of contact in case of emergency. 

The manager was furious with me and said calling the PD was unnecessary. I disagreed, and said the dispatcher disagreed as well. I check in to another hotel, left reviews on various review sites, and contacted corporate.

My mother has always said, ""don't you dare"" and told me it would break her heart. ""That's the name I gave you,"" she says.

Well, I'm fed up with the teasing. I'm also getting married in June, and I will be taking my fiance's last name. It seems like a perfect opportunity to change my whole name as well. Going by Rae when my full, legal name is Rachel is very bothersome, as I often wonder what name I need to give people (such as when I signed my car lease--if I put it under Rae, would that be problematic for the bank since that's not my full name?). It's flat out annoying, and it would make my life a lot easier. I would also hope it would be a great big ""fuck you"" to my family, who I love dearly, but I'm sick of hearing them tease me when I have told them why I changed my name (which is a very important part of my personal history, imo), told them to stop, and told them I would legally change my name.

I know it *would* break my mother's heart; I don't know if she would ever forgive me, but she's not listening to me. I'm sick of it. WIBTA if I just changed it anyway?

Edit: some folks are confused how/why I was bullied over “Rachel.” I was not bullied over my name and no one bullied me for the name Rachel. I was teased for other reasons and I changed my name to get away from that part of my life. I can also say I was just a weird and anxious high schooler most of the time, and I didn’t want to be that same person when I went to college, so I changed my name. It gave me some control and made me feel like I was different already. 

I also want to reiterate that I never asked my family to call me Rae and told them they didn’t have to suddenly switch to calling me something different. I just asked that they respect my decision, and IMO, they haven’t. I probably still wouldn’t ask them to call me Rae if I changed it legally, but it would give me satisfaction to know that they’re wrong. 

Thank you to everyone complimenting my name, by the way. I appreciate it. :)",121,431,0.94

1026,Not the A-hole,"We were assigned into groups for a semester long project and to complete activities every week. I'm never happy to hear the phrase ""group projects"" but it happens, whatever. In my group: we'll call them Alex, David, and Rachel. Over the semester, we went from everyone contributing equally to Rachel contributing only within 30 minutes of the submission deadline (11:59pm) if she bothered to contribute at all. We're all in a group text, we all sent each other reminders & updates on when we got our parts done. She clearly received the texts as she would acknowledge them & reply.

Which brings us to the group project:

* Friday, April 19th: We organize our project document. David decides what part he'll work on.
* Saturday: I let everyone know that my part is done. Alex & David sign off on it.
* Sunday: Alex decides his part. Rachel asks what she should handle. I tell her what each of us is working on/what is left (there's only one option of what to work on).
* Monday: Rachel asks if she should do the activity diagrams. We say yes.
* Tuesday: David has his part done. Alex and I sign off on it. David suggests some helpful resources to Rachel who says she'll look. Later, we give Rachel suggestions & we say we'd like it done by 2-3pm Thursday. We specify this because in previous weeks we've had to turn in a few assignments late because she hasn't contributed until the day after they're due.
* Thursday: Alex finishes his part. Rachel tells us she's added the activity diagram. Clearly stated in the instructions were that there should be at least 2. We take a look. It's about a railway ticketing system (nothing to do with our topic) & something about the weird image pixelation of it just gave me a feeling. I image search and find out it's straight up plagiarized from a website. David walks her through the instructions again. We tell her to let us know if she needs help. We give her the deadline to have it done by the next morning. If she doesn't, David and I will do the diagrams.

Friday, April 25th: At 10:00am, we tell Rachel we're going to submit at 12. She says okay. At 12, David & I add our diagrams, take her name off the project & submit it without her. We tell her. At 12:40, she says she has it done (again, only one diagram) & when she puts it on the document it's not even the right type of diagram. She says she doesn't care that we've submitted, she's going to put her name back on it with her wrong diagram, and resubmit it for the group. She complains in group chat that it's due at 11:59pm & she ""tried her best"" to get it done by noon & found out we submitted without her. Then she tells us if we want to talk, go tell the professor because she talked to him after class yesterday.

yesterday I ran into a new mom who had a 8 year old daughter (hannah) and a 1 year old son. 
the minute I saw hannah I knew something was up, I work with autistic kids and help diagnose people with autism. she clearly had autism. I will not go into what she had but she definitely had it. 

she was running around the place and was enjoying herself, I said to the mum, oh she must be a handful and she laughed. 

a short while later a loud noise started and hannah dropped to the floor and covered her ears. I automatically knew what to do and helped her until the noise left. 
when Hannah's mum asked me why I was so good at that I explained that I would with autistic children and this is common with them. 

she automatically got defensive and told me her daughter DOES NOT HAVE AUTISM. 
she grabbed her daughters arm and stormed off. 

the next week she came back and her daughter was throwing a tantrum because the food in her mouth did not feel good and she would not touch it. she is also quite skinny and looks super unhealthy.

1028,Not the A-hole,"So, I have some genetic problems that affect my bone marrow, blood, etc. It's not super serious currently, I just have to get labs done regularly to monitor the situation. Anyway, when I first was made aware of this condition, I was 15 and the doctor told me that I would most likely never have children without the aid of some drug which I looked up at the time and it's usually prescribed to cancer patients. Really gnarly side-effects. I just accepted that motherhood wasn't for me 11 years ago. 

This was further proved to me when I suffered a miscarriage by my ex fiance very early on. I was shocked by the pregnancy honestly. I had never been on BC because it could exacerbate my blood condition. I always assumed I was infertile, but it turns out my body is just not healthy enough to support a pregnancy to term. I didn't know how to feel about this.

Anyway, I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. Very early on in our relationship, we discussed children and I told him in no uncertain terms that I was NOT the one and I explained my health issues to him as best I could from my understanding of them.

Fast forward to recently and he tells me that he's been doing all of this research on myeloproliferative disorders and how motherhood can be possible for me, that there are new treatments available etc. He was VERY excited about it. I didn't know what to say. I guess I just accepted that I couldn't have children and that became my reality that I was okay with. 

He's been trying so hard to sell me on the idea and I finally just told him that I didn't even want kids. It got very ugly. He is upset with me because he feels I mislead him. I don't think that's fair. I told him in the beginning I was physically unable to have children, so in my mind him pursuing a relationship with me knowing that is on him. From his perspective, when I said that, he heard ""I would like children, but because of my health problems it isn't possible right now"". He thought I would be down to be a lab rat to have a child and I'm sorry, but I'm just not.

Picture of said cat.

http://imgur.com/gallery/M48fxsH

Ok, here's the situation. I've been living in my current house about 8 months. There's a cat that basically lives in the house, except no one in the house actually owns him. I figured he might be a stray, but to be sure I put a paper tag on him the next time he went out, and ended up getting in touch with his owner.

This guy told me that yes, it was his cat. I explained that he was around our place and I wasn't sure if he had an owner or if he was stray. The guy told me that it was his cat, that it came and go as it wanted and it slept there at night. I said that that was all good, and left it at that.

Here's the thing. He is talking bullshit. The cat has been living here pretty much full time for months. Over the winter he was outside in every storm we had, I let him into our house every time and he was soaked through .I've been feeding him 3 times a day, he's free to leave whenever he wants, but when he does he's back within the hour. He sleeps in my room pretty much every night. And I'm only here 8 months, this has been the case since the initial housemate got here 3 years ago.

This cat and I are homies. I pay for his food, worm him, check him for ticks and mites and I was planning on bringing him for a check up before I found out the owner existed. He waits for me outside every day when I get home from work. He literally spends all his time in our place. He sleeps on my back. He's my fucking cat.

We got served notice on our tenancy recently, and the thought of leaving this cat is breaking my fucking heart. I've tried to explain the situation to him as best he can but I can only meow in the key of Eb so I'm not sure if he understands entirely. But I know if I dont come home from work one day and he cant get into the house again he's gonna be pretty upset about.

In short, if I steal this cat, am I an asshole?

1034,Not the A-hole,"I have 13 tattoos. Mostly on my one arm and legs, but some in other places. My friend asked if I would be willing to cover them up, knowing I was probably going to get upset. I did say no, instead offering to bow out of the bridal party and help with other things she needs me to do without officially standing with her on her wedding day. She insisted that I’m important and she wants to find a solution so I’ll be in her bridal party, but she keeps going back to the coverup, which I refuse to do. 

The argument that ensued is based on two main things:
1. She’s afraid I’ll be distracting in photos and stick out from other bridesmaids. She’s VERY concerned with the photo portion of it, not that traditional family members would have to see them. I’m also allowed to have them out at the shower, rehearsal and reception. 
2. She says in any other circumstance she’d consider my feelings on the issue, but my feelings don’t matter for this because it is “her day”.

After literal hours and massive paragraph texts, we still haven’t agreed to disagree. She thinks I’m being selfish and unwilling to compromise. I offered a few solutions like standing in the back in photos or asking the photographer to photoshop them out if it really means that much to her. But if I don’t use coverup she says I’m just thinking about myself and choosing my tattoos over her wedding.

I personally think of my tattoos as part of me. They’re not like piercings I can take out or a necklace I can take off. I’d feel the same if she asked me to dye my hair or gain or lose weight. This is what I look like. If one of my closest friends doesn’t think I’m good enough as I am to stand with her as is on her wedding day, then how much does this friendship actually mean? 

So, do you think she’s being selfish and prioritizing appearances over my feelings and our friendship or am I the selfish one in refusing to use tattoo coverup for a few hours for her?",90,80,0.92

Usually I just leave and go in the lobby so I can be as reasonably loud I want but sometimes i like to just be in my room. So on days i stay in my room i think i'm not in the wrong for listening to my stuff out loud after 12 pm. It's not super loud, it' s just loud enough where i can hear it out loud but it's not obnoxious. I even walk around the room to make sure it's not loud across the room. One day she left me a note on my bed saying to keep it down but I figured to expect someone to stay completely silent until you decide to wake up is unreasonable especially if it's well into the afternoon.

Last night, my wife put our daughter to sleep in the crib in our hotel room. She then went with her mother and aunt to watch a show or something. I was tired so I said I'd stay behind. Also staying in our room is my SIL. We were both on our phones. Then, at around 10pm, a couple of dudes I met at the pool earlier knocked on our door and asked if I wanted to play billiards with them in the game room.  I asked my SIL if she was okay with staying behind with my daughter, and she said she was fine with it. I trusted her because she's a pretty mature and responsible kid. I told her not to stay up too late and call me if she needed anything.

Then I headed out with my friends. About an hour and a half later, my father in law came into the games room and saw me, he asked me who was watching my daughter. I told him that the sister was still in the room, and he got super mad at me and said I was being totally irresponsible.  He then lectured my wife too and said I was putting both her sister and her daughter at risk.

My wife defended me in front of her dad but also lectured me when we got back. She said I should be more cautious especially since we're tourists in a foreign country and our room is on the first floor and has a balcony. She asked me if I ever heard of the Madeleine McCann case, said that almost the exact same situation we were in and look what happened.

My sister (24) lives at home with my parents and I. She has no college education, hardly can hold down a job, and my parents have to drive her to work. 

She and my mom were about to leave (so my mom would take her to work) and my sister grabbed a snack pack (cheese, nuts, raisins) from the fridge. She asked if it was mine (it was) then asked if she could have it. I had just walked downstairs to grab it for myself so I saw no. She said she was taking it anyways. I said she shouldn’t have asked if she was just going to take it anyways, and she said “I haven’t eaten yet and i have to go to work.” I told her it was her fault for coming home at 3 am and not waking up until 12:30 pm (which is why she didn’t have time to eat). I also told her there were other small things that we had that she could eat that had meat in them. I’m vegetarian, so these little snack packs are great for me for a snack with protein.

She threw the snack pack at me and called me “disgusting” and “embarrassing.” I told her she shouldn’t act entitled to things that aren’t hers, and she called me heartless. 

I know it’s something small, but I’m fed up with her acting entitled to things (something she does frequently). There were also other things that she could have eaten on the go, but I couldn’t eat them because they weren’t vegetarian.

1046,No A-holes here,"Up until recently, my husband and I lived about 30 minutes away from my family. We, as a couple, would see my family about once a week for a controlled period of time (meaning we would have a meal with them or watch a game together, we  wouldn't be there for hours on end just hanging out). I would see my parents without my husband present for lunch about once every other week on top of that. About a month ago, my parents moved to be closer to my brother for reasons that aren't important to this post. They're still within driving distance and we see them about once a month.

Two months ago, my in-laws moved to the town that my husband and I live in. More specifically, they moved into a house less than 5 minutes away from us. Since then, it feels like they're constantly around. In reality, we only see them 2-3 times a week, but it feels like a lot more than that. I'll come home from work and they're at our house hanging out in our living room. They'll come over for 12 hours on a Sunday to watch TV with my husband. It feels excessive to me and it's in my house so I can't really avoid it.

The problem is that my husband loves spending time with his parents and wants to spend that much time with them. They are an extremely tight-knit family. If I ask to limit them coming over to once a week, my husband will point out that we never put a limit on how much we see my parents, which is true but we also only saw them once a week. I know how this conversation will go because we've gone through this over and over again setting other boundaries with his parents. I ask to set a boundary, then he complains that we don't have the same rule for my parents, then I point out that we've never had a reason to set that boundary with my parents because they don't do that, then he gets sulky.

I've asked my parents for their input and, while they sympathize with me, they think it would be unreasonable for me to ask to limit the visits to once a week because my husband has such a close relationship with his family. They think it would cause long term problems in our marriage. The friends I've asked about it all have different opinions, but I have noticed that the ones who support my reasoning all dislike their in-laws, so I'm sure that they're biased.

1051,No A-holes here,"My dad's name is Bert. My grandfather is Bertram. My great grandfather is Bertrand. And the naming convention repeats ad infinitum. All sons in the family get the same name or a twist on the same name. My brother is Robert (which was controversial at the time), my uncle is Bart (likewise controversial). Those who deviate like these examples have got shit for it, but nothing too serious. This ""tradition"" has been going back at least a couple of centuries.

At least my brother has a normal name that isn't too uncommon like Bert. My name? Bertamo. I could go on and on, paragraph after paragraph about why I hate my name. I always have. You cannot imagine the bullying and namecalling I've got in my life.

I'm 17. Soon I'll be 18. When that happens, I'm going to change my name to something completely unrelated. I expressed as much to my parents and I guess it got through the grapevine to the rest of my paternal family and no one is happy. My dad is indifferent but is upset I don't like the name he gave me, but my grandfather is apparently so upset I'll be written out of his will. I don't know what a career fisherman is going to leave me in his will but I think I'll be okay.

The thing is that I kind of like some tradition like this going back dozens of generations. It's just this specific tradition I think is stupid. If it was something like a pendant passed down to first sons or something like that, then fine, but I have to live with my name, on display, 24/7, for my whole life. But then again this is really the only family tradition we have. My brother is married and is already brainstorming ""Bert names"".

WIBTA for changing my name?

UPDATE: for some more context on how big of a deal the naming convention is, I replied to another comment with more info but I'll post it here too.

Whenever a new son is born, they consult a document/family tree to see if the name is already in use by a living relative, but only going linearly up. I can't have the same name as any living father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc, or any of their children. But I can share the same name as my uncle's children because it's not going directly upwards in the family tree (it's going up, and then down in a divergent path). I have over 20 Bert cousins or children of cousins to give an idea how widespread it is.

And they do have records going back to at least the 1780s. Before that we're unsure because no one kept physical evidence. The first one was a Bertrom but the story allegedly goes it was an offshoot of Bert and the real root name is Bert. *Every single son* in my father's lineage is named in this convention. At a time in the early 1900s, there were a few Bertha/Berta to start a new female tradition but it never took off.

My family justifies it by being a common denominator we can all connect by. I'm actually close to relatives that diverted from our family (but kept the naming) in the late 1800s. I'm close to family who have lived abroad for generations. We all connect by this name, so I guess it works. My family's huge on ""family"" if it's not obvious.

FWIW it's Bear-tah-moe. My mother's Italian (hence my brother is Robert, keep in mind). On my father's side it's muttville, I don't know. Our earliest recorded ancestors were from Germany, but there's a large portion from the Netherlands, and many, many, many from Newfoundland, Canada, which I guess was English at a point? Our family is large with parts in Scandinavia, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, etc.",532,2201,0.98
1052,Asshole,"So, I study medicine.

Today we were at the cafeteria, and someone said that another classmate of ours carries around a rock in a necklace, because she believes it helps her and gives her good luck. I said literally (and I said literally because it is important to state exactly what I said, given the amount of hate I received from this comment): ""*I think believing in rocks has no place in this career, and that I would rather send a patient towards a doctor that does no believe in rocks, horoscope,* even god*, that one that does*"".

And a tidal wave of hate started towards me. People saying that there is no problem believing in rocks if you can totally divorce it from the actual medical-scientific based knowledge. Another argument arose, saying that by that reasoning, no one that believes in god should study this career, because it is not evidence based.

Is it an asshole comment the one I stated?

AM I an asshole for that comment (I already apologized and I did it sincerely, because one particular friend was very very angry, but I did it thinking that maybe I said it in a wrong matter or worded it wrongly, but I didn't say it because I think im wrong). My posture; if you are studying to become a professional in the medical area, you should base what you know, and what you think you know, on evidence. Why? Because tomorrow you´ll be responsible for peoples lives. How reliable can you be on your medical knowledge if (even though very well divorced from your career) you believe a rock is going to help you? Shouldn't the things you know be in alignment with every part of your life?

In regards to the god argument, I think sincerely that I should not have said that. I do not believe in god, but it doesn't sound right to say that no doctor should believe in god. However, to me again, it sounds perfectly sound to say that a doctor should not believe in rocks, even if they are for ""personal and spiritual and intimate uses"".

1053,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

This happened a little while ago but is still causing issues in my house so I was wondering AITA

&#x200B;

Backstory:

I am at university and I went home over the Christmas break including new year leaving my housemates at the house.

When I came back I could tell my bed had been slept in, so I asked why it had been slept in and I was told my housemate stayed in my bed (for no reason).

However, as I was stripping the bed to change the sheets I saw makeup on the pillow so I knew a girl had stayed

After much argument it turned out one of his mates had slept with a girl in my bed.

I barely know his mate but he used to come over all the time and from what I have heard of their conversation, is not a pleasant character.

After I found out he had sex in my bed I told my housemate his friend was no longer welcome in the house and he had to buy me new sheets. He said he would buy me new sheets but didn't and now he wants his friend to come over.

I am still annoyed at this situation so I said he can't as he is disrespectful and brought this upon himself.

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: thank you guys for your responses! I have never posted on Reddit before so I didn't know what to expect. I really appreciate everyone taking the time to comment and give their opinion. 

I response to some comments, I understand that saying he can't have his mate over anymore may seem a bit excessive, however, it was in the moment when I found out and I was super pissed and I felt like I had to take some sort of action. It's also really upsetting as my girlfriend stays over and  I don't want her to have to sleep in those sorts of conditions. 

The awkward thing now is, do I let his mate come over and have that awkward interaction (he hasn't even reached out to apologise and I doubt he ever will) or do I just not say anything and continue how it is lol. I think I will go with the latter.

Once again, cheers guys I appreciate all feedback! 

Oh and yeah I am moving out in July and then I won't have to live with him anymore!!",50,134,0.97

1057,Not the A-hole,"So, some TW stuff in this so if it makes you uncomfortable to hear about coersion and sexual stuff just don't read.

When I was in primary school there was a rich kid there, let's call him Jack. Jack was kinda mean and rude, but everyone loved him because his dad had a lambo. 

I got bullied in school as my posts say quite a bit, but there was a period when it stopped: that was when Jack was my ""special friend"". We were at that age where kids ask questions and look things up on the web we really shouldn't, and Jack knew I had no other friends and no choice but to do as he said. 

He'd take me to the toilet and put his hand in my skirt, my shirt and would even try to touch me in class and lift my skirt. Once, he made me kneel down and have his cock in my mouth for 3 seconds in the toilets. He was a few months older and was taller and stronger, and he had given me bruises before when I was bullied. 

This lasted for a few months until he got tired of me and the bullying started again. 

Now, I'm going to go to college and he seems like a nicer person, but I'm still quite damaged from this and want to talk to my parents about it so I can feel better and get it off my chest before I become an adult for real. Even though he's changed, my parents would likely contact his or get him in trouble but I feel so confined by this and I hate how disgusting and whorish I still feel, believing it to be my fault, even though he threatened me if I didn't do as he said.

1061,Asshole,"Just an fyi: we are both guys and are both 22. 

So me and my group of friends have all made plans to go stay at a cottage next month for a weekend. I’m the main planner of this but everyone is contributing equally financially. 

There are six of us going, including one of my good friends “Ryan”.  Ryan is gay and I’ve never ever had a a problem with that. I barely ever think about it. 

Ryan and one of my other friends “Rachel” are really close and they hang out separately all the time. 

Rachel and I and a few of our other friends (Ryan wasn’t there) went out for drinks last weekend and we were all a little drunk by the end of the night. 

At one point Rachel takes me to the side and says that she needs to tell me something. She said that Ryan confessed to her that he is starting to have serious almost love like feelings for me. She said that he is really distraught about it because I’m straight and he knows I’ll never reciprocate his feelings. She made me promise not to let on that I know. 

To be honest I’m kind of freaked out by it. I don’t know if I’m comfortable having somebody there at the cottage who has such strong feelings for me. I’m considering asking him not to come on the trip. I would cover his portion of the cottage myself. 

I feel like because I am the one organizing it that I should be able to decide who I want there or not. Obviously I would talk to him about this and emphasize that maybe it’s best for both of us if we spend some time apart so he can work through his feelings for me.

He seemed interested in me though, but I wasn't certain. Over the months it became like one big friend group, and me and Tall Dude (""Isaac"") started hanging out more and more often. He did make a few passes, but nothing bad.

We became really close I think, i confided shit to him and he told me stuff too. I started to really like him, not romantically though. About a month ago I started talking with a raelly cute guy ""Brandon"", and we started hanging out more often, though usually in groups. I noticed that Isaac was never around anymore though. He didnt respond to my messages as often, and when we hung out he didn't talk much.

A week or so back me and Brandon started actually dating, and Isaac pretty much dropped off the map. He didnt block me, but he stopped texting me, he kicked me from his private Snap story, and doesnt speak to me when we hang out. He and Brandon don't get along. Brandon is cool with him, but Isaac very obviously HATES him. Like, true contempt.

He apparently thinks theres no point, since I have a boyfriend now, and that I was just wasting his time at this point.

He was dismissive when said we still were friends, and told me to go away. I sort of lashed out and told him I didn't friendzone him, HE **fuckzoned** me, and that it was really disrespectful to just throw away a friendship like this. He was really rude and sarcastic throughout, and that pissed me off even more. 

I told him he was a creep, and that he didn't value girls, and he ended the conversation by telling me off and walking away. I felt bad for blowing up on him and tried apologizing, but all my snaps were ""pending"", and I can't find his FB profile, or call him. He completely ghosted me. 

To make matters worse, some of our friends are defending him, telling me he did the right thing, and that i shouldnt force this kinda stuff.

1074,Not the A-hole,"Title self explanatory but I'll elaborate slightly: the damage happened in November, I know where the child lives, and have been chasing the parent for repairs to my vehicle for the past few months. 

Basically what happened was the child was riding their bicycle down the pavement and crossed onto the road where he collided with my motorcycle. I stopped, but the child picked up his bicycle and, after an exchange of angry words, continued to ride down the hill.

The parent insists that they aren't responsible for paying to repair the damage - which consisted of bent handlebars, chipped paintwork, scuffed exhaust, and a small crack in one of the fairings.

Right, full story: Kid is riding down the road, I'm riding up the road. Road is a 30mph limit, I'm travelling at 30. Road is an incline from my perspective, so I'm keeping the throttle at a decent idle to stick to speed - Kid is riding on a decline on a pavement - he cuts across the road, presumably thinking he'll either get in front of me, or behind me assuming that I don't react. I swerve and brake to avoid the collision, he runs into the left side of my motorbike, causing me to drop the bike on the right side. Kid pings off me and hits a parked car and is flung from the bike. As I'm picking myself up, he shouts a torrent of abuse at me and gets back on his bike and rides down the hill. Witness (a neighbor that lives opposite me, as it happens) says that him and his mated are forever cutting roads and it's a wonder none of them have been killed yet. I've asked whether she knows the kid and she pointed me to a house a few streets down. I've gone to the house and been met with an angry woman who insists that I've knocked her kid off his bike. Tried to explain the situation but she's told me to fuck off else she'll call the coppers and have me done for harassing her child. Decided to just repair the bike myself. Since then, constant arguments with the mother and (presumably) father about who is responsible for the damage. Since then, kid has been knocked off his bike and hospitalised by a car, and they're trying to sue the driver for it. 

I'm starting to think that the kid has been put up to it by the parents as a cash grab. He's evidently aware of the danger of cutting in front of vehicles, so why do it?

1076,Not the A-hole,"Okay I'm gonna start this with the preface that this is potentially the stupidest fight I've ever been in and I've made this account solely to post this here because I could really do with some third party insight to tell me if I'm missing something and being a total dick. 

I (25M) have been vegan for almost 10 years at this point. I'm not one of these people who's going to yell at you for eating animal products or join PETA or whatever, I'm just a dude who choses not to use animal products. For the past 2 years I've been with my partner (26M) who is *not* vegan, and in fact comes from a family of ardent meat eaters. 

This is where the issue arises. For as long as we've been together, I've been bringing my own food to events where his mother cooks because I know there'll be very little there that I can eat. I never make a big deal out of it and I always bring plenty so that if anyone else wants to try what I've brought, they can. His mother has never been particularly fond of me (she thinks I'm a ""goddamn hippie"" and maybe she's right), but she's never brought up the food thing until recently. About a month ago, however, she asked my partner to tell me that she finds it incredibly rude and disrespectful that I don't think she's a good enough cook to eat her food.  I told her that if she was willing to cook something I could eat then I'd be happy to eat the things she made. She called my bringing my own stuff ""snobbery"" and said that it had nothing to do with my not eating animal products and everything to do with my thinking I'm better than her (I don't).

It's caused a bit of a rift ever since. She's still insisting that I'm being a stuck up snob and that I should put my ethics aside for the sake of politeness. I'm maintaining that I haven't done anything wrong and shouldn't have to change my lifestyle to save her feelings.

I felt like some milk but when I checked the date, I had let one whole 3L bottle go off.

1079,Not the A-hole,"Hey. I (22m-French) have been going to therapy recently because of self-confidence and relationship issues, and an addiction to video games. I met a male psychologist, whose method was to let me talk to force me to put words on my thoughts and find by myself the issues they imply.

Last time (6th session), I told him I wanted to take a break from therapy, because I had a forthcoming appointment with a psychiatrist and felt a little better. I also wanted to save some money (he only took cash, 40€ per session).

I meant it when I told him this. It would only be a break. But some things convinced me otherwise:

When I said it, he seemed annoyed. He asked me why I wanted to see a psychiatrist, and I told him it was mainly a financial issue. He told me it was a shame because there were still many things that he believed I hadn’t said, and that I should come back to have them revealed to me through talking. The very fact that he welcomed my desire to take a break with such an expression of irritation made me wonder if he saw me as anything else than someone paying him.

I also asked him to tell me what he thought about all we had said, so I could be a little more informed about my situation. He didn’t answer this, apart from saying that there were still some things to say. He insisted on the fact that I should come back, but never explained me anything about what he thought my problem was or what my words said about me. He cut the session just after I told him I wanted to take a break. It had only lasted for about 25 minutes out of the usual 40.

When, last session, I talked a bit about video games, he said: “because as a teenager, you were fond of it ?“. It seemed like he had forgotten. He never took any note. It was such an essential part of my issues, and I had explained him for 10 minutes in the first session how addicted I used to be. He was talking so little that I can’t imagine he would point it out if it wasn’t because he didn’t remember.

Finally, on the 4th session, I didn’t have time to get cash, so I only paid him 20€ instead of 40. So on the 5th session, I gave him 60. Last time, when I was about to leave, and after I had paid, he told me “by the way, last time you only gave me 45”. I said I had given him 60, and he insisted. Having too much self-doubt to accuse him of lying before accusing me of having indeed given him 45€, I gave him the 11€ I had left. I thought he was being honest. But now, even though I think I *might* indeed have made a mistake, I’m pretty sure he lied to me because he wanted the extra money I wasn’t going to give him on any future appointment. Every time before seeing him, I went to an ATM and took cash only in 20€ bills. That’s why I highly doubt I could have made a mistake while paying him. I accuse him of having exploited my psychological weaknesses to get me to pay him more.

I don’t want to act out of spite, because his Google rating is what convinced me to see him. Thanks for reading.",48,193,0.94

1083,Not the A-hole,"My friends and I recently went out to dinner at a restaurant that’s quite expensive for college kids, but we decided to splurge for end of the year.

When the check comes, the waiter says the 8 of us will need to be on one bill. There’s some silence at the table, so I offer to put the charge on my card.

I’m already a bit thrown off because a few people in the party ordered appetizers that the rest of us didn’t eat, yet when calculating the they split the app evenly. (It was only a $2 difference for me so I didn’t want to make a fuss). Also, I asked everyone $1 for tax when it was actually $1 and some change to keep things simple.

But when everyone sent me their payments later, I was about $15 short. One person owed me at least $5 more and she gave it to me then but I was still left about $7 short. I went home and did the math and it ended up being that a few people were just $2 or $1 short, but it all adds up. As a college student, I could get a whole other meal for $7.

I jotted down the math and sent a pic to my friends explaining how everyone’s bill chalked up and who still owed. But honestly, they seemed a bit perturbed that I was making an ordeal out of just a few dollars.

AITA for asking for exact change? I thought I was doing a favor by putting it on my card (and honestly in the past, when someone has paid for me I always overpay them a little back if anything!)

EDIT: lots of people asking why he couldn’t split the bill. One of the guys in our group knew the restaurant owner, so we were offered a discount but the server could only apply that to one bill. Either we could all get the discount one bill, or it would only go toward one person.

1084,Not the A-hole,"Using a throw away account as sister knows my main.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me preface by saying that me and my sister are not very close. We get along fine, and I love her, but she is 7 years older and we have very different personalities (she is the ""cool"" type and I am the ""goody goody"" type). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My sister (28F) is marrying her boyfriend of 2 years in a few months. Recently she has set the plans for her bachelorette party. She wants to go out to dinner, then go to a strip club, then out to a regular club, and finally back to her house where everyone can crash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The problem for me is that I myself (21F) have a boyfriend that I have been with for 3 years. Both of us have been in full agreement from the start that we do not go to clubs without the other present, and definitely do not go to strip clubs at all. We both fully trust the other but we do not feel that the clubbing environment is appropriate for one of us to go to without the other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told her right away that I was sorry but I am not comfortable going to a strip club or to a regular club without my boyfriend out of respect for him. I told her that I would definitely go out to dinner with them, and offered to go back to her place and clean up and bake cookies for when the rest of them got back. She was not happy at all and freaked out. She said that I'm a horrible sister and need to ""get off my high horse"" and ""live for once"". She also said that I was trying to seem better than her and suggesting that she was being disrespectful to her fiancee by saying that I would not go out of respect for my boyfriend. I told her that I was sorry for coming across that way, but that I only meant that for me and my boyfriend personally, we do not go to clubs without each other, but that I think every relationship is different and I am not judging her for going. She was very angry and kept saying I was being ridiculous and prioritizing a ""silly college relationship"" over my own sister. I told her that I am firm on this and am not comfortable going to the clubs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today she texted me and told me that if I care that little about her, then maybe I shouldn't come to the wedding at all. I texted her back saying that I love and care about her, but am not comfortable going to the clubs, and that I would be very hurt if she removed me from her wedding completely over this, but that it is ultimately her decision and that I will not be changing my mind about this regardless. Other members of her bridal party have also been texting me and saying that I should just go and stop being such a prude.

These were al friends I know and trust because I don't want to risk damaging anything in the house or creating a huge mess.

1096,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I've been working food service for the last 18 years. Subway, Qdoba (chipotle), diners, to full bar fine dining, and everything in between. I have held every position from dishwasher to manager. I know these employees are overworked, often underpaid, no vacation, benefits, or sick leave. The shit we deal with day to day can be soul crushing. I know the industry and I understand the trials - and I always tip. Even on togo orders. 

So...In the last, idk, five years or so, the prevalence of the iPad POS systems has grown, if not ubiquitous. I'm talking about the kind of establishment where you walk in, order your food at a register, get given a number, sit down and someone brings you the order. While being rung up, *before* you have received any service or food, you are prompted to tip. Yes, you can always choose no tip, but there is sort of a public shaming incentive taking place as they flip the damn thing towards you and everyone waiting behind you carefully inspects your generosity...or lack there of. And really screw other people in line, I sortof feel like I'm giving the proverbial finger to the employees if I don't tip. (Not reccomend while dining out).

Anyways, that is my crux. AITA for thinking that a tip should be based on the services given *at the end* of your experience, not before I have even received my food? What if everything was terrible I and pressed the 22% button before I even sat down? I know there is a custom option usually, so I know I can just go less than whatever they reccomend, but even if I go below 20%, I feel that tinge of guilt from being in the industry for so long. Even when I was coming up, we didn't get (or ask) tips at these kinds of establishments. Usually you get paid more hourly than at a traditional sit down service joint. Alls I am saying is the point of the tip is to incentivize good service *prior* to finishing the experience. Instead, for these types of restaurants, it is simply a ""give me money"" fee upfront.

My wife and I moved into a new apartment about a year ago, and let a mutual friend move in with us (Well call him Kevin, since he's basically the Kevin from *that* Reddit thread).

 We were iffy about it at first, but felt bad for him. Kevin had a rough life at home, being used financially by his older sisters, and since he had nowhere else to go we let him move in with us. He had a decent job and he promised to be clean and respectful and pay his portion of the bills on time. 

Ill admit he always pays his dues on time. But since the day he moved in hes been nothing but an inconvenience. He's lazy, and a total slob. His bedroom and bathroom are a disaster, and he's always making messes in the living room and kitchen and leaving them for my wife and I to clean up. I'm gone up to 16 hours a day and my wife also works full time. We don't have time to clean up after him, and do our best to respectfuly remind him to clean up after himself. He typically responds by getting indignant and shitty, and will avoid talking to us for about a week or so. 

We recently found out my wife is pregnant. This means that either we need to find a bigger house, or Kevin needs to find a new place to live so we can eventually have the second bedroom for our kid. My wife has floated the different scenarios in which Kevin can still live with us. Ive tried explaining to her that this isn't feasible and that we need to tell Kevin he has to make his own arrangments. Apparently that makes me an asshole.  

Fast forward to today: we got notice today that our landlord is doing an inspection of our apartment tomorrow. My wife and i got home from work and busted our ass to get the place clean. Kevin was home so we asked him to clean his room and bathroom. He responded by giving a long sigh, closing his door and going to bed. This was the final straw for me. 

My pregnant wife shouldn't have to worry about cleaning up after this lazy shitbag. I have a very stressful career that keeps me away from home for long periods of time, and I don't have time to be cleaning up after a full grown adult. I told my wife I plan to confront him tomorrow and tell him that he's struck out, that he's exhausted us both and he gets to be gone before our baby comes towards the end of the year.

We decided about an hour before the movie started to see if there were any good seats left, and, if there were, we would go.  The theater in question has all reserved seating.  Most of the theater is stadium seating, with a few other rows in the front.  The stadium seats always sell out first, because it is hard to see from the up-close seats right in the front.  

When I pulled up the app, there was miraculously a block of three seats left in the stadium seating section!  I bought two, and off we went.  By the time we got there, the showing was listed as ""sold out"" on the theater's display.

We were a tad on the early side--people tend to show up very close to the start time of the movie at this theater because you have already booked your seats.  Unfortunately, of the 15 or so people in the theater, three of them were in our seats.  It was a mother with two young children.  And they were extremely spread out.  They had multiple large bags with them, and so much food and drink.  

We approached the woman, who was aware she was in the wrong seats.  She said she had moved because the theater seemed so empty.  I said actually, the show is sold out and people will come right at the start time of the movie.  She seemed to realize at this point that she had to move.    It took an excruciatingly long amount of time for her to gather up all her stuff and the children's food--we actually offered to help, but she declined. 

As they walked away, she explained to the children that ""these people"" made them move.  One of the children was very upset and crying.

My movie companion was very upset at me after, saying we could have gone and sat in their seats, and that it was trivial for us to move, but that they had so many things that it was a huge burden for them.  I said their seats were the highly undesirable seats at the front, and that we only decided to see the movie because there were good seats, and we decided to see the movie thinking those would be our seats.  Similarly, this woman had bought tickets knowing where her seats would be. 

We also argued over the significance of the fact that they sat in the exact three seats that showed up as available when we opened the app--there were three seats available in the stadium section one hour before the movie.  We bought two of them.  It was weird to see a party of three occupying what I know were the last set of three desirable seats in the theater.  We couldn't decide if that was significant.

Recently my mother (40s) has been single after a long relationship with my step dad. Since being single she has been going out a lot to drink and socialise. She doesn't have a job so this is the only socialising she does. She's been seeing this guy who she met while out drinking, who's in his mid 20s. From what I know they aren't serious yet but there's potential. 

This evening they had something to discuss and because this guy doesnt know my mom has kids (I'm 18f, sisters are is 16 and 10) she originally tried to meet him somewhere other than our house, but he wanted to come here, and she didn't tell him why that would be a bad idea. So instead she wanted me to make myself scarce. This is a bit difficult for me as my computer is not in my room (small house) and she sprung it on me that he was coming. I refused because I didn't think it was fair, and she wasn't telling the guy the truth about why it would be a bad idea, cause I'm sure if she did he wouldn't have wanted to anymore. 

So when he got here I stayed where I was. I didn't talk to them at all until I went up to bed. I asked my mother a question before doing so and that was the first time I said hello to this guy. He seemed fine and they got up to get something from the kitchen. It was then without thinking that I called her my mother when asking her something else before leaving. She gave me a death stare and gestured towards the guy as if saying that was a colossal fuck up. I got angry from that because I didn't think it was right that I couldn't refer to her that way just because she is choosing not to tell him she has kids.

He said this is making him suicidal & said if he dies it's my fault...Blocked him on everything & he began contacting my friends, who i told to block immediately if they received any messages from him.

I told my brother I was scared because he had violent tendencies & he gave me a pepper spray. We went outside our house so he can show me how to use it, & I saw a car outside that looked just like my now ex's, but it wasn't him & i just broke down crying because i'm so scared. I'm going to talk to campus police tomorrow to let them know my situation. I'm also worried that if he kills himself if I have any legal implications but i have screenshots of our conversations if need be...

Thank you to everyone for your kind advice, I was truly blinded by this asshole & hope you guys have partners with a healthy competitive drive <3

18F here with 18M bf. We are freshmen in college.

He is a big gamer, specifically loves League of Legends but only plays this when i'm not with him since it's time consuming. I, however, am not a gamer. The only games I've played are classic games like Pokemon, Super Mario, Mario Kart, etc just fun games that are low commitment. However, I grew up playing Tetris with my dad and it was a great way for us to bond & I got really good at it. I told my bf I grew up playing Tetris but never played with him.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I play video games with my bf & I always lose, I don't care since it's only for fun & he knows I'm not as skilled as him. We were playing Call of Duty, something he's very experienced at while I have only played it a couple times since I don't have a game system for it. As expected, I kept losing but I still had fun and overall was a good sport about it.

&#x200B;

Then I asked him if he wants to play Tetris since we both had our laptops and can easily connect to battle. He agreed, still in a good mood from demolishing me in CoD. I was excited to see his reaction since I was planning to go hard as soon as we started.

&#x200B;

We connected, the game began and I beat him in <2 minutes. I was laughing, not at him for losing but because he was surprised. But reading his face I quickly realized he was mad. He said lets go again, so we did. I beat him exactly the same way as the 1st round. He quietly started a new round, this time I felt bad & went slower, but seeing this, he force quit the game, took his laptop, and stormed off to play League. I was left there, my screen still on Tetris, just stunned he reacted this way. 

&#x200B;

He said ""I'm not gonna play against someone who's been playing for years"" & started League, knowing he's gonna leave me alone for 45 minutes (avg. time per game) just in his room. I said ""wait, you've been playing CoD for years, I can't beat you at my game once?"" He scoffed and put his soundproof headphones on as his match or whatever was starting. 

&#x200B;

I packed up my laptop & just went home without a word. He later texted, about 3 hours later with ""so no call or update with where you are or what ur doing. probably playing Tetris or something so u make sure u win.""

&#x200B;

I simply replied ""I'm just at home."" He's blown up my phone with 40+ calls that i've been dodging. AITA for beating him at a game I'm actually good at?",499,2605,0.9
1104,Not the A-hole,"Don't worry people, I am not a child abuser. Let's get that out of the way. Also, on mobile, throwaway, etc. 

My son (12)  has always been smart and done well in school, until this year. He started middle school and his grades went to shit. He failed English the first term (maybe relevant, I am an English teacher). He just hadn't been turning in reading logs despite reading every day.  When this occurred, we took away his video game privileges, and I started more closely monitoring his homework and grades via an app. He worked to bring his English grade up, and he got a Switch for xmas. 

Things seemed to be going well so I got lax about checking his homework. Then he failed science and got a D in math. Dude wants to be an ecologist.  So I went a bit nuclear and declared an indefinite moratorium on screens. He is only allowed to use his phone to text family, and he only gets tv if we are watching a family movie. No video games at all. He has to bring both grades up to at least a B to get screen time restored. If he doesn't do that by the end of the year, the moratorium will continue all summer. I have been firm about this. 

Now I am starting to feel guilty. The rest of the family has a game or show they're into, so there are times where we all are having screen time and he has nothing to do. He reads, builds with legos, and we play board games, but he's getting bored. It's finally warming up, so I have let him ride bikes with friends. And he goes to an after school program where he sees friends as well. So he's not completely isolated. But still, maybe a simple ""you're grounded for a month"" would do?

I am new to this sub and english is not my primary langage but I will do my best. I am 26 F.

My sister (24F) turned full vegan 2 years ago. I wasn't really aware of that movement and its implications. In order to understand her choices I documented myself on the subject. I agree with many things but strongly disagree with others. 

I am the only one of my family who respect her choice. But sometimes I argue with her. I favor local and I would rather eat chicken from the nearby farm than quinoa that had to travel 5000 km + to arrive in her plate.

My sister comes sometimes home and recently BBQ season started again. In order to respect my sister I got my meat from local market and went to the supermarket to get her some watermelon (delicious on BBQ) and vegan ""meat"".

She arrived, blablabla and I start getting food ready. But I put everything on the same grill and used the same dish for both food (I seperated them though).

She got a bit upset because apparently since my meat touched her food she cannot eat it now... It got a bit on my nerves but I decided to let go and offered to go back to supermarket buy more vegan food. She said it wasn't the point and I should be more careful knowing that she already make effort to support my murderer lifestyle. Usually I let that gobut this time I told her that if it was such a big effort to be in my compagny she could just go away. Which... she did.

heeem I do not know if I was wong here. Is it so much a big deal for vegan to have their food touched by meat? What do they do ont common transport when someone with leather jacket touched them?

1110,Not the A-hole,"So, I met a girl on a dating app this past weekend. Since the start of our conversations, something felt a bit... Off.

First, her profile stated that she was 26, but she said that she couldn't be out too late because of a curfew. I blew it off as maybe she lives with her overprotective parents. I planned on asking more about it on the date. 

Next, she wanted to meet up on Easter. I don't personally celebrate, but I know that most places are closed and families usually have plans. There would be almost nothing to do. 

Finally, before we decided to meet, our conversation within the app disappeared, meaning that she blocked me or temporarily deleted the app. Today, the conversation reappeared and she apologized very purfusely and asked to meet up today. She said she was ready *at that very moment*. 

At this point in sketched out as hell, but I also have a tendency to overthink things so I decided to meet up after I finished my errands.

I went to pick her up from her house and when I pulled up there was a white car with two guys in the front seat. It was about 60 degrees F and they both had on coats with their hoods pulled up, looking down and obviously avoiding eye contact and making sure to cover their faces. 

When she came up to the car I locked the doors and rolled down the window. I asked her who the guys were and she said ""They're my friends, they are just smoking."" I looked back at the car and one guy looked up and back down quickly, then closed the driver's side door, which was previously open. There was no smoke coming from the car, not a cigarette or any weed in sight. I told her it was too sketchy and I left.

1115,Not the A-hole,"There's a young family on my street. There's now three under 3 children since she just had a baby. I actually really love them, but they often come and hang out by my door and front yard. I don't mind that except that a couple weeks ago the 3 year old picked a geranium bud off my plants while I was talking to the mom and the mom just thought it was cute/ funny and didn't say anything. I didn't want to hurt the little girl's feelings, so I didn't say anything either. I was disappointed though because my geraniums have had bud worm for years and for some reason this year they are finally blooming nicely and she picked off one of the 5 new buds.

I also have a little planter of succulents that sits on concrete disk in front of my house to hide the disk. So it's basically on the ground. I noticed the other day that someone, most likely the one year old, had picked off a bunch of stems from the succulents and dropped them on the ground. The succulents are old and look kind of ratty, so I decided to touch up the round with spray paint and I bought 6 new baby succulents to replace the old ones, to freshen it up. I did this before I realized it was probably the little girl who attacked the old ones. Plants are expensive so it cost me about $22 for 6 new plants, which is a lot of money for me because I'm ill and can't work.

Now I'm paranoid that the neighbor mom is just going to let her kids attack my plants willy nilly and I'll be out the money I paid for them. I can't afford to change them out more than every 5 years or so, so these need to last. They are all baby succulents, so even picking off one leaf will make the plants look weird.

WIBTA if I put a little sign in the succulent planter saying ""please do not touch""? and a sign next to my front door asking people to please not pick the flowers? I'm sure the mom will realize it's for her. I don't want to offend her.

If I saw signs like this, I would probably think: ""who the hell puts up signs like this?"" or that the person is anal retentive and un-friendly.

However, since I can't exactly wait around for my neighbors to show up and pick flowers so I can ask the mom not to let her kids do that, a sign or two would be easier for me. They often come over when I'm not there to play with my decorations.

edit to add UPDATE: Thank you to everyone for your feedback! When I stepped outside my door a little while ago, there was a cupcake sitting there for me. I'm pretty sure it's from the mom and her little girls. They have left one for me before. It made me reflect on how lucky  I am to have this young family as neighbors. A year ago, there was this retired guy living there and he antagonized all the neighbors for years. To the point where when he put his house up for sale with pictures of the inside, we were joking that he did a great job of removing the torture chamber and all the large drums where he put the bodies. The comment from the mom who said she would be ""mortified"" if she saw a ""do not touch"" sign really stuck with me. I really don't want to hurt this mom's feelings, or the feelings of the little girls. I don't think I can go talk to them, either. I'm sort of awkward when speaking and I'm sure I wouldn't say it in a way that wasn't offensive. PLUS, I had already bought a gift for the baby and I was going to give it to them the next time I saw them, so it would be super awkward to bring up the plants. I'm heavily leaning towards just learning how to propagate my succulents so I can have a fresh supply of new ones. Instead of tossing the old ratty ones out, I'll try to start up new ones from them. If I notice the new plants or geraniums getting trashed, then I might put up a cutesy-type sign that some people suggested, with large enough print for adults to read too.

TBH I was surprised I was assigned because my colleague Joe did the research for pitching the client. Usually if you did the research you will be the one on the team.

I think I was assigned out of luck. VP did not know Joe did the research. Joe did the research for the GM, not the VP. VP had the decision power. I bumped into VP in the office the day he was deciding who to work on it. No big differences between Joe and I.  Everything about same, position, work load, competence, well liked, both want to move up, hard working. When Joe found out I was assigned, he did not say anything bad but I could tell in his reaction he was surprised. I felt bad for him.

I am in the position for some of this client’s projects I can get Joe to support working. The VP lets me decide. If I want to have Joe work on it, I can. I know Joe wants to work on it. When chatting at the office, Joe frequently asks about the client, what they are like, bring up things he remember from his research.

I decided not to have Joe. I asked a coworker more junior to work on the projects. For the skills required for project, it doesn’t matter who does it.

Joe is a little more social than me and some clients like that personality more. Joe is probably a better fit for the client. I am afraid if Joe is working on it I will be slowly phased out.

Anyway my roommate and I have been living together for about 2 years we're college students and live off campus in our own apartment.

1124,Not the A-hole,"  

I am a teenage girl living in Italy with extremely religious parents, and a now 26 week pregnant 14 year old sister.

My parents raised us with no knowledge of sex, and did everything they could to ensure that we couldn't learn about sex in school (such as removing us from school in days sex education was performed, and going as far as to remove me from class whenever I had biology in my later school years in case I got any ideas), and they never told us about it either. We were always taught that sex is for married couples who want to have children, and so the only real knowledge of sex I had was from my friends and media.

My parents think I am still a virgin despite being with my current boyfriend for two years, but this is not true. As they never found out about me having sex, I suppose my parents assumed their methods worked. However, last year, my sister (who is much braver than I was) came home to my parents and said she had a boyfriend. They got extremely angry, but knowing they couldn't really stop her seeing him without pulling her out of that school, accepted it somewhat.

My sister's boyfriend does not come from a religious background. I know his family well as I am friends with his older sister and they are very liberal.

My little sister and I share a room, and long story short, I found condoms in her pocket when I was tidying her clothes up. I asked her about it, and she told me they had been having sex for months with the condoms. I'm still pretty uneducated on sex due to my upbringing, but I have also been using condoms only for years so I - perhaps stupidly - assumed she would be fine and decided not to tell my parents. She is of age here and he is a nice boy, so I assumed it was fine.

This was a while ago, and I recently came home to a huge argument going on in my house. My parents had found out that my little sister is pregnant, and she has somehow been hiding it for all this time. My parents were going crazy at her, making her cry and simultaneously telling her she is stupid for getting pregnant but also that giving away the baby be wrong. My mother also claimed that an abortion would never be an option, to which my sister said she was too far along anyway. As far as I am aware, abortions are not permitted after the first trimester. At this point, my mother changed her mind and decided that my sister absolutely should have had an abortion. It was a huge mess in which I mainly stood aside. My mother eventually asked my opinion, and I replied:

""I think it's entirely your fault she is pregnant, you actively prevented her from knowing how to have safe sex and ultimately this child should be your responsibility, you have failed her and are abusing her for it.""

My whole family are now angry at me, and along with this I shared that I had sex at her age and the way they raised us made us deceitful. Now everyone is angry at each other apart from me and my sister, and I can't help feeling like my input made it worse.",846,10628,0.95

A can be a very nice, caring person and good listener but also selfish and entitled, especially when it comes to doing work for/with her. Also she's the type of person who will always ask for your advice but will literally do the exact opposite of what you told her.

Actual story: about two weeks ago, we were at a club (basically our entire year was there, as we are graduating soon). Until 10pm, all cocktails were 50% off. I arrived at about 9:15. A greeted me by telling me that there was no space at her table for me, but no where else either as she hadn't reserved a seat for me (thanks, I guess?). Afterwards, I immediately got in line for some drinks. A was right in front of me and at about 9:30 it was her turn to order. She ordered at least 15 cocktails. The bartender started taking her order and A was being an annoying customer. Why? While ordering A would ask what was in every single kind of cocktail and how it was made. This question-answer-game took about 5-10 minutes. Finally the bartender started making the drinks slowly.

A kept interrupting her and asking why she was doing whatever she was doing at that moment. Another 10 minutes pass and not even half the drinks are made. People in line are becoming impatient.
It's 9:45 and A looks at her watch, turns around to us and says in the most smug way possible with a grin on her face ""oh well, you guys only have 10 minutes left, you better hurry up"". Another five minutes pass. Again A turns around ""well, that'll be close for you"". At 9:58, all the drinks are made. All A had to do was pay. A and another girl decided to split the bill and started arguing about who would pay what.
9:59, they start getting their small change out. They pay all the drinks that way which takes at least another two minutes. Well, happy hour might be over, but this story sure isn't.
I decided to pull a Karen and wanted to speak to the manager, A friend and I went looking for him and we met A, who asked us what we were doing. I told her and she replied ""hm, at least I still got MY drinks, so I'm fine"" while grinning and trying to blow me a kiss. I slapped her hand away and told her to fuck off.

A later comes up to me, telling me she's sorry I'm upset but it's not her fault, The bartender was being fast and I shouldn't be mad. She then offered me one of her drinks that I could just pay her for. I refused. 
About 20 minutes later A comes to me and starts yelling at me. She thinks it's stupid that I'm upset about that, I tell her to leave, she yells that she won't unless I'm not upset anymore about something stupid like this. I lost it and also yelled at her, telling her to fuck off. She then returns to her table and loudly tells people there how dumb I am being. Later she texted me, wanting to talk.

I know that it seems strange, but it is something that I feel very strongly about.  We dont want any photos on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Including stories.  That includes photos with face filters, other people holding him, or any other photos.  We just don't want them online. Since this has been our feeling since he were born, we would really appreciate if you removed any photos of him that you have posted.  We are fine with Snapchat, but don't want them on any platforms that have permanence.  Thanks for being so loving towards Bobby and also respecting our wishes!

My wife has already gotten a text from MIL about this, and the in-laws have already told my wife ""We're going to talk smack about your husband.""  Is it too much to ask them to remove the photos they have posted already?  AITA?",42,78,0.89
1128,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my wife knows my account. TLDR at the end, I know this is long.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years now and together for 6 in total, for some context. Lately (these last 6months-ish?) she's been trying my food, picking around it, and throwing most of it away. Now I'm not a chef, and sometimes my first time cooking something can turn out horribly and be replaced with take-out, and I get those. But lately it's been just about everything I cook even if it's something I know tastes good to most people. My brother eats with us often and likes my food. 

The thing is, my wife grew up in a family with middle-eastern culture, and therefore, their food. I grew up in southwest Texas. So has always told me that my food ""has no taste"", and then will subtly eat microwave chicken strips or pizza rolls after she eats none of it at dinner time. I tried fixing this, and found recipes and recipes online and got a massive spice/herb collection in the meantime. I also learned recipes hands-on from her family. Still the same thing, ""it has no taste, but that doesn't mean I don't like it!"", then she picks around it, throws it away, and eats something from a package. 

On top of the food she is used to from growing up, she doesn't eat beans, soup/stew, brown rice, anything whole wheat, seafood, pork that isn't bacon, beef, or venison. All because she doesn't like them, not for a religous/cultural/health reason. I respected that, and over the years learned to stretch chicken breast recipes out thin, because I'm not left with much. That's fine. But now the seasoning stuff? I got tired of it. Now I'm cooking steak, brisket, seafood, whatever I feel like eating/serving to company as I please. Her family likes my food, and so does mine. She also will never request something specific, and doesn't cook.

She has noticed this I started this over the last couple weeks, and is now making remarks when I tell her what's for dinner such as ""So you're just cooking for you tonight?"" and then storming off and eventually eating the same pizza-rolls/ramen she does anyway. I always make enough for her in case she changes her mind. I've heard her complain to her friends who totally agree with her being rightfully upset. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My wife doesn't like my food, and is pretty picky as well. I got sick of it and started cooking whatever I want and leaving her to fend' for herself. Her friends think she's rightfully upset about this. AITA?",123,369,0.96

1130,Not the A-hole,"Some backstory, I'm 32 and have been married for a decade, my husband is the oldest of 6 siblings and the most responsible. His sister has relied on her boyfriend/babydaddy to provide for her even though the relationship is extremely toxic and for the past 10 years I've been a part of this family she's ""left"" him more times than I can count but this time she's supposedly serious. The problem is that she has never had a job, has no income and has 4 children. She has no car, no driver's license. She was on the list for HUD housing and when a house opened up for her and her kids she decided to turn it down and stay with her boyfriend. 

 Fast forward to yesterday, my husband and I are in the process of moving into a very small 700 square foot house that his grandparents just built and are renting out to us for 500 a month so we can save to buy a house. (Rent in my city is no less than 1200 a month for a studio apartment). We already have to get rid of a ton of things to fit in this house. It is 2 bedroom but second bedroom is the size of a large closet and is suitable for maybe a nursery or small office which is what it will be since my husband works from home as a social media marketer and graphics and web designer. An important thing to note is when the house was halfway finished we offered it to his sister and said we would stay where we were and she and the kids could take the house since she was once again wanting to leave her boyfriend and she TURNED IT DOWN because it was too small! Of course I understood because 700 square feet is small for 2 people much less 4. Her oldest is 14 and second oldest is 12 so they're not all small children.

Now that she is legitimately (or so it seems, it's a bit of the boy who cried wolf) leaving boyfriend/babydaddy she asked if she and the kids could move in with us! 7 people, 3 dogs and a cat would be living in this house if that happened and I said no. My husband said no. She keeps calling and asking why. I feel badly that she has no where to go at the moment but she has turned down government housing and the opportunity to have the house we are moving into for herself and the kids and turned it down as well. She's had 14 years to leave this guy and has chosen to not save any money, get her license, or prepare to leave him even though she has been trying to leave for years and years. 
No one in his family understands why we won't let this happen but they're also not volunteering their homes either.

1132,Not the A-hole,"This has been on my mind for a while and I figured I should ask an unbiased party, so here we go. I'll try to keep it to the point.



I've been getting unsolicited dick pics for as long as I've been on the internet. I still remember my first one, when I was 12 on Myspace when I had a freaking anime drawing as my profile pic. Hell I've even gotten several on here where my gender is ambiguous unless you go through my post history.



It used to ruin my day, but this point I'm getting used to it. I get at least one a day, sometimes a vagina is sprinkled in for a good mixture. But basically I am in an endless hurricane of weiners. For a long time, I would just report the message and move on with my life. I knew they were looking for a reaction and I wouldn't give it to them.



Then I got one from an acquaintance from high school who I knew was married and had a child. I can ignore the dick pics, but if he's screwing around on his wife who's at home with their toddler I felt like she should know. 

And when I went to his profile I realized he had all his family members listed. And lots of female ones. Grandma, mom, cousins, sisters. I bet at least all of them have gotten an unsolicited dick pic at one point. It's easy to sexually harass a random profile on the Internet, but what if it was your sister being harassed? Or your daughter? Maybe it'd make them think. Maybe it'd teach them a lesson.



So I screenshotted the message, but a little emoji over the tip of his dong, and sent it to his whole family, then blocked him. I dunno the aftermath. Frankly, I don't really care. I just hope maybe his mom or sisters tore him a new one and maybe he learned his lesson. 

This is now my go-to response to peepee pics. The perps nearly always have at least one family member listed, or have female friends tagged in the photos. And I send them a crudely censored version of the message and let karma sort itself out.



I generally don't get a response, but they almost always get seen. I've had a few girlfriends/wives tell me it's because I look like a whore. And one dad made his teenage son delete his Facebook. But that's about it. It makes me feel a little better about the sausage fest in my inbox, even it doesn't do anything. 


I mentioned on one of my social media accounts that I do this and of course I got the echo chamber of ""yassss kween 🙏"" from other girls, but one guy went against the grain and told me I'm just as bad as the guys sending the photos, because technically I am also sending unsolicited dick pics. And no grandma wants to have to see her 21 year old grandson's boner. So it started to make me think...




So, Reddit, am I the asshole for sending screenshots of dick pics to guy's families when they send me them?



Edit; I blur the entire photo or put a big eggplant emoji over the entire wazoo at this point before sending it, mostly so I have to look at the thing for as little amount of time as possible.",332,686,0.89

1135,Not the A-hole,"Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you’re thinking I didn’t say it in the way you’re thinking.

The gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don’t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend “Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.”

I shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I’m not entirely sure if it’s an actual well known exercise) 

The same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf “Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible.” Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

At this point I call her out. I said “Oi, you.” She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically “You in the purple top.” 

She turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:

Me; Do you want to fuck me?
Her: What?!
Me: I said do you want to fuck me?
Her: What the fuck is wrong with you?
Me: Well you keep staring at me, so I’m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

She went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn’t see them again.

When I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

My defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn’t talk shit if she doesn’t want called out on it.

I’ll admit that I’m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business.",1712,25459,0.85

We’ve been through a loooot together but overall we really do have a solid bond and I can see myself marrying him, I really do love him and know he loves me. We’ve both made a lot of mistakes and we’re currently trying to get over a bunch of shit that happened, and he’s trying to get over some shit he saw that happened while we were separated so I’m trying to be the perfect girlfriend right now. 

My great grandma is in a nursing home and my grandma and grandpa are trying to sell her house and go through everything in it and have a garage sale. So we all left on Monday to go to the house, and visit my great grandma and see all other family members that live here. It’s about 4 hours away and we were gonna be here for a week. It’s a *lot* of stuff to go through, as my great grandma was a hoarder, so we’ve all been tired my great grandma isn’t the friendliest person in the world so it’s all been exhausting. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m leaving to another country in a couple months and some of these family members might not be here when I come back so I enjoy seeing all of them. 

I’ve already planned on leaving earlier than everyone else because I know my boyfriend wouldn’t be happy with me being gone for so long. So I was gonna leave Thursday night (tomorrow). Also, me and my boyfriend live 5 mins away from each other and see each other every day. 

So today we were all gonna go see my great grandma and take her out to lunch. 

My boyfriend and I always have our location on for each other. Yesterday he was saying he didn’t want his on for a couple days and wouldn’t tell me why, which was fine with me cause I really don’t care. He told me not to turn mine off. 

So surprise surprise, right when all of my family leaves to go see my great grandma, he tells me he’s ten mins away from me. I didn’t believe him until he shared his location. I was in the car driving to the nursing home so I couldn’t really do anything about that, but I was really happy he came and excited to see him. 

My family and my boyfriend don’t have the best relationship. They all hate each other. So my boyfriend can’t exactly tag along. I asked him if he could wait until I was done having lunch with everyone. 

That’s when he got mad and said he wasted his time and money driving 4 hours just too see me for 45 mins. I said if he could just wait until I’m done having lunch then I could maybe talk them into letting me leave early with him. He got even more mad and sad he’s a dumbass for trying to surprise me. 

Now I’m at lunch stressed out feeling like shit but I really don’t know what I could have done differently. I had absolutely no idea he would come up here because he’s not great on money right now. He’s ignoring me. Am I the asshole?",64,68,0.9

Context: My roommates and I live on the 4th floor of this apartment building and one day for no reason the firealarm starts blaring.  I know this isn't a drill so I grab my coat and run out of the apartment, I don't want to be caught in the fire especially if it happened on the second or third floor.

&#x200B;

So, I hightail it out of my apartment and start running down the stairs and I can definitely smell smoke.  On the way down between the second and third floor staircase there's a woman with her kids walking down slowly.  I call out ""excuse me!"" as I run down the stairs, the mom doesn't care and so I run past and knock over one of her kids as I run down and outside the building.

1140,No A-holes here,"A bit of background first. My wife and I have been together for 6+ years (married for 3). Last August, she gave birth to our first, a beautiful son. Complications during the delivery forced her to have a C-section after 48 hour in labor and 3 1/2 hours of pushing. She was deeply angered and saddened by this, as she wanted to deliver as naturally as possible and his birth was anything but. 

After I returned to work, she began to spiral into a deep depression, refusing to leave the house, snapping at the littlest things, and not helping with our son after I got home from work (or helping very little). We were in a financial situation where she could afford to stay home and take care of our baby. While this was good in some ways, it also made her postpartum worse. She would go in between picking fights with family members, to kicking me and the baby out of the house for hours on end, to locking herself in the bathroom and taking long, tear-filled showers. 

She has since seen multiple therapists, been put on medication, and has vastly improved in so many ways since then. The problem is, her attitude has remained the same. I feel that she has become bitter, irritable, and developed a very short fuze, completely changing her personality from before our son was born. I have tried talking to her about this, but she always blames it on her postpartum and refuses to engage in any type of conversation without defaulting to shouting/personal attacks. 

I don't know what to do. I still love her more than words can express and I don't want to leave her. I have been up literally every single night with the baby so she can sleep uninterrupted, worked extra hours at work to keep a roof over our heads and our stomachs full, and tried to be as supportive and understanding as possible. But the lack of sleep, financial stress, working 11+ hours a day 6 days a week has made it difficult for us to connect and talk. We are now more roommates than a married couple, and I don't see how to move forward without seeming like a complete asshole.",28,51,0.88

1143,Not the A-hole,"I (27) bought a plane ticket for my brother (17). First and foremost it was to see him, but I paid extra (a lot extra) because we both agreed it would be cool to see \[**a certain superhero movie that I cannot name**\] for the first time together, especially because we're both fans of the series, bond over talking about each movie, and have never actually seen one in the theaters together. This resulted in me booking the flight relatively soon to the departure day.

I knew ahead of time there would be a Thursday night showing but since he has school Friday, I'd have to book the flight for Friday and we'd see it that same night, right after he lands. With the Thursday night showing in mind, I asked him if he was going to go see it that Thursday- if so, I’d just book the flight for May because it would have saved me a lot of money. But if he could wait until Friday, us seeing it together, both experiencing it for the first time, would be a lot of fun. Plus my brother tends to spoil shit if he sees it first. He swore he’d wait until Friday and so I booked the flight + $50 for IMAX tickets.

He told me today that he's seeing it tomorrow. I brought up to him how he had told me to he *would* wait until Friday and that I paid extra for the plane ticket in order to make that happen. He replied, ""I literally can't wait."" I’m extremely hurt that he went back on his word and that I paid extra on the flight and IMAX tickets for nothing.

I felt bad for cutting our hangout short, but I have been in need of getting shifts lately because I'm a new employee and have been working one day weeks only.

I apologized and I do realize it was an inconvenience for her to drive 20 minutes back home, but to me my job security is more important than her having to come back later when the party started. Later we got into a text argument where I again apologized and said while it was unfortunate timing, I would make the choice again and explained how I felt.

1145,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’m F/25, recently married. I’ve known my husbands parents for a long time as my husband and I have been in a relationship for 8 years. MIL/FIL and I have always gotten along great, they are wonderful people. 

The one thing I cannot stand though is documenting everything we do on Facebook/IG. I deleted all my social media accounts 4 years ago and have never been happier. I never realized how much social anxiety it caused me to have pictures of me out there/people knowing what I was doing/where I was going constantly. 

This annoyance started around our wedding. I would get back our engagement photos/bridal shower pics/wedding photos and instantly MIL would upload all of them to Facebook. This annoyed me because I am extremely picky with pictures and basically just wanted to show my parents/close friends/his family a select few of MY wedding pictures, not have our album of 100+ private wedding pictures posted online for people I don’t even know to see. MIL has quite a following and I had people texting me about the pictures that I’m not even close to, I was like WTF. 

Recently, they visited my husband and I from out of state. MIL always asks us to get in for pictures wherever we go and takes a bunch. Both husband and I are annoyed by this and we like to just be out enjoying the day, and often leave our phones at home to unplug. We went out hiking and obviously were all sweaty after a 6 hour hike. At the end, I took a few pics of her and her husband and son together because she asked me to on her phone and I don’t mind at all. They asked me to get in a few, also which was fine but I specifically asked to not be posted because #1: I run this trail very often and do NOT like people knowing my regular routes. #2 this may be selfish but I am just straight up not a fan of taking sweaty workout pics and posting for the world to see.... 

So after I made this request they joked with me “oh there going to be all over Facebook/IG etc” I laughed along and was like whatever but please don’t. They both always make fun of me that I hate pictures/social media and don’t get it because “you look great in pictures it doesn’t matter” etc.  It bugs me they don’t take me seriously even though it causes me anxiety anytime we go anywhere and I know they’ll be posting about it (mostly MIL). It’s almost as if I’m weird I don’t want to be on social media? 

Literally the next day my husband showed me at least 10 pics of us were uploaded to FB with our location/time of the hike, had 150+ likes and 30 comments. It’s not so much how I look in them as I really dislike a bunch of randos knowing where I am, what we are doing as a family and when, etc. I’m just extremely private and enjoy having my business be my business. 

Would I be the asshole to bring up this issue or do I just need to get over it?

For the first 2 years I was in Chicago and it was 2 and a half hours one way so I get that any split visitation wasn't going to happen.

The high schoolers she works with don't like their manager, he keeps their hours just below the threshold for higher pay, doesn't give promised raises, and is just an asshole to work with.

Recently my daughter and one of her friends were joking about making a union like the ones they were studying at school. They texted some of the other kids from work, and the idea started gaining traction. So I talked with them about it, explaining the possible benefits and risks. I tried to encourage them to do their own research too. I thought it was pretty cool that they were considering taking something they're learning about in history class and applying it.

The girls ended up inviting the other high school kids who worked at the coffee shop to our house, to talk about how to unionize. I could tell some kids were going along for fun. But most of them were taking it seriously. I helped them write out their demands and practice them. They even got the college kids, who were unhappy with scheduling around exams, on board. 

They all went to the coffeeshop Sunday morning, and presented their case to the boss. Who absolutely blew up on them, and told them that if they didn't stick to their schedule, they were all fired. But the kids stood their ground. He started singing out the kids that were scheduled to work that morning and telling them to start work immediately or they're fired. And so three of them got fired. Then he told the rest that anyone else who didn't report for their shifts would be fired too, and I don't think he expected them to call his bluff. He fired several more, then started demanding that the ""fired"" kids come in to work. Right now, the kids are all holding strong. Apparently the manager is trying to replace everyone fast, but isn't having much luck. 

I'm honestly quite proud of my daughter for all this. But the parents of the other high school kids aren't all OK with this. Several of them have called me up or come to speak to me furious with me for these reasons:
- Making their kid lose their job, which they were supposed to keep to teach them hard work and responsibility
- Encouraging kids to be entitled brats and sabatoge a local business owner
- Letting the kids play at something they didn't really understand

Our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. Depression hit me hard and I became an alcoholic. I willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. From then on, I strived to improve my life. I did AA, went to rehab and I've been sober for a long time now. By the time my daughter was 9, I was completely sober. I looked forward to our visits. I was really heartbroken that I didn't get much time with her. 

He remarried and I was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. But over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. She called her mom( I don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). She completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. I could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. I was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.

At her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and I only got one picture with her. I was crushed. And when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. That broke my heart. She did not contact me much after that.

I moved to a different state after that. Moved on with my life and I met an amazing man who is now my husband. We have a daughter together. I've completely moved on and I don't resent anyone. I have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. I'm content. I don't regret or resent anything. 

Recently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. She's 28 now. According to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. She fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. She's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. She apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. According to her, her mother manipulated her. 

Idk. I don't feel any connection between us now. Honestly, I've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. I don't want to open that wound ever. I don't think it will do any good for my mental health and I'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. I don't think I can or should have her back in my life. WIBTA here??

Edit: I've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. But my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. He tried to help her out but she never improved. So he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. He adviced me not to take her in. He doesn't know that she's pregnant.

Edit2: I'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. I'm not letting her stay with me for now. I have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. Thanks for all the replies.

All of the primary schools were cancelled that day, but the university did not cancel classes, only urged caution. Obviously it's something to be concerned about, but on the other hand:

* None of my other students were absent that day
* The suspect was caught before my class started
* The student emailed me after my class had ended to inform me that they wouldn't be coming due to concern

He's been with this woman for about 8 years and they have a 5 year old son together. Well, about 3 years ago she decided to call CPS on them. CPS came out and deemed the child safe in their care. They knew it was her that did it because it was pretty obvious so they decided to cut all ties with her. 

She has shown up at their house unannounced, has taken them to court for grandparent rights (lost), shown up to the child's school, and many many other overbearing things. So fast forward to now, they are in a better place and have started to communicate and everything. The grandchild has reunited with her. A couple weeks ago she asks to take the kid to a museum and her son and his girlfriend (mother of child) agree to let her have him for the day. 

She comes into work the next week saying all sorts of horrible things about the child and eventually says ""My son has ruined my grandchild and I just can't stand to be around my grandchild any more and he didn't even say thank you for taking him to the museum."" I just listen and keep my mouth shut even though it REALLY pissed me off she would say that especially after she basically stalked them for 3 years. She comes in today telling me she told her son how she felt and her son flipped out on her and wouldn't take her calls. She then asks if she was wrong in the situation and I tell her I would've reacted the same as her son. She is now pissed and wont talk to me and said ""I can't believe you would agree with a drug addict. His mind isn't right.""

1157,Not the A-hole,"A little background.

In short, I grew up as a minority in a Muslim-majority country which was a very traumatic experience for me. I worked my ass off in school to emigrate from the country I grew up. To say I was bullied and tormented throughout my childhood is an understatement. 

Because of my experiences, I can be Islamophobic unconsciously, it takes a great deal of conscious effort for me to not be Islamophobic. When I say I can be Islamophobic, I do not mean attacking, insulting or harming Muslims. Instead, I tend to avoid close interpersonal relationship with Muslims and minimize personal and professional interaction with Muslims.

About a month ago, my friends wanted to set me up with a girl that they thought would be perfect for me. She and I have plenty common interests, we share similar interests in music, movies, hobbies, etc. 

I agreed to meet her and quickly discovered she’s Muslim after our initial meeting ( I offered a meal with pork, she refused and explained why ). 
Out of respect for my friends, I had dinner with her a few more times. I definitely DID NOT lead her on by the way. I strictly told her prior to everytime we had dinner that this is simply an meal between friends, NOT a date. She seemed to agree with my sentiment.

A few days ago, she popped the question asking if we could explore something more serious. I never wanted this, so I honestly told her I would love to have her as a friend, but we’d be incompatible as partners.

She got very upset and asked why. I never told her the real reason but she sort of guessed it. She called me all sorts of names, etc.

Obviously things blew up and all of my friends know what happened. Some think I have a right to choose what’s best for me, while others think I’m an asshole for being an “Islamophobe”.

I admit I don’t want to pursue anything with her because she’s Muslim. But I never insulted her faith or her personally, I just told her we’d be incompatible.

They have 3 kids together, my brother has one with another women while the marriage and another one on the way with someone else, and a house.

I know her for so long and can't imagine her not being part of my family anymore. She is the mother of my niece and nephews and the aunt of my 2 kids.  
I declined, he threw a fit... basically he was a total asshole to her. Trying to throw her out of my family, talking bad about her, still having sex with her and keeping her hopes up. All this BS made me really sick but my SIL didn't wanted to give up on them.  
He told me that he already has a new girlfriend for half a year (my SIL didn't knew about and he had sex with both of them without them knowing) and want to bring her into the family.  
The moment we met her, he tells the whole family (my mother, my kids, my boyfriend etc) that she is pregnant and we aren't allowed to tell my SIL.  


The point is, my brother didn't wanted my SIL to know that because she was about to agree to split the house (1/3 her, rest his) and he knew she would try to take it away from him, if my SIL would find out about the girlfriend and the pregnancy.  
He always says that he didn't wanted to have another child, but impregnated his girlfriend 4(!!!) times (she lost 3 of them).  
Because he tormented my SIL so much over and over and refused to tell her the truth and forbid us to have contact with her I chose to step forward, meet my SIL (even tough my brother forbid it) and told her the truth.

-making the bed more (she didnt live with me, she just came over to my apartment occasionally)
-making more homemade meals(I do make homemade meals she doesn't like anything I have though, and I was willing to buy stuff for her but she never wanted to go with me to the store.)
-she said I was becoming less involved when were having relations
-showing more affection in public. I dont feel comfortable showing tons of affection in public.

She got her bachelors degree without going into debt because her parents helped her pay for her bachelors degree and wants to do the same for our kids.  My parents, for financial reasons, did not help any of their kids with college cost and I paid for all of mine.

I dated a girl from tinder 2 times, she told me twice she couldn't see me anymore and then came back weeks later out of the blue with texts. We had only kissed up until this point.

Date 3: She comes to my house, I have a surprise picnic and take her to the shore of lake michigan where we eat and talk and walk the sands. I drink wine, she doesn't partake. On our walk we stop upon a log and kiss. Things are going great!

When we get to my place I sit down in my red one person recliner, she approaches and sits on my lap. Our eyes meet and we begin to kiss. Things heat up and I move my hand up her short summer dress a little bit at a time until I'm touching her intimates and things are very hot and heavy. I stand up and she does as well, we move to my bedroom. 

I kiss her neck and body. I perform oral sex on her and she says first ""That feels good"" and second ""You should never not do that"" or some such that I thought was an interesting double negative. After a while she pulls me up and asks me to remove my pants.

I oblige and we have sex. In a few positions she whispers too deep and I try to adjust. After some time I ask her to get on top. She obliges and asks me two or three times ""How are you doing"" to which I stupidly reply breathlessly ""Good"" as if I'm replying to the mailman.

After a while she rolls off.

K: I think I'm going to be done

Me: Oh ok! Are you ok? 

K: I can only take so much!

Me: Ummm like physically or emotionally? (I don't know why I said this)

K: No it's just overwhelming.

I ask her several more times if I hurt her, is she ok, does she need anything ect. She says no and replies that I did nothing wrong.

She stays till 7, and makes an excuse to leave, originally having planned on staying till 9.

Once home she texts me:

K: I made it.

Me: Ok :)

K: You ok?

Me: I'm fine. You ok?

K: You didn't seem fine when I left (I was pretty bummed)

1168,Everyone Sucks,"I met my current girlfriend of 4 years while we were in grad school. We were both very physically active but were passionate about teaching. After a year of dating, we both graduated and wanted to get our Phd's. She was accepted into a very good program while I wasn’t but took a fantastic job in a different area. During that 6 month process, I felt empty and lonely while she was extremely reluctant for me to move closer. We still wrote each other letters, I would have flowers delivered to her office and we still stayed together. I felt that I was the glue holding things together while feeling confused by her reluctance. I was able to secure a work form home position with a stellar internal team at my job, so with her blessing, I packed my things and moved.

Over the next 6 months, I noticed there was still reluctance on her end. Her PDA limit on campus was zero ( it's the work place, understandable ) but the tentativeness of me being around always odd to me. Her department secretary would melt in her chair when I'd swing by asking when my gf would be out of the office so I could plant a surprise on her desk. That spring, I wanted to bring her flowers for valentines. I knew where she was teaching that day so I wanted to put the flowers in the room she would be teaching in; girls like getting flowers but girls LOVE getting flowers in front of other people. I asked a few students around if they were going to her class. One student agreed. That night, she blew a gasket and told me to never do that again. She said that I crossed the line, interacting with her students and giving her flowers while she was teaching. I was very, very confused.

That spring, I was also accepted into my own grad program at the same school. The next two years was me being tossed around by a poorly ran department while she was getting ready to graduate. I ended up being kicked out of my program for not passing their exams. Fortunately, I moved to another department.

At this point, our relationship did a complete 180. I had started focusing on my school to help give her the space but she had since started demanding less space. She has secured a job about 1.5 hours away and wants to get a place together in between our schools ( 45 minute commute for each of us ), plan our wedding ( not engaged yet ) and expresses that she's getting ""old to have kids"" on a weekly basis. Part of me thinks I should be ecstatic since this is the reciprocation I had been desiring in the past while another part of me thinks that I should focus on my PhD and that I deserve that time & space I gave her. Whenever I bring up the past, pointing out that I gave her that space in the past and that I actually would appreciate being able to finish my degree without having to plan a wedding, travel 45 minutes every day and think about having kids; that is always met with some sort of ""it was different back then"".

She is usually doesn't even wake me up before to ask, just starts it and lets that wake me up. If she woke me up to ask I could say no and easily get back to sleep, but this way makes it much harder to do that. I am always too tired to really enjoy it and am always SO tired the next day, so I asked her to stop doing that, but said we could have sex before I went to sleep more often.

I got annoyed at her this time, but she said that I should like waking up to a woman riding me, and if I didn't then I am clearly not attracted to her anymore.

You can be allergic to gelatin in general, or some red food dyes. But they're in tons of other stuff including other flavors of Jell-O.  

I didn't question the allergy and apologized several times.

I have a strong feeling that I'll be made out to be an asshole if I say no when this could easily be solved by allowing both of us to have those two days off.

1176,No A-holes here,"I have a job in an industry that puts me in a position of institutional power. I don't want to sound conceited, but basically, a lot of people vie for my time and assistance, and anything I say could potentially be construed as me abusing this power. As such, I'm always very careful not to make advances on women, both so I don't get manipulated by those desperate and unscrupulous, and so I don't seem like I'm using sex or a relationship as a quid pro quo thing for my assistance. So let it be said now that I do not go hitting on every woman I meet in the line of work, to the contrary in fact.

I was at a business conference in another city and began getting along with someone I met there. It turns out we actually live close to eachother in our home city, and she suggested we should hang out. I was open to it, and asked for her contact information: I deliberately did not ask for her number because I felt that was a bit too date-y, and suggested she find me on linkedin or twitter. We exchanged names, but ironically we both have rather weird names: my name is hard to spell (even though I was wearing a name badge at the time) and her name is a very unstandard variant of a more common name. I couldn't find her, and she never found a way to contact me so I let it go. I thought there might have been the faintest bit of romantic interest, but, again, I'm always very cautious to never pursue that in a professional capacity.

About six months after that convention I'm swiping through tinder and find that woman. She matches with me and sends me a message that she remembers me from the convention and apologizes for not looking me up sooner. I offer to take her up on her offer to check out a restaurant in the area she suggested way back when.

My issue here is, because we met, and matched, on Tinder, the thirstiest of all dating apps: am I correct in assuming that if she matched with me she is open to a romantic entanglement? It's one thing to make advances to a woman in a professional setting and come onto her where she thinks she can't say no, but is a match on Tinder necessarily consent to dating or being approached in a romantic manner?

Of course, this is highly dependent on how she keeps messaging me, and how our hang out actually goes as well, and I could simply ask her about it after we get together, but I want to know what headspace I should be in when we actually meet up.",29,210,0.91

I'm in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend for about a year now. I visited him two times and always wanted to spend as much time as possible together since this isn't often possible.  I've got family over there but I didn't visit them too much.
He keeps telling me how much he misses me and can't stand me being not with him/ wanting me to be there with him permanently. 
He also was really looking forward to meeting my family and spending time with me and them. 
A week ago he told me that he would come over to my country and I got relly exited about that cause... yay I'd be able to spend more time with him.
Yesterday he told me that two other friends of him are coming with him neither of them can stand me cause they are jealous of me and one has a crush on him. 
I already hated hearing about that but when he told me he'd be spending the majority of his time being here with them visiting other people I told him that this would make me sad. 
He replied that he couldn't please everyone and he wants to see my country together with his friends.

1179,Not the A-hole,"I work in an office where I’m one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. 
Being one of the low level staff I get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren’t anything to do with my job role. 

This has never really bothered me while I was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

I initially thought great someone to share the load of “crap jobs” with so I can focus more on my actual work. Boy was I wrong 

Whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb I was always the only option,they aren’t allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as “being a gentleman”

Which to me seems like bullshit 
I don’t expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes I can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

I’m not the strongest either and coupled with the fact I have never had any manual handling training I have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

So anyway we had our annual staff review this week and I decided to ask what the deal was and whether I could split the work. 

I first said that i felt lower than everyone else and I felt it unfair that I was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
My boss couldn’t comprehend this.
He said “you dont expect the girls to do this do you?” To which I said “yes and I find it quite sexist”

You might expect my argument to have been that they were being sexist towards women by saying they can’t do something, actually I went the other way and said they were being sexist towards me for giving me less favourable and harder jobs for being a male

To an old conservative man in England, any notion being “p.c” must be like a slap round the face and he basically laughed me out the door

This is my first post here and I am posting from my phone so bear with me.
 
My story is the following:
 
A dear childhood-friend just got out of an abusive 10 year long relationship last fall. It was pretty bad emotional abuse she had to endure from her boyfriend. They have two children together (still very little). She only just recently started to recover from it and being her usual self again. We are all glad she got out of it because we told her to get out for years and years but she wouldn’t listen and would make excuses for him. At the same time she kept complaining about him...
 
Three weeks ago she started writing with a guy online who lives far away (like really really far away). It's pretty unlikely that it would work…. I told her this and asked her how she imagined it to work out. She said she knows it's not realistic. 
 
Now she is mad at me for not being more happy for her. I told her I am happy for her but at the same time don’t want her to get hurt if it doesn't work out like she imagined. Plus that she should take things slow.
 
Am I the Asshole here for not being more happy for her?",14,27,0.91

Last monday I ran late again, and I realized that I wasn’t going to come in on time. I tried to call my boss to tell him, but he couldn’t answer. I left a voicemail and went back home and found another job (I’m starting next Monday).

My boss called me on Monday afternoon and asked me where I was, and I told him that I was running late again so I have to quit. He got mad and asked me to see him on Friday in his office.

I did what exactly he told me (albeit somewhat petty) so I have no real guilt, but I want to know what Reddit thinks of this situation. Am I the asshole of this situation?",401,914,0.93
1184,No A-holes here,"The title might be slightly misleading, but I had trouble properly articulating my situation in title format. I do care, which I will try to explain in the post. 

I have been with my girlfriend for a few years, been living together around two years. In our first few dates we discussed our respective sexual needs. Her libido is a little bit lower than mine, she asked if I was fine with it. I told her that it was not an issue, but I would be masterbating and looking at porn. I also said that I would never pressure her or make her feel guilty for sex, and I asked that she would not try to make me feel guilty about masterbating or porn. She agreed without any apparent reservations and we moved on with a happy relationship.

Just want to add some details about my habits in case someone finds it useful. I am never blatant about my porn usage to her. Normally do it before she gets home from work, or after she goes to bed, and she has never seen me do it (that I am aware of). I get that she is not thrilled about the concept, so I don't try to rub it in her face.  It has also never led to instance where I couldn't perform during a sexual encounter. My porn usage has stayed about the same, and no changes in our sex life that I am aware of. 

Now to the reason that I am making this post. Every so often the issue of porn will come up, might be on TV, news etc. Each time it does she gives me this irritated look. In addition I have an external hard drive that has a folder labeled porn, I use it for when I travel for work. The hard drive also has folders for movies, TV, books, etc, so it is not just a porn hard drive. She saw that folder and I could tell it irritated her. It has never been a fight between us, and even her irritations are few and far between. 

I am curious if I am the TA for not feeling any guilt or remorse for these irritation? I do care that it might be upsetting, so I try to always be discrete but that is all. It's just that I feel I was honest from the start, and have stuck by our arrangement.


Edit:

I think I worded this poorly. My girlfriend never really tries to guilt me, and any negative feelings she has seem to pass almost instantly. Just wondering if I am a dick for not feeling bad about those few seconds?",212,497,0.92

Today, I woke up and babysit my baby brother who has a celebral palsy and washed the dishes. Of course I'm tired and wanted a reward so I began to play with my phone. My mom woke up, began insulting me again. She told me I should just go play Mobile Legends in my whole life and that I should stop going to school. It's fucking summer why would I be studying. She took my phone while I was playing in RANK. 

Later, she's holding my baby brother and said that he is my responsibility. That I should be taking care of him. As if he is my child. Then left him with me to go play candy crush. Whenever she sees me in my phone, she goes beast mode, like I never took care of my brother everyday.

I was at a T intersection(specifically Grace Street and Wharf Road) when I completely stopped for a stop sign, rolled a bit over for visibility, and waited for cars to pass. I was there for 30, maybe 45 seconds when the examiner just told me to go, then failed me for intervention. There were no cars behind me, and I didn't feel pressured to go since the cars on the road were driving kinda buddy buddy right behind each other. He said I had 3 opportunities to go, which I complained to him later were not safe in my eyes and I wanted to be completely clear turning right into a one way street. He argued that there was enough space in between cars to just go, and said:

""Did u end up making the turn after I told you to?""
""Yes...""
""safely?""
""Yes, but only after the cars passed.""

I continued arguing with him about how letting the cars pass was the best way for me to guarantee being safe, but he just left and said ""sorry dude"". I went in and also talked to the supervisor of the DMV, who said I was being ""overly cautious"". I argued some more, but gave up. I feel super disheartened, but the way I approached the situation seemed a little immature. Just need a dose of reality.

I was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  I am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  We really hit it off right away.  We study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

Day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  I said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  He said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""This is my day, I can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" This shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

Wedding was going well and I obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but I said no.  She looked hurt and confronted me when I was getting a drink.  She said ""We were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  I really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  I said yes, and apologized and we danced.  

My dad forcibly tried to pull me off the dancefloor but i ignored him,  I got a text from my brother during the party that I was not to talk to her.

Her dad got in a car wreck when he was drunk, causing him to get fired from his job, since it was driving related. Since then they blew through all their savings and are basically living paycheck to paycheck. 

The catch is, that paycheck is my SO’s. She works 70+ hours in a part-time job, and barely gets to enjoy it, since she has to buy groceries, rent, etc. to keep her family off the streets. It’s a nice gesture, but she’s trying to save up for a car and college, while only netting $60 or so since she’s paying for everything. 

Her dad, while not working at the moment, does have money coming in. He now works at a cement laying company, and while he’s recovering from injuries related to his work, he does have a job secured, and money coming in.

So, after he left the cookies out to cool I decided that since he was going to use my things to make these, these cookies were mine.  So, while they were unattended I took them to my room.

We had a pretty strict policy of keeping everything of ours separate and prior to this had shared only when asked.

So, After reading through the responses and doing some self-reflection, I realized that I definitely overreacted to what had happened.

We had a talk today about this, basically about how I wanted us to stop this right now before we ended up in a chain of spiting each other and ruined our relationship. I talked about how crazy it drove me over him lying to me about the prank despite how much he knew I hated it. He talked to me about invading his privacy, we talked about how he was the one who wanted to keep all the items and ingredients separate and how that vanilla extract he used was very expensive.

Regardless, we both apologized and while I can't say that for certain that everything will be better I think that at the very least this is a very good sign of things to come. Thank you for being honest with me in my last posts, I really needed it.",222,250,0.91

We've been roughly on the same page so far concerning everything, but last week I found out that she doesn't want the child to have my last name. We argued about it, and we haven't talked since.

My wife and I have a beautiful marriage of nearly 20 years. She’s amazing and we get along well. She never thinks about sex, though. She will go months without ever thinking... “gee we haven’t had sex in months.”

She doesn’t dislike it. She just never thinks of it. She says that she likes to have had sex, but doesn’t particularly enjoy it at the time. Literally, any time I initiate, she will happily do it, but tbh, I don’t really wanna have sex with someone that isn’t into it. 

So... my AITA. Rather than initiate sex with my wife, who doesn’t really want it, I masturbate... usually before bed. She is completely aware of this and encourages me when she notices (mostly because it gets her off the hook). She admits to feeling guilty for going months without thinking of sex.  Of course, I tell her everything is fine, and it is. It works for us. 

But, from time to time, I enjoy 1:1 video sex via one of the sleezy cam sites. It’s fun from time to time.

... But I haven’t mentioned that I do this. 

I don’t think she would mind, but I do think that if I told her it would make her feel worse about not wanting to have sex... which would lead to her pretending to want to have sex, which is a complete turn off for me. 

Anyway...  I do this maybe 3-4 times a year for fun.

Although i wasn’t in anyway negatively vocal about the transition to my Dad and have been accepting of her choice- I would still like to call her what she fundamentally is to me- my Dad. Yet now she is saying this makes her uncomfortable and I think addressing it in my 22nd birthday card is selfish. I want to say something, and say that not calling her Dad makes me uncomfortable, but first- am I the asshole?

Edit*- Upon reading the comments thus far I can recognise how still saying Dad would be upsetting- and I will use her given name from now on. Most frustration from this situation (but not well stated/ contextualised in this post) is the means of communication to which this was articulated. I had previously called her Dad- with no sign of discomfort nor request to change and with a text message or a call it would’ve been more well received.

1207,Not the A-hole,"New Business Client (BC) joins me on a 1-week business trip. Makes it clear on Day 1 that he’s “A Christian” and I’m like, that’s great, let’s get to work. The week proceeds & he just cannot shut up about Jesus, the Bible, the Rapture, and all the while criticizing Muslims, Buddhists, etc. No matter the conversation—even in work meetings—he has to bring Jesus into it. Even pulls me aside and physically holds me and starts praying over me for business success, in the name of Jesus, which made me hugely uncomfortable. I let it slide, but towards the end of our trip, he’s getting more fanatical and aggressive, to the point of baiting me for the sake of arguing his Christian agenda. It culminates at dinner when he takes over the conversation and tells some of my other clients that they need to find Jesus. At which point I tell him flat out that he’s being inappropriate and that I don’t care what religion he is, but it’s not relevant to our work relationship or my business. He STILL attempts to testify or whatever, at which point I excuse myself from the table and leave with some of my other colleagues. 

AITA? I respect this dude’s right to religion but I’m also not interested. I find his pushiness really quite exasperating. Problem is I will likely lose business from his company.

1210,Not the A-hole,"So about a month ago I met a girl in a coffee shop. We talked for a bit, exchanged numbers, and have gotten coffee a couple of times since then and have texted and what not.

My company was offering tickets to Game 6 of the Caps/Hurricanes series in NHL hockey for extremely good value. I have recently gone through a breakup of my girlfriend of five years and I'm really starting to like this girl so I decided to invite her to the game on a date. I tried to make this pretty apparent - it was meant to be a date. She agreed and said hockey is actually one of her favorite sports. At his point I'm super excited.

Well I get to her place to pick her up for the game, and she comes out with a male ""friend"". She hops in the backseat with him and I am completely blown away. Not sure how to question her, I simply say ""I thought we were the only ones going, I only have two tickets.""

Her: ""Oh I didn't even think about it. This is my friend \*whatever\*, he wants to go too so I thought I would invite him.""

Me: ""That was nice of you, but I still only have two tickets. I can only take two people.""

Her: ""You can't find another ticket? I may have to stay home if that's the case.""

At this point I was confused and frankly outraged. She had to have known the tickets were rare and not cheap - even if I got them at a great value. I kind of lost my cool and told them both to get the fuck out of my car - just with a few more words than that.

I sped off and went to the game by myself. It was a fantastic experience, but unfortunately that encounter is literally all I could think about. I still can't believe it happened.

This morning I texted her to lose my number and blocked her. If her intent was to just bring a friend, maybe I was too harsh. That being said, I really wonder if they were actually just friends. Maybe she thought we were just friends and it wasn't actually supposed to be a date? Just sucks because I really thought she was interested in me - I sure was in her. Too good to be true I guess.


INFO: Since some of you asked for additional info regarding how I asked her and what I said specifically.

I started by asking her if she was busy on Monday (the night of the game). She said she had nothing planned. I then asked if she was interested in going to the game. My exact words were: “I can get us tickets at work if you are interested.”

She replied with “omg yes!” And thats when she told me she loved hockey. I also suggested dinner but then realized we wouldn’t have time before the game so she said we could just get food at the game. Sounds like a date to me.

As far as what I said in the car, once she said she would rather stay home than not go with her “friend”, I said “Alright then. That’s kind of shitty of you. Guess you’re not going, get the fuck out of my car.”

She laughed and they both got out and I went on my way. Nothing really more than that.

Just a massive kick to the nuts when I spent money on expensive tickets and was very excited to go with this girl just to have her basically make me go alone. It came out of nowhere and at no point in our prior get togethers did she hint that she wasn’t interested in me. I mean we had the whole night planned out pretty clearly.

EDIT: For what it’s worth, I’m thinking maybe she just lost interest in me and thought this would be an easy cop out. Tip to anyone: If you aren’t interested in someone, tell them. Had she texted me days before the game and said “Im not going to be able to go, Im just not interested. Have fun.” I would’ve said “Well that sucks, but I’m glad she was honest.” I would’ve found a friend to go with.

But to cop out like she did was brutal and just downright shitty.",2033,9635,0.9

Basically I used to bail her out of things all the time. 

The last thing I did for her was move 2000km to work for her new business because she ""couldn't find any reliable employees""

Her bf didn't like me, so she fired me and told me to move out a month earlier than we had agreed on.  

Then she blocked me on FB, found a new bff and that was that. 

2 years later, she says she misses me and wants to hang out. 

Then everytime we make plans she bails at the last minute and later I see posts of her with her new bff. 

Well this time she really messed up. Sold all her stuff, moved halfway around the world for a guy, only to realize it wasn't going to work. 

She made it back to our country but has no money and no place to live, no car. 

She asked if she could use my car or live with me. 

Legally she could live with her ex here in town because her name is on the mortgage and they could each have their own floor. 

She could live with her new bff just out of town but would need a car.

Now that I'm sober I notice how immature and self centered she is, how she's never had my back on the big things. I think she just wanted someone to drink with. 

So I told her no.

1215,Everyone Sucks,"This is a throwaway account that I made just to ask this question. The following story happened very recently.

For some context, I am a 37-year-old man. I live with my wife who is also 37. We got married two years ago.

Ever since we got married, we'd been trying to have a baby. After two years, it was becoming tiresome. It wasn't just the fact that we'd been trying for two years, it was also that we knew we were getting older and that time was running out.

**Please note that I'm a very private person**. **I don't like surprises because they make me uncomfortable.**

One day, my wife told me she wanted to have a dinner party and invite both our families and our closest friends. We don't usually host parties, but I went along with it because she was persistent, and plus, we had a good house and dining room for it. She invited both of her parents and my single father, plus our siblings and two close family friends.

Everything was going swimmingly and everyone was having fun. As we finished our meals, we lingered around the table talking. Then, my wife tapped her glass calling for everyone's attention. She stood up and told everyone the reason why she'd invited everyone there was to announce that she's pregnant. Joy filled the room at that moment. Everyone seemed excited, especially our parents. They hugged us and my father cried with joy. They all seemed to assume she had told me until I said that **I didn't know**.

**I was angry.** My wife didn't tell me she was pregnant. **I felt like I should've been the first to know.**Having a baby is a team effort and **the father is just as necessary as the mother.** By telling me with the rest of the family, it felt like I didn't matter. **I just felt like a chump because my whole family and two friends found out about MY baby the same time I did**.

Right there, I pulled my wife into our bedroom and asked her why she thought it would be a good idea not to tell me about the baby. She explained that she wanted to surprise me and for our families to witness my reaction. She also said that the manner of delivery shouldn't matter when we've been trying for so long for a child, that I shouldn't make a big deal about it and just be grateful that we'll be having a baby. She kept repeating ""*I thought you'd be HAPPY that we're having a baby!*"" until the point of tears. I couldn't believe how insensitive and selfish she was being.

I stormed out of the house in front of our guests and got a motel for the night. I dodged my wife's calls and returned the next morning. 

**My wife told me I embarrassed her, but I feel like my behavior was justified.** She told me she was worried about me, and that our families thought I was angry about the pregnancy itself rather than the manner of announcement. Our relationship hasn't been the same since.

**AITA for reacting the way I did to my wife's pregnancy announcement?**",1325,3122,0.94

1222,Not the A-hole,"Background: my girlfriend and I are looking for an apartment in downtown Toronto, Canada. It is a very competitive place to rent. Condos go up and within a week the good ones go for more than asking. A big part of the application is “credit score” - not sure if people in the USA use it, but basically it’s a number of how financially attractive you are. The numbers don’t matter, but mine is considered very good, and hers very bad. My dads is considered excellent. Her mom is our real estate agent.

So, it has come time to rent and we are having a hard time getting accepted. Our real estate agent thinks the only way we are going to have a chance is to put the application in the name of me and my dad, as opposed to me and my girlfriend. While I don’t deny that this would be a better application, it also puts 100% of the financial responsibility on me. Obviously the plan isn’t to break up, and I am certain she would pay her portion as long as we are together. But things happen, and realistically if we break up and she moves out I would be powerless to make her pay, and I cannot afford a place on my own.

When I try to explain my point of view, it’s instantly “so you’re saying my mom doesn’t know how to do her job?” Or if I point out that there is no negative for her to leave her name off the application it’s “what are you trying to accuse us of”. I’m sure you can imagine how the other 20 arguments go.

At this point I have basically just said I’m not submitting an application alone, and if we submit one it’s going to be in both of our names. Of coarse now I’m being accused of secretly wanting us to fail, and intentionally making our application less attractive.

1225,Asshole,"I had an affair with a mutual friend of my husband’s. I admit that what I did was VERY wrong and I still regret it deeply to this day.
When my ex found out I was cheating, he immediately filed for divorce. He took me to court for infidelity and demanded a paternity test, and the court had the test done on my two sons. (For clarity, I’m just going to call my two sons by their ages from now on.) The paternity results came back. Eight was his, Six was not.

In court, we ended up getting joint custody over Eight (Ex gets him one week, I get him the next), but I was granted child support payment since Ex earns more.

It’s a whole different story when it comes to Six. My ex refused custody as well as any kind of visitation with him. Since Six isn’t his, Ex has no legal obligation to pay child support for him either.

Soon after the divorce was finalized, Ex found a pretty nice house that he foreclosed on. It has a pool and a play area with a swing set and slide assembled in the backyard. 

Six still doesn’t understand why Eight gets to go to “daddy’s” house all the time while he’s never even set foot inside. 

Eight will come back from Ex’s house with new clothes and toys and won’t hesitate to brag to Six about all the fun stuff he did at Ex’s house until he cries. I tell Eight if he doesn’t stop taunting his brother, I’ll donate the clothes and toys.  

I don’t think it’s fair to Six since Ex had always been in Six’s life up until the divorce, but now he won’t even acknowledge Six when he comes to my place to pick up Eight. Won’t say a word to him, or even make eye contact. I make enough to pay the bills, but I don’t have the money to afford all the nice clothes and toys for Six like Ex is buying for Eight and I can tell he’s getting jealous of his brother. My heart breaks for Six since he has no idea why his “dad” suddenly doesn’t want anything to do with him. I’ve been trying SO hard to convince Ex not to cut Six off completely.

Ex sent me a message saying he’d “make my life hell” if I didn’t stop trying to get him to be a father to Six.

I messaged back saying it wouldn’t KILL him to at least take Six with them every now and then, but he responded with “It wouldn’t have killed YOU to have stayed loyal.”

I told him I know I made a HUGE mistake that I would kill to fix if I could and I know that he has no legal obligation to Six, but he’s the only father figure that Six has ever known, and it’s not fair to punish Six for something he had nothing to do with. 

Ex responded with: “If you want Six to have a father so badly, then why don’t you call [name of mutual friend I cheated with]? Ex KNOWS that Mutual Friend cut me off after I told him that Six was his because he doesn’t want kids. 

So AITA for wanting my ex to be at least somewhat involved in Six’s life?",109,77,0.84

1227,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account since my wife knows my name on here - long story short we've been married 8 years now and no kids because of me - there's a genetic/hereditary/whatever situation causing a low sperm count and weak swimmers among those that are there.  Despite years of trying, the old fashioned way just isn't happening.  Ever.

We've been dealing with fertility specialists for a little over 3 years now - early on we discovered the issue was with me and so about 2 years ago I went through a surgery where they removed testicular tissue in the hopes of being able to retrieve viable sperm that way.  After going through this we took some time to prepare ourselves mentally/financially for what's to come with my stuff on ice while we did that.  After meeting with various dr's and not liking what we heard we finally found a guy that seems to be a good fit for us based on our appointment yesterday.  Unfortunately, after reading the reports from my labs he has informed us that the vials they have from me are deemed ""rare/possible"" in terms of potential to retrieve sperm for an IVF treatment.  Because of the situation, we basically have 3 options

1. Attempt IVF with my stuff, spending the $$ knowing full well that there's a ""reasonable"" chance of embryo creation but no guarantees.  If this doesn't work we then move to using donor sperm costing even more dough.
2. Attempt IVF with my stuff alongside a donor sperm at the same time seeing what works and going from there.
3. Skip use of my stuff entirely & just go with a donor sperm which would allow us to use IUI instead of IVF, a much larger percent of which is covered by our insurance.

My gut is telling me it's not gonna happen with 1 or 2, that me having a kid genetically mine just isn't in the cards.  Because of this, I feel like in the long haul option 3 would be the best for us from a financial standpoint, I'd much rather have money for taking care of a kid than use it up creating one.  

Mentally however, I'm not sure how well I can deal with this - I have friends that have adopted, have seen firsthand the love their family have etc, but I just don't know deep down if I'll ever be able to look at a kid that's ""mine"" the same knowing we share zero DNA.  And what hurts me the most about this is how desperately my wife wishes to start a family.  It's the one thing I haven't been able to give her and it kills me inside.  So while my instincts are telling me to take one for the team and help her realize this dream, I question my ability to feel true love for him/her and whether it's fair to bring someone into this world not 100% sure how I'll look at them down the line.

Context:

So at the beginning of March my father passed away from a long and horrible illness (PSP if anyone is interested. Not the game console - afaik it isn’t deadly). His funeral was mid-March and my mum has had his ashes delivered. 

It was in my fathers wishes that his ashes be scattered in a local river that he loved and somewhere in his home city.

Judgement needed:

Today my mum text me to say that she is going to scatter his ashes on her own because the river meant something to her and my dad, and had nothing to do with me. I called her selfish because although I was not born locally I consider this home and would be distraught if he was ‘put to rest’ without me. I have said goodbye to him but I see this final act as closure on the grief of losing my dad. 

I feel horrendous for calling her selfish and shouting at her. I have cancelled an afternoon tea we had booked this week and told her not to come round mine for a BBQ on Sunday which was going to be for my engagement planning. But I honestly feel she is being very selfish in not including me with the justification of ‘I have been married to him for 33 years whereas you have known him for only 25+ years’ (numbers changed to protect the innocent)

As I pay for my meal, Eric starts openly mocking me for having to pay $5 for my meal. Like legit ""haha, you have to pay for lunches! That's hilarious. I get my breakfast and lunch for free!"" Eric is part of the free/subsidized meal program at the school, as evidenced by how the lunch lady rings it up. He makes a few more jabs, and his friend Grant laughs along.


I'm getting tired of this and just want to eat my pizza in peace, so I ask him, ""Are you actually bragging about your family not having enough money to feed you? If that's supposed to make me feel bad, it doesn't."" 


A couple nearby kids started laughing at  him. Eric got mad, swore at me, then walked away. Two lunch ladies started yelling at me for being rude. Apparently Eric had never realized what the free/subisized meal program was and had just assumed he won some prize for free food. Turns out he was pretty devastated by this realization and was tearing up during his next class. I guess his family had done a good job hiding their financial situation from him.


The vice principal ended up casually talking to me about the issue, saying I wasn't in any trouble but that I should think about things from his point of view and be a little more understanding of other people's financial situations. She understood I wasn't intending to make fun of Eric for being poor, but that it came off that way to him. I brought the situation up with my friends after school and they were split on whether I was being rude or if Eric deserved it.

1233,No A-holes here,"This happened a couple of years ago but I discussed it with someone recently and they insinuated that I may have been a bit of an asshole.

A girl who was in my college friend group but who I personally didn't know very well underwent a truly amazing transformation right after university. She must have lost about a hundred pounds, maybe more, with Weightwatchers. Even though I didn't know her that well, she was a really nice girl, obviously worked so hard, and totally deserves all the praise and admiration she gets as a result of her hard work. 

I kind of knew about her transformation because of Facebook at the time but how I primarily found out about it was by opening up in a national magazine in my country and seeing her ""before"" picture featured on a middle page spread about weight loss. The picture was from a college trip we took and showed her at her heaviest, but also me and a couple of my friends.

I never would have thought this would bother me if you had asked me before but I just really didn't like seeing a holiday pic of mind featured in a national magazine unexpectedly. It felt like a weird invasion of privacy. My friends felt the same and one of them mentioned how they wouldn't be surprised if she sold her story to a bunch of women's magazines too and how our faces would be everywhere. 

I decided to send her a Facebook message that I felt was really friendly. I congratulated her on her amazing achievement and told her I was so happy to see her accomplishments recognised. I said she totally should capitalise on this and share her story further to inspire others but, if she wouldn't mind, could she use a before picture that didn't include me in it, as I wasn't expecting to see my face in a magazine and it was a weird shock. 

I felt I was as fair and as positive about the whole things as possible and acknowledged that I totally understood she didn't mean anything by using that picture in the first instance. She was very nice and open in response but I could tell she was really afraid I was mad at her, which I wasn't (and I explained that!). I just didn't want it to *keep* happening. I felt if it were me I wouldn't share anyone's picture without their express permission. 

Anyway, the person I explained this to said I was being selfish because this was a huge accomplishment for her and I made it about me, which honestly wasn't my intention, but when they said that I could kind of see their point.

1234,Not enough info,"A little background: My son is four years old and has always had trouble sitting still & staying quiet at the dinner table.  We have just had him tested for ADHD (because his sister has it, but the doctor has called it “TBD” because of his age), but an assessment did determine he needs occupational therapy for some sensory issues. 

Anyway, anytime we get together with my parents and sister/B-I-L & our kids for dinner, my son is squirmy at the table.  My B-I-L always makes comments to my son (only once has he raised his voice, and I did ask him to stop). This time, he said “William, will you stop making that noise?”   Not a big deal, but it definitely causes tension. This was about three minutes after my sister said “SHHHHHHH!”  

I am not very close with my sister & B-I-L, unfortunately.  Because of this, their corrections don’t feel like they’re coming from a kind/caring place, but rather a slightly self-righteous/inconvenienced place.  (Note: I never correct their kids. They are definitely much better at the dinner table, but they’re FAR from perfect when they’re playing - lots of fighting & crying, the younger one is allowed to pee in the yard, etc.)

WIBTA for reminding them that I don’t like it when they shush (in annoyed tones) and correct my son?

A few years ago when my now wife and I were planning our wedding we decided on a destination wedding to Mexico. Before revealing the itinerary to friends and family; we made sure to make all aspects of the trip affordable (i.e. less than $700 usd) so our college age friends could attend but also provide the opportunity for those more well off to have their choice of flights, hotels, airbnbs, rental houses and food depending on what they wanted to spend. We also gave more than a year notice so those that needed to save if they wanted to attend could.

Needless to say when we sent out the announcements and details. My family lost their shit, the first comment I remember was from my own mother, saying that my wife's family should pay for my entire Hispanic extended family(45+ people which included spouses/so and kids) since they were well off ( half of the extended family regularly went to Hawaii or Europe every summer for 2 month long vacations so money wasnt truly an issue.) I ended up paying for my mother and my sisters so they could attend(this wasn't a big deal for me).

The extended family including grandparents for months called and texted about news stories they had seen about how bad Mexico was and how we should reconsider moving the wedding for safety or for their sake so it was easier to attend. This went on for months which caused a ton of friction in my own relationship with my soon to be wife. I ended up having to talk to a therapist about it and came to understand how toxic my family was being by making the wedding about themselves.

The one phone call that still bothers me was one from my grandmother saying how they were not going to be going because ""your grandfather has never had a desire to go to mexico and it's not safe to go anyways, we are tempting fate with all the violence there etc.""

The wedding came and went without a hitch or any trouble my family predicted, it was a blast and everyone that attended loved every minute of it. Afterwards I will say I did hold some resentment towards my family and had to work through it with my therapist. Their behavior did severely effect our relationship going forward but I did learn to stand alone my new family(i.e. my wife and I) were now my primary focus.

So fast forward to this year, after several weddings in the family and life moving on. A relative is now getting married for a 2nd time in a destination wedding in of all places Mexico. Cost wise this time, probably 4 to 5 times the cost to attend our wedding. This time however 75% of the family is going including my grandparents(who are now a few years older with quite a few health issues that are severe).

I haven't said anything to any of my family but I honestly feel now that I live across the country, this is the perfect reason to cut ties and never go back including when funerals happen. So reddit AITA?",26,170,0.96

1244,Asshole,"47F, my kids are 11M and 17F.  

My brother (50M) recently got married to his wife (46F) on a cruise ship.  It's a small family wedding so it was just close family invited on the ship, and then the wedding was going to be on one of the beaches where we stopped.  The other guests in attendance included the bride's parents and siblings, their kids, and the bride's and groom's kids.  My kids were also invited.

The bride's brother (42M) was pretty attractive.  I'm recently divorced so he and I started chatting and flirting.  He doesn't have kids, and was sharing a room on the ship with his father, while I shared a room with my two kids.  We wound up getting drunk and making out the first night on the cruise.  My kids didn't see, but their cousins did.  Their cousins must have been teasing my kids about it, because the next day at the buffet my daughter told me that I ""dishonored the family"" and my son barely wanted to speak to me.

Then, at the formal dinner later that night, my kids insisted on sitting with me when they saw me sitting with 42M.  I was trying to send them signals to get lost but either they purposefully ignored it or were just oblivious.

I later discovered that my son, probably in a way to ""act out"" had been assuming a Borat-type foreign persona during the entire cruise experience.  My daughter had been playing along.  Multiple people came up to me telling me how ""interesting"" my ""adopted Romanian son"" was.  Many people asked if there was anything wrong with him.  Then at the end of the cruise he broke down in tears saying that he was afraid if he started acting has himself again instead of this foreign persona, that the whole cruise would ""hate him.""  It was just a total disaster.  I also found out that my son, daughter and their cousins were riding the elevators on the cruise and smooshing their faces against the glass.  Multiple people on the cruise have complained about our kids being unruly.  I feel like they are doing this to get back at me.

Of course, now that we are back home they are still mad at me for making out with 42M.  We have continued to see each other but my kids don't approve and are embarrassed that I made out with him in public on the cruise. That said, considering our room situation, we had nowhere to go.

1245,Not the A-hole,"So it's Spring Break, I'm a senior in high school and I've got about a month left of school. I'm a pretty good kid, straight A's, relaxed and friendly with most people. So since it's spring break I have a week to relax, chill, and study for my upcoming final exams. For the past 4 years I've been waking up for school at 4 to 5 am and sleeping around 10 pm on weekdays. Horrible schedule I know, but that's just how it is. So since it's spring break and there's only a month left, I thought I'd treat myself to waking up late just for this week before going back to school. I'd wake up around 10am  but I wouldn't get ready until noon/1pm then I'd eat some food, play some games and study for a bit. However my mother thinks this is ludicrous, she's really chill and doesn't mind most things I do when I feel lazy but she's getting upset that I don't get ready early enough even though I've told her I do my responsibilities regardless of when I wake up, and to her my responsibilities is just to study and take care of my little brother, which I do. 

So today, I got out of the shower at 1pm and head to the kitchen, Im talking to my mother while she's making some food and she's just starts yelling that I don't get ready early enough, I always tell her to calm down because I don't feel as though it's a big deal, as Im just staying home all day, and generally I'm a calm and relaxed so it's my go to saying because there are better things to spend your time on than yelling. Though this does seem a bit dick-ish.

As she's been yelling at me since spring break started I got fed up, I closed the sliding glass door in the kitchen really hard and walked away, she then proceeds to raise her voice and throws bowls on the floor, I get she wants me to get ready early, and I guess I'm going to tomorrow just so she doesn't throw a fit like this again. Welcome back 5 am wake up call.

Plus I feel like I can't talk with my parents about it since they'll just present a biased view and proselytize.

I just can't believe in a God. After we've had 3 deaths in the family this year, two of which directly affected one person, and seeing all this crap that happens in the world, it really is easy to believe that there is no God at the helm of things.

My parents are really religious. They say they're fine with me being an atheist but it seems like they're not really. They always try to force me to go to church every Sunday and I've told them that I don't want to sit and praise something that doesn't exist, so they take away my internet access for the entire day. And we have to do religious activities as a family that I believe are a waste of time and aren't effective. No amount of praying hands can match two working hands.

My dad believes that atheists are stupid and misinformed (I'm a perfect example of that) and need to find the salvation of God. He thinks they just take things all out of context and make up fallacies to discredit the idea of a God. He believes that if someone took the time to study theology (I haven't yet because I'm 17) then they'll logically see that there is evidence and ways of proving God exists and that explain the things that say otherwise.

My dad once caught me reading one of my old Yahoo Answers (abandoned it long ago) questions where I took what my dad told me and asked about it (can't think for myself, I'm a total NPC) and saw the answers criticizing it, and it sparked a whole family debate over whether I should have access to the internet or not, since they believed that all I was doing was looking up atheist lies and that it's better if I don't have access to it at all. In the end they let me off with a warning.

Now I feel like I have to browse r/atheism in private or clear my history as if my parents see it then they'll disconnect my internet access entirely. So much for ""not shoving their religion down my throat"" and ""allowing me to believe what I want"".

My wife and I are looking into remodeling our kitchen and our plans involve taking a wall down and expanding. The wall itself is something that I cannot personally do on my own - it's a load-bearing wall and it happens to have vents running through that heat/cool the upstairs that would need to be re-routed. 

So I've been contacting people to do the job and responded to a craigslist post that advertised a free quote on any project. I called the company and explained the project and set up a time for someone to come by and take a look at the wall we want to take down. The next day the guy calls me and says that he doesn't feel like he could give me an accurate quote without having an architect come in first to better assess the work that would need to be done. His words were ""we need to take care of the architect first before I can give you a quote.""

So the architect comes to my house, spends about 20 minutes or so doing measurements and calculations. When he finishes he tells me that I owe him $245. Confused, I asked him what for, and he tells me that he ""doesn't work for free"". I said ""well, you just did...I never agreed to pay anything...this was advertised as a free quote.""

The architect then gets the contractor on the phone who then claims he told me there would be a charge for the architect. Apparently when he said ""we have to take care of the architect first"" that implied I would be paying him. 

So I told the architect to get the funds from the contractor since there was never an agreed upon price up front and I never signed anything that acknowledged a price. The architect tried to convince me to pay him by saying ""$245 is not a lot of money, you can just write me a check."" I refused and asked him to leave with the calculations he wrote down, which he then got annoyed and tried to guilt me into giving him something by claiming he drove out of his way to come to my house and it was an inconvenience for him to come.

All of these students were roughly 17 years old. I am a 30-year-old man.

One female student in particular would get into fights in the bathroom for calling other girls ""thots"" and making fun of them, which escalated into clothes tearing, suspensions, etc. One day, this student was gossiping about another girl who was out of the room, and that anyone with said girl should just ""hit it and quit it because she's a thot."" When I told her that it's not something she should be talking about, especially behind the girl's back, she started attacking me, saying that she and her friends get way more action than I'll ever see, and that I'm just jealous because I want to get laid.

At this point, I took her aside and told her that maybe a person's self-worth shouldn't be measured by his amount of sexual partners, and that there was a huge contradiction in her making fun of others for both sleeping around too much and also not getting laid enough. How would she feel if others talked about her and said she was easy to get with behind her back? Based on how she talked in class, it would be very easy to stereotype her that way.

This seemed to stop her behavior for awhile, but a month later, she brought it up in a disastrous way. While testing, she refused to stop talking or put her phone away, and I had to eject her from class. Upon going to the principal's office and arguing there, it led to her getting suspended. After this happened, she stormed back to my room and said, ""You think you can call me a thot and kick me out? You're gonna get your ass beat one day."" This riled up all the students, everyone started saying Mr. X called student X a thot, and the principal basically had to come and shut everything down.

I thought it ended there, but the student went home and told her mom after her suspension that I had made fun of her sexually, mom emailed principal's boss that I had done so, and it became a big thing. Principal tells me not to come into work and that ""I don't think you should be here for the rest of the year because of the situation"" and ""You should have not engaged the student and need to understand where these students are coming from."" I don't think this will affect my ability to get a normal teaching job, but I still feel rotten about it and keep wondering what I could have done differently and what went wrong.",307,848,0.92
1263,Not the A-hole,"This is almost a ""How much of an asshole would I be...?"" Because I already feel this is wrong but I don't know if it's justified.

I've recently found out that this two girls (C and M) have been manipulating me and using me: whenever they had a problem with someone or something they come to me to solve it for them and everytime I refuse to do that they start yelling at me because I have to do it because of some bullshit reason. I'm also really bad confronting people so I always end up doing what they want. 

Another thing they do is ask me to give them my exercises and that's where my problem begins.

We were doing a group project and C and M told me to kick out of the group another classmate for ""not doing his part"" when they hadn't done theirs. I told them I didn't want to because they were being too hard on him since they also had a lot to do but they said it wasn't fair because at least they were working hard and he didn't even show up. 

So I ended up talking with this guy (T) and he tells me that he is doing the exercises in his own time but he couldn't meet up with us. C and M still talked shit about him and tried to make me not trust him and kick him out but I didn't listen.

In the end T and I ended up doing most of the project because M and C didn't finish the exercises on time but, even though the project is finished, they still had to do all of them so they can study for the exam. Today after complaining so much about T being lazy and saying how hard they have been working on the project (and I doubt that) they asked me to give them all the exercises from the project and the ones we did in class.

I'm so sick of this and everything else they have done so here's what I thought: the exercises are about programming so I can change a couple of codes and the program won't work. That way if they study they'll realise something's wrong and they'll have to make their own program but if they plan to copy what I did on the exam, they'll fail.

Is this too much? Would I cross a line? I've shared this with my friend and he says it's what they deserve but my mother and my sister think I shouldn't do it. Would I be an asshole?

TL;DR: 2 classmates are manipulating me and using my exercises to study so wibta if I change the exercises so they are wrong",30,45,0.89

Yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. We had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. I really wanted to get her the ice cream. She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

When I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room.

1271,Asshole,"Let me just say this first: I am NOT victim blaming or saying that girls deserve harassment or anything of the like based on what they are wearing. I’m not saying that at all. 

So I was out on Saturday night with some friends. We were just having drinks at a pub, nothing crazy. 

At one point in the night a super attractive girl walked by and I won’t lie i stared as she walked by because she was wearing super tight jeans and a low cut top. 

One of my good female friends, who always calls me out on my bs, smacked the side of my arm and said it was gross how men stare at women when they walk by and that women aren’t pieces of meat. 

I was pretty tipsy by this point and I said that “If she didn’t want people to stare at her like that then why would she wear that outfit? I mean isn’t that the point? If she didn’t want to be stared at then maybe she should wear something else.”

My friend got super pissed at me and said that she thought that “I was better than that” and that I was victim blaming. She said that some women wear those clothes to make themselves feel better and not to get attention. 

I tried to explain that I wasn’t victim blaming at all but why else would she dress like that besides wanting people to look at her? And even if she was dressing like that to feel good about herself, she should still expect people to look. 

We went back and forth like this for a while before I had to go to the bathroom and it didn’t come up again that night. 

My friend is still pissed at me (in a more light hearted way though) and she says that I need to “change my perspective”. 

I really do get some of what she’s saying but I also think that I’m not entirely out of line on this.

1276,Everyone Sucks,"I have been seeing a woman for about 2 weeks, and on Sunday we were both drunk and had unprotected sex. We agree that this was very dumb, and we will be more adamant about condom usage in the future. Afterwards, she told me that she was not on any form of birth control, as she does not like being on hormonal BC.

&#x200B;

She tells me there is nothing to worry about because her period ended on Saturday, so her cycle makes a pregnancy very unlikely. She is also very pro-choice, and says she will get an abortion (no discussion) if it comes to that. I would agree that this is the right course of action if she does become pregnant.

&#x200B;

I thought her rationale over for a day, but it was still stressing me out. Since we were still in the 72 hour effective window, I thought Plan B was a very good idea here. The way I see it, even if a pregnancy is very unlikely, why not take actions to reduce that risk even further? Even if we are 100% agreed on getting an abortion, why not try to avoid that situation altogether? The side effects of Plan B seem pretty benign, but I cannot know for certain how they will be for her.

&#x200B;

She's taking the Plan B, but is pretty upset with me. I feel like I might have been insensitive to her right to do what she wants regarding her own health.

Edit: Some more context based on the comments.

Last night I called her after work to say I don't think her confidence around fertility cycles is well-advised and we should consider Plan B. She responded that she can understand my stress, but has no time to go to the pharmacy. I thought that was a pretty bad reason and offered to go myself and bring it to her apartment. She then said the conversation was stressing her out and we'd talk in the morning.

Early this morning she texted to ask if I still wanted her to take a Plan B. I said I think it's the best idea. I paid for it, I don't really care about the 50 dollars. I'd pay for the entire abortion if it came to that: this is my fault and I have emergency savings for a reason.

I do feel like the asshole here, because I can only read about the side effects of hormonal bc on the internet and have no real context for myself as a man. From internet sleuthing, I read most women tolerate Plan B just fine, but there are exceptions there's no certainty for her. Obviously, I don't want Plan B to become a regular form of birth control.",186,165,0.91
1277,Not the A-hole,"So I am a guidance counselor in a school district. About 2 weeks ago an email went out to staff about purchasing a t shirt to show support of a coworker who is in remission from cancer. This initial e-mail I was left off of so I had no idea this was going on and no one brought this up in passing. About a week later on the day the shirts were due to purchase a teacher came up to me and asked if I was purchasing one for 20$. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about and she quickly explained and I said I would get back to her. At this point I was confused since I dont really know this teacher and I have no idea what the money was going towards or the purpose. I meant to ask around but I got busy with work and it slipped my mind.

The other day everyone wore their t-shirts to support this teacher which was about 70 staff. I was one of only five or so who did not have a t-shirt so obviously did not wear one. I did not know there was an event to wear it on the same day since it was part of the initial email. I got a few comments that day from other staff for not participating in this event. So AITA for not participating in an event I only knew the day of purchase.

1278,Not the A-hole,"I'm really new to Reddit. I heard about this sub through YouTube and thought it'd be a good place to go to help resolve this. Apologies if anything is wrong re: formatting etc. 

I'm a bi dude in a relationship with another dude. We've both got kids from prior relationships, one of whom is my 9 year old son of whom we have custody. His mother is a deadbeat who neglected him pretty severely and ultimately chose her party lifestyle and toxic relationship over her child. He's 9 years old now, has lived with us full time since he was 4 and his mother hasn't even attempted to make contact since he was 5. Of his own volition, he began calling my partner ""Dad"" a couple of years ago and now tells people he doesn't have a mum. 

One of our neighbours is very conservative, and has made it plain in the past that she doesn't approve of our family unit. She's rarely overtly unpleasant these days, but she makes annoying subtle comments to our kids that have been rubbing me the wrong way for a while. For instance, if 9yo refers to my partner as his dad, or my partner's kid as his brother, she'll make a point to correct him like ""you mean *step*dad"" or ""*step*brother"". I politely asked her if she wouldn't mind stopping that because, not only do I loathe what she's implying, it really upsets my boy. She's argued this with me saying it's not right for a child to have two fathers and I'm poisoning my kid by allowing him to think so. 

The final straw came a week or so ago when she overheard my boy explaining to another kid that he doesn't have a mum. She went on something of a rant about it, saying my son *does* have a mum and that everyone has to have a mum and a dad because having two of one of them is wrong ethically and biologically impossible anyway etc. My 9yo came running home bawling his little eyes out and I was reliably informed of what was said by another neighbour who stepped in to tell this chick to fuckin stop. I went over there and essentially just yelled at her that she's a fucking disgusting bigot and that she has no business being near kids if she's going to try and force her shitty dogma on them and that I never want to catch her talking to any of my kids ever again. 

Now I appreciate that I lost my cool and that yelling at her wasn't the best course of action but I was seething because she made my boy cry like that. However, she's recently started chatting to other neighbours saying *I'm* the bigot for not allowing her to express her views, claiming I'm trying to impede on her right to free speech and that I as a man had no right to ""threaten"" a woman (to be clear I did not threaten her directly, just told her I don't want to see her speaking to my children). For the most part my neighbours agree with me that she's fucking cuckoo but a couple of them have told me that she's right that she should be able to have her opinion and express it however and to whomever she wants.

1281,Not the A-hole,"So, about a year ago, my now former friend offered me a job at this retail store. I was struggling to find work because I live in a big city and despite having a degree, job prospects are quite low. I accepted, but quickly realized that he was taking advantage of our friendship while working there (giving him rides to and from work without pitching in for gas, giving me shitty hours revolving around what was convenient for his schedule, pinning the blame on me for his shortcomings to corporate, etc), and after about 4 months of this I said fuck it and quit. I left on good terms and decided to move in with my mom who's sick with MS. 

&#x200B;

Two months after this, I get a random text from him, saying that my old job is still open if I want it. Despite not enjoying my time with him as my boss (we were both managers), there weren't really any other job prospects where my mom lives so I said fuck it and came back down. However, working for him this time around was even worse.

&#x200B;

He now hired a new assistant manager below me, and as you can imagine, the two started fucking around (metaphorically and literally). To give you an idea of how shitty they were, for the 4 months I was there during my second stint... they would steal items left behind by customers and return them to the shops where they were originally purchased for money/store credit, would purposefully give other employees shitty schedules because they didn't like them, vape \[weed\] in the store with customers present, the works. I essentially had no control of the shop, and I felt I had no one to turn to, as my former friend was on great terms with the district manager. 

&#x200B;

But the final straw was when his in-store girlfriend offered me cocaine the Saturday before Christmas, on the main floor, in a store full of people. I couldn't be 100% sure, but I had/have a feeling one of the customers saw her busting out the bag of coke. At that point, I emailed my DM, told her everything that was happening, and basically told her to ""deal with it"" because I wasn't going to any more.

When we are at home we correct her, tell her that we don't do that and she stops and doesn't do it again until after a visit there. When we are at their house, if they are saying blessing we remind our daughter to stay quiet and be respectful, but don't let her cross her hands, but if that's going to be too obvious I usually stand there quietly, my wife gives me the look of ""oh shit he is going to say something"" and we discuss it later.

He mentioned that his girlfriend would be spending at least 3-4 nights a week at our place - she's really nice so I have nil objections to her being around.

The only issue is that I can hear them having sex. Very clearly. It's not gratuitous or anything, just very audible bed springs and various moaning sounds for about 5-10 minutes, once or twice a day. They both get up pretty early, whereas I work from home and stay up pretty late, so I tend to be working at my desk when it happens.

I honestly don't mind at all - I just put my noise canceling headphones on and go about my day. It's his flat too and I think I'd be a real arsehole to tell him that he and his adult girlfriend can't be intimate.

So my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she’s not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I’ve ordered. So many times I’ve ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she’ll say she’s not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

Anyways in the past year I’ve found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won’t touch any of it. Recently some family members discovered I do this and called me a massive asshole. They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I’m just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. AITA?

**Edit**: To those asking if I’ve told her to stop, I do, all the time, but it’s honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly.

It looks really good...” Or she waits until I’m taking a break to ask me multiple times if I’ve finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she’s begging for scraps.

1293,Not the A-hole,"Got in a cab in a city where I was a tourist. Told the driver I wanted to go “Goldie Garden Hotel” next a specific metro station (this is important). 

He arrives at a place that is NOT the hotel. Looks like a park. He said it was GOLDEN GARDEN, what I asked for. It’s now dawned on me he misheard. 

I said no, I had asked for GOLDIE garden HOTEL. He kept insisting I asked for Golden Garden, never said hotel. Regardless, I said I wanted Goldie Garden Hotel and to go there. So off we go. 

During the ride, I asked him what he was going to do about the fare for the mistake. He continued insisting I never said hotel. 

I told him when I got in the car I definitely said the hotel NEXT to the specific metro station. Which is THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION of the garden he took me to. 

When I mentioned the metro station, he got quiet. I thought he must have remembered this detail now and realized he did mess up, because shortly after, he flipped down the fare meter. 

He drives in silence and we arrive at hotel. He now FLIPS UP THE METER which shows the full fare from Point A to Wrong Destination to Correct Hotel. (EDIT: This means he DID NOT “stop” the meter at the park. Not sure why he physically put it down still.) Let’s say the total fare is $18. (I am converting all this from foreign currency to USD). 


I said I will not pay the full fare since he made the mistake. I took Uber before that day for the same route and it had cost ~ $10.

At this point, he asked me you’re not paying $18? I said no, $12, $14 most. Ubers here cost 25% more than cabs so I think this was very fair. 

He said, he will call the police. 

I was INCREDULOUS. Is this guy really threatening to call the police over a fare for a mistake he made???

I decided to call his bluff. “Okay, if you want to do this, we will do this inside the hotel. I want to my hotel manager present.”

The driver parked his car, came to the hotel lobby. He called a # on his cell phone.

15 mins later a police car came by with 2 police officers. I could tell they were equally incredulous. We told our sides of the story. 

Police asked me how much I was willing to pay. I said $12. 

2 hotel managers came out and tried to convince him to take lower fare. Taxi driver said no. Police tried convincing. No. 

He said he was a poor man and I was robbing him of his $. I told him he tried to scare me off by calling the police for a mistake he made.  

There’s this standoff. Eventually he asked me how much I was willing to pay. I said $14. I said this situation is a mess. I’m willing to just split the mistake of $8. 

DRIVER STILL SAYS NO. Hotel mgrs AND police cajole him again repeatedly. FINALLY, he reluctantly accepts. 

AITA for arguing essentially a $4-6 USD difference? $6 probably mattered to driver than to me. In the heat of the moment, I was furious the driver was trying to scare a woman into paying for something that was his mistake. Felt he was also being shady by turning down the meter.

1294,Asshole,"My wife is part of several mommy groups on fb where they discuss mom related things. It's a good group and they help each other out a lot but it's also a place for her to vent and receive encouragement. One particular group that she is a part of is specific to breastfeeding. Over the last several months, my wife has frozen up a large supply of milk. Our daughter refuses to drink reheated milk for some reason and my wife decided to give away the milk. She met someone on the breastfeeding fb group who cannot feed her own child any formula and for some reason, cannot produce her own milk.

Now here lies the problem:

1) I really don't want to liable to anyone for any reason. What if, god forbid, this child drinks my wife's milk, has an allergic reaction, and something terrible happens. Or maybe it spoils in the mail and the mom doesn't realize. Even if the mom picks up the milk in person, there's no guarantee that she will handle it properly. I'm no lawyer and maybe there is some kind of law that protects an act like giving away breastmilk. I honestly don't really care. Even if I was protected, I'll still have to hire a lawyer, possibly go to court, and spend money protecting myself. 

2) I don't know this person at all. For all I know, she's a career scammer who feeds off the goodness of others. Most likely she's not, but there's no way of telling. And, even if she was a good person, people don't act logically or rationally when something happens to their child. They would want someone to blame and I don't want to be on the receiving end.

I want to say that I know I do sound a little ridiculous. After all, it's just breastmilk. However, I've always been a careful person and I always will be. My wife says I'm being ridiculous and I definitely see her point of view. That being said, I'm not changing my mind. AITA?


Update: Wife and I talked and we're going to look into donating to a hospital. Most of her milk is getting to freezer expiration which is around 6 months so we'll have to find somewhere quick.
My wife never actually ended up responding to this women's request on the fb group and there were others who responded, which made our decision a litle easier. Thank you for those that responded!",78,101,0.88

1297,Not the A-hole,"I met my now wife when her daughter was 5 months old. I am a lesbian, my wife is bisexual and she had the little one with a man she was never really dating, but they were good friends who ended up sleeping together. At first, he was perfectly fine with me being around the child. As things progressed more seriously, the three of us discussed my role in the child’s life, as she lives primarily with us and because the dad lives out of state, he sees her two weekends a month. I asked if he was comfortable with me taking on a parental role, not to replace him, but because I didn’t want to just be a “step-mom” when we got married. He said he was fine with it and wanted his daughter to be raised respecting me.

My wife and I got married when the little girl was 2. She was calling me by my first name at the time which made sense. However, she is now 5 and recently asked me and my wife if it’d be okay if she started calling me “Mama” (she calls my wife “Mommy”). I was touched and said of course, as did my wife. I treat her the same as I do the son we have together and to me, she’s not a “step-daughter”, she’s just my daughter.

Well, apparently this pissed off her dad. He came to drop her back off after a weekend with her and asked my wife why she thought that was okay. My wife said since it’s not “Daddy” that he didn’t think she’d care, plus he okayed my role in her life. He said that it was crossing a line and that we need to correct her. My wife said that she wouldn’t, so long as I was comfortable. He said as a dad, he should have a say. Ever since, he’s been e-mailing me, trying to show me studies about how she’s just “confused”.

Ironically, this times up with him getting married himself. His wife is a lovely woman, but the little girl doesn’t view her as a mom, as she doesn’t know her well (they barely spent time together before her dad and the new wife got married, as he kept his weekends just them). I asked if this had anything to do with the little one not calling his wife “Mama” too and he admitted that her feelings were hurt. I told him that it’s up to our daughter to decide and that he really needs to decide if this battle is worth ruining the co-parenting relationship the three of us had or how he wants to start the new relationship between the four of us. His wife then e-mailed me and said “step mom to step mom” I should get how she feels.

AITA for not getting how she feels?

&#x200B;

ETA: A lot of people have said that the dad doesn’t get a say because he doesn’t seem like much of a dad. I should’ve clarified that even though she goes with him two weekends a month, he’s an amazing father. He pays child support and sees her throughout the month. He goes to ballet recital, school events, birthday parties, etc. He’s been an extremely cooperative co-parent to my wife until now. The only reason he lives out of state is for work and she has more overnights with him on breaks (like she’ll be with him a whole month in the summer) but he’s not a deadbeat by any means.",244,1918,0.97

1299,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway. 

So, there's a FtM trans guy at my school, let's call him Don (since I'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. He says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. As a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100M. He switched over to the male team. The coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). Don nodded along and said that's okay.

But the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. Since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. And he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. 

I disagree with this, partially. I do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. But he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. I know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. 

One time, after practice when Don was complaining, I civilly shared my opinion. He got offended at this.

He was supposed to live to be anywhere from 50 to 70 years old. He was my baby and a companion I expected to have for most of my life. 

I am away at college and today I got a call from my dad that George flew away on Thursday (five days ago) and though he has been spotted within a five mile radius of our house over the past couple of days it’s not looking too hot for us to get him back. I was at a coffee shop when I got the call and frantically asked my boyfriend of five months to come pick me up (a six minute drive) because I was panicking and didn’t want to drive my car and also just wanted the company. I couldn’t tell him what had happened over the phone due to outside reasons. When he arrived and I explained the situation he got a little removed and rushed the getting home process. Once I was at his house he told me I hadn’t respected his time because he was very busy studying (which I did know but honestly just didn’t think would be much of an issue).

1301,Not the A-hole,"So this is a hard issue. I [23F] live with 3 other roommates (2 guys, 1 girl). We each have our own bedroom but only the guys have TVs in their room. I use the shared TV in our living room to watch my shows. 

Anyways, I’m into GoT and will watch it on TV because I don’t have an HBO account and can’t find good quality alternatives online. The last few times I’ve watched it my female roommate asks me to turn it off almost immediately. She says she used to date this really abusive guy who’d force her to watch GoT with him even though the gratuitous violence/sex made her feel nauseous. She says seeing it on TV or even hearing it from other rooms gives her panic attacks because it feels like he’s back in her life. 

I’ve really tried to accommodate her like turning the volume down, using something to block the TV so you can’t see it from other parts of the room, letting her borrow my sound cancelling headphones, but she refuses. She asks, albeit very nicely every time, for me to turn off the show whenever it airs. The only solution she’s given me is to go to my boyfriend’s place and watch it there, but he lives 1.5 hr away and I don’t want to stay there because I have classes the next morning.

I’ve asked the other two guys if I could watch in their rooms but they also politely declined because they don’t feel comfortable with me sitting in their rooms when they’re not there (they stay with their gfs on weekends). 

AITA if I just keep watching the show on our living room tv regardless of my roommate’s feelings?

Edit to clarify: lots of people are asking what I’ve done to help the situation so I’ll clarify the steps I’ve taken so far. 

Our living room is in a room by itself connected to the side of the house. It’s not open so you can’t just glance at the tv from kitchen or wherever, you have to physically step INTO the room and turn around to face the back wall in order to see the tv. 

What I’ve done is I put up bedsheets that block the tv from view even when you step into the room (only way you can see it is if you sit on the couches). I have headphones too so there isnt any sound. My roommate hardly spends any time in the living room anyways because she watches her stuff on her computer in her bedroom. When I’m watching GoT she’ll come down, ask me what I’m doing, and then come over and turn off the tv. She knows what time the show is on so she comes down specifically to “check” if I’m watching the show. Im not forcing her to hear or see anything, she wasn’t even in the room before that.",329,783,0.97
1302,Everyone Sucks,"So I know off the bat this sounds outlandish, but here we go.
I am quite active on the hedonistic and orgy scenes in my city, they are quite posh, high class events that you need to be vetted and prove you are clean, attractive ect.  There are obviously lots of rules, NDAs are signed at the door so you don't discuss what happens inside, people wear masks, and a man can only come at the invite or a woman.
I'm not exactly vocal about what I do with my friends and obviously it's not very common, but I do have a good friend with as high a sex drive as I do. He has been in a relationship for about 6 years, his gf has a low sex drive. I know he has cheated multiple times, and although my advise to him has always been to tell her, I don't know her and don't feel it is my place to tell her myself. Also he's a careful bastard, I wouldn't even have any evidence to give her exept my word. The odd part is, and I know it sounds stupid, but he completely loves her. And yes he's an arse and a lot of people will say cheaters don't love, and I agree completely. However, after knowing him for years, I genuinely do believe he does, which is so contradictory I know, but he does seem to completely adore her. The sex I think is just sex for him. NOT that I am in anyway defending his actions, cheating is cheating. Anyway the question isn't about if he's an arsehole, because we can all agree he is, but about wether I am.
So we're drinking and having a chat one night talking when I felt comfortable enough to tell him about what I enjoy doing. He's interested and he asks me about the rules and such, and I mention the rule about men attending. He asks if I go with anyone as I'm single, and I say no, and he asks if he can come.
I said yes, as long as he pays for his own ticket, doesn't embarrass me as my guest, and obviously I was out of bounds as his mate. 
At the time I was of the opinion that i have told him on multiple occasions that he should tell his gf what he's done, and after years of telling him this I can't be asked and it's not my job to police his relationship. I'm not going to tell him what he can and can't do. I'm also very comfortable with him, being that he is one of my closest friends, and I trust him to bugger off and find his own amusement. Since the conversation I have given him many opitunities to back out, I even told him it's a shitty thing to do in my personal opinion, but he seems pretty set on the idea. And now we have the tickets and personally, again I know, I don't feel it's my job to police him.
However with the benefit of foresite I feel like I'm enabling him, even though I didn't invite him, but he can't go without me.
So Reddit, ESH, YTA or NTA?

TL;DR: My coworker is driving me nuts. She's slow, throws tantrums, lies, and won't listen to me (manager). Boss won't do anything and I have a new job offer. WIBTA if I left (with appropriate notice), and told my boss that she's the main reason I quit?   

Long version:

About 4 years ago we hired Joan. Joan and I went to the same school, and took the exact same program with the same teachers. 

At first, she was a bit forgetful or asked basic questions, but there's always a learning curve starting a new job. After a year she continued to mess up. Customers would get angry or flat out say they were not coming back because of things she did.  

Now, I give her advice or instructions and she will give me 101 reasons why she wants to do it her way. I try to help her with problems she's having, using advice that she normally would have done herself, but she will reject my idea, seemingly because I was the one who said it. 

Recently, she's had tantrums, screaming matches with the boss and myself, and will cry and storm off over really small disagreements. She NEVER apologises for her behaviour. The one time I pushed for an apology she literally got on her knees and mocked me (""PLEeEeASE forgive me, deadleaf28!"") 

Last week, we made a plan that I would continue hole punching some books while she printed her business cards, and when there was a decent amount to coil, she would start coiling. I guess she forgot? Because when I reminded her about it, she blew a gasket. Convo below: 

Me: Hey, I'll take over the punching now, you can go do your cards.

J: No I'm fine.

Me: But.. I thought I was going to punch and you do your cards? 

J: FINE! I'LL DO THE DAMN CARDS! I WILL DO THEM! I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU!! \*runs away\*

Me: What? 

I met her at her desk and she was really angry and crying. (No actual tears...)

Me: What's wrong, why are you crying? I thought that was the plan, for me to punch and you do cards, then coil?? 

J: IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THE STUPID CARDS I'LL DO THEM!

Boss shows up to see what all the fuss is about. Joan IMMEDIATELY calms down, stops 'crying' and says, ""oh, I misunderstood."" 

I feel like Joan is trying to manipulate me into either quitting or losing my cool. The only time I've raised my voice at her was when she was already yelling at me so I could make my point before she ran away. I've told my boss about my concerns and how I really can't work like this anymore. She says she'll hire somebody new but it's been over a year and she's done a few interviews and hasn't hired anybody, and hasn't told Joan that it's not acceptable behaviour. Recently I got a job offer in the same field, with better pay and a better organization.

1306,Not the A-hole,"Surgery Context: I got an emergency surgery called appendectomy (I think? The one where they remove my appendix) done Tuesday and was discharged Wednesday after being able to eat a full meal. At first I went on short walks everyday and slept the rest of the time (I was on an opioid medication). It took 3 days before I could walk at a normal pace. I still experience lots of pain in my shoulders and overall have a tiny amount of energy. I do anything and I run out of breath. Due to pain and rolling around when sleeping uncomfortably I even go sleep on the couch to let my girlfriend sleep peacefully. Doctors have me off work for 2 weeks and then on light duty for 4-6 weeks with a maximum of 15 lbs lifts during light duty. 

At home context: Me and my SO live together. We take turns taking the dog out, and we clean our half of the condo every Sunday. She hasn't necessarily been ""pushing"" me, but she has asked me to take the dog out the day after I got home and I have rotated taking her out ever since. It may seem stupid because she is only 11 pounds, but after surgery she is actually hard to hold when she runs after birds or other dogs. At first I barely had the energy to make it back to bed. Now it's better but I have not been doing much, just lots of videogames. Yesterday I was supposed to clean (Sunday) but I skipped due to a lack of energy and more shoulder pain. Today, she asked if I was going to clean(expecting me to). I said I would try to do a little bit now and a little bit later. She told me to just do it now and that it's also my turn to vacuum (we rotate the vacuum every week). 

Anyway I felt like I was being pushed too much and I got really mad. I told her that I hope she gets to go through abdominal surgery so she can feel some sympathy for the effort I am putting. I regret saying that and I know that was an asshole move but that's not the AITA of this post. I then more calmly explained that even simple tasks are very difficult for me but she does not seem to understand and is very defensive about it.

I guess I realized some things as I wrote the description idk. But anyway. I talked to her and she understands better now. She just didn't know. I'm too stubborn to say no and to show pain.

1307,Asshole,"23 years ago, I had a month-long fling with a woman who I quickly ended up breaking ties with; she turned out to be toxic and abusive, and I made an effort to stay as far away from her as possible. 3 years ago, I received an email from a young woman of 19 who introduced myself as this woman’s daughter, and claimed that she’s also MY biological daughter, borne of our long-ago relationship.

She gave me her birthdate, and I can deduce that she was conceived right in the window of time that could have been near the end of our relationship, OR right after the breakup; hard to know for sure. Even if this girl WAS conceived before we broke up, I do not trust that I was the only guy she was sleeping with, as our relationship was fairly “open” and loose.

1308,Not the A-hole,"Background: (sorry it’s long and a lot of dumb drama)

My MIL and my husband and I have a very strained relationship. She is very manipulative, and when she doesn’t get what she wants, she can be very cruel, and usually spins the narrative to make herself seem like a victim and my husband the aggressor.  On the flip side, when things are going her way, she’s very kind and generous. 

We have four kids. A three year old and then baby 2 became surprise triplets who just recently turned a year old. 

Her favorite guilt trip is over us not making the drive over six hours a way with a toddler and three infants instead of her coming to us for holidays and special occasions. We get this every holiday until she realizes my husband won’t give in, and never apologizes for the cruel things she says during the fights. 

I’m sick of it and her. My husband has considered many times going NC but never does

So fast forward:

I recently discovered my MIL has been posting a lot of pictures of the triplets on her Facebook. She tags the lot of them with a million different triplet tags. 

These aren’t always pictures she’s taken herself. Most of the time they are pictures my husband has sent to her because she asks him for recent pictures. She captions them as if she took them, and as if she was there. She makes up a narrative like “they were crying until she came in and scooped all three up and then they started giggling” etc. 

This made me furious. I think I saw red. My husband and I only post pictures once every three months or so, and when we do we make sure our privacy settings are locked down so only our close friends can see. Her pictures are NOT locked down. I’m not friends with her and I could see all the posts. 

Anyone with multiples knows there’s a lot of weird people on the internet when it comes to twins and triplets. Some people fetishize multiples, and steal pictures to post as their own. It’s creepy. 

I reported every photo on Facebook. FB allows you to report pictures of your minor children that you don’t want, and will remove them.

What I didn’t know is that it tells the poster that the photos are being removed. 

So MIL sends a message to my husband talking about how heartbroken she is that “someone” reported these pictures. She also separately talked to the rest of the family. 

The whole family thinks whoever did it is a huge asshole. 

I didn’t admit to it. I thought I was justified at the time, but now I’m second guessing myself because of how they’re talking about “whoever did it” and because honestly my motives weren’t completely pure. Part of it was anger at my MIL using the photos for likes, and part of it was concern at the weirdos with her unsecured privacy settings, and part of it was general irritation at her because of the poor relationship between her, myself, and my husband.

1309,Not the A-hole,"I was asked about a year ago to photograph a long time friend’s wedding (this upcoming fall). 

I agreed, thinking it would be a standard job with full day coverage. 

Since then, I’ve been notified that this will require THREE days of my time, as well as the mentoring of a “friend’s daughter who wants experience in wedding photography”. 

They want me working and training this girl for all three of these days. 2 of these days are taking place about 3 hours away, while 1 day will be relatively local. 

Day 1: ceremony

Day 2: rehearsals for a second ceremony and trial run for makeup. 

Day 3: 2nd ceremony and reception. 


I’ve told them that I cannot make this work due to the fact that I have small children, one of which is special needs. 

Now they are hounding me about finding someone to stay with my kids, and offering up strangers who could stay in my home and babysit so I can accommodate them. 

Truth be told, I probably could make arrangements for my children but in doing so, I would have a really hard time getting away again if I wanted to for a few months at best. I would also have to pay about 70% of what I make off this wedding just in childcare. 

Between that, the fact that they don’t want to pay me much to begin with, and the length of time they are asking me to give them.. I do not feel like it is worth it. I’ve never been asked to photograph a wedding over a span of multiple days like this and it seems extremely unreasonable to me. 

They should have ample time to find a new photographer, but they would have to pay significantly more money and still wouldn’t get the coverage they want. I never agreed to an entire weekend of work.

This grocery store has 5 or 6 checkout lines but only one was open. There was a line of 6-8 people, many with their carts full. It was clear it was going to be a long wait for anyone in the line. 

Eventually my wife and I are next in line to check out when an employee opens another checkout lane. As I'm starting to walk towards the newly opened lane, a woman in her 60s (who had been waiting in line but on the ""wrong"" side of the line; think of a ""Y"" with only her being the only one on one side of the ""Y"" and the rest of the line being on the other side of the ""Y"") pushed her full cart into the checkout lane without saying a word. 

I proceeded to place my basket, which had 8-10 items in it, on the conveyor belt in front of her cart and walked passed her. She said something passive agressive to me and I told her she was rude for cutting in line. I didn't raise my voice or get in her face but I was clearly agitated, am 6' 3"" with an athletic build, and was wearing a backwards cap and a tank top, so I had a very ""bro"" look going. 

My wife tells me that I shouldn't have reclaimed my spot or, at the very least, not ""mouthed"" off to her. She said that my behavior, coupled with my appearance, made me look like the asshole in the situation. Redditors, please render your judgment.

1311,Not the A-hole,"so me 27f and my wife 28f are expecting a baby, my sister 22f has been there through out the ivf treatment and tried making light of every fail we had. she would make jokes that did not land super well and caused my wife to cry. we just accepted that it was her way of processing it. 

4 months ago we found out we would be having a baby and told our family 2 weeks ago. my sisters first comment, before congratulating us was, so who's the father. I said that it's the donor we picked, I then told her, we are in a gay relationship how would there be a father.  I looked super confused because I did not understand she was joking. 

she then replys, it was just a joke, don't overanalyze it and rolled her eyes. 

i told her that this is a special moment, not a place for your silly jokes.

1312,No A-holes here,"This is my first post here, so sorry if it's formatted badly.

This happened in school not too long ago. A friend of mine in my band class was born blind. We met 3 years ago in the same class, and are rather close. Let's call him Will. Will plays trombone, and I tuba. I also know how to play trombone, so I was told to assist Will in class.

Will has a few friends that escort him around the school. They are all well aware of how he is blind, and choose to stay away from the topic. Anyway, onto the main bit.

Me, Will, and Will's friend are walking to class together, talking. I mention my instrument, and how the lacquer is scratching, and showing the brass underneath. Will is confused by my description. Then it hit me: He doesn't know what color is. 

I do my best to describe what I am talking about, and how color is seen. After my summary, Will seemed really upset. He said he didn't understand how he didn't know what color was. After Will leaves, the escorting friend starts laying into me about it. I feel what I did was justified. I'm not sure if it was too much. 
So, AITA?

EDIT: This is how I described it to him.
Color is a characteristic of things, one that can't be felt, it can only be seen. Like if you have an two apples, both exactly the same shape and texture, but different colors. There is a difference in how they look, but not how they feel.

This is about how it went, but I don't remember precisely.",20,31,0.88

One of my friends who happens to be Asian said I couldn't dress up as Mulan because I'm white and that would be cultural appropriation. I don't see it like that. I'm not dressing up as someone's race, I'm dressing up as a character who happens to be a different race than me--which isn't the same in my book. I wouldn't do a yellow face or even wear a black-haired wig because my hair is already dark. I would just be wearing a dress like the one she wears in the beginning of the movie--which is what everyone else was doing with their respective princesses. My friend wasn't rude about it and didn't try to push me to pick a different princess, but now I feel uneasy. WIBTA if I went as Mulan despite my friend's comment?

1314,No A-holes here,"First of all, I know that sounds like the biggest asshole thing ever. But.. I've never shamed her for it, but it was happening at least 1x a week and I just didn't know what else to do.

She's never been a bedwetter, no problems in pre-k or kindergarten. I asked her what was going on since she knows the potty drill. She said she doesn't like having to raise her hand to go. Sometimes the teacher just says ""Not right now"" without knowing what it's about, so the teacher came up with a special way to raise your hand that means BATHROOM NOW! (you just wiggle your hand while raising it). She just did not want to do the funny wiggle, she said it made her feel dumb..I said ""Isn't peeing your pants more embarrassing?"" She doesn't think anyone can tell (newsflash, honey...they can!) I told her she can get a bad rash or infection if she keeps it up....Still was having accidents.
 
I talked to her teacher and she says she has permission to go any time, no questions asked. I told my daughter she is special because she can just go without doing the silly hand thing. Should be all set, right? Nope, still having accidents.

 I took her to the doctor. No infection.  I tried everything he recommended. More fiber, more water, and making sure she goes before school. Still having accidents...

Nothing in our routine has changed, no big move, no new people or loss of any loved ones...nada.

I realize 1st grade is quite a leap. In preschool and kindergarten there were bathrooms in the classroom and you didnt need permission. I feel bad because I know it's just anxiety, but all I can do for that is reassure her that it's OK to speak up. . 

I've tried rewards for a whole clean week at school...didn't help.

I just felt like I had no more recourse. I told her there is absolutely no reason she should not be going to the toilet at school. I mean, she doesn't even have to ask anymore. 

 So I told her I will have to start taking privelages away at home. No TV, no games, just work for 5 days. . .

So far it has worked. She was clean all last week and today. .

I just feel awful for threatening a 6 year old with anxiety. So go ahead and give me the big YTA!

Anyways, we were arguing and I said that I wanted to play like an hour or two more and I would be done, so she took my laptop and threw it onto the ground.

I look at it and say “no, I won’t like it”. She keeps insisting on me getting a #3. I keep saying that I know I won’t like it but is so insistent that the bartender that is hearing the whole convo since the place is practically empty goes to make me the drink anyway. Ex friend did say ""just make it for her"" while I repeated ""I don't want it and won't drink it"".  I tell ex friend to take the drink but she won’t insisting that I at least taste it.

1318,Not the A-hole,"I became a Muslim 12 years ago when I was 22. when I accepted Islam my parents hit the roof and disowned me. They assumed it was a phase, called me a terrorist, my dad threatened to shoot me, my mom said I wasn’t her son anymore. I was close to my parents so I was hurt, I can’t lie. But my religion was important to me.

I moved out of my hometown, got married 7 years ago, & had my first kid. In that time there’s been radio silence.

I got in contact with parents at the urging of my wife once our second child was born in November 2018. She knew I really wanted closure. 

Since January I have flown twice to see my parents who seemed overjoyed to hear from me. They totally ignored all religious talk and for a while it seemed like it could work out. Wife has not yet come along as she had a c section and has complications so she is on a no fly from her doc. However she gave me blessings to take the babies to go see their grandparents. I explained to my mom and dad that the kids and I can only eat vegetarian food. Now this isn’t strictly the truth, we *can* eat halal and kosher, but there isn’t any halal or kosher food sources around in my tiny lil hometown. They seemed to accept it, however over the course of our 3 day stay I noticed that mom kept acting shifty around my 4 year old. I tried not to be too overbearing bc I wanted to show I trusted her. 

Yesterday tho, my brother angrily came storming into the backyard and told me that he’d caught mom feeding my 4 y/o pork. He had confronted our mom and she said she’d been feeding him it since the start of our stay because he was ‘malnourished’ Now, I’m a hella involved dad and mealtimes I’m the one feeding my kids and cleaning up after them. She hadn’t been feeding them pork then. She’d been waiting for when my dad would ask me to go work on his car in the garage or shoot the shit with him, *then* she’d give the kids haram snacks.

It’s not that she’s feeding the kid pork. I don’t really care if you do it by accident. Accidents happen. It was the careful, deliberate, spiteful way she’d gone about doing it. I confronted my mom and asked her why she’d try and fuck up our relationship all over again. She yelled back that it wasn’t American to not feed our kids meat and that my son wasn’t a Muslim at the age of 4 anyway. I told her that we were done, and that we weren’t gonna be in her life anymore. I took the kids on a red eye back home. 

Since then I’ve had phone call after phone call from her where she’s crying that I can’t take her babies away from her, and that she loves the grandkids and was getting used to seeing them. She’s also said that I’m the one burning bridges. My wife is so incredibly pissed and sad on my behalf, and my 4 y/o REALLY enjoyed the time with his grandparents. I feel like I’m the one holding the family back but I’m also so angry that she’d disregard my beliefs like that.

1319,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, I’ll try to make this as brief and unbiased as possible.
I  met my bf a year ago, we have always had protected sex ( I’m on the pill and he wears a condom). I have no idea what happened but I still managed to get pregnant. I immediately decided to get an abortion.
I asked my bf if he could come and support me through the procedure. He said he didn’t want to take a day off. Full disclosure if it gives insight: he works from home taking contracts as a programmer, makes $150k a year and can take off whenever he feels like it.

So whatever, he told me he wasn’t coming and that I had to take care of it. This was a week ago. The procedure was yesterday and it went as well as can be expected. I went to his house afterwards and he told me he had a surprise for me: it was a small, child sized bowl with cutesy animals on it. I thanked him but mentioned that this was maybe not the best gift as I just had a tough day and was emotional at best. 
He then told me he had a wonderful day with his family and proceeded to show me a video of his father and nephew doing egg hunts together and the father teaching the nephew to wash his hands, etc.
So I immediately started bawling because I just terminated a pregnancy ( it wasn’t wanted and I don’t regret it, but it doesn’t mean I feel sensitive about it). He became very cold and asked me to stop crying, saying that I was overreacting and he was just trying to make me feel better. He didn’t apologize and we went to bed upset. I woke up in the middle of the night because I was cramping and sore, so I went on his couch and had a good cry. Apparently that woke him up because he came to ask me if I was going to continue crying for long and told me to turn off the lights ASAP because I was being inconsiderate.

AITAH? I feel like he doesn’t give a rats ass about me and is being disrespectful, he says it’s the ‘pregnancy hormones’ making me whiny.

ETA: thank you all for your judgement and messages. I’m going to have a conversation w my bf tonight. To those who think he wanted to keep it: he made it clear (explicitly) that he didn’t want it. Regardless, I want to at least understand his motivations. I will try to post an update when this is all over. Thank you again.
Also don’t waste your time calling me a baby killer, I’m 100% pro choice and would do it again in a heartbeat. If you can’t understand why, then you’re not someone I want to engage with anyway.",1747,17034,0.81
1320,Not the A-hole,"**Relevant background info**: My in-laws are both very conservative and my FIL in particular was raised by racist parents in the South.  My wife and I, on the other hand, are very liberal and as such we have always had a ""no politics"" rule at family events for the sake of harmony.  


**Yesterday's Events**:  This year we hosted my wife's families yearly Easter pot luck lunch for the first time and everything was going fine without any incidents.  In attendance were my father in law, mother in law, sister in law + boyfriend, my wife and myself.  My father had been drinking and with the loose tongue this provided started making snide comments that were quickly rebuked by my wife with a mention of 'remember no politics please'.  It started innocuous enough with comments about Mueller's investigation being fruitless, the Dems were in a panic, etc but eventually escalated to my father in law laughing and saying:

FIL: ""can you believe the Democrats are desperate enough to put their hope behind that f--got Buttigieg?""  

At this point I interjected and the following interaction took place (about as word for word as I can recall):

Me: ""FIL, please don't talk politics, and also don't use that word again, it's incredibly offensive.""

FIL: ""What word... f--got? That's not offensive unless you're a f--got""

Me: ""Yea well I'm not gay but that's still very offensive to me""

FIL: ""First I can't say n--ger and now I can't say f--got, the whole world is going to hell""

Me: ""I asked you nicely but if you can't stop speaking that way then you're not welcome in our house""

My wife then tried to defuse the situation but my FIL kind of blew up and started yelling that I was a pussy if words could have that effect on me and I yelled at him to get the hell out of my house.  My MIL grabbed my FIL and pulled him out of the house but said that I was clearly 'not raised right if that's how I treat my elders'.  I'd had enough and walked away into a different room until they left.  

Later in the day (and today) my SIL and MIL have said in our family whatsapp chat (that FIL isn't a part of) that I didn't need to kick him out saying things like 'that's just the way he is' and that I knew that since I started dating my wife.  I responded that he's welcome to be that way everywhere else but I won't allow it in our house and that he isn't welcome back until he sincerely apologizes.  I'm now being called choice names by my SIL and MIL and several cousins/aunts/uncles have all been blowing up my wife's phone too.  

My wife is obviously upset at what happened but agrees that he went over the line after being repeatedly asked not to and is agreeing with me that he needs to apologize.

1321,Not the A-hole,"So about 2 months ago I was in a car accident with a good friend of mine. We have a FWB type of relationship. I'll explain why that's relevant in a minute.

 The car was totaled and both of us were injured. He had a concussion and I hurt my ribs pretty bad. The police came and took both of our vitals and our information. So here's where the issue lies... he was buying the car from his ex girlfriend and everything was still in her name. She isn't the most mature person imo and they have problems consistently despite being broken up. As a result he didn't want her to find out I was in the car with him because of OUR dynamic because she would freak out. 


I didn't end up going to the hospital even though I wanted to because I didn't want the bill to get charged to her car insurance. He asked me to lie about why I was hurt so I just didn't go because I was uncomfortable with doing that. A few weeks after the accident the insurance company began calling me asking for a statement. The first time they called I asked him what he wanted me to do. He said, ""Just be like 'I don't know what you're talking about.'"" I was also uncomfortable with that. So I ignored them for awhile. The next time I talked to him about it he asked me to ignore them. I told them I wasn't sure what I was gonna do yet.

Today they called me again and I finally answered. I gave my statement and they offered me a 1000$ settlement for my injuries which I accepted. I feel like it's important to mention that the money could also REALLY help me right now. As soon as I was done talking to the insurance company I called him and let him know what was going on.

He is FURIOUS with me now because I gave a statement to the insurance company and now his ex is going to find out I was in the car. My thing though is it's already on record that I was in the accident with him and the police have my information. So I don't think I'm massively fucking him over in any way. And I WAS actually injured so I don't think he's being fair by asking me to lie or turn down the settlement. 

So Reddit, AITA?

1323,Not the A-hole,"
For the past few years, I’ve been in a group of friends for quite a few years. In total there’s about 15 of us, and many of us are closer then others, and the main reason for this is many of us have known each other longer than others, case in point, my best friend, Nate, and another good friend of mine, Dylan. The three of us were pretty close. 

A few months ago, Dylan came out as trans, and began transitioning, in the following months, they became more and more feminine, and adopted a new name and new pronouns. 

(From this point on if I mess up anything about the whole Trans or LGBT+ terminology please forgive me as I, suck at it)

Nate and I had no problem with this, we were ready to support Dylan (now Ella) with what she was going through. 

Others in the group were less supportive, saying she was too young to make such a big decision, and that maybe she should think it through more. 

This upset her at first, but as the group got more used to it, she came to realize that people were just worried she was making a rash decision, as she has been known for doing and regretting it later. 

Past few months, Ella has been very combative towards us. Any pronoun mixup is seen as an act of aggression in her eyes. I am the worst for it. We’ve known this person for almost 20 years, to change pronouns suddenly is a hard thing to do. I’ve been calling her dude or man for as long as I can remember, and every now and again it slips my mind. Every time it happens, Ella gets upset, understandably, and I apologize, and I am getting better at it, but every now and then, I’m bound to mess up.

This came to a spearhead last month, when Nate, following two weeks of Burnout following family problems, work, and a ton of tests and projects, accidentally used the wrong pronouns for Ella. (Nate was usually pretty good for this sort of stuff)

That was the last straw for Ella, who we found out, had tried to get Nate labeled as a Transaphobe and Bigot among our classmates.  

Nate and Ella haven’t spoken sense. Myself and Nate have tried speaking to Ella, but she hasn’t wanted to talk. 

Slowly, the rest of our group followed, and Ella wasn’t invited to anything we did anymore. It wasn’t because she was Trans, it was because we felt she was being an asshole, and ridiculing us for what we know can be hurtful to a trans person, but something that we are still working on. 

We have stopped inviting people for being assholes before, and it has nothing to do with Ella’s gender identity, we want to be supportive of her, but we don’t know how anymore. 

Another friend of mine came up to me the other day and told me I was being an asshole for excluding Ella. The same day, my other friend (also trans) said that we were justified in our decision, and that just because Ella was trans, it didn’t give her the right to be an asshole and spread rumours about her best friends because they mixed up a pronoun 

AITA for not inviting our trans friend to any more group activitys?

1327,Not the A-hole,"A little background and context.  Fairly standard relationship, with things turning a bit adventurous half way in. We explored the swinging scene and had some fun with others. We also let each other meet others solo, but it was on a permission basis - She took a friends-with-benefits relationship, with very strict rules - permission and absolute transparency required, and turned it into a full blown affair. I caught her texting him VERY strong love messages, wanting to be together swooning over each other.

I caught her 3 times with him. After the 3rd time I was done! Especially when she spent an hour telling me how she never really loved me, never had a connection, didn't try in bed with me intentionally, how this guy showed her what true love is.  She blamed me for EVERYTHING sex related, saying I forced it all on her.

For the past year we've been working towards the divorce.  She is still seeing him and thinks she is being super sneaky. It’s now 3-4 nights a week and lying to us about it.  I have been documenting all of it, and she has NO idea.  She took off this past new-years eve without telling anyone her plans and spent the night at his house. When we texted her, she said she was at a girlfriends house. She spent half of Easter with him, and didn’t see 2 of her kids.

We talked about the divorce at one point. She thinks she gets EVERYTHING – the contents of the house, more from the house sale, and I get all the debt. She will NOT reason with me at all.

Remember I forced her into swinging?  I got a text from a friend saying wife and BF were at a sex party!  Through a website, my friend chatted with them - the BF is sharing EVERYTHING.  Screenshots of the conversation were made and there is enough evidence to prove what she’s doing.

My wife also believes that I absolutely should NOT tell the kids about the affair, which I would have agreed with if it was something that ended. Now I’m not sure. My original intent was to just have this information to protect myself. She may make me to the be the cheater and the cause of all this.

Now, I'm really considering either going scorched earth and telling my ADULT daughters EVERYTHING (Not my minor son) or threatening my wife that I will if she doesn't knock her shit off and start acting fairly. A lawyer I met with believes that I absolutely should NOT lie to my adult daughters, they have a right to know, especially if they ask. I'm not sure I agree, under normal circumstances. I don't look at the idea of destroying the relationship between my wife and her kids gleefully. That really hurts to think about. But at the same time, I am so FED UP with her behavior, it's disrespectful to EVERYONE around her.

WIBTA by first threatening her with this information, and then possibly going through with telling my kids? I think as long as I play nice and go along with all of her demands for settling the divorce, she will not do anything. If I fight her, I'm afraid she will do whatever she can to destroy me.

&#x200B;

Edit:  Wow, thank you all for your insight on both sides.  I posted this in anger and am not as irrational as I sound :P  For now, I am saying NOTHING.  I will never tell the kids about the swinging.  I'll let her screw that up herself.  I'm also not going to initiate conversation about the affair and will let them ask questions.  I will NOT lie to them though.  I need to be careful to not become the AH by lashing out, which would backfire on me in a BIG way in court.  I will go out of my way to NEVER use my kids as pawns and just let the extra time I spend with them and love do all the talking.  I just got off the phone with a great lawyer - he confirmed that her demands are absolutely ridiculous and if she were to bring these demands to court, it would NOT go well for her.

1329,Not the A-hole,"I'm born with pale skin and it won't tan at all. I need sun cream with SPF 50+ or else my skin will turn red. When I was a child, my skin tone didn't bother me at all, until people - friends, family and even strangers - started to point it out. For example, girls asked me why I was so pale. Or they even started to touch my legs and say ""wow, it almost glows in the sunlight!"". Sometimes strangers shouted rude insults whenever I crossed the streets wearing revealing clothing (Tshirt, shorts, dress and such). Hence I have been very self-concious about my paleness since I was twelve years old. I thought it was hideous and I refused to wear shorts or skirts even during hot and sunny days. Nowadays, whenever I get a negative comment about my skin color I say ""I simply can't tan"" or ""You wouldn't say that to someone with a darker skin tone, would you?"".

Yesterday, I was at a summer party with a couple of friends and there was this blonde girl who I have known since middle school. We were never friends, but we talked to each other every now and then. At first we had a nice chat, until she started to make comments about my pale skin. She was subtile in the beginning: ""You could burn easily with such sensitive skin"", but her comments gradually became more offensive, saying things like ""You look like you're ill... or dead"", ""You should get a tan. You will look so much healthier!"". By the way, she said 'skin cancer doesn't exist' and that she shouldn't use sun cream because she can't tan if she uses it. Which is the reason why she has tan lines and painfully red skin which she calls a 'tan'. 

After half an hour I finally said jokingly to her: ""By 'tan' do you mean flaming red skin like yours?"" which changed the tone of our conversation completely as I saw that she was genuinely hurt by my 'joke'. She whispered 'f\*ing dyke' as she walked away from me.

1330,Asshole,"My girlfriend's dad died 4 years ago. It's taken some time but she decided she was ready to get rid of some of his stuff. 
She was getting rid of some of his clothes and told me to take anything I fancied before it went to the charity shop. 

In the box were lots of his clothes but also a box with his military dog tags and watches from when he was in the army, some coins too. I told her and she quickly realised and took the dog tags and coins out as she wanted to keep them. 
There were 3 watched in the box and I asked if I could have the gold watch. She said sure and I took it along with a belt and necklace. 

A few months passed and the watch broke. I took it to a shop to be fixed and the guy said it was super valuable and actually worth over £300+ if fully functional. He checked it out and offered me the £300 there and then. 
I was at a hard point in my life and had car insurance due, rent due and money owed to a credit card and my MOT due. I took him up on the offer and then excitedly rang my girlfriend to tell her. 

At first, she got mad and said I better get it back and that she didn't give it me to sell it. I said that it was being given away anyway and she said that no, the clothes were to be given away but when she realised she had the box of dog tags and watches was in there, she took it out and only gave me that watch because it was me who asked. 

I said that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but that what's done is done and I can't just go and get it back because the guy will sell it for a profit, not just to sell back to me for what he bought it. She asked how much I got, I said £300 and she screamed at me and said it was worth way more than £1,000. I checked this later and in fact it's worth around £800-900. 

She then said if I'd sold it then she wanted at least some of the money. I said I'd already booked my MOT and paid off my credit card. She cried and said I'm an asshole. We spoke the next day and she said she was genuinely reconsidering our relationship. 

I don't think I did anything wrong at all, but AITA?

1331,Not the A-hole,"My sibling (13M) wanted to learn how to shave because he hated his childish mustache (he has a lot of hair there and people kept telling him how big his beard was going to get, which he can't stand), and wanted to actually do it without having a clue about it. I tried to talk him out first and he, being so damn stubborn, kept ""threatening"" to do it anyways.

In the end I gave up and taught him how to do it, gave him a new razor, gel, moisturizer, etc... and we did it together. I shaved after a few weeks, and he got rid of his mustache. He didn't get any single wound, and was incredibly pleased.

The problem started when he insisted I taught him to wax and shave his legs and others parts of his body, which I did. I gave him my epilator, and he got rid of his hair (just the legs.) He told our mother and she instantly called me and said I was irresponsible and should be ashamed of myself for ""forcing my views in a child"" and ruining his childish hair because now will grow back thick and black (it was black before too though...). She kept telling me how disappointed was, and how horrible it was for me ruining a child innocence by doing stuff just adults are supposed to do, because children obviously don't care about that.

Near the end of the game my sister and I both had 3 stars and were going into the mini game before the last turn. I had that golden pipe thing that would let me warp to the last star on the next turn so I basically had 4 stars.

1333,Not the A-hole,"So I'm riding my boosted board (an electric longboard) back from my job this morning. For most of the way I ride in the bike lane, but about
 a quarter mile from my dorm building I have to ride on the sidewalk. This sidewalk is plenty wide enough for me to ride, plus there are no rules against riding on the side walk and it's not very busy around this time; however, there is a choke point where the sidewalk narrows and is only wide enough for like, 3 people side by side. This is where my problem happened.

As I'm approaching the choke point, I see a rather large guy walking in the middle of the sidewalk, not on the right side. Cruising at maybe 8mph, I say ""excuse me"" loud enough for him to hear so that he can get over. I know he heard me because he turned his head to look at me. He keeps walking in the middle. Fine, I'll just squeeze by him.

So I ride between the edge and the guy and just squeeze by him. Not my board, bag, or body touched him and I wasn't going very fast either, maybe the pace of a jog. Although I will say, it was a tight squeeze.

He screams ""HEY WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!"" I stop ahead of him and turn around and look at him for a second before responding, ""I was watching where I was going, you're the one that didn't move when I asked. I didn't even touch you so just don't even worry about it."" To which he sort of grunted and sneered to. That was the entire conversation.

Right before I hop back on my board a girl that saw it all go down told me I was a jerk for talking like that to a mentally handicapped person. To which I replied, ""I don't care what he is, I don't like assholes."" (I didn't know he had any mental issues until she told me, but I probably wouldn't have handled it differently either way).

1335,Asshole,"A bit of background...Long story short me and my partner will have been in a relationship for 2 years in August. His family are very accepting of our relationship, to the extent that I actually live with them due to commuting for university and them wanting to help us out financially. 

However my family, are extremely religious and traditional. My dad and one granddad are church leaders - and it's a big family with some big and strong opinions. They are pleasant to my partner however it is clear to the untrained eye they wished I was with someone more involved in the church. My partner is not an atheist by any means - he is very much accepting that there is something bigger out there just not your 'born again' level Christian. Nonetheless, my families strong views cause quite a lot of unnecessary stress in our relationship (e.g. they don't like the fact I'm living with him, no sharing beds in their opinion, marriage then house then sex and kids). 

 his family are very good at involving me with things (e.g. inviting me to family functions/holidays). They invited me on a trip to Disney, however being a masters student I could not afford it. My partner decided he didn't want to go without me and forfeited the holiday. He is currently saving for our future and very serious about doing so - so me and him have never really been on holiday together (for that reason and the upset it would cause my traditional family). 

However, my family are not so great. I always have to invite us along as a couple to make sure he involved. I feel very guilty my family are not as accepting. For example, at Christmas a large family photo was taken and he was left on the sidelines. So I had to make sure another photo was taken with EVERYONE in it. 

I am currently spending the week with my grandparents who I am very close to, who very spontaneously offered to take me on a 2 week holiday to the canary islands in July (no cost to me).  Which I am very grateful for and have said yes to. Not once did they mention the possibility of inviting my partner (who would happily pay his way). It gets complicated in terms of they are getting a 2 bed apartment - which his family would be fine with us sharing a room but mine would never agree. I haven't even mentioned whether he would be able to come as do not want to make things uncomfortable as they have already been generous. However I feel do guilty that my boyfriend wont get a holiday and I will. 

TLDR; my partner has declined holidays with his family due to me not being able to join for financial reasons, however my very traditional family have offered to take me on holiday - but partner not invited. AITA for accepting the holiday and going with my grandparents?

Edit: few things I should have probably mentioned:

1. I have declined multiple holidays and visits to my family on the basis of him not being able to be involved. 
2. I fought for him to spend Christmas with me and my family; despite no offer from my family.
3. I have rejected monetary gifts to support me living in the city where I study and chose to communte to live with him and his family to make our relationship easier. Thus disappointing my family.
4. I did discuss it with him before I fully accepted- he was obviously sad but nonetheless supportive of me saying yes to this holiday. 
5. I encouraged him to go on his family holiday or holidays with friends at every given opportunity. 
6. Any family events I invite him along even if the invite has not come from my family. 
7. I didn't ask my grandparents if he could go as they had already had to change their original holiday plans to incorporate me. Given their opinions on room sharing, I thought the battle wasn't worth fighting. 
8. This family holiday is a tradition for me and my grandparents - they hadn't planned on it this year but could tell I needed a pick me up after a tough year. 
9. My grandparents have nothing personal against my partner - they are the most accommodating members of the family to my boyfriend. It is just moral beliefs. If we were married - he would be invited in a heartbeat.
10. I have discussed with my grandparents the conflict I feel about going and the only option they have given is I can choose not to go.

EDIT 2: after alot of thought about what everyone has said, The holiday has been politely declined.",80,37,0.83
1336,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at the end.
I will explain this well enough so that you can understand this without being a horse person.

Some useful horse info to understand this better:

- When a horse breaks a leg it has to be euthanized.

- We usually ride around on the arena avoiding the person jumping when we have jumping lessons to keep the horses “warm” before our turn.

- A “green horse” is the same as an inexperienced horse.

- Most horses retire from competing at 18 yo.

Some background info:

At the stable I ride there is a woman [30] who recently bought horse [20]. She has only ridden for 6 months and rides terribly. The horse she bought is extremely jumpy and a very advanced horse. He has been abused in the past and he competed on an international level in dressage. Meaning he was an extremely good horse. I have worked with him on the ground (walking him and getting him used to his surroundings and grooming him, when he was scared). I cared a lot about this horse and I am devastated this happened.
The woman is known for riding in the way of others on jumping lessons. She would ride in front of a jump that another horse was going to jump it when it wasn’t her turn.

I [15 f] ride a quite green horse [7], that has trouble making turns. He has only just started to learn how to jump. The horse isn’t mine and I am training him for the riding school. I have ridden a lot of green horses and problem horses and I would like to say that I am very good for my age.

The accident

It happened during a jumping lesson when I was riding towards two jumps that only had one horse step in between them.
When I was about two steps away from the jump the woman I mentioned earlier, suddenly rode in between the jump. I had only a couple of seconds to decide what to do.
If I had tried to steer my horse to the side he would have definitely fallen over and possibly injured himself or in worst case scenario he would have not been able to make the turn and would have crashed into the side of the jump which was decorated with sharp stars (I shit you not).
If I continued riding forward I would either crash into the other horses hind legs and definitely break them or he would have time to ride past the jump. I chose the latter option and got unlucky.
My horse tends to stretch out a lot after jumps and because I was distracted I forgot to prepare for this. He stretched is front legs out and kicked the other horses hind legs with his front hooves and the other horses hind legs broke. He had to get euthanised.

Now when I think about it, I chose risking a horses life over definitely hurting my horse badly. There is a difference between being right and being an asshole. So reddit AITA?

TLDR: AITA for taking a risk and ending up breaking a horses legs when I could have chosen to badly injure my own horse instead, when the situation was created by the other party?

EDIT: Can you guys specify if it was the fact that I chose my self over her or some other reason that made me TA if you think I am so?

EDIT 2: Remember I made this decision in a split second.
- It was a lower level lesson that I was taking part in just to train this horse.
- I couldn’t have predicted that she would slow down in between the jumps to do a canter change.
-Everyone on the lesson knows we are the trouble equipage.",116,135,0.92

1339,Not the A-hole,"So a little backstory: when I got married I started taking birthcontrol which really messed with my hormones and made me gain weight like crazy. I've since switched to different pills and my body has since calmed down and I've started losing the extra weight but unfortunately it's a slow process. 

I was at my grandma's house for a family party a few months ago and was mingling with my cousins when I walked behind the couch and heard my grandma talking to my cousin (I don't fault him for any of this my grandma has a habit of trapping you in a conversation that you don't want to be in) I heard my name so I thought she was calling to me but before I could respond she said this ""poor Firestarter she has just gained so much weight. She's a sweetheart but she's just not pretty anymore. I'm just waiting for the day that her husband leaves her for it."" 

Incredibly hurt I said ""grandma"" and was going to tell her that that was incredibly out of line for her to say when she turned around and said ""oh hi dear we were just talking about you!"" I just responded with ""ya I heard"" and went home. 

I cried on the way home and my husband felt really bad that he didn't hear it going in (he was in the other room) I haven't spoken to her sense because of how horrible she made me feel about myself. My brother says to just get over it it's just grandma being grandma and it's not that big of deal. And my mom calls me almost every week saying that grandma keeps saying that I don't visit her anymore and it's making her feel bad. 

So AITA for no longer talking to my grandma?

Edit: I have a handful of cousins who refuse to talk to my grandma because of the different things that she's done/said one example is she threw a plate near a toddler's bare feet because his older sister 'refused' to take it because her hands were full so she jokingly said ""you have two legs"" and my grandma flipped",19,27,0.88
1340,Not the A-hole,"So I’m in a weird kind of transitional period right now where I have a need for a place to stay for about 2 months. I didn’t want to sign a 6-month lease and then have to break it, so I was looking for other solutions. 

I have a couple of family members who have a house that they aren’t using for anything, so I asked if I could rent it for a couple of months. I figured that way I got a place to stay and they got money for a house that was otherwise sitting unoccupied. Win-win! My relative said I was welcome to stay there rent-free, but that it needed some work. I’m not a snob, I figure that’s okay. For two months I can survive without hot water and deal with some electrical issues.

It’s probably important to say that nobody except these relatives had seen the inside of the house in years. The week leading up to me needing to move, I tried to get in touch a few times to come by the house and see what it looks like, how much room I would have for stuff, etc. but I kept getting the runaround. The one thing he said is that I probably wouldn’t have room for any of my furniture. Okay, that’s fine. As long as I have room for clothes and toiletries, I can rent storage space for the rest temporarily. 

So I move all of my big stuff into storage and take my clothes over to the house and... holy shit. The phrase “needs work” doesn’t begin to describe this place. It’s not that the house is dilapidated, but it’s so ridiculously full of junk it’s borderline unlivable. I’ve helped clean out a hoarder’s house before, and this is significantly worse. Additionally, he told me that there are probably rats/mice living under the piles of stuff. 

I’m pissed because:

1) knowing the condition that house is in, I wish he would have just said no.

2) I tried to get in and see it for a week with no success. Had I seen it, I would have said no myself.

3) I now have one week to find a new place to stay.

4) I offered to take the money that would have been going towards rent, and use it to hire professional cleaners. They’re dragging their feet about saying yes or no.

I just feel like this whole situation was misrepresented, or at the very least severely understated, and because of that I’m kind of in this bind where I either have to scramble for a new place to stay or live in literal filth for a prolonged period of time. I’m not broke, I could have rented a place but it would just be more convenient to not have to sign a lease. At the same time, I do recognize that they were trying to help and they offered me a free place to stay. But still... AITA?

TL;DR: Two of my relatives offered me a place to stay, but neglected to mention it was a hoarder house. Now I’m scrambling for another option, and pretty pissed about it. AITA?",35,46,0.95
1341,No A-holes here,"So me and my friend are writing a story together about a 16 year old girl in an fantasy/ different world. Her older brother is 24 and adopted. But he was adopted into the family before the girl was even born. And he also basically raised her over half of her life.

She wants him to have romantic feelings for his sister that he 'fights' and overcomes to then support her decision for choosing to marry someone else. Also, nothing physical actually happens between the characters. Just one sided emotional.

But I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in writing that story. None. It feels wrong. It feels like he would be manipulative and gross. Even if nothing happens between them.

 I had already came up with a solution that fixes everything I'm uncomfortable with, makes their relationship deeper and more trusting, and the conflict is instead him breaking the trust by keeping secrets from her that she should have known and being over protective. And also giving him a wife. 

We both came to agree on that part of the plot, but then recently she wants to change it back to the original. And this is originally her story, I am just messing with the story for her to come out with an actual solid plot. I have changed numerous plot lines so they all are cohesive.

But the thing is, I have really fallen in love with this story as I fix plot issues. I genuinely love all the characters, especially the villains. But doing what she wants on this would ruin the character for me.  And I don't want to leave my friend to do the plot on her own as I know how much she has struggled with it. We have gotten in semi arguments about it, and I have held my ground that I refuse to make that a part of the plot.

TLDR: AITA for refusing to write a plot in my friends story that includes an adopted brother falling in love with his younger sister.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, me and her discussed it more and ended up compromising. I liked all of the emotions she was bringing in, but not on that character. So we pushed those emotions onto another guy, who is an actual childhood friend, and not her adopted brother.

 I also explained more about a brother sister relationship to her, (she doesn't have a brother) and how impactful having him as an actual older brother would be beneficial to the plot, and she ended up agreeing. She had always thought of them more as childhood friends.

Btw, the whole brother sister relationship is just a minute part of the plot. But overall we both feel this compromise makes the story more interesting and heart felt, than bordering on creepy. We intend on actually selling the final product, so I really don't want people to get creeped out and stop reading.

And thank you to those especially pointing out that this is her story, and if she doesn't want to change something, then I shouldn't force her. I care very much about her, and wouldn't force her to do anything she didn't want to do, and she feels the same for me.

1344,Asshole,"So this happened about a month ago. I work at a restaurant that has a convenience store in the front of the building where we sell ice cream, merchandise, candy, etc., and I was manning it that day.

I greet him and he walks over, hands me change and says ""For a refill"" (we do cheap refills for those who bring in our large cups or yetis or the like). I say ok sure and start counting while he goes and fills his cup. The total price of a refill is 81¢ after sales tax and he only gave 80¢. 

I politely ask him for the last penny and he looks at me like I insulted his mother and says ""Uh, no. You're not getting that penny."" I reply with ""Well sir I need that last penny or I can't let you leave."" He starts going on about how he's a regular here and is close with some of the employees who have been here longer than I have. I've never seen this guy before in my life so why should I believe him at all? Not to mention the fact that he walked in like he owned the place. Finally he says ""Is (employee) here? I'll get you your damn penny.""

 As he walks towards the actual restaurant, employee is walking towards the front. I hear them talking until I hear employee yell out ""THATONETUBAMAN! What are you doing?!""

So for Easter, my grandparents always host a large dinner for all the family that can come. Last night though, not many people showed up. All but my parents and my uncle said they would not be coming for one reason or another (most had pretty good excuses to be fair to them.). Because of the possible low turn out my parents asked me to come and I agreed. 

&#x200B;

Like we expected, very few showed up. Only me and my parents along with my uncle and his two kids. Enter Jay. Jay is my cousin. She's 19 and she is just finishing up her first year at university. I had been close to jay but according to her brother, she has become super ""pc"" since entering into academia. I understand this. I'm half way through my masters program right now and along with being gay, I have seen how sensitive some people can be. 

&#x200B;

The night started normal as my grandmother finished dinner up. Me, my dad, and my grandpa decided to have some drinks before and talk. One of the jokes my grandfather always would make is that I will make a good housewife one day to a fine business man (He's not homophobic. He's one of the most caring men I know. This joke comes from the fact I made it when I came out and he won't let me live it down). My cousin heard this and came into the room to tell my grandfather that was ""insanely inappropriate and homophobic."" and that he ""should be ashamed he would treat his grandson like that"". Things got really awkward after that and we just drank in silence till dinner. 

&#x200B;

When dinner finally came and we sat down. My grandmother wanted to say grace but my cousin asked if we could to a ""non-denominational prayer"" instead. I scoffed at this and told her to ""lighten up"" because she was acting like an ""entitled millennial princess"". She got mad at me and tried to tell me about how I'm being ""inappropriate"" but I shut her down and told her to ""fuck off with that PC bullshit"". She ended up leaving the table and sitting in the living room while we ate. Her parents left with her pretty quickly after. Before they did though, she sent me a text saying that I had ""internalized homophobia"" and I needed to ""educate myself"". I showed my uncle this and he only apologized before leaving.

Then she told me she was in love with me. Prior to this i had feelings for her but felt like an awful person for having them due to me being friends with her boyfriend so i ignored them. After she told me she loved me she asked what i thought and how i felt. I told her i didnt want to talk about it but she pushed it until i gave her an answer. I eventually told her that i felt the same way, but i felt awful about it. And that regardless of if we end up together i think it’s healthy for her to stop dating him. The next day she felt terrible for saying all that stuff to me because she never wanted to talk about it. Her bf skyped her that night and she told him everything that happened. He was mad and never wanted her to see me again, so i went back home. A few hours later she called and said she doesnt want to never be able to see me again and she told me to come over. I did, and in that time she was screaming and crying saying that she was sorry and she didnt want this and that she should have just broken up with him a long time ago. Around an hour later she skyped him again, i was waiting downstairs for her to get done, but then i got a text from her saying i needed to go home, and that she was never allowed to see me or talk to me again. So here i am, a few days later, miserable, thinking desperately what i can do to fix this. I cant help but feel like im the asshole in this situation, but i dont know why i feel like that.

TLDR: my best friend told me she loved me, i told her i felt the same. Her bf found out and now i cant ever see her again.",37,40,0.79

1350,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I know how the title sounds, but hear it out.

So, I currently live with my boyfriend, he's my best friend, and we spend pretty much all of our free time together, and we both genuinely enjoy each other's company. Only thing is, he's a bit of an attention whore (a fact he openly admits and jokes about).

Recently, he got a new job. More or less the issue comes with the timing of our shifts. He's 8am-6pm with a 45-min hour drive back and forth. I'm 7am-5pm with a 15 min drive. 

Because of this, I'm home when he gets off at 6, and it's become a habit that every day he calls me and talks to me for the 45min-hour drive he takes home. Which I initially didn't mind at all, I thought it was nice. But as a bit of an introvert and a clean freak, I did like to use the brief time as a bit of me time and to straighten up the place before he got home. I decided to compromise and put him on speaker when he called while I cleaned etc. He didn't like that idea though, as he said I wasn't giving him my full attention, which I admittedly wasn't. Last time he called me, he got irritated and hung up because I was in the middle of something and, while I was still listening, I wasn't responding very often.

Would I be the asshole if I told him to just stop calling me and wait to talk to me when he gets home?",89,312,0.97
1351,Not the A-hole,"Context a long time ago, around 8 years ago. We'd gone out to a lake to party with a group of friends. Tempers flared and my good friend took off and left his girlfriend at the house we were staying at saying he was driving home (hours of driving) he'd been drinking, wouldn't answer anyone's calls until he answered my call. I went to go get him and we spoke in his car for about an hour. He ended up coming back and in the am took his girlfriend and went home.

My wife says that I just left her and went partying with my friend. If by partying she thinks sitting in a Safeway parking lot and talking your friend out of driving home drunk, then guilty. Come to find out last night when she was at the house with the girlfriend she was talking to another guy who is a mutual friend. 

""He was funny and sweet to me, and you weren't there."" 

So of course last night when she is mad at me she tells me that she was thinking about sleeping with him that night. We'd been married about 2 years at that point (lake party). And this guy was a blackout drunk who sat out naked and got a sunburn (still is a blackout drunk). I was really hurt, largely because I can't believe anyone would choose this guy over me. And I said ""I'm done with you, with us"" well I screamed it in the car if I'm honest and I regret saying it. She came in this morning and apologized, but I'm still mad and I'm feeling like an asshole, so confirm or deny my feelings please.",139,407,0.94

1353,Asshole,"My wife and I just relocated. It upped my salary considerably and we got a decent amount to help us relocate. She worked at a library as a desk attendant (she doesn't have a library degree or anything) and the library system was small.

With my added salary, we don't really need her to pull in a lot of money. We are happy to live comfortable lower middle class lives, no kids, a few pets, etc. We have enough money in savings for her to be out of work for about a year comfortably, then another year if we're very frugal. I'd be happy if she found another library job, or something similar. 

Last week she went on an interview at a local Catholic Church that needed an admin. assistant. I was skeptical when she went on the interview, but afterwards she told me that it went very well, they asked her back to meet with others. She would be one of two admin. assistants. 

I'm not comfortable with this. For one, I'm an atheist. For two, I know that Catholics stand on the opposite of the political spectrum that we do, and I don't see that working out well. The whole anti choice, anti gay, etc thing is unappealing. I don't want her around that kind of talk all the time, and I absolutely couldn't handle it if I had to listen to her parroting their beliefs. Not to mention working for a corrupt organization like them.

But she wants to go on the second interview and she thinks it would be a great fit. She's not concerned about the differences in ideologies, and said that practically everyone at the library she worked in had varying beliefs and no one really cared. She also thinks it would be good for her to get involved in a community because we're new to the area. But I can see that meaning down the line that we'd be over to someone's house for a Bible Study, or a dinner party where everyone's talking about Jesus, which is not something I'm interested in. I'm not interested in becoming Catholic and I think she's out of her mind if she thinks they won't aggressively try to convert her. 

I don't see any benefits to her working there, just red flags. She sees it as a great opportunity. For whatever reason, she doesn't think the difference in ideology is a big deal, and argued that most corporations she could work for are also corrupt, and that the bad actions of the Catholic Church as a whole don't reflect them on the individual church level. Also that she would like to have a job and that if it's just a temporary one while she looks for something else, at least there's a smaller gap in her resume. I said that if she wants to think about it that way, she could just drive for Lyft or Postmates or something. 

So AITA for not wanting her to go on the second interview or take this kind of job?",55,32,0.82

So me and my wife were out at a family gathering and enjoying ourselves, our son was hanging out with his cousins and just generally enjoying himself. The problem arised when the barbecue came out and my brother began to cook on it. My son being naturally interested in it asked his uncle if he could use the barbecue, my brother (who was just looking out for his safety) told him that it would be unsafe for him. This caused him to kick off and start to literally attack his uncle in a wailing mess. I then ran over at full pace and grabbed him, and proceeded to give him an earful as my parents would have done when I was his age. My wife then came over and started to argue with my brother for not letting him use the barbecue and explaining that my son was autistic and that he wasn't going to do anything but flip a few burgers. My brother then gave me a look of ""what do I do?"". I then had to explain to both my wife and son that it would be unsafe for him to use the barbecue.

My mother and I have an incredibly close relationship. It has always been this way, as me and my family are small and close knit. However, over the last few years (2014-present) things have drastically changed.

Back in 2014 my mother met (for simplicity I'll call him guy) guy on some dating site. Things were okay for the first few months between them, they had fun, laughed, and Guy treated me and my family incredibly well.

Then things went rough. Guy ""develops"" an alcohol problem. He becomes increasingly abusive towards me, my mother and my siblings. Not a night went by where there wasnt an argument between Guy and my mum. 

Several times guy threatened all of us. Guy would basically bully us, calling us names, degrading us, all sorts of nasty things. And the situation only gets worse.

One night me and mum went out to pick up a few things, we came back and the entire house was trashed. Food was all over the house, glasses and bottles smashed, everything possible had been dragged out. This was the breaking point for all of us.

I was under social services as my school caught on to everything what was happening. Social services gave my mother a choice; Get me away from Guy by moving me elsewhere, or get Guy out of our house for good. My mum was blinded by Guy, she chose to keep him in MY home and I got moved to my sisters for a few months. 

While living at my sisters, a few things happened and my mum and Guy split up. She was still infatuated by him and was trying her hardest to get him back.

Over the next few years they were on and off. And I, because I love my mum with everything I have, forgave him everytime she got back with him, and the vicious cycle replayed itself. 

Fast forward to now. Mum is still trying to get him back, and she has been successful. They see each other every weekend and he sometimes comes to our house. Bear in mind, I am now 18 and I have come to see just how vindictive and awful the entire situation is. My mum begs me to forgive him and give him one more chance, saying this will be the last (I have heard this so many times before.) 

I cannot forgive him anymore. I have told her time and time again that I cannot stand him being in the house and I do not want him here, or to even be around him. She just will not accept this and still continues to bring him to the house despite the fact she knows that it puts my anxiety on edge and that I cannot cope with it. Am I the asshole for feeling the way I do?

Tl;Dr my mum keep going back to her abusive ex and I cannot forgive him anymore for the things he has done. She expects me to just drop the way I feel. Aita?",53,283,0.98
1358,Not the A-hole,"A couple of months ago I started dating this girl from one of my uni classes. We hit off pretty well and have had some great fun so far.

However, this weekend, we were discussing the movie ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and I was saying that I enjoyed the movie but didn't like the editing and the fact that Mary just brushed off Freddie's bisexuality and said he was gay.

She basically just brushed it off by saying something like, ""It's kind of true no? Like wasn't he just a gay man who couldn't admit it?"" I replied, ""Not necessarily. There are a lot of bisexual men that aren't ""gay but don't want to admit it.""""

She gave me a bit of a weird look so I felt compelled to tell her that I am bisexual. And then she got quite upset. She said I should have told her and all, and that I've lied to her and that I was an asshole for not letting her know.

I understood where she came from, I just didn't mention because I felt it didn't have any effect on our relationship. I was clearly wrong. I will admit it that I have also avoided saying it because I've been prejudiced by women in the past for being bisexual. 

Anyway, I've finished by saying that it only bothers her because she's homophobic. It was a bit abrupt but it's true imo. There are no reasons to not be with a bisexual men just because he's bisexual other than homophobia. We haven't really spoken since.

EDIT (adding some info that is relevant): I am a monogamous man. I also had a full panel STI check before our sexual relationship and told her that. I've never had MSM (too nervous), but have made out with quite a few men if that's relevant. So when I meant that it wouldn't have an effect on our relationships, it was in terms of health risk, her ability to give blood, whether I'll ""miss men"", etc. Really, it should only affect her if she were biphobic imo.

EDIT 2: I also realize that homophobic was probably not the right word, and that biphobic would have been more appropriate. English isn't my first language and I simply didn't know the term until today.

1360,Not the A-hole,"For background: me (Chinese) and my husband (loosely Jewish) recently had our 3mo daughter and want to make strong traditions for her mixed culture, involving separate Chinese and Jewish naming ceremonies.

I will preface with: my mother is 95% of the time wonderful and loving to our daughter. The problem is, every time she catches wind of us doing anything “Jewish”/really anything with my husband’s family, she gets very upset and emotionally abusive (has always been with prior boyfriends/my brother’s girlfriends’). She will text dozens of times, write multi-page emails in the middle of the night with emotionally abusive language, then the next day she is back to normal like nothing happened.

When we include my parents with his family, my mom is tense, whispers negative comments about them in Chinese to me (in front of them), afterwards sends long paranoid emails about how they did disrespectful/manipulative things “to teach you, for your own good” (I believe she truly thinks she is doing me a service despite a lifetime of me arguing with her that she is not). My husband’s family has always been nothing but loving to us and them.

For our Chinese naming ceremony (traditionally hosted by the mom’s parents), my parents straight up did not invite any of my husband’s family, which is a new low for them - usually they at least pretend to get along. Husband and I are choosing to allow this because his family is aware of the situation and wouldn’t be able to make it anyway.

My question is: WIBTA if I don’t invite my parents to our daughter’s Jewish naming ceremony, set for December in his parents’ hometown (a flight away)? On one hand, it goes against my beliefs and I don’t feel this is right or respectful to any parent, but I also don’t want to continue being unfair to my husband’s side of the family or allow them to be treated so poorly.

1364,,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?

&#x200B;

Last month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.

I have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. 

So I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.

&#x200B;

But when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.

&#x200B;

So I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...",854,10518,0.96

1368,Not the A-hole,"Just as a preface I work as a cashier for a pretty big grocery store, the job sucks most days because some managers are incompetent and like to either micro manage or do absolutely nothing. The job pays less than minimum wage because we have less than 25 employees but everyone still gets about 27 hours a week because people with seniority get the hours (which is fine). This September will be my second year working there.

Now there is a system in place to request days off. Basically you just have to do it at least 2 weeks before the schedule is set but you can do it as far back as 5 months. I had a trip coming up in July that was very important to me. So last November I told every manager I could including the director at the time that I would like to request those days in July off as my vacation I get every year. All of them said it was fine. So I reminded them in December and January that I wanted them again. In February as soon as I could I requested my vacation week in July and reminded them again. I have reminded them at least once a month since. We even got a new director and he said it was fine. Now last week I was talking to a coworker and brought up that I requested these day and he say oh really I was actually planning some thing that week too, I asked him if he requested the days and he said no not yet I'll just wait till the end but they'll give them to me because I have seniority, he then told me that another co worker was going to request that week as well and that she also had seniority. Both these people only have maybe 1 to 3 years on me but seniority is taken very seriously at this job. I later asked the co manager( who makes the schedule) If I could still get those days off and she said she didn't know she would have to see because other people requested it that day. Usually taling a week off isn't a big deal but the problem is that 3 people want to so they may only let 1 maybe 2 go. So I thought if I don't get these vacation days then that's it I'm perfectly ok with losing this job. I drive for uber, postmates, Lyft, doordash, and uber eats, on my time off so I could do that until I find another job or just continue going to school.

So my step kids are 6 and 8. They’ve been in school for 3 + 2 years respectively. My husband and her used to do parent teacher interviews together, however in every single one she’d speak over him when he had questions about the kids learning, how to help them at home, etc, and tell him he’s “dumb” (he’s dyslexic but he doesn’t want his kids to go the same way) and it got to the point where he was ashamed to go in and ask questions. I ended up scheduling my husband and I our own interview times away from his ex, which the school also agreed with and encouraged as they too felt each parent could speak more freely without the other there.

Now to today. The kids have interviews this week. I booked them 4 weeks ago when the slots opened up. It’s been in every newsletter for the last month. Today his ex tells us she hasn’t booked interviews and is demanding to come to ours. We’ve said no and she’s pushing it, saying that I (as their step mother) have less of a right to be there than she does. Which I’m not arguing with, I know she’s their mother and I’m not. But there are still slots open, albeit not within an hour of each other, but again, she’s known for a month and didn’t book and is still refusing to book. Husband considered for a brief moment letting her join us but I stopped him and reminded him why we have our own separate interviews from her.

Am i the asshole for not allowing her to join our interview time with the teachers?",320,3371,0.98
1370,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account, you get the idea.

Some background: My \[32F\] sister \[25F\] recently came back to town after being in and out of my life for basically all of her adult life. She usually makes a brief stop off at my house after she's run into some issue or needs money or a place to stay, and all of this I'm fine with. She has a history of drug and alcohol addiction as well as mental health issues so I try to help her as much as I can, and I do genuinely love her. When she's in town, we get along really well to the point that I'd call us friends.

Most recently since we moved house a couple years ago my sister has had to stay in my daughter's \[15F\] room until I can find her someplace more permanent to stay. In the past my sister has never shown any interest in my daughter but they've actually become quite close, I guess because my daughter is a teenager now. 

Last week they came home together after taking a walk together, and plainly speaking my daughter was drunk. She vomited in the bathroom later that night and woke up with (I assume) her very first hangover. This is not the first incident that I suspect has happened and I hate that my sister thinks it's ok to do this behind my back.

I was livid and confronted my sister who said that she wanted to do it, and it was fine because she (my sister) was supervising. I told her that I didn't want her being a bad example for my daughter and told them both that I didn't want them hanging out anymore. I had my daughter when I was very young and was very much like my sister is now back then, so I think that had an effect on her upbringing.

1373,Asshole,"Throwaway account as my husband knows my real one.

My daughter (14) has been struggling with school, from her grades to bullies, overall her freshman year has been a bust. I’ve done all I can to help her and she arranged to get some extra help with teachers as finals week was approaching. I know she’s been going through a lot and I’ve encouraged her to talk out her feelings with both me and a counselor, but she isn’t very fond of that.

I got a call last week telling me that my daughter had made a “hate list”. Not a hit list, like she intended to hurt anyone, but a list of people that she “hated”. The list mostly included bullies, though there was one teacher on there. This teacher is strict and a bit hard on her, but it does seem to get her butt in gear. My daughter complains about her often, saying that the class is just too hard but she does go for extra help to try to make it better.

I wasn’t sure how to feel about the list. I knew it wasn’t intentionally meant to hurt anyone and she didn’t mean for anyone to find it, a separate teacher admitted that it fell out of my daughter’s bag and that she was obligated to turn it in. Luckily, the vice principal is treating it at face value and believes my daughter when she says it was a list made out of frustration. The VP also told me, however, while she wouldn’t be telling any of the students’ parents, she did inform the teacher that was on the list. I was unsure of why she would do one without the other, but I also didn’t think it was that big of a deal either.

Until I got an e-mail from the teacher on the list. She informed me that she “no longer feels comfortable meeting with (daughter’s name) outside of class” and that if it wasn’t so close to being the end of the year, she’d request for her to be moved. I was in a bit of shock and tried to explain what the list meant, that my daughter was going through a lot and it didn’t make it okay, but she wasn’t a threat. Just a sad teenager. The teacher was still on the fence and eventually told me that the only way she’d meet with my daughter is if she received a letter of apology. I forwarded this to the VP and she did back up this choice.

Now, for all of this stuff, my daughter hasn’t apologized for any of it. She says she knows it was wrong to write in school and that it could’ve been taken the wrong way, but that she also isn’t sorry that she expressed her emotions. I told her what the teacher said and she told me that she’s not going to write the letter. She tells me that it’s wrong that the teacher is being so sensitive.

My husband is sick of hearing this fight. He was harder on my daughter about all this than I was, but at the end of it all, he feels that forcing an apology won’t do any good. AITA here for pushing this? Or should I let it go?

&#x200B;

Edit: So, I want to thank everyone who was honest and up front with me. Many tried to make it seem like I didn’t care about my daughter until this happened which isn’t true. I had fought for her prior, but no one seemed to make a fuss about it until now. I do care about her feelings and overall, want to make it better. My husband and I discussed it today and we’ve decided we’ll leave it in her hands. We’re going to talk to her once more about the situation and explain why writing it (even if she’s not sorry and she doesn't have to be) would be beneficial, but we won’t force her. However, we’ll add that she’s not out of the woods in terms of work and will get her a tutor. 

Also, someone asked why we don’t just switch schools and there’s many reasons (the main two being, it’s the only HS in the area and she doesn’t want to) as to why it’s not possible. Hopefully over the summer we can come up with a new alternative, because everyone should feel safe at school.",171,110,0.88

My sister (who’s going to be a bridesmaid) found out and asked me if we could reschedule the party for noonish. I asked her why and she said it’s because she doesn’t feel safe going into that part of the city at night, because that’s statistically where the most assaults on women happen.

I told her I can call one of my fiancé’s best friends who lived near her to pick her up and drive her over so she can go with him and his wife, and then I’ll personally drive her home after. But she said no, because she just doesn’t want to be in the city fullstop at night. She says dark alleys and alcohol and strange men make her anxious and there will be some combination of that at my party. I basically shrugged to this and said, fine, you can not come if you want but there’s 56 people coming already. I can’t change plans just for you.

Well I thought that was that but she told my mom and my aunts and now everyone is calling me an asshole and bridezilla for not accommodating my sister’s fears. They think I’m being selfish for not moving the party up by a few hours so my sister can go. I think everyone is overreacting but not sure what I should’ve done better.",122,720,0.98

I explained that I don’t want my daughter going to church or experiencing any religious activity till she gets older, my daughter is two. I’m not against spirituality which I explained to my mom and told her I don’t want my daughter growing up having an influence from a religion. I understand she’s only two but my mom was really upset that I said no. Beyond upset. It hurt her feelings deeply.

1378,Not the A-hole,"Granted, this was on April Fools Day so it’s been a while. 
Necessary context: My boyfriend got his dream job across the county, and he asked me to move with him. My career and all my friends were in our hometown, so I was nervous to leave. I told him that for me to make that sort of commitment that I needed to be convinced that he was legitimately invested in us in the long term. For me to drop my whole life to move with him, I needed to make sure we were on the same page in our levels of commitment, especially because I would be financially dependent on him until I finished graduate school. He agreed and convinced me that it was what he wanted. He even went a step further to say that he wanted us to eventually get married. That was enough for me, so I moved. 
Things have been going really well, but after around 4 months in I asked him when he sees us getting married ideally, not that I was in a rush but, again, I think it’s important to be on the same page as your partner in terms of long term wants. He totally avoided the question (just kept saying,”we will” over and over) which kind of concerned me, but I let it go, because I didn’t really care that much. But, like most women I’m sure, I definitely dream of getting proposed to and married some day to “the one.”

A few days later, we went on a drive and ended up at this beautiful shoreline. We got out and it was gorgeous: sunset over the water. I made a comment about how romantic the scene was, and that’s when he did it. He grabbed my hand, got down on one knee and looked into my eyes. It seemed SO real. I kinda of yelped (lol) from the shock, and then he says,”April Fools!!!” And starts laughing his ass off. Like, tears in his eyes laughing so hard. Meanwhile,I am not laughing. I’m crushed. I’m so embarrassed all I can squeak out is,”not funny.” He’s totally confused as to why I’m not laughing, so I tell him it felt like he was making a joke out of something I felt really serious about. He does not understand why it upset me, and has been bringing it up for days now, saying things like,”you know that was funny” and starts laughing all over again. Am I the asshole for getting hurt and upset? Should I just lighten up about this?  

TL;DR: Moved across county to live with bf under assumption our relationship would get more serious. When I ask about marriage he avoids it(even tho previously he brought it up), then fake proposes a few days later. I’m upset, he doesn’t think I should be. AITA?",115,432,0.94
1379,Everyone Sucks,"Let me expand on the question: So my boyfriend and I both work in the tech industry, but he's been in it for much longer than I have. Technology isn't really my passion so, naturally, I am a grandmother when it comes to using my computer. I know, even I don't know how I ended up in the tech industry. Anyways, I was going to start work on an assignment and had a very, very dumb question that I myself felt embarrassed for asking. But, him being my bf for 3 years now, I know I can ask him anything without feeling embarrassed. So, I go ahead and say ""Can I ask you a dumb question?"" he says ""ya?"" I ask my question and he immediately gives me a look like ""did you just ask me if the Earth is flat?"" and goes on to explain the answer to the question in the most condescending and arrogant way possible.

Naturally, I got upset and explained to him that he should not speak to me like that when I'm asking a question to learn something. Like, better late than never right? Sure, it may have been the dumbest possible question I could have asked given that my career is in tech, but if I somehow don't know it, I don't know it; acknowledge that I'm still a student, still learning, and there's more I don't know than I do know.

So then he comes in and apologizes to me saying it was wrong of him to speak to me harshly. That's great, but I don't want to accept his apology because he believes I should not let his ""joking personality"" get to me so much since we've been together so long. It's for the exact reason that we've been together so long that it does get to me: I expect him to know where my insecurities lie and to respect those insecurities. To clarify, I've told him time and time again that I'm insecure of my handicap with computers, being in the tech industry. I feel like the appropriate way for him to behave would have been to simply answer my question, teach me properly if he had the time to do so, and keep whatever rude remarks he had about the situation to himself.

&#x200B;

Update: I realized I was holding a grudge for something so small, and it was because my ego was hurt. We both apologized to each other & communicated our feelings. He understood where I was coming from and said he will be more mindful. Thanks everyone!",54,34,0.88
1380,Not the A-hole,"A little background, I have multiple jobs and one of them is being an EMT. My career goal is to be an EMT/Firefighter and the manager at this job in question knew that ... I told her my plans in my interview. 

Well I had been working as a waitress & bartender at this job 4-5 days a week and 6-7 shifts per week, frequently working 16 hour days and on my days “off” from there working on the ambulance for paid shifts and I’m a volunteer on a fire department too. 

Now the fire department is my favorite, they were the first people I met when I moved and an AWESOME bunch of guys. They’ve never made me feel weird or different for being a female in a male dominated profession and that’s rare... they’re just an amazing bunch of guys. 

Well not long ago, the Chief for this fire department got in an accident. And the day after the accident we learned that his injuries were too severe and he would eventually succumb to them. As you can imagine, I was devastated to hear this, I cried on and off all day and late that evening I called my manager at said restaurant job and as a courtesy (it’s a small small small town) told her what was going on and let her know that he wouldn’t make it and I’d need my shifts covered and she apologized profusely and said absolutely she’d make sure they were covered - no problem. 

He passed away two days later and I asked another bartender to cover my shift that night so I could pay my respects when they escorted his body to the funeral home. I worked that next morning (Wednesday) and told my manager that Sunday was the funeral but Saturday was a private ceremony to pay our respects as a department (for FD and the PD since they work with us frequently) She said that’s fine, that I just needed to find someone to work for me .... which I thought was odd since she had told me she’d make sure my shifts were covered but no biggie 

Well I exhaust the small list of other bartenders and no one is willing to work the weekend so I text my manager and she says to ask in the group chat with every employee... so I do and no one even responds to me at all, which isn’t uncommon when you’re asking them to work but it’s still frustrating 

So Saturday rolls around and I’m hurt and a little pissed and ask the manager what I should do and she says she understands I’m upset but there’s no one else willing to work my shifts and that it’s unfortunate but my responsibility... that she had “missed more award ceremonies” for her sons than she could count and she expected me to be there. 

I responded that this was not at all even close to being the same as a funeral, that I was upset and disappointed in them and said I’m sorry but they’d still need to find coverage for my shift, because I quit

1384,Not the A-hole,"I'm posting because I'm getting very divergent feedback about this from close friends. I am a 38-year old divorced woman with a 4-year old son. I recently began online dating (we divorced about 2 years ago) and signed up for a Match profile. I of course mention my son and that I'm divorced in my profile. So far I've gone on a few casual dates, but I am eventually looking for something serious. I would prefer to get into a relationship with a man who also has children because 1) I want to be with someone who won't be surprised about what parenting actually entails and 2) I would be less worried about being pressured to have another biological child (I have a history of infertility). 

&#x200B;

So I began talking to a man I met on Match, 36 years old, who has three daughters. His kids are a bit older than mine; they are 16, 13, and 12. After some correspondence, we met up for our first date. I was enjoying myself and our conversation, and found myself attracted to him. 

&#x200B;

Then we began talking about our kids. We talked about our custody arrangements with our exes. The man said that he had joint custody with his younger two girls, but his oldest daughter lives out of state. I was confused as to why he had different arrangements for his kids. Turns out he has not one, not two, but three women that he has had children with! (And he has not been married to any of them.)

&#x200B;

When he told me this, I immediately knew I wasn't going to see him again. My ex and I are friendly, and even we have challenges with the co-parenting thing. Negotiating co-parenting as a potential stepmother with three different women (if we were to get to that point) is just not something I want to take on. I'm really not looking for a NSA relationship, so I thought why lead this guy on?

&#x200B;

We parted ways after the date and I didn't say anything then, because I thought maybe he didn't even like me all that much and it would be a moot point. Well of course, he texted me the next day asking me out again. I tried to ghost him for a couple of days, but he called me out. So I finally responded saying that unfortunately I didn't think I could get involved with someone who has children with three different women, due to the logistical challenges all of the communication and arrangements must pose in his life. He hasn't responded.

&#x200B;

Some of my friends say I am being judgmental and making assumptions. They ask whether I would be upset if someone refused to date me because I have ""baggage"" (a son and being divorced). Other friends say that it makes sense I wouldn't want to get involved with someone with this much baggage, as I have to think about my son first and foremost. So, AITA?

1388,No A-holes here,"So I decided to take my dog to a popular local creek. I live in a fairly large southern city, so it being Sunday, there were many people around. It was about a mile and a half to get to the pool area and there were 2 mid twenties women with 2 dogs in front of me. They were fairly far ahead at first, but they walked fairly slow. I'm 6'2', have a big stride and my dog was pulling me to go faster so I inevitably caught up with them. Once I got 20ish feet away from them, one woman kept looking back with a somewhat concerned look, which I immediately got the feeling she thought I was a creep. Her 10lbs. dog at that point walked towards my direction to greet my dog. I made my dog sit because some people get worried about little dogs being around my 75lbs dog. I had him keep sitting after the little dog was called back to the woman to try and keep some space between us and them as she apparently felt uncomfortable by my proximity to them. This bought me about 10 minutes as the pace my dog was setting caught us up to them again.

Once I was about 20ish feet away from them again I thought, ""Fuck it, I'm passing these slow walkers and proceeded to close the space. The women looked like they were taking snapchats, but kept looking over there shoulders at me. At one point, one of the women starts walking backwards, point her phone directly at me, as if she were taking a picture. I was still about 20 feet out, and knew at that point they assumed I was some sort of predator and wanted documentation of my face in case something happened to them? I was both hurt and kinda pissed that I made them feel threatened by simply walking faster than them. At that point I decided I needed to address the situation and announced to them, "" Hey, my dog is pulling me through, is it alright if I pass you guys?"" They said, ""yea, sure."" After I passed them, I could hear the one woman who turned to take a picture of me say, "" well, I didn't even get a picture of him."" I was absolutely mortified. Once we got to the swimming area, I made sure to walk to the farthest side of the area to ensure I was nowhere near them. There were probably about 100 people there and I found myself sitting on an uncomfortable ass rock because I wanted to keep my distance from them. I felt uncomfortable the whole time and kept thinking that if they felt that way, maybe I'm making others around me feel that way.

I am 32 years old, I had sunglasses and a backwards hat on with my beat up vans. I looked like pretty much every other hipster dude in my town just trying to enjoy some solo adventure with my dog, but apparently I either gave off a creepy vibe, or they were a bit overzealous in their actions. I really wanted to confront them about the attempted picture taking, but due to my shy nature and their discomfort, I felt it would have probably made matters worse.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for the responses and advice. My shyness comes off as awkward or sometimes creepy in the right situation; I get it. I'll be more assertive and vocal of my passing women on the trails. Talking to strangers is hard for me sometimes. I got told I'm TA a handful of times, fewer than I was actually expecting. I received a pretty shitty message from a lady telling me to take a different trail and then it ended by her calling me a creep. [https://imgur.com/a/SpimhZg](https://imgur.com/a/SpimhZg)

&#x200B;

And although the general verdict is NAH, I still feel like the action taken against me was a bit extreme. I really think it's more hysteria at play here than rational reactions especially given the foot traffic on the trails that day.  I mean, did the ladies really think there wouldn't be men walking faster than them behind them? I heard some pretty gruesome stories and was told statistics about women being assaulted anywhere from 1 in 4 to 1 in 6. After googling it myself, there seems to be a lot of conflicting numbers floating around out there, I'm no expert, but I'll take the advice given here anyway to avoid being in the predicament I was that day.",363,539,0.97
1389,Not the A-hole,"A couple of my friends and I play Dungeons and Dragons one night a week. We started out with the five of us, including myself then added one more person when we started a new campaign. We are all in the age range of 18-22. We usually switch up between each other’s houses every week. 

The most recent person to join us is a person who has transitioned from a male to a female. I did not know her until about two weeks ago when she joined us. She is a friend of another person in my friend group.

The problem started the first night she played with us. I use words such as ‘bro’ or ‘dude’ when addressing people, regardless of gender. I am a woman and if someone called me ‘bro’ I would literally not care an ounce. She became mad at me because I said: “Bro, use your ‘spell that I can’t remember now’!” and again later when I said “Hey dude, can you pass me my drink?”

She called me insensitive because she identifies as a woman now and doesn’t want to be referred to as a male. That wasn’t my intention at all, and is just how I speak. When I have spoke to her or about her, I am very good about only adressing her as ‘she’ or ‘her’. I apologized to her, even though I didn’t feel as if I was in the wrong, because again I speak to everyone that way.  I stopped talking to her directly for the rest of the night because I didn’t want to have to worry about saying anything else to offend her. 

After the first time she played with us, she texted her friend who introduced her to our friend group and told him that she thinks I am a bigot and transphobic.  Which I am not, she shouldn’t expect me to change my way of speaking just to accommodate her and her way of life and resort to calling me a bigot just because I slipped up. 

I was pretty offended to be called transphobic just because I dropped the word ‘bro’ or ‘dude’ once during the night. I wasn’t using any slurs or derogatory speech towards her, again this is just how I have spoken for the past 20 years. This week we decided to play at my house and I texted in our group chat that she was more than welcome to come, however I wouldn’t be censoring myself in my own home and if she didn’t like that then she wasn’t invited to join. 3 of my friends said that I was totally in the right, however the other two think I’m being an asshole and could go a couple hours without saying ‘bro’ or ‘dude’. 

I feel like that’s not the point, and I should be able to enjoy myself with my friends, without worrying about using an innocent word and offending someone.  So AITA?",1442,4175,0.88

1396,Not the A-hole,"For starters, I'm 17. Ever since I was a little kid, my grandparents would give me the generic birthday/christmas money, and me, being super indecisive, would just save up. Keep in mind I never had an allowance or anything. When I was 12, I decided to take that money and buy a laptop because my family had one big computer from the early 2000s that only ran internet explorer, and (more importantly to my 12y.o. self) wouldn't run Minecraft (haha). 

Fast forward to now and I still have the only real ""functioning"" computer in the house. Now my parents have enough money to get a computer, they just use it on other thing. It'd be no big deal, except they act like it's theirs. They ""ask"" to use it but will yell at me or ground me if they can't. My brother uses it for homework, my parents use it for taxes, my dad uses it for who knows what, I just know he has more on it than I do. I'm not even allowed to update it from Windows 8 because anything else is ""too confusing for them,"" even if 8 won't run programs I need. My parents have known the password to my computer since I got it, so I often come home to them using it without even asking. I mean, they're my parents, but I bought and paid for this! I really want to update it and use it, but even I'm doing something and they deem their objective more important than mine, I'm kicked off. 

Side-note, also a little peeved they talk about buying my brother a gaming computer because a. I HAD to pay for mine on my own. b. they will still use mine for everything and c. my brother is VERY irresponsible with electronics (like my father), and I know he will break it and use mine again. 

I'm not sure if I'll get to take it with me when I go to college, or if they have to much ""important stuff"" on there that I'll have to get a new one. 

Basically, I just want to be able to use my laptop again. Its come to the point where I've been kicked out of my room while on the phone with a friend because my dad would get distracted with me talking and it was too much of a hassle to unplug and move a laptop.

1397,Not the A-hole,"So this happened last night. I got to my boyfriend's house pretty late after work, and ended up having to leave again to go grab an overnight parking pass down the street. As I was leaving there was a car parked outside with a man sitting on the curb next to it. I continued walking to my car and as I crossed the street I got a huge whiff of alcohol and turned back. There was a woman sitting in the front seat clearly drunk, with the driver's side door open. She had vomited out of the side of the car. 

I didn't really give it any thought at first but then my mind started racing as I was driving to the parking kiosk. I was thinking ""what if she drives off and ends up hurting herself or someone else?"" ""what would I want someone to do if that was my mom or sister in the car?"". Both my mom and sister drink heavily and do drive under the influence sometimes and it scares the fuck out of me constantly. 

I was thinking of different things I could do, like call her and the guy lyft to get home (but I only had cash on me), or maybe call them a taxi. I ended up convincing myself the best thing to do would be to call the cops to go check on them- I figured she wouldn't get in too much trouble because she wasn't actually driving and the car was parked. I called and talked to someone and they asked if I wanted to leave my contact info in case the cops needed it. I left my name and phone number and the cops called shortly after. They asked me if I was in the car with the woman to which I told them no. Then they asked if I saw her driving the car, to which I again told them no. I let them know I mainly called because I wanted to make sure she was going to be okay and not drive off and potentially hurt someone. 

As I was pulling back up to my boyfriend's house the cops pulled up also. I walked across the street up to my boyfriend's house without saying anything, I figured they had it handled from there. Everything appeared to be fine, no one got taken away in handcuffs and I believe the cops may have actually given them a ride home. Her car was left there overnight (not impounded or anything) and I'm assuming they picked it up sometime this morning as it was gone when I left for work. The cops gave me a call back before they took off last night, thanked me for calling it in, and most importantly let me know that she was okay.

1398,Everyone Sucks,"I'm 17 and my brother is 16. I'm only one year older than him. I feel like he doesn't have a path and is wasting his days. He is failing school and his days are spent playing the PS4 every single day for the entire the day. Literally everyday after school he doesn't study or do homework and just play fortnite or Minecraft until 3AM. As a result he is doing so badly in school. He had a surgery for
 Scoliosis one year ago and I really do feel bad but he practically gave up everything after that. He doesn't do his art anymore and he does not do any of the exercises the physiotherapist gives him. I don't think sitting down for very very long periods of time playing PS4 is helping him either. I go on walks every day after school to refresh my brain and I always ask him to tag along but he snaps back at me like I'm trying to hurt him or something. My parents are easy on him because of this surgery he had last year

Anyways what I did today was I banned him for using my PS4, told him to suck it up and stop feeling sorry for himself and do something with his life. I said I would tutor him but he snapped back. The PS4 and the games are mine after all since I bought them. I think he needs to start doing things for himself again. He might have to repeat school. So I banned him for the PS4 and put all the games and the dualshock in a locker I have. He got so so angry and threw multiple plates at me and it smashed into pieces everywhere. My mom is saying that it's my fault that I made him angry and that I'm being inconsiderate since I don't have Scoliosis and she made me clean it up

1399,Not the A-hole,"Just a quick aside: I grew up in a neglectful and abusive home. While I do my best to be polite, sometimes I miss the mark. This sub has been an invaluable tool for me to gauge when I'm in the wrong, and how to better my behavior. So I'm sorry if my post ever seems dumb.

So, I have been strictly no contact with my family for years. However, my husband is very close to his family. They've all done a really good job of making me feel loved, and I really like spending time with all of them. 

We are exceptionally close with his younger sister. She's in her early twenties, and a single mom. Her son, (my nephew) is a really great 3 yr old kid. My husband and I often volunteer to take him for the day when she works weekends. We've earned the coveted title of ""favorite uncles"", and I'm pretty proud of that. 

My SIL went to take him to an egg hunt yesterday. They got there, and the older kids kind of pushed him out of the way. He didn't get a single egg. He was heart broken. And when he came over that evening, he cried while telling me about it.

Guys, it broke my heart. 

We told her to bring him by on Easter. She told him that the Easter bunny got confused and came to our house instead.

I'll admit to going overboard. We hid a total of six dozen eggs. Each filled with his favorite candy, a toy, a tattoo, or some stickers. We also got him two **huge** eggs, one with a stuffed animal that we knew he would love, and one with some gold dollar coins. Lastly, we got him a huge amount of bubbles.

We had a great day. They came over at 8am, and they didn't leave until about 1pm. She sent me a message saying that she appreciates everything we do for him.

And then she tagged me in her Facebook post about it. She had pictures of him with a few of his things, and a pile of Easter eggs. It just said ""Thanks [our names] you saved Easter."" At first it was all cute comments from family. But then one of my husband's cousins, whom I've never met, left a nasty comment saying ""Nice of you to post this. [Her daughter's name] saw it, and wants to know why [my nephew's name] got so much and she got so little. Maybe consider who may see it before you post something like this. Most kids would never get this much.""

I've been feeling bad about the whole thing since it happened. Part of me thinks she has a point. Maybe we shouldn't spoil him so much, there are kids that don't get much, and this may make them feel bad. On the other hand, why can't I spoil my one and only nephew? (No nieces, he is the only small kid in the family.) Does that really make me an asshole?

**Edit**

**I got curious, because some comments were asking about the girl's age. After talking with my husband, I found out that the daughter is 12, but has some really severe learning disabilities.**

**I also learned that her family and my husband's family haven't really spoken in about a decade. They had a falling out when this woman's dad got black out drunk at Christmas and tried to fight everyone there. They had to call the cops, after the situation cane to blows.**

**His kids (the cousin who complained and her siblings) claim it could have been handled better, and there was no reason to involve the police. My husband's family disagrees.**",121,491,0.96

My girlfriend is the worst driver you’ve ever seen. 

She runs reds lights, drives way too fast, tailgates and is so unaware of her surroundings. 

Last night we were on our way home from dinner and she had to drive since I had some drinks. 

We were at a four way stop and she didn’t even look in all directions until a huge pick up truck almost slammed into the side of us with the horn blaring. 

All she said was “Why didn’t they stop?” I got really pissed and said that they had the right of way and she wasn’t paying attention. She just dismissed what I said with an “Oh well.”

When we got home I waited until she went to bed and I hid the keys where I know she would never think to look. 

When she woke up the this morning she asked me if I knew where the keys were and I said that from now on I would be driving her to and from work and wherever she needs to go until she takes driving lessons. 

She freaked out and told me that I had no right to do this but I told her that we could’ve been seriously hurt or killed yesterday and she doesn’t even see what the problem was with her driving yesterday. 

She tore the house apart trying to find the keys but she never found them. 

I drove her to her family’s house for Easter dinner today and I picked her up about an hour ago. 

She is super pissed at me but I think I’m within my right here considering she almost hurt us yesterday with her driving. 

So AITA for not letting her drive until she takes driving lessons?",341,340,0.95

- belittled and called my mother names;
- gone back time and again to their insane mother (my dad’s first wife) who at one point threatened to kill me and mum, has abused both of them physically and emotionally and has stolen over a £100,000 from my sister:
- my brother’s actions send me into depression when I was a teen (he treated me like a sister and then completely abandoned me without any warning or explanation);
- both of them have abandoned my dad after his car accident which left him needing care for almost half a year.

My dad left when I was three years old for a another woman.

My mom took it hard. I was sent to live with my grandparents shortly after.

Don’t get me wrong, I had a good childhood.

Only thing missing in my life were my parents. I seen my mom once a month and holidays. (She didn’t want kids in the first place).

When my dad remarried his current wife already had four kids who dad passed away in a car accident. After two years of marriage he adopted them.

But my dad didn’t try any relationship with me, and he didn’t even tell his family I existed. Well he and his brother(who I see once a year and he takes me camping.)  Got into a huge fight, and he brought me up to his whole family.

My adopted sibling, and two younger half-siblings were shocked they had a secret sister.

Anyway my adopted sister who is the same age as me added me on Facebook.  I accepted thinking she was a second cousin, and I wanted to get to know my dad family more.

I told her to go enjoy your perfect family you don’t need me, and I blocked her on Facebook. My uncle gave my dad my number because he wanted to talk to me.

I didn’t pick up the phone, but he left me a voicemail on how I made my adopted sister cry.

&#x200B;

Soon after they arrived, his wife came up to my wife, her sister, her brother-in-law, and I, and told us that she really wanted the four of us to attend her performance in a community play.  She told us that we could all go for a date night, and that she brought tickets for us.

  
We told her that we'd be happy to go (happy being a polite embellishment), and asked when.  She mentioned a list of about 8 different performances, and we picked one.

She then thanked us, and I wandered off to check on my son.  While I was gone, she apparently informed my wife that we could write a check, because the tickets were $26 a piece.

I came back right as my wife was making out the check.  My niece turned to me and said ""\[your wife\] was just like 'sure, I'll go! even though it's $50... that's just great!""  Well yeah, that's because she didn't tell us until after we said yes!

I was pissed when I found out, and my wife was pretty upset, too.  We don't really have $50 to toss out for a play that we know nothing about, and we only agreed to go because my niece told us how much she wanted us to go. We assumed we would be going as a sign of polite support of her performance; not a financial contribution to her production.

1409,Asshole,"My girlfriend (21) and I (22) have been together for about three years now. We met while we were both in our freshmen years of college; I'm studying engineering while she's been studying to become a doctor.

In the past few months, my girlfriend has been studying intensely in preparation of the MCAT. She studied for a little over a month before the actual day she'd take the test, but she took that month very seriously. She dedicated virtually all of her free time to studying and basically cut herself off from hanging out with friends or going out. And over the time she was studying, she developed a nervous tic.

Her tics involve exaggerated blinking and eye movement (she's either opening her eyes real wide or slamming them shut) and constant fidgeting with her jaw. I noticed them developing early into her study period, but I chose not to mention it to her because I assumed she developed it from all her hard work studying, and I didn't want to shame her or deter her from studying. So I let it go.

Well, she took the test this past weekend and has now basically returned to her regular routine. One thing though - her tics remained. I thought they would slowly dissipate because the stress of the test is gone, but a week in, it's here.

And it's been really annoying for the both of us. I chose to refrain from bringing it up in the days following the test, but eventually, I just had to. I asked her what was up with her tic and why it wouldn't go away. She said she had no control over it and that she was trying her best to suppress it.

So for that day, every time I caught her doing her tic, I would call it out. Eventually, she got really mad and told me to stop. So I stopped.

But it still doesn't avoid the fact that her tic is a real big turn off for me. Especially during when we have sex, it doesn't look pretty to see your girlfriend's eyes spasming while you're looking down at her. In fact, the tic is really affecting the way I see her. I see her tic as detracting from her beauty, even though I really don't want it to. It's gotten so bad to the point where I kind of resent her, which is why I want a break up.

1411,No A-holes here,"To start, I am a 20 Y/O guy, about to go into my fourth and final year of college. In previous years, I have been a Resident Assistant on the campus at which I go. My tuition has been paid for though the generosity of my parents, as well as a $100 dollar stipend they give me to help pay for groceries. They also pay for a portion of my car insurance, which is due semi-annually. This year, I am not returning to the RA position and therefore needed a place to live.  Being that it is late in the leasing season, and that everyone I know already has living arrangements my options were thus;

1: Live somewhere that does random roommate matching and live with with people I don't know for the fourth year in a row, or

2: get a place with my current girlfriend of a year and a half and split rent.

My parents have made it clear in the past that they don't approve of co-habitation before marriage and that they will stop giving me any financial support if I choose to pursue the latter option.

I have HATED living with random roommates, it has been the worst part of my college career thus far. Ive managed to get terrible roommates who don't clean, leave trash everywhere, smoke in our apartment, etc. I spend as much time as I possibly can outside of my own room, and I'm pretty sick of it. Ill be graduating with an engineering degree in just over a year, hopefully setting me up to make a decent amount of money post college. In the end, I signed a lease with my Girlfriend and we are moving in early august. I am also working two jobs over the summer to save up as much as possible for the coming year. After telling my parents, they made sure I was aware that I would have to find the money to pay for my own tuition, rent, food, car insurance, etc, and then spent 20 mins basically making me feel like the Asshole for ""throwing away thousands of dollars"" and not just ""dealing with it for another 9 months"" so that I  could instead ""Go play house"" with my girlfriend. I'm personally tired of feeling like they are holding their money over my head, and between my jobs and the loans Ill have to take out, I will still be far better off than most students after they graduate.

So, whats up? Am I the asshole for not just biting the bullet and living with people I don't know, or are they over reacting about this whole moving in thing?

For one, I work at a hospital myself, and I know for a fact that hospital nurses, the front desk receptionists, operators etc are usually more than happy to accommodate things like that, there is no need to ask strangers for their phones. For another thing, I work with a lot a drug addicts, and I couldn't help but notice she had a LOT of the little tells that indicated addiction. I mention this not to be judgmental, but because sadly a very common scam among addicts is to go to hospitals and ask for phones because they need rides, only to end up stealing the phones; the scarier ones will even ask for rides and then mug whichever good Samaritans fall for the act.

I’ve addressed this with them multiple times, sent emails and letters (which I’ve made copies of) yet it still keeps happening. Where I live parking spaces are a premium and the cost of parking at a meter/a garage is through the roof.

I’ve started calling/towing when their daughter parks in my space, and have got her ticketed/towed (once) and got angry messages from the parents. A few of my neighbors have also gotten angry with me. The house is vacant most days, but it’s still my property and neither me nor my relatives should have to pay for alternative options because she parks there for convenience sake.

She’s in college so I don’t want to sue her, but I may have to (even small claims court or something), I assume her parents will cover the settlement costs anyway but it’s mostly about getting her to finally stop.

How this was resolved IRL: I came to the house and she was parked there, so I told her parents she shouldn’t do that going forward because people are often there and it’s quite expensive to find alternative parking. Some time later I caught her parking there again. I said “Hey, look, I don’t care if you park here when I’m not home but I need you to move your car before I get back or I’ll be forced to have it towed”.

You’re 40 years old, why are you acting like you’re 14. Not only that but they didn’t sell mozzarella sticks and I got embarrassed. I got upset and told her to check next time. 

She made me baby sit my sister so she can hang out with girls half her age at the bazaar. I have friends who are older than me and can be my mother but my mom gets angry when I hang out with them. 

She acts completely different around them and always glares at me to shut up. She acts all “sassy” and “strong independent woman-like”. She was talking about how she wanted to become a therapist because people already come to her to talk so she “might as well start charging them” and said how she wanted to help teens. Which is ironic because she’s straight up said that she doesn’t care about my anxiety attacks and how I’ve been told by two doctors to go to a psychiatrist and said that “it’s a phase” (it’s been 4 years) and that I just need to wait one more year. 

I confronted her about it and she said that they’re happy to see her and smiling and that’s why she likes them. I’m just bitter that I’ve known this woman for 16 years and our relationship is SHIT. While she’s met these girls for a few months and they speak so highly of her and how kind and caring she was to them. She hugs them more than she hugs me. I don’t care if she’s friends with them, I’m just embarrassed that I feel like she cares more about them. It’s like she’s completely given up on our relationship and is just having “new daughters”. 

Am I the asshole for thinking of it this way?",26,73,0.95

1429,Not the A-hole,"So I feel like this may come off as a shit post but it really isn't.

My brother is 14 and has 2 Guinea pigs. He checks on them every morning and night and plays with them. I don't like Guinea pigs and told my mom and my brother that when we got the first one, and told them they're not gonna be my responsibility. (important cause my brothers hamster became my responsibility as well. Didn't mind since I had my own 2 little guys and love hamsters.)

I just came home from work and my brother casually tells me ""oh yeah and apparently the Guinea pigs haven't had water in days. The only water they got was from their veggies."" They could've died of dehydration. I told him that's super irresponsible and he got defensive and told me he thought mom was giving them water. They're not her pets. I told him that's no excuse and they're his responsibility.

Both my mother and my brother got mad at me for being insensitive, and saying it was just a mistake. A mistake. Two little lives could've been lost because of this 'mistake'.

They got really mad, and my mom kept yelling so I got pissed too. Said some mean things, and repeated about how they could've literally been dead. Then my brother, I shit you not, said ""jump out of a window"". I'm still baffled by this. He told me it would be nice and quiet then so I told him ""yeah then you'd have a dead brother and 2 dead Guinea pigs. I see how it is"". This was a thing for about 30 minutes so I'm just trying to point out some key things.

I definitely said some mean things just to try and get through their thick skulls about how bad this was. And they said some incredibly mean things to me, such as my mother calling me an asshole with a lot of other stuff. It was a bit heated so it's hard to recall EVERYTHING. A decent example:

Mom: can you SHUT UP!?

Brother: no he cant. 

Me: at least I can take fucking care of my animals.

Stuff like that.

They're both incredibly pissed at me and I honest to God can't get over the fact that we could've had to Bury these two young piggies because of his irresponsibility. I just wanna see some third party opinions on the situation. AITA?

1431,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I got married over the summer. He has a 6 year old daughter, whose bio mom passed away when she was an infant. I’ve been involved in her life since she was a year and a half, and have lived with her/been her maternal figure since she was 3. She knows I’m not her bio mom but I’ve done my best to make her feel like my daughter. She calls me mom and everything, but sometimes it still comes up that I’m not her “”””real”””” mom.

I’m about 18 weeks pregnant right now. It was a surprise but not unwelcome. My husband and I told my daughter recently and she seemed pretty happy about it. There were no major issues.

A few days ago, she asked me where the baby was going to sleep, and I told her I didn’t know, and we might have to find a new place to live to fit the baby. I didn’t think this was a huge deal because we told her when we moved in that this apartment was going to be temporary and we were only going to live there for a year or so. She’s not particularly attached to it and wants to live in a house. 

When I told her this she just kind of nodded and walked away so I didn’t think anything of it. We went to dinner at my husband’s parents’ house last night and my daughter asked her grandparents if she could move in with them because she had to move somewhere else to make room for my husband’s and my “real” baby. I immediately started crying because I felt terrible that she even thought I’d kick her out because she’s not my bio child. My Father in Law became irate and yelled at me that I was trying to manipulate his granddaughter by crying and making it about me. My husband grabbed us both and left. We talked to our daughter and then my husband stayed to talk to her alone and I fell asleep before he came to bed, and now he’s at work.

Everything you say is a slight against her. Every comment or noise gets an anxious look. She butts into every conversation with her opinion, and then every non agreement upsets her to the point she must make a dramatic exit.

Three years ago she and my uncle divorced. She'd been cheating on him almost their entire marriage. She admitted to cheating on him in front of my grandmother, and then threatened to take her own life. I feel like this was only mentioned to get her out of trouble as in the three years since it's never come up again.

I can't forgive her. She's irritating to be around to begin with, petty I know but 23 years wears on a person. She's never apologized for her behavior, or otherwise acknowledged she had a hand in ruining her relationship. She moved back in with my grandmother and brought her cats who have destroyed my grandmother's house. She abuses their hospitality by staying out late, drinking and doing drugs, and making them worry.

I feel my feelings of dislike are justified, but looking at her, knowing that something mentally is wrong with her, I've been wavering. She's at Easter today and I can't look at her. Tell me, reddit, am I the asshole?",13,62,0.91

So I heard and listened to everyone’s comments about how unfairly I was treating Jeff. 

I told my mom that I wasn’t comfortable forcing Jeff to help out with the funeral and that she should just drop it. 

My mom threw out comments like “This is typical of Jeff” and “He’s always been this selfish”. I told her she needs to just let it go and leave Jeff out of it. 

We had the funeral. I could tell Mom was upset that Jeff wasn’t there but it was a nice considering the circumstances. 

After the funeral I checked my phone and I saw that I had a missed call from Jeff. When I listened to the message Jeff was drunk and was saying how we should’ve just left him out of all of this and that he hopes the “bastard rots”. 

It was honestly really upsetting to listen to and there’s no way I’ll tell Mom about the message. I thought about calling him back but I figured he just needed to vent and I would make things worse. 

I tried to go see him since the funeral but he was either not home or letting me in the house. I don’t know what to do. Maybe he just needs some time.

1438,Not the A-hole,"Me and my friends are pretty young and very dumb- so naturally, we decided to celebrate 4/20 yesterday. We said that we would hang out from 2 - 5:30 or so, but I told them that they definitively had to be gone by 5:30 because my brother was coming home at that time and I wanted to spend time with him. They were ok with this and said that if they were still not good to drive by then they could just walk around.
The problem was that when the time came, they started asking me to let them stay. When I told them no, they said that they could just hang out in our downstairs and that my brother wouldn't even know they were there. However, I still wasn't comfortable with this and told them definitively that they had to go. They started getting angry at me and saying that I wanted them to drive high (which is not at all the case, I just wasn't comfortable with them sticking around at my house without me there). Then they started to leave and I told them they didn't have to yet because he was late, but one of them said ""I don't want to be somewhere I'm not welcome"". I asked if they would help me clean up (cause we made kind of a mess) and the other said ""only if you let us stay"" and I told them no. Then they both left.
The thing is that they came back 5 minutes later, and I opened the door for them and they walked into our sitting room and started talking while I kept cleaning up and I could tell they were still pissed at me. One of my friends was crying which I felt bad about but also I really wanted them to leave when my brother got home, which they ended up doing.
One of my friends ended up saying that she understood why I wanted them to leave but it felt like I wanted them to drive while they were high and was kicking them out (even though I explicitly told them I did NOT want them to drive high).

1443,Not the A-hole,"Ive had my dogs since before we were together. We got together in HS and now decided to live together as we attend uni in the same state.

I chose to take my dogs with me because they were always MY dogs, i took care of them, fed them, trained them. Moreover, they ***feel*** mine. They love me more than anyone in my family, follow me even to the bathroom. They are super well behaved but also I have to admit they are very possessive of me, wanting to hug all the time (as in lay against me while they sleep) 2 of them are super small, one is medium sized, all mutts.

My bf wasnt excited to live with them but he wasnt against it either.

But now he is, 4 months into our living together he told me an ultimatum - either I send the dogs to my parents/shelter/new owner or he leaves. 

As arguments he presented that they have to sleep in our bedroom ( they do, but they don't sleep on the bed, they have their own small dog beds) so he cant focus while having sex, they are always near me, that they lick me and I kiss their foreheads - both of which he finds disgusting - and that out flat is too small anyway to have 3 dogs in it. When i said he had no problem before we moved in, he claimed he thought i will come to my senses already and ""besides, you wouldnt move in if I told you to leave your dogs and I love you too much to live away from you""

I was heartbroken but when he said he will leave if I dont get rid of the dogs, I packed my stuff and moved to my friend's flat. She was looking for a roommate anyway (thankfully) and accepted the dogs. 

I thought we were over, cried my heart out for a week and now after 2 weeks he called me and said he ""made a mistake"" but that he was hurt I loved dogs more than him. My whole family is on his side. Even my friend said I overreacted and that they would be mad too if ""i broke up with them over a dog"".

1448,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, cause paranoid.

My sister (19) and I (29) are both diagnosed with depression (I’m in therapy, she’s currently not). I planned a trip to London to see a musical, talked to her and she wanted to come with me. Since I know she doesn’t make much money, I said I would pay for the flights and hotel. 

Now to the situation: most of the day yesterday, she was kind of miserable. No matter what we did, she was pulling faces and complained a lot. She didn’t want to come to the musical, said she was going to entertain herself til it was over, and afterwards she complained that she couldn’t sit down (she didn’t go somewhere for a coffee like I suggested because she feels judged sitting somewhere alone). We went to several places she wanted to go and she disliked it. We then went to a drag show and there she complained that the queens took 10-15 minute breaks between numbers. That’s when it was too much for me, I confronted her when we came back to the hotel because I wanted her to have a good time and her constant pouting brought me down with her.

She said I have to understand because that’s just how her depression works. And yeah, I get that, depression is a bitch. But I came to have a good time and I think she could make an effort to try and enjoy the holiday I’m trying real hard to make great for her. 

She is as of now sulking in our hotel room while I’m out doing the things we wanted to do alone. She’s not speaking to me. My mum called me and she is freaking mad that i left my sister at the hotel (I asked her to come twice before leaving and called her to come after I was gone) and says I should just apologise.

Tl,dr: my sister is miserable on a holiday I paid for and says it’s because of her deression and I need to be more considerate. Now we don’t talk and I’m doing everything alone.

I told my mom this last night and she said no, we are actually going to my sisters college.

Normally, I’d be okay with this if she had told me a couple days or a week beforehand and would gladly go, but she didn’t until I mentioned plans with my dad. Another reason I’m upset about this is my sister is coming home from college in less than 2 weeks, so I don’t see why we should be going 3 hours away and then 3 hours back in one day for her to come back in 2 weeks anyway. I’m aware I put my mom in a similar situation by telling her I had plans the night before, but at that time I had no idea she was hiding this trip. This morning I woke up to texts from her telling me that we weren’t going anymore but that I was being disrespectful and should do whatever she says without questioning it, which I feel is unfair.

1452,Not the A-hole,"At dinner tonight, SO and I went to a back-street alley where the restaurants are usually cash only. We didn’t have a lot of cash on us, but I saw on one of the shop’s name sign, it had Apple Pay - so we decided to go in and eat. Also it was a Korean restaurant I had eaten at before a few years ago and I was craving Korean. 

We order and my SO is already visibly annoyed because he thinks I could’ve chosen a healthier option (we typically try to avoid soy oil and I ordered a stone pot rice which can be greasy). Anyways, food comes and it didn’t look that great. Didn’t taste great either, so the mood was pretty stale. 

When I get up to pay, asked to pay on Apple Pay and the staff said they were cash only. I asked about the sign, and he said it was an old sign and they hadn’t updated it. 

At this point, I’m thinking, well, I’ll go get cash out around the corner and come back to pay. SO walks up and asks what’s the matter, I tell him and he thinks it’s the shop’s fault and we shouldn’t have to pay the different (we were a few dollars short). He started getting loud and I told him to stop, then he turns to me and says that I’m never willing to stand up for myself. He then says that I don’t value my time, because this is something the staff could fix and just let us go. 

I was getting really embarrassed because it’s a tight space and the other patrons were looking at us. I ended up getting cash and came back to pay. 

SO and I got into a heated argument outside the shop - I thought he behaved rudely and there was no need to make a scene - he thought I could’ve stood up for us and not wasted our time getting money and going back. 

I don’t feel like I’m the asshole here, but should I have stood my ground and complained to the staff / demanded that they just take whatever cash we had and let us go? 

Am I in the wrong to have felt so embarrassed? I do have a tendency to hate causing a scene at any cost, whereas SO tends to be hotheaded. But I think he didn’t need to get loud and that’s why I think he’s TA.

1455,Everyone Sucks,"So I knew this girl for a long time who I kinda grew up with, let's just call her Emily. So throughout secondary school me and Emily were kinda on and off every now and then, not fully going out but having light fun here and there. Then when we were about 16 it got a little more serious. We were each other's first time for everything up to sex, which we didn't have at that stage, and it was fun, but called it quits after a while. Then I got a girlfriend for a year, and I lost my virginity to her. That relationship ended really badly, and fast forward to when me and Emily are both 18 and in our final year of school. We were all out at the club one night and got drunk, then I ended up going back to Emily's house and we had sex. After that, we were kinda friends with benefits, having sex and other stuff often enough, but at the beginning before we did anything I said to her I didn't want a relationship because of the bad experience I had in the past, and was done with that stuff, to which she said no problem. So we weren't exclusive, yet she would get jealous any time I would mention another girl even though we are not together. Then one night she got with another guy, which I was fine with because like I said, we weren't going out. Then on New Years Eve, I got with another girl, and Emily saw us, and spent the night crying in the bathroom with her friends, and she wouldn't speak to me for a while. Then we made up and said it was fine for us to get with other people (our original agreement) and continued our FWB thing. I got with another girl then, and she absolutely cut me off, blocked me on everything and then got with other lads which I didn't mind, because that was our thing. I decided to end our FWB for good because she kept getting upset if I got with someone else, even though it was okay for her to do it. Now, any time we all go out to the club or anywhere, and I just do my thing and get with girls, Emily always ends up crying when she sees it even though we ended like 4 months ago, and even her friends are just like ""she needs to cop on"". So AITA for continuing to get with other people and moving on, while Emily still gets upset?

Edit: Also, she has rang me when she was drunk before and asked me to get back together and I've said no outright to her, because it's not okay for us to be FWB because although I see it as just that, she clearly wanted more and can't handle just the FWB

1456,Not the A-hole,"Hey AITA, I trust the judgement on this sub and hope that you can give me some insight on whether or not I overreacted. 

Short backstory: I’m 21, female and recently moved back in with my parents (will start going to uni this winter semester and move out again). All is good, I help around the house and get along well with both of them. 

Here’s the thing about my dad though: While he is very supportive and I wouldn’t trade him for the world, he has a very specific sense of humor. He loves teasing people, even if it’s about things that he knows people are sensitive about - in my case my weight (gained 10kg after a traumatic event/depression), my hair (naturally curly - I got bullied recklessly for it in elementary school/early high school until I straightened it. I only wear it straight and he knows I’m sensitive about it), the list goes on.

It’s usually fine and we can laugh about most of his jokes, which on my part probably enabled this behavior. Not saying I’m innocent. 

But due to said traumatic experience and my depression, I’ve told him multiple times that my self-esteem is low and that I don’t appreciate these jokes anymore and to please stop. 

Well, this morning I had my hair curly and came downstairs to make some breakfast. Curly haired people surely know that after sleeping and then brushing your hair, it can look a little wild. 

The first thing he said to me was “You look like Ludwig XIV!”. Not happy Easter, not good morning, just that. Meanwhile, he wonders why I never wear my hair curly - precisely because I hate these comments. 

I told him relatively calmly that I didn’t appreciate that comment and why, he was a little upset that I took this joke so seriously but ultimately apologized. All good - I moved on. 

Then, he suddenly comes and tells me to follow him. He brings me to a mirror and makes me stand in front of it to prove that I *really* look like Ludwig XIV and that he was right, and then laughs. Not an evil laugh, the kind of ‘laugh with me’ laugh. 

This genuinely upset me and I walked away and cried a little - not so that others could see because I realize I’m more sensitive than normally, but it really hurt. 

Now he’s upset that I made him look like the bad guy - and we haven’t talked since this morning. 

I know it’s Easter and I genuinely don’t want any family drama, I love my mom and dad and I know that he doesn’t have an ill will, but I also want to establish real boundaries and let him know that this wasn’t okay. 

AITA for how I handled things? Are there ways to handle it better?

*Edit: Thank you everyone for taking your time to read this and respond. I’ve read all replies and taken what you said to heart. My dad is really not a bad guy at all, I love him a lot and I know that he feels the same way about me - and his joke wasn’t intended to be malicious. It wasn’t cool that he kept pushing and I had an honest and long conversation with him - about my mental state, and that I’m generally more sensitive to these comments than I was before. He understood and promised it won’t happen again. Thank you again for all replies, you guys saved our Easter!*",117,479,0.93

I was overseas, and met up with her while she was working at a festival in the UK. I stayed with her for about a week in her apartment, which was kind of her. Yet the behaviour surfaced. Her roommates even asked if they had done things wrong as it was spilling over to them too.

When her job ended we travelled to Scotland. It was lovely but stressful. She was rude to my UK friends, resentful of me for petty reasons and judgemental about my choices.

We flew to Iceland for the final stint of our holiday and her aggression amped up: she was annoyed I had a SIM card that worked and she didn't. She said I was excluding her from seeing the sights. . I was walking on eggshells, trying not to upset her. 

On the trip to a shopping mall she became irate that I was texting my boyfriend. I was on my phone a lot cos the relationship was new and I was in love. I acknowledge this was annoying for her. 

She got in my face and started yelling and pointing her finger in my face and standing over me. It was very aggressive. I told her I was upset and i was going to head back to our apartment to calm down. 

She later sent a text sort of saying sorry and saying she'd come back and cook dinner. That never happened. 

I packed my bags, left her a two page letter explaining the years of issues, why I broke, left the note and money for my half of the apartment and left.

She had to spend the next 5-6 days in Iceland alone. I felt bad leaving her alone, but felt it was a safe country. I also felt bad for leaving her without support.

I couldn't do a confrontation. I had enough of the abuse. Anxiety through roof. I wanted to feel safe.

It was a big deal in our friendship circle back home, people thinking I was an asshole for leaving her and not talking it out. Others understood why I had cracked.

We've attempted reconciliation over the years but never met up. I think we are both too scared. Frankly I don't think she will even acknowledge why I left, and it will be about how I was a complete bitch for leaving. She says she lost all trust for me. I feel the issue was bigger than me leaving her.

Anyway, AITA for leaving my friend while on holiday, ghosting her, ending our 15+ year friendship?",27,71,0.88

1460,Not the A-hole,"This happened 5 minutes ago.

I went to a fast food restaurant and ordered using a kiosk. I walked towards the counter to wait for my order and I saw a bike parked in the restaurant. Okay, unusual, but no biggie. I see a homeless man walking back from the counter towards the bike. I think ""oh, that makes sense, it's a bit of a strange fellow, I'll leave him be"". 

As I'm waiting, a woman yells basically in my ear ""is that your bike?"". I didn't realise she was talking to me and I turned towards her and she yelled it again. For context: I was in workout gear and she was from a non-English speaking background, so may be more used to loud speaking than I am. I said ""it wasn't my bike"" and go back to waiting for my order.

She walks away. I realise a guy is waiting at the counter with a bike helmet the same colour as a bike. He's a food bike courier. He turns around once the order's ready and goes to find his bike and it's not there. The guy who was standing next to me said ""a woman came up a moment ago said she saw someone take it"". I help to identify her by pointing out she was wearing a headscarf. 

He leaves the restaurant in a panic, and comes back in (without his bike) just as I get my order. I leave.

In hindsight, I could have recognised that the man didn't suit the bike; or that there was a bike courier at the front of the line; or that this woman had just been yelling at me about a bike. But I didn't put the pieces together at the time.

Am I the asshole?",24,24,0.92
1461,Asshole,"Hello fellow redditors! :)

I really love my SO and we've been together for years. However, he's done something that caused some trouble with my best friend. You see, while my SO is normally a very nice person, he's rather homophobic due to his strict christian upbringing. We've argued about it for a long time, but i've come to decide that, since it normally doesn't affect our daily lifes at all, I'm just going to ignore this topic in order to have a harmonic relationship. 

What's important to mention is that he doesn't hate homosexual people or treats them with less respect than others. It's just that he thinks of it as some kind of sad mental illness which keeps those affected from being able to start families in a natural way.

However, my best friend, who recently came out of the closet, wasn't too happy when she found out about this. She eventually confronted my SO about his beliefs and after he told her it wouldn't be something he supported and offered to help finding her a therapist ""to deal with the problem"" (I know, pretty bad idea), she completely lost it and demanded I had to leave him or our friendship would be over.

AITA if I don't follow this advice? In every other aspect, we're on the same page and I'm really happy to have him in my life. On the other hand, I'm worried about my best friends' feelings as well.

I would appreciate to hear your opinions.",706,952,0.89

A lady came up to me and practically begged me to help her fill out her form, claiming she couldn't write very well ( whatever that means ) I was hesitant at first but then felt bad for her so I agreed. We sat down and I told her I couldn't just look through her papers and copy everything, since that would take a lot of time. I asked to read her information to me and I would write it down.

A couple of seconds in, she tells me that I am doing a good job and I don't need her, so she got up and said she had to go buy tissues and left before I could say anything. Now this woman knew that I was up next and did not have time to waste and I felt taken advantage of. So I put the pen down, left her papers on the table and went back to my seat.

1464,Not the A-hole,"Background: This happened many years ago when I was solo travelling around the US, the flight in question was my flight home from NYC to London.

A few things about me: I'm slightly taller than average so flying isn't great for me to begin with. I cannot sleep on flights, it simply does not happen. I have some pretty intense personal space issues so get pretty uncomfortable when the person in front reclines, and don't like the idea of reclining in front of someone else. I do not, at any point in my life, anticipate being able to afford PE/Business Class seats so what I normally try to do is get on online checkin as soon as it opens and bag the exit row or fuselage seats, but unfortunately I didn't have mobile internet access at the time so this didn't happen.

Anyway, a couple of hours or so into the flight they turn off the lights and the lady in front of me reclines her seat all the way back to the point that my legs are pinned and my tray table is barely an inch from my stomach. I ask her if she can move her seat up a bit so I'm not pinned in and she says ""I need to sleep, and this is my seat that I paid for, so I'll do what I want"", puts in her headphones and goes to sleep.

I am extremely uncomfortable at this point and this is an older plane with an unadjustable screen so I can't watch a movie. I decide that the only way to pass the time is to read a book, so put on my reading light. Lady in front of me turns around and asks me to turn the light off as it's disturbing her sleep. I say ""I'll turn my light off if you move your seat up a bit"", she says ""I need it back all the way to sleep"" and I say ""well then, this is my seat and I'll do what I want"". She glares at me then puts her head back and sleeps the rest of the way.

1465,Not the A-hole,"My sister (34f) is currently is prison for robbing several houses. Prior to this, she's caught charges for theft, drugs, assault, and prostitution. She's always been a volatile, manipulative, lying thief. She's been well beyond disrespectful to my mother on numerous occasions (she's our step-mom, but truthfully always been a mother to me, whereas the other is more like a defective incubator). She's had 4 children; she was proven unfit and stripped of all parental rights to the first after some Really messed up stuff and the state took the other 3. So, basically, she followed by example and became just like the one referred to as defective incubator.  


Her bail has been lowered to 1k, down from 20k over time. My dad wants to bail her out. He also wants to move her up here to live with them (over 1,000 miles away). 


My parents both do this horrible thing where they fail to properly communicate with each other, but tell me basically everything. My mom told me she'll leave my dad if he brings her here... But I don't think she would be happy with me telling him this because it would come across as an ultimatum... 
 

I have made it clear to my dad that he would be making a massive mistake, telling him a Lot of things that he didn't know that she (sister) has said and done. I pointed out that she'd skip out on court (she didn't even bother showing up to court to so much as try to get visitation of her first child, does that sound like she cares about anything but herself?) and he'd end up responsible for more. He's still pretty set in what he wants to do. 


EDIT: 

I didn't expect so many responses. I appreciate the encouragement, but I think I may need to add a little more info here. 

If it seems like I'm a bit more worried about my relationship with my mom than I am with confronting my dad on some things, it's because I am. My mom suffers from depression and my dad isn't the most empathetic person, so things sometimes get a bit complicated. 

In addition to this, 6 of my siblings are my dad's and he didn't raise any of us. My younger sister and I came to live with him when we were 12 and 13; she went back to the defective incubator at 15 and I was kicked out at 16 for protesting her return (she had made actual attempts on my life). 

I would like to point out that he has gotten a lot better about things over time. BUT. 

My mom had to put her foot down on her daughter (my step sister) coming and going as she pleased. She used them, robbed them, and otherwise carried on in horrible ways. And, funny enough, she also had 4 kids but had custody of none. 

So, basically, my dad seems to be expecting my mom to ""get over her concerns"" and allow this horrible human back into their lives, but wasn't flexible in regards to basically the exact same thing. 

And my mom is dealing with a LOT more that isn't included in this post (not dad related); I'm  legitimately afraid confrontation could put her over the edge. 



WIBTA if I just flat out told my dad he'd lose the best thing he ever had (my mom) if he fell for false promises and brought this horrid human up here?

My mother seemed fine with it at first and kept telling us that we should do what we want and that she didn't care. After some time passed, she told us the wedding officiant wanted to speak with us.  Basically, she planned an entire wedding for us and invited both of our close families (about 20 people). She did plan this with me in mind and kept the whole thing small and simple for a wedding so nothing too outlandish. I get the impression that she did this mostly for her parents/my grandparents. She's also covering all the costs.

1469,Not the A-hole,"I live in on-campus housing at my university. On every floor, there is a ""common area"" with a TV and other shit. When there is a hockey game on, everybody who's interested sits down together to watch it. We were doing that tonight.

Then comes this guy we'll call John. John is a bit annoying. People have hated him since he transferred in this year, though to me his behaviour seemed like he's trying to be friendly rather than intentionally an asshole. Maybe I'm biased because I was once socially awkward, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt until today.

John apparently does not like hockey. We know this because he made it very clear to us tonight. Repeatedly. He started by saying ""hockey is a dumb sport"" and he did not shut up after that. Now, I respect his opinion. I'm not a huge hockey fanatic myself. But in principle, if I saw a group enjoying something that I hated, I wouldn't join them just to complain.

I politely suggested that John should leave. I do not remember my exact words, but it was something like ""you don't like this, eh? Why don't you go and use the other TV"" (there's another place on our floor with a TV). The others agreed with me. John barked that he has the right to be in the common area just like us, and we couldn't force him out. Someone else suggested we move to that other TV, and let John watch what he wants in the common area. So we did that. Like five minutes later, he joined us, and he continued to talk. The ""conversation"" shifted from how John feels about different sports to how John feels about his freshman crush. John was asked to shut the fuck up multiple times. He refused.

John's bullshit was really ruining our enjoyment of the game. Many people had left to watch it in their rooms in peace. So at the end of the third quarter*, my roommate and I invited everyone except John (a total of 5 people at that point) to our room to watch the rest of the game where we wouldn't be annoyed. John seemed genuinely hurt when he heard that. He stopped talking and walked away.

I wish I did not have to say that. But I still believe I did the right thing for everyone given the circumstances.

1470,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I rented a house for almost 5 years. We had a kid last year and intended to renew the lease.

However, a few months before the end of the lease (which was to end June 31) the landlord told us he wanted to move his son in “when we moved out.”

We explained that we had been hoping to renew, and that the end of june was literally the worst time to move due to our daughter’s first birthday, visiting family from out of state, work engagements, and a wedding where my wife was the bridesmaid. I asked for a month of leeway, which seemed reasonable after never even missing a rent payment once in 5 years.

They got pissed about this, but eventually agreed it was fair given the circumstance.

We ended up buying a place and are getting early possession, and will be moved out by May 2. We accepted the fact we’d have to pay rent but I did offer the landlord that if his son wanted to move in early we would like to get out sooner.

He agreed at first, but then when I called him back said he was sorry but his son didn’t want to move in until June.

I was disappointed but understood of course and agreed to pay to the end of may. Then he said, “but if you guys aren’t there I hope you don’t mind but we’ll be doing some painting and getting the place ready.”

But no, this wasn’t “ok” with me. I said very matter of factly “Does that seem fair to you? If we are still paying the rent we’ll not be exchanging keys until End of May sorry.”

To which he replied “well if you want to be like that I guess we’ll see you May31!”

Basically he made it seem like I’M the asshole for not letting him prep the house for the next tenant!

She is 71F, my cousin, she just got  her own apartment soon, she  is living with us. Has been for 3 years. 

So usually every mid- spring, we have an ant problem, my mom got an exterminator, but this lady is so sloppy. It’s gross, a week ago she left a chicken bone on the counter, I got the raid, I sprayed it, and I said, “ Hey we have an ant problem, so please try your best, to be aware and clean up after yourself and don’t leave your food out on the counter. “ She was like “DON’T SPRAY THE FOOD.” no one was going to spray the food. She also said, “Your Mom has to get an exterminator.” I told her, “I know, but you can’t just leave food on the counter regardless, ant problem or not.” I was being monotone. This lady is known for being gross, but you know what, she was moving out soon. Forget it. 

Next day, I come home from school, she left a banana slice on the floor, ants are all over it, and ants all in one spot is so disgusting I HATE IT. it’s like microscopic lines wiggling and moving. EW. I was like, “I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE GROUND, WHY, WHY.” She was like, “I didn’t do it, must’ve been someone else.” Lying, as if she hasn’t been here all day, and even though my mom leaves 5 hours after I go to school for work, she would still clean up after herself, regardless of the ant problem, because my mom hates disgustingness. I left it alone.

1480,Not the A-hole,"I’m a 7th/8th grade English teacher. I took over in January from a teacher who was fired for being openly rude and racist towards the kids; I was given the job without even an interview because I’d subbed for that classroom before and the kids had really liked me. Due to the history, I’ve tried extra hard to be understanding.

Two girls in particular - H and S - have been openly disrespectful to me. They have tried to get out of every assignment and called them “boring”; they have played games on their iPads during class; they try to walk out early every day. Again, I’ve tried to be calm and reasonable with them.

Last Monday, I had had it. They’d been walking all over me. It was the end of class and again they were trying to walk out early. So I stood in front of the door with my hand on the handle so no one could leave until dismissal. The two openly mocked me and laughed in my face and I called for a behavior escort and told them to leave my classroom.

I decided to make a seating chart so these two could no longer sit next to each other. I also switched around several other groups of kids that talked a lot in class but left some groups that weren’t disruptive and worked well together. H and S refused to sit in their seat. I called for behavior intervention immediately because I’m not putting up with this shit anymore.

They say and talked with the security officer outside my classroom until the officer pulled me out for a meeting. I let the girls speak first and made a point not to interrupt to defend myself so they’d have their full chance to share. H started talking about how the new seating chart was “unfair” and it singled out only them. Privately, I thought that I could easily prove how untrue that was, but I still stayed silent.

Then, H said, “And we’re still mad because you put your hands on S.”

I stopped being silent. “Excuse me?”

“Yeah, on Monday when you shoved S.”

“That did not happen.”

“Yeah it did! You shoved her away from the door!”

I stood up. “That never happened. I do not touch students, much less shove them. You are lying. This meeting is over. If you’re going to make up stories about me like that, you are no longer welcome in my classroom.”

I tried contacting the principal via email but she ignored me. I tried to speak to her in person and she blew me off.

These two girls made up a story about physical assault over a damn seating chart; they could potentially destroy my career. I am very uncomfortable having them in my classroom.

The boy was reluctant, and did not like any of our suggestion. Finally, he found a pair that he liked. They were pink/light red-ish and had a slightly curved/""feminine"" shape, but they fit him nicely. Neither the boy or his dad picked up on them being from the girl's section. 

I thought about the possibility of him being bullied about his girly glasses, and his mother disapproving of their choice, but I didn't have the heart to tell him that he couldn't have the only frames he liked just because he's a boy. He shouldn't have to choose ones he doesn't like just in case someone else doesn't approve of his choice.

My friend told me it was awful of me to let an unknowing kid buy ""girly"" glasses, just because I personally believe that clothes, toys and frames shouldn't be separated in boy/girl sections. She said I failed my job, which is to inform the customer and use my knowledge on how to pick the right frame. This has bothered me a lot, and I don't know if I did the right thing.

Was I the asshole for letting this boy buy the pink-ish glasses that he liked, without letting him know they were actually made for girls?

Edit: NTA flair in place. I just want to say that I disagree with the major downvoting of the YTA-comments, most of them had valid points. I think it's perfectly acceptable to believe that I should have informed the boy or the dad. We pretty much all agree that there's nothing wrong with a boy wearing ""girls frames"", but that does not change the fact that the boy might not be comfortable with it if he knew.
I'm still conflicted whether I did the right thing or not, but I appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts. Hopefully one day the frames won't be separated in girl/boy sections anymore.",192,331,0.94
1482,Not the A-hole,"I work in a nursing home and we recently had an issue with our call lights not working. Because of this, we put bells in the bathrooms so people who need help in there could still call us. 

The call lights have been fixed for 3 weeks now and we were told to collect the bells because a lot of people were complaining that they were being used in the middle of the night. I had 2 residents who refused to give me the bells. One of them is completely sound of mind and the other (Mr. Man) had a stroke but most of the time he is in his right mind. 

Mr. Man rings the bell in the hallways, dining room, and while he's in bed for no reason. He was the one everyone was complaining about. When he left his room, I went in and retrieved the bell. He had a fit but he eventually got over it. 

My Head of Nursing was the one that told me to pry it from his hands if I had to. My coworkers say that I'm an ass for taking the bell. I took the other person's bell too to be fair.

Turns out the sister (aunt of the baby) brought those tubs for herself only and she was sitting across from me as i was serving my mother and i. 
 
I still apologized profusely and if she had stopped me i wouldn't have done it. My mother later told me it's extreamly rude (in our culture) to bring your own food not to share and a party. Especially of that quantity (it really was a lot). I haven't seen the aunt since. 

When i think about it i feel bad that i didnt ask, but i also feel that she was rude for bringing food only for herself or that she could've hidden it?

My younger sister and I have always been close growing up but in adulthood there’s been more tension. Namely the fact that my husband and I earn a lot more than her and her husband. It’s not a huge deal but it’s a sore spot for her and my parents. They think I need to contribute more to family but I think there should be limits. 

Anyways, sister recently bought a new house and my mom suggested I buy her a house warming present that’s like a small renovation. I agreed and we ended up settling on me paying for small renovations of one downstairs half bathroom. In their words, this meant retiling, new sink, new toilet, etc. I was fine with this. 

Well the construction finishes and the bill is 4x what I expected based off the items they told me. They actually EXPANDED the half bath to a whole bath, with shower and everything. I asked a contractor friend and he said this was unprecedented and also illogical (who showers in a ground floor guest bathroom?) They also tore up half the house to make this happen. They chose the most expensive items possible (like shipped from overseas) to rack up the bill. 

Anyways I saw it and said I’m paying for half of this shit, which is already more than what I had expected. My mom and sister flipped their shit saying that I’m reneging on my present and that I should’ve put a monetary limit on my gift if I was planning on being so stingy. They said since I didn’t I owe them the full amount. 

Are they assholes or AITA?

She has been forced to move back in with her controlling parents who live in another state, thus quitting her nursing program that was in our city (which I was also paying for.) 

I’ve felt 0 remorse but now my family is calling me heartless, saying that I’m robbing her of her future by making her move back home. They said that her cheating was wrong but it’s equally wrong of me to cut off her nursing education when she was trying to help other people. They said I should give her money (like a few thousand) so she could be self sufficient because I was the one that supported her all those years and made her so reliant on me.

However, after my grandma died, Grandpa started hanging around with this terribly unpleasant woman (K from now on) who lived in the trailer park not far from his house. The entire family had a venomous hatred for her, but tolerated her as she was grandpa’s “guest” to family occasions. Note that she was never invited, she simply showed up. And she had quite the reputation for starting fights with family members, such as lying about my uncle to garner sympathy and even going so far as to insult my late mother to my face on one unfortunate Christmas. It was hard to say anything against her, as we all felt guilty since Grandpa was a lonely old man who was introverted in the first place and had lost his outgoing wife. At least, we reasoned, K gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. That said, it was impossible not to notice the disgusting amount of money he was lavishing on K. Clothes shopping every week, a brand new car, a new Tuff shed for her trailer, expensive Vegas shows, and even lasik eye surgery. No one said anything, since that was his pension money and he could do with it what he wanted. But my uncle, one 4th of July, found a pamphlet about getting a trust altered on his desk, he flipped. Said that the objects and money in the trust were also Grandma’s and he had no place to let K into that. Grandpa immediately conceded and threw out the pamphlet. It made everyone hate K more. Eventually, my Grandpa fell sick to the illness he’d never recover from. I’ll never forget, K came in to the hospital and complained that he had better get out of the hospital soon since she had some bills hitting soon and she didn’t know what to do. I know it sounds too outlandish. But I swear to god, that’s what she said. Uncle screamed at her to leave. Later, I went to talk to Grandpa and he told me about a safe with a stash of money that he had been squirreling away for K for after he passes. He gives me the code and asks me to give it to her. He died the next day. K didn’t come to the funeral. After the funerary arrangements were all settled, I went to the safe and opened it. There was thousands in there. Floored and a little insulted, I just closed the safe and didn’t touch it. As I was closing out his credit card and bank, I was horrified. It was way more money spent on K than any of us had ever speculated in the past. I was furious. That woman had milked my poor lonely grandpa for every red cent she could manage.

My parents split up when I was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. My mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and I and stopped paying child support. He justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way I had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. About a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. However, today he asked if my sister and I could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which I had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. I rejected his request and told him I wasn’t ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and I suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. After rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said I was murdering him. Some of my friends also said I should forgive him because he is my father and that I am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. So AITA?

Edit: His other kids are still pretty young (~15 and I’m not sure how many other kids he has but I think at least one other) so I’m not sure they are able to donate at their age. Also an update: my aunt (my dad’s sister) who I also haven’t spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. At this point I’m leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.

Edit2: Thank you for all your replies and advice. I’ve decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister. I realize now that I shouldn’t feel any guilt for not donating as this man is not truly my dad.",2792,15901,0.94
1500,Not the A-hole,"   I completely adore my husband but I don’t think he’d be a good father. My husband recently got a puppy to keep me company when he deploys and because he’s been wanting a dog for a long time and he’s using the dog to prove he can be a good pet parent to him so I would open up more to the idea of having kids with him. 


  I know dogs and kids are completely different but even with this puppy he’s showing selfish tendencies that I don’t like or think is fair to the puppy. I basically do everything for this puppy, my husband always groans and complains if I ask him to do something simple with the dog like take him for a walk with me. My husband just likes the idea of having a dog but not the work. 

  
The other day I finally managed to get him to walk the dog with me and we were walking for about 10 minutes and he said let’s go back home. I said 10 minutes is not enough for him for a walk and he needs a little more than that and he said that I can take him by myself then because “It’s my dog”. 



 If he can’t even take care of a dog then I don’t think he’s fit to take care of a child. He’s too selfish. My in laws say I need to suck it up and give him a child since it’s my “womanly duties” to make him happy and they want grandchildren/cousins for their kids. 


 My husband rarely helps around the house or with the dog which includes; not making sure the dog has food or water, not remembering to take him out or give him his medicine, and not teaching him any tricks or commands just to name a few. 


 I feel he just likes the idea of having kids but not the work so I’d be stuck doing everything.

Me: “Why yes, I did. Want an autograph?” (Sarcastically and in good taste.)

My husband’s family visited today and it was mostly lovely. Spent some time with my father and sister in law plus their kids - all nice. They all love my cat, but not as much as my father in law does.

After a couple of times of this, my father in law got up and left the room - I didn’t think anything of this until I hear an unmistakable rattle of food hitting the cat’s bowl (about 10 minutes before his food was timed to release anyway). I move into the kitchen and ask my father in law what he’s doing to which he brazenly said “I’m feeding your cat because he’s hungry.”
I argued that he’s not acting hungry and even if he was, he’s being fed and anyway, it’s not okay for him to presume that he should be feeding my animal in my house without consulting me first.

She only drew acrylic floral arrangements in bright colors and everyone loved them. 

Recently, she posted a new type of art. It looked drastically different from her old stuff, and she said she had started doing digital art so I just accepted that was the difference. It was simply cleaner. 

THEN she suddenly started posting incredibly clean painting of famous landmarks and buildings from our town. I was blown away, so much so that I knew something was off. I simply commented, asking if she was drawing them by hand because it was incredible. She sent me a private message and explained she had done them with her apple pen on a tablet.. so I responded by asking “Is it like you start with picture and do your art over it like an edit?” She answered with “Yeah pretty much! I’m terrible at creating straight lines so it helps me get the outline then I do all the color work! Lol” 


So she was literally just tracing photos and coloring in the lines and selling them for a lot of money.... I was so surprised, but I just left it alone.

Naturally I said yeah, as I have 2-3 other cheaper whisky's in the cabinet and I (stupidly) assumed he would drink first before ripping into my birthday drink.

In the time it took my fiance to drive out and pick me up from work (~30minutes) he had basically gone through over half of the bottle, and was on the couch quite drunk. I could probably get 2 very small glasses with what's left 

I probably would've been less pissed off if he had of enjoyed the whisky, but he was chugging it back at a rate of knots.

WIBTA if I ask him to pay me back, or do I let my mistake of assuming he wouldn't drink so much slide? 

I understand my communication could have been better however there was no shortage of other booze to drink and I really can't afford to replace it, so I would have to miss out.",64,70,0.95

1513,Not the A-hole,"Sorry this may be long- but im hella annoyed and need to add details, i guess 

Okay so for the past 10 days, my brother and I have been at home alone. A week ago, my brother decided to invite over all his friends to watch a movie and have some edibles. My mom knows that we have edibles, and has had from it before- she’s chill about it. The one thing she’s not chill about it us lying to her. My brother lies a lot, and everytime our parents explain how they’re not mad that he DID THE THING, they’re mad that he LIED but apparently he wont get it. 
So bro+friends downstairs, and my brother has this concept that he’s “immune” to weed, and gets this fantastical idea to eat HALF THE FUCKING BAR without telling me, or our mom. The whole time i’m upstairs studying. I then hear hurling, and one of his friends yell “there’s shit everywhere”- now: a month ago, he and his friends went on a trip, and one of them basically shat himself at this bar from the edibles, so the first thing that I thought of was “there’s s h i t in my living room” and so i went downstairs, only to find my brother in the bathroom, with throw up EVERYWHERE. Walls, door, corners, persian carpet. On the inside and outside of the bathroom. 

While I was cleaning up, his friends were asking me if he was gonna get in trouble, and I said “if he told our mom he was gonna do this before hand, he wouldnt get in trouble”, as in if he told her he would have some of the edibles- so someone would know he’s under the influence, and HE SAID “i already told her” so okay cool. 

Now, this is where I was called an asshole: 
Our mom got back yesterday, and she already knew he threw up, so in the car she asked me why he threw up, already hinting that she thinks he ate from the edibles. And I told her “well, he told you didnt he? He ate too many of the edibles” and she said that NO he didnt. So again, he lied. 
My mom goes and talks to him while i’m out, and I get a text from him saying “thank you for proving I cant trust you” and i’m just ????

And he said how “he told me not to tell her” and that “playing dumb wont help me” and how now our mom is “pretending like she always knew”

My mom’s a smart woman, even if i didnt mention it, she would have known, ALSO mind you, the edibles were FINISHED. She would notice

Now apparently i’m “full of shit” and how if i “didnt say anything our mom wouldnt have concrete proof” 

I think he’s fucking stupid cause THERE’S NOTHING TO HIDE- she doesnt care that he ate the edibles, ITS THE FACT THAT HE’S LYING is why she’s mad at him, and when I told him that he said that this isnt about what he should or shouldnt do, its about “me lying to him” 

Oh the irony of it all. So, AITA?

1514,Not the A-hole,"My wife (F31) and I (M31) got married a little over a year and a half ago. During the ceremony my brother in law on my wife’s side of the family got up to the pulpit and said a few bible verses and proceeded to mention a few family members that had passed away that we wished could have been there. My wife’s mother was mentioned because she had passed away and my grandma was also mentioned as well.  My step-mother’s mom had also passed away but wasn’t mentioned.  We didn’t chose to not mention her because of any ill reasons but because we would have been there all day if we were to list off everyone. We simply picked 1 person each side of the families and proceeded to say “and everyone else that contributed to us being here today”.  My step-mom was irate that my grandma was picked over her mom. She proceeded to go to the reception afterwards and completely act like an asshole all night. She refused to participate in any dancing, eating, or pictures.  I wasn’t aware that she was acting like this because I was occupied with pictures, dancing, and socializing with everyone there.  Towards the end of the night I stepped outside with my best man to have a cigar and   recapped the day but that was when she cornered me to tell me that it was bullshit that my grandma was mentioned over her mom. That it was disrespectful of me to chose my mom’s family over hers. I was completely blown away by what she had said. I explained that it wasn’t meant to be disrespectful or a slight to anyone that we didn’t mention. She wouldn’t hear a word of what I was saying, I was simply in the wrong to her and that was final.

We haven’t spoken to this day. Even when my paternal grandfather passed away. She wouldn’t come anywhere near me then.  My dad said that she makes his life a living hell everyday because of what happened.

So am I the asshole here??? I don’t know what to anymore.

Edit: Fun facts for that day

Just so you all know that there were plenty of assholes that day...

My maternal grandfather was not invited to wedding due to the fact that he was the cause that my grandma passed away.  His presence would have caused many people not to stay or even show up to my wedding. I despise that man and openly admit it that I hate him.

My mom’s sisters caused a scene by getting drunk prior to the reception and getting into a fight in the parking lot. Security had to be called to escort them off the property.

My step-mom’s sister made my photographer cry by criticizing her work.  I had to calm her down and make things right.  We were happy with her pictures so we had no idea why she was being yelled at.",62,270,0.91
1515,Everyone Sucks,So bsckstory is she's known this guy for years and they've been pretty close friends. They also slept together one time 9 years ago when they got drunk and have remained friends ever since. Well my girlfriend got a new phone and I was helping her set it up and I noticed she had been talking to him recently and I'll be honest I snooped on the messages. She was asking him how he was feeling after what happened the other night. The problem is all the previous messages were gone so I didn't know what they were talking about. I asked her and she originally said she had no idea and she didn't deltele the messages and it must be because she got a new phone that the messages were gone. I knew this wasn't true because this was on Facebook messenger and it saves all your messages to your account regardless of your phone. We argued and she finally admitted she did in fact delete it because she didn't want me to see messages from years before we met that I would over react about even though it was before we were together. So couple days past and it's still been bothering me so I asked her to message him for the screenshots of their conversation because it was nagging at me that she was hiding something. Well she got pissed and we argued and she finally admitted that he got drunk and said some innapropiate things about having sex with her years ago and basically hitting on her. She says she told him that he better be careful saying those things because his girlfriend would see them. She said she delteled it and lied to me about it because I would overreact and tell her not to talk to him anymore. Which of course is exactly what I asked. . She is pissed at me and says that's not the type of person he is and it was a one time thing because he was drunk and they should still be able to be friends. I don't feel like they should still be able to talk after this happened especially because she was willing to lie to me to protect their friendship. Am I the asshole?,49,49,0.85
1516,Everyone Sucks,"Obligatory long term reader, first time poster, on mobile.

So my kid (5) was playing with the neighbours kid (6). They wanted to play cars, so my son came in saying the other kid only brought one out. He then went upstairs to grab a pocketful so they could play properly. 

Maybe 20 minutes later, my kid comes in the back door, while neighbours kid knocks on the front door. He said my son stole one of his cars. My son swore that he never and showed me the cars he had, which were ones I recognise from picking up off his bedroom floor. 

Neighbours kid then says my sons a liar and that I'm a liar. I said ""my son doesn't have your car, now go away!""

Next thing, the door is being pounded by the kid's dad, screaming in my face that his kid is crying and that I shouldn't have spoke to him in the way I did. Because he was so aggressive, I obviously got aggressive back, bearing in mind I'm 37 weeks pregnant and do not need his shit. I told him his kid called us liars and it's not on and to get the fuck away from my doorstep and out of my face. 

If the dad had spoke like a rational adult, I would have reacted like one too. My kid didn't steal the shitty car.

Am I the asshole for telling the kid to go away?",66,270,0.96
1517,Not the A-hole,"Names and details changed in this post for obvious reasons. This requires some backstory so I'll start there.

So for context, I was born as Jess Smith, and my name stayed that way until I was in my early twenties. Yada yada yada I fell in love and got married right out of college and as such I changed my name to match my husband's, for the sake of this post we'll say my name is now Jess Johnson.

Over the next twenty years, we stay married and have two beautiful girls, but eventually decide that we are unhappy together and it's best for everyone if we got a divorce. At the time our girls were 8 and 12 and they were going through so much that we decided I would keep my last name as Johnson to match theirs. We figured it would be easier for them to see me as they always had, and since I had primary custody it would be easier when it came to doctors, schools, etc.

That was around 12 years ago, and I have now been with my current SO for about 10 years. My name is still Johnson. My ex-husband and I still talk occasionally and get along decently (completely innocuous just talking about the kids), and he has since remarried and had more kids all with the last name Johnson. Don't think his wife likes me sharing the same last name as her, but we never interact and her behavior is not hostile.

So here's where we get to where I might be the asshole. My SO and I have been talking about finally getting married and moving in together now that our kids are grown and out of the house. And with that comes with the implication that I will take his last name.

But here's the thing... I really like my last name. I am in my 50s now and my name has been Johnson for the entirety of my adult life. It's the name I built my career around and had kids with. It is a part of my identity I connect with a lot. I realize I could just go back to Smith, but I am not close with my siblings and parents. I am, however, very close to my daughters and they are who I identify with as my family, and they are Johnsons. I am at the age where I'm not looking to build a new family. I love my SO but I don't know if I feel the obligation to change my name to his since we're already past middle-age. It doesn't help that the ""Johnson"" name in real life is a just really cool last name to have IMO.

I know my SO is more traditional though and won't be happy if I don't change my last name to his, I don't know if it will be a dealbreaker but it will definitely be a big fight. It will be drama with the in-laws and everyone who thinks they have the right to an opinion. And I can see how most people are not going to understand the logic of keeping my ex's last name, and they are going to see it as some weird devotion to him rather than to our children. But in my mind it's not just his name, it's our kids' names, and at this point it's my name.

1518,Not the A-hole,"I am a kindergarten teacher. I have taught many students with special needs. 

My brother has a 6 year old in kindergarten. 

The boy seems to be on the autistic spectrum but my family doesn't know. I don't know if my brother is ignorant of the issue or just doesn't want it to be true. It seems it must be the latter because my sister in law is a family doctor. 

My parents often watch the boy and just think his bad behavior is due to him being out of control or ""a bad seed""

My brother is quick to shut down any conversation about his son. Saying in various ways that I have no business about it. Last year, I thought they discussed that in kindergarten they would be ready to seek support from the public system. They have some more support skills since then but it is still a house full of frustration. 

I don't live close by, only see him a few times a year, and don't talk or text much either. 

Whenever I see them, I prepare my children to protect their bodies from the boy, practice using their words when they are upset, and to be patient in hard situations. 

The boy has a 3 year old brother who has no special needs, except that he copies the bad behaviors. 

I think if they know, or face, the truth their son can get help. They can help raise him to know his strengths and my parents can understand him.

For some background information I'm a 15F living with my mom and younger siblings, my dad works in another country because the pay way better. To put this in perspective, I only see my dad every 6-8 months and honestly, it can be really hard, especially on my mom. Now onto the actual story.

&#x200B;

Last weekend my dad came over for a couple of days, and he brought his iPad with him so he could still do some work. Well I needed to borrow it and take some photos for my photography but, when I'm looking at the pictures I come across a video of my dad with another woman. It was a really graphic video and I don't want to go into details, but in short he cheated on my mom.

&#x200B;

After I found the videos, I had a complete mental breakdown on whether I should tell my mom or not and ended up just telling her. She was obviously completely distraught. Well the next day, my dad pulled me aside and apologised saying he was drunk and that he and my mom were going to stay together and work through it. He told me that the reason he cheated was because he missed my mom and was too drunk to even remember doing it. 

&#x200B;

I don't think my mom was in the wrong for deciding to stay with him, but reddit AITA for not accepting my dad's apology because I feel as though he's using the alcohol as an excuse and not really owning up to what he did.

1525,Not the A-hole,"My Dad asked me [18F] if I could come on a trip in the country and stay with his girlfriend [40F], her kids [12F+6M] and him in a nice house. I felt obliged because they’ve only been together for a year and I want to get to know them.

I really liked them all until today and I’ve always been extremely nice, talking to the kids and being non-judgemental towards the (sometimes) strange attitude of the girlfriend. She’s somewhere on the autism spectrum, but she’s pretty normal most of the time. She gets snappy as fuck with my Dad sometimes though and it kind of bothers me, but I never say anything.

So we arrived at this house today, after me sitting in the car next to those two kids for three hours (youngest smelled like shit). I was told we would all have bedrooms and I’d be able to study.

The house wasn’t as expected. The girlfriend booked it, and said she hadn’t realised it wasn’t separate bedrooms. On the top floor, there’s a king size bed, and two single beds close by, all in the same room. On the bottom floor, there’s a sofa bed which can probably fit two people.

The logical solution is: Dad and girlfriend go upstairs with two kids; I sleep downstairs. But no, girlfriend said there were only two options, both involving me sleeping alone with the two kids, and my Dad and his gf having a great time in their own room. My Dad looked a bit uneasy with her decision, but didn’t even speak up for me.

I think that’s absolutely ridiculous. I really want to complain to my Dad and/or tell him I’m never going on holiday with the lot ever again. I’ve clearly been pulling a massive face for the past eight hours and she’s still committed to making me sleep with her goddamn kids.

Here’s the thing. My Dad wanted to pay, but the girlfriend heavily insisted and paid herself. I didn’t contribute at all. That’s the only reason I’m hesitating to speak my mind.

1526,Update,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bdi0g4/aita_for_wanting_to_expose_my_uncle_to_his_wife/

Just a forewarning, this is very anticlimactic. As I said in the original post, my family is not of the dramatic variety. 

In the original post I left out the conversation my mom had with my uncle. After my ex told me, I told my mom, who texted him and said, I'm paraphrasing here but ""I don't know what is up with you lately but you're really starting to become a creep, twice now you've texted that young girl and we all see you comment and like every other girls Facebook stuff. This needs to stop""

His response was a cop-out, he claimed to have been drinking and ""doesn't remember"" saying any of that. My mom wasn't buying it and has basically resolved to avoid him.

I messaged my uncle, this is verbatim the conversation:
Me: ""Does your wife know you're offering money to my girlfriend for sex you fucking scumbag?""

Him: ""That's false . She's blocked and unfriended on FB. Totally not true.""
(which she did, after he messaged her asking her)

Me: ""Lol I have screenshots [uncle's name]""

He then immediately blocked me, then unblocked me and started typing something, and then blocked me for good.

I made a new Facebook, messaged him and said ""are you going to tell her, because if you don't, I will"". He never responded or blocked me.

I waited a few days for a response, nothing. So I messaged her and said ""I know this is an incredibly uncomfortable thing to talk about, but you should know [uncle's name] has twice messaged my girlfriend trying to get her to go to your house to meet him, and this last time offered to take her to dinner and give her money. I have screenshots if you would like them, I just thought you should know.""

Her only response was ""thank you for telling me"".

There hasn't been any more drama, I don't expect there will be, at least not publicly.

Edit: there is a family graduation party coming up that I know he's going to. Haven't decided if I'm going, I know my mom is, and I know my other uncle (who's an incredibly great guy) now knows, and who's son the graduation party is for. Might get ugly.

I knock on my roommate's door, but he's asleep and non-responsive and won't wake up, and I'm trying to explain why I'm waking him up when his girlfriend flips her shit and wakes up her brother and they angrily start getting ready to leave.

Now, people can just walk around my cubicle to get to the break room but it would take them maybe an extra ten seconds to do so. Because of that, people tend to walk through the gap between the wall and my cubicle. It annoys me a lot because I don’t ever feel like I have any privacy. We all take our breaks and lunch at different times, so there’s constantly people going through my cubicle. The water cooler is also in the break room, so people are constantly heading there for a water refill.

I’ve asked people constantly if they wouldn’t mind walking the other way. They’ve all acknowledged the request but by the time the next week rolls around, they’re back at it. I even brought this up at a meeting once, but not too seriously because I didn’t want to seem like a jerk (our boss asked if we had any office requests like more coffee machines or whatever and I “jokingly” said that I’d like for people to walk around my cubicle—it earned a few chuckles but nothing came of it).

Anyway, what mostly annoys me about this is that whenever they walk past me, a good amount of them always look at my computer screen. I know they look because some of them have made comments on the music I was listening to at the time or whatever. I also know that mostly everyone in the office watches Game of Thrones.

Most of the time that we spend apart is time that we’re working.  I love hanging out with her, but I’m not as clingy as she is.  I like having time to myself.  I miss being my own person.

I miss being able to just hang out with the boys without having my wife with me.  It’s nothing against her.  I love her, but me and my friends go all the way back to childhood and some of us have been friends since birth.  There’s just that special bond with them.

This isn’t too big of a problem because we’ve been trying to do things that she’ll enjoy whenever she joins us, but since she always wants to join, this means that we don’t get to do the things that we really want to do since she won’t have a good time if we do.",51,323,0.95

1534,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I have recently come to a total impasse on this situation (to the point where we can't have more than a simple conversation) so I've come here to get an unbiased opinion. I also don't see how we can reach a middle point on this as it's either one way or the other and I've tried everything logical I can think of to see her point. 

  
A little back round is that we've been together nearly 9 years. We both wanted to buy a house so we saved up and 2 years a go we bought a house, everything has been fine until this. When we started to look at properties she had saved a bit more than me. Her grandparents also decided it would help my partner out much more if she received part of her inheritance now rather than waiting 10-20 years. So they gifted her a sizable amount of money (although lower than what I've just got) to help her. At this point my partner had quite a lot more saved than I did. We'd always planned to split buying the property 50/50 so I spent all my money to maintain this. We still maintain separate finances but both contribute equal amounts to a joint account which covers all of our expenses. We both earn roughly similar.. When we moved in we knew we'd be having this work done so we've both been saving individually for this. 

&#x200B;

Now the current issue. 2 months or so a go my grandmother passed away, her will has always been that it will be split between her two remaining daughters however my mother has always told my sister and I that she has no need for it and would much rather it went to us. So last week I saw my mother and she told me she was giving me the money (lowish 5 figures) and that I'd get it soon. When I saw partner next I told her about it and said that it would be great to put that much into savings to help in the future or until I decide what to do with it. She was initially happy and said if I put it towards the extension to our house that we have been planning, we'd have enough to start the work we wanted. Almost immediately I said that was a great idea and if we both put in for it we'd still have plenty of savings each and could get the work done. This is where it went all wrong, she looked a little shocked/confused by what I had said and after a moment said why would we do it like that. She argued because she used her inheritance to buy our house and not her savings that I should be willing to use my inheritance to extend our house. I agree and said I am but I will still only pay for half the work like she only paid for half the house and she should use her savings for the other half. She said because I have enough to cover all the work  and it's inheritance why should she use money she's worked hard to save. I've tried so many logical points like the fact I could argue she used her savings to buy our house and kept her inheritance in her bank but none of its worked so far.

1536,Not the A-hole,"The housing estate/town I live in is fairly posh and is known to house very wealthy people, however the surrounding towns are the opposite and many people are living below the poverty line. A lot of people in my area have quite poor backgrounds but their parents have “made it” and moved here, which means there is a lot of anti social behaviour and everyone’s quite stuck up. I go to a well respected sixth form full time and do quite complicated subjects with the hopes of going to university, same as the majority of my friends. My boyfriend was brought up in one of the poor surrounding towns, however his family are comfortable and ironically they actually have a lot more money than my family so at the moment. He has finished college with qualifications. He is currently searching for an apprenticeship, however it is extremely hard to find one so he has been working full time at a fast food chain for just over a year. My friends are constantly mocking him and telling me how much better I can do than a “burger flipper”. My boyfriend really hates his job and finds it embarrassing as he is very ambitious and wants to do well. It really irritates me when my friends make fun of him because he’s working hard instead of just sitting at home. One day at college my friend made a comment about his lack of career prospects so i just turned around and told her that she’s a stuck up bitch and at least he doesn’t sit back and rely on his parents money like her.

1537,Not the A-hole,"Sorry, I definitely didn't realize how long this got!

My (27F) best friend (28F) got engaged last year to her boyfriend she's been with since high school, and I am thrilled for her. She initially kept me in the loop about wedding planning, and it was always insinuated (so I assumed), that I would be asked to be a bridesmaid.

She decided on a very small ceremony, which she then told me would only include parents and one of her childhood friends as a witness/bridesmaid. I was totally fine with this, because I get that it's her wedding. She is planning a reception for all other family and friends to attend a few days later.

As planning continued, she asked me for dates I was free to go with her to wedding dress shop. My schedule is fairly fixed so I sent her my schedule for the next few months. She told me she was planning for a certain weekend when I was off, and then I heard nothing from her. As that day got closer I messaged her and asked about it and she replied ""oh we already went and got a dress"". Honestly, my feelings were a little bruised. I heard less and less about wedding planning as time went on.

Now, all of this would be fine. And it's all kind of background to my AITA question. I 100% understand that it's her wedding, her day, and she can do whatever she likes and include whoever she wants. But here's my issue: she wants an expensive shower/bachelorette weekend that includes a spa day, wine tasting, high tea, etc.... And this other friend/sole bridesmaid has asked me if I would be willing to split the cost with her. It's going to cost a lot in addition to all the other costs from just attending (travel, hotel, gift, etc).

I have a great job and could afford to help (her childhood friend is currently in med school and is very financially stressed).... But AITA if I don't think it's fair I'm being asked to contribute a big chunk of cash to this bachelorette weekend when I'm not even a bridesmaid and haven't been included in really any aspect? I haven't given an answer yet, but don't really know what to do here.

EDIT to add/clarify: I am not invited to the ceremony. I am invited to the reception. And I am invited to the bachelorette weekend. I would never in a million years ponder paying for an event I'm not even invited to, I'm not that daft.",357,2614,0.96

1540,Not the A-hole,"At the time of this story, I was a college freshman living in the dorms on campus. For the floor I lived on, you had to be in the college's Honors program to live there. There were a few empty singles on my floor that year, but it was really uncommon to have vacancies. 

A few months into the semester, a girl (I'll call her Tricia) moved into one of the empty single rooms right next door to me. I learned really soon on that she wasn't in the Honors program but had to move into a single room because of her disability. 

At first, everything was fine. Tricia obviously had a mental handicap and didn't catch up on social cues all the time, but it wasn't anything serious. 

Then, the smell of stale urine started coming from Tricia's room. I really cannot oversell the smell- it was like a cloud of stench that extended a full room's length on either side of her door. I was choking on it outside my room, and it got to the point where I could even smell it inside my room with the door closed. 

Apparently, Tricia had started the year in a double room, but she would constantly urinate and defecate the bed and not clean up after herself properly. She was moved to a single room after her roommate complained. 

I contacted my RA to complain first, but nothing came of it. 

My friends and I planned to stay in the same rooms next year, and to my horror, I saw that Tricia would be returning too. 

I immediately contacted my college's residence department. Besides the huge hygeine issue, Tricia wasn't an Honors student. It was totally fine for her to switch into an empty room if there were no other singles open, but it wasn't right for her to occupy a space that could go to an Honors student for the coming year. 

The residence department folks ripped me a new one. They said I should be more compassionate and empathetic to Tricia's disability and realize how embarrassing this all must be for her. They also pointed out that Tricia needed a single room, and that my floor was a good place for her.

1542,Everyone Sucks,"I’m Facebook friends with someone I went to high school with two decades ago. We were never close. He’s just one of those FB connections that build up over time. 

Anyway, he never used to post on political topics, but within the last two years he’s started sharing a lot of content about the QAnon conspiracy theory. It’s ridiculous and incendiary stuff and it’s clogging up my feed to the point that it’s all I see when I log into fb sometimes. 

Last week I started leaving comments on his posts explaining how there was no truth to any of it and he began to angrily reply and insult me. It pissed me off he was insulting me so I started to mock him and the QAnon movement for being gullible fools. He replied with a comment about how a great reckoning was coming and the second amendment meant it wouldn’t end well for me. 

At this point I insulted him again and asked what he meant about the second amendment. He replied “it means I’m gonna put a bullet between your eyes the next time I see you.”

To be honest, I wasn’t really scared for my own safety—we live in different states. But it still bothered me someone would make a death threat so casually, even if I was trying to make him mad. So I took a screenshot and sent it to his employer. I received a very apologetic email from the company saying they’re taking the matter seriously and that he no longer works there. 

Of course I start to get abusive fb messages from his friends, which I just ignore. But I was telling this story to friends over drinks last night and the group was pretty divided. A couple were very upset with me. I’m mostly looking for a second opinion here. Did I go too far?",45,30,0.81
1543,Asshole,"&#x200B;

A little background info, I am 37f and she is 27 and due to work obligations we basically see each other once a week, either she comes over to my apartment and stays for 2-3 days or I do. During this particular week she was over at my place and we had an awesome time together the first dau. The next day I was supposed to be at work from 9am to 4pm and I left her alone in my apartment while I tended to work. During my shift I learned that I had to stay until 4:30 because my shift change was running late and I told her that I was coming home asap and she said it was okay and that she didn't mind hanging alone for a little while.

&#x200B;

So fast forward two hours later I completely lost track of time, didn't text her or call her that i was gonna be late and even though my shift ended at 4:30 i went to have a drink or two with friends. She wrote me a message at 6pm asking me what's the hold up and I told her i am having drink with friends, she didn't reply. When I arrived home at around 7:30pm she wasn't there yet I felt like a terrible piece of shit when I peeked into the kitchen and saw that she'd made my favorite dish and plus went out of her way to get my favorite wine.

&#x200B;

She came back at round 10:30, still pretty mad and I asked her where she was she said she was out with a friend. Then she confronted me by saying that she understands if my friends or colleagues dropped by at my workplace and it was fine and that she wouldn't have been upset if I texted her and told her that I was running late, she wouldn't have minded even if i arrived home at 00:00 and that all she needed was the info so she wouldn't wait around like an idiot alone. I could see she was upset and if she did the same thing I would have been way more upset than she was at the moment and yet I made the situation worse. All I said to her was ""this is who I am, deal with it"", she then proceeded to pack up all her stuff, threw the dinner in the garbage and left. I begged her to stay but she didn't.

&#x200B;

So how big of an asshole am I?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Unanimous, I deserve it I suppose. I tried to call her and text her and she isn't answering or replying. I will try to mend things between us even though Reddit is on point of me not deserving her.

1547,Not the A-hole,"So, I (17m) have been working at a fast food restaurant (KFC Australia) for 2 and a half years now. I train all of the new employees who come in, and I honestly love every minute of it. At the end of last year, we had a new manager come in (we'll call him Jake). Jake had been working at a different KFC before transferring to our one, and at our store he became a manager. Then, our assistant store manager left, and Jake filled the position. He can be disagreeing at times, but for the most part we got along.

A bit of context for this story, we have 4 registers, 3 ones we've had for ages and one new one that was just put in. With the 3 old ones, the one on the right kept jamming and you had to hit it for it to work, the one on the left would be tough to open and the one in the middle would work perfectly.

So, I usually work in the morning, meaning that I get to pick what register I get to choose. I, obviously, always choose the middle one, and it's never been a problem before. Well, last week Jake came in and saw me on the middle register. He looked at me, and looked at my female co-worker next to me on the right register, and said;

""Hey Kalipokai, from now on you're going to be on the register on the right.""

""Ha ha...why?"" I thought he was joking.

""Because that one is tough to hit, and some of the girls have trouble with it. You're stronger than them, you can use it.""

""Hahaha, no I'll just stick to this one.""

""I'm being serious.""

""...oh, ok."" I didn't see him that week until earlier today, where this happened:

""Kalipokai, why are you on that register?""

""...oh, I got here early this morning and just... chose it.""

""Kalipokai, I was serious about you only being on that register from now on.""

""Jake, I'm sorry but I'm not being confined to a register, especially when this is a rule only for me.""

""Kalipokai, I'm serious.""

""Jake, so am I."" He then walked away, and I was in shock that this had happened. I've been there longer than him, and never in my 2.5 years of working there had something as ridiculous as this happened. That was also the first time I had spoken back to a manager, and I felt weird after saying it. Was I the asshole?",89,253,0.94

Basically, my wife is on a diet and she fucking loves honey. Like she’s mad for the stuff. I never liked it and think it’s gross. BUT...!

Recently she’s put me on a diet as I’ve been having a few too many beers and so she makes us this delicious yoghurt/ granola/ strawberry combo. She drizzles a tiny bit of this honey on top and we have it as lunch. I never liked honey but in this dish I love it.

Anyway my wife is a total G and I really fancied getting shitting drunk yesterday as the weather has been amazing. She was like cool, no prob. I proceeded to get absolutely drunk and drunk me decided to eat all the fucking honey smothered over fresh bread and butter. Never done that before but man, it was delicious.

1553,No A-holes here,"My ex-wife has had a very aggressive form of leukemia since August of 2017. She’s been in the hospital most of that time except for two periods after a bone marrow transplant. Over this time, she has had periods where she has been on a ventilator, she’s been unable to respond to texts, and sometimes her and her family refuse to give me basic information about her condition. The outcome and survival for this form of the disease is below 1%.

Edit for clarity; My ex-wife hasn’t been home since December. There isn’t anyone to live with. My ex-wife’s mother is staying with my daughter as much as possible. If she were home, this wouldn’t be a thing at all. 

We share a 12 year old daughter. My wife and daughter live 4 hours away. Since she has been in the hospital which is about halfway between our two cities, my daughter has been living at my ex-wife’s home being cared for by my ex-wife’s mother. However, the grandmother drives back and forth to the hospital most days.

During breaks in school, some weekends, summer, and holidays I have my daughter. The only reason my daughter is there is because of her enrollment in school and her friends. One 7 different occasions, I’ve tried to form a plan for when we should consider moving our daughter to live with me.

I have been unable to even get a conversation going or a plan of when “enough would be enough”. My ex-wife in a stable period, but was about to be very sick about 6 weeks ago and I pushed so hard everyone in the family basically unfriended me on social media, stopped giving me information, and told me “I was upsetting everybody.” 

Look, I’d love nothing more than the mother of my daughter to get up and go home to live a long life with our daughter... but she’s mine to protect. (Not the grandparents or a feral kid to raider herself) I have the right to raise her and protect her.

Before anyone asks. I’m not a deadbeat. I have a great job, own my house, no arrests, no drugs or other issues. My daughter and I are extremely close. The issue is they’ve been afraid to 1) accept the high chance my ex-wife is going to die. AND 2) It’s not good for anyone involved to continue to drive 2 hours a day each way while trying to take care of a tween.

My daughter fwiw is getting good grades, no behavioral issues, but she def carries a burden and maturity beyond her age because of this. She’s a brilliant kid. My entire reason for bringing her to live with me is to make sure she is getting the chance to be a kid while she still can AND because she has a family here. AITA for thinking it’s odd she’s alone up there and nobody is seeing an issue.

Lastly. Lawyer has told me because of the complexity, it would be a little drawn out of a fight. Her advice was to just not return her next time she visits. That seems like a course that might make things worse and harm the relationship with my daughter.

TL:DR - ex is very sick. Hasn’t been out of a hospital for 4+ months. Daughter is doing well in school. She doesn’t want to move her. I’m trying to form a plan moving forward. Nobody wants to upset her. Now they’ve cut me off information wise. Wouldn’t be resolved legally before end of school year.

- We were dating for 6 months (2 long distance, since I was traveling with my family).

- My parents paid for my trip, and they invited him to join us on the last 20 days since all the hotels rooms booked were double and I was gonna stay alone, so it wouldn't change the price of the room if he stayed there with me.

- He told me he wanted to go, but he didn't have much money to spend now, so I lent him some money for the food during the trip, and he would pay only for his plane tickets.

- 2 weeks before the trip, we had a stupid argument, and it was my fault, so I apologized and we moved on, or so I thought.

- 5 days before his flight, he stopped texting/calling with the same frequency as before, but I thought he was busy packing. He continued being distant until 1 day before his flight, where I asked him what time to pick him up and if it was everything ok.

- He arrived, he didn't seem so happy to see me, but I imagined he was tired, it was a long international flight.

- We traveled by car to a countryside village, 4 hours from the airport he arrived, and we got there very late and tired. That's when he broke up with me and told me he was seeing my friend for the last few days.

He asked me if I wanted to be away from him, if he should leave, and in that moment my mind got stuck.

I thought that he already had plane tickets to go back with me to the country we live. That he spent a lot of money on the tickets and he would have to spend more money to change his tickets. There was no airport, bus station, train station, uber/taxi service near where we were, and I had no condition to drive him back to the airport.

He had just met my entire family, we even got to the village late because his plane was late and we were waiting for him, so I had no idea what I was gonna tell them (my mom has BPD, and she gets a little stressed when traveling, and I had no idea how she was gonna react to it). I was still processing everything, so I told him he could stay, but if things got bad, I'd ask him to leave.

He stayed, the trip is being awful for me, but I'm keeping an smile on my face to keep my mom and everyone unaware of what was happening, but I'm completely broken inside. I'm trying to enjoy the amazing places we're visiting, but it's hard to get over him sleeping in the same room with him everyday. Honestly, I'm lost, and even my friends don't know what to do. Some told me to send him home, some told me that it will end soon, so I should try to ignore him and enjoy the trip as much as I can.

So, WIBTA if I send him home? He's having the time of his life, my family's having the best time. The only one sad right now is me, and I don't wanna ruin this for everyone.

EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many comments, thank you all so much! You all already made up my day. I'll try to read it all and answer all of you, sorry that I didn't had the time yet. I'm doing my best to enjoy everything here, I went for a walk by myself, and it was a good day for me, was good having some time for me. Meeting him in the room later was annoying, but ok, I'll tell him to make an excuse for my family and leave. I know it's easier to say it than doing it, I'm kind of still a little overwhelmed with all and getting over him, but I know that it will be better. Again, thank you all, I was feeling really lost. I'll come back to update asap

Update: I asked him to leave, I told him I wasn't feeling good around him and that no matter how much he tried to make the trip good for me, being consoled by the one that hurted you is the worst thing that exists. He got angry at me, he said that I was being dramatic and started a fight. We got late to meet my family for breakfast so my mom came to the room to call us, but she was already angry, so, I don't know why I pretended that I was feeling sick that's why we were late, I thought that telling the truth in that moment would be worse. I won't tell my family, I rather not, but he said he will find another place to stay. I'm ashamed to admit that I feel stupid for not being able to do something that seems so obvious for all of you, that I'm treating everyone better than I treat myself, and I hope I'll change that soon, but at least, he said he will sleep somewhere else.

1558,Not the A-hole,"I am white and my girlfriend is Chinese. I met her in college while she was studying here, and continued dating after she graduated and got her green card.

I recently proposed to her and she said yes, but said I would need to ask her parents for permission before we get married. She also explained that it’s tradition that the groom pay the brides family a dowry in the form of a lump sum of cash.

Note: her sisters dowry was 80,000 RMB (~12,000 USD).

So we travel to Henan province to her home village and I ask her parents. Having looked up before hand online, I was expecting to pay a dowry of anywhere between 50,000 - 150,000. They end up **demanding** I pay 800,000 RMB (~120,000 USD). 

The thing is, I’m successful and can definitely afford this amount of money. I would happily give away 120K to marry my girlfriend, however what angered me is the fact they were clearly asking for this much simply because I’m a foreigner. As I said, her sisters dowry was 1/10th of that.

There was no way I could decline this without pissing off her family, so I just declined as politely as possible and left. This initially upset my girlfriend thinking I valued the money more than her - but after reassuring her it was a matter of respect she said she understood and agreed her parents were trying to take advantage of me for being a foreigner.

So as you’d expect, my girlfriends entire family things I’m an asshole foreigner shitting over their culture/tradition. But to me, I simply resent being taken advantage of, and was happy to pay the normal amount.

My girlfriend and I would end up supporting them anyway as it’s chinese tradition. Why on earth should I pay them a crap load of money on top of that?

It's been awhile. At the time, I proceeded with my asshole plan: I interviewed her to appease her father, but I had no intention of hiring her. However, when I finally met her, I was pleasantly surprised. She was very mature, clearly intelligent and well-spoken, and apologized for her dad's relentless behavior. I was singing a different tune by the end of the interview, and I did offer her a job, but her availability did not match our very specific needs at that time.

However, about two months ago, we opened a 2nd location and were hiring for all shifts.

As of today, she is the only employee I have who has never called off, been late, or left early.

1564,Not the A-hole,"On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.

The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.

I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

1565,Asshole,"So, I started dating a girl a couple weeks ago. She’s great, it’s been going well.

But last night she went to her gay best friends birthday party. Cool, no problem. 

She gets pretty drunk. Long story short she sent me snaps of her cuddling with her “gay” best friend and they took a nap together.

I told her I was extremely uncomfortable with this, and she replied “he’s gay? Why are you so worried” 

Her friends also told me I was being overprotective and ridiculous for getting mad at her. 

Am I being abrasive here? And is it okay to be pissed even though he’s gay? I feel like it’s not okay to sleep with someone else who is the other gender no matter what sexuality they are when you’re in a relationship...",85,43,0.93
1566,Asshole,"This morning my wife informed me that she was going to RSVP for her friend’s bachelorette party.  It is going to be a 3 night trip to Cancun at a 4-star all-inclusive resort in Mexico with around 8 girls.  The cost for the resort and flights is roughly $850 per person and I’m assuming the total cost of the trip will easily pass $1000.

I initially balked at the cost and asked if there was maybe another option for a bachelorette party or if she could stay at one of the other, cheaper resorts in the area (there are quite a few in the area that are significantly cheaper and she could purchase day passes to the expensive, 4-star resort the bride chose).  

She got defensive and brought up the fact that 2 years ago we were guests at a friend’s destination wedding (I was a groomsman) at a different resort in Mexico that ended up costing us around $800 total.  In addition, I went to a bachelor party in Vegas that year (although I went on the cheap, stayed one night sleeping on a hotel floor and ended up actually winning several hundred dollars which covered all costs and put me $600 ahead).


I guess what really makes me upset about this is that about a year ago my wife unilaterally decided to effectively stop working as a realtor (where she made around $60k) and began working as a Zumba instructor instead while doing a little bit of realtor work (making under $20k).  This has made me, a teacher, have to pay basically all of our bills for the past year and has put us in a pretty tight spot financially.

1567,Not the A-hole,"I hire and fire employees all the time, but this one is sticking with me. I let someone go today who just found out that his wife is expecting their fifth child; they have 4 kids under 7.  His wife is a SAHM. He was hired less than 90 days ago so he was still on probation. He was hired to be the employee responsible for our company supply room. His primary responsibility was to take and deliver orders to departments, stock shelves, inventory and reorder supplies. Not the most vital job in our company, but depended on by many departments. 

The employee was frequently 15-30 minutes late to work (13 out of the last 20 days, including today) and would usually use the drop off lines at his oldest kid’s school as the reason, or that his wife had an appointment that ran over and he had to stay home with the kids until she got back.  The only reason why I know his wife just found out she was pregnant was because I verbally addressed the tardiness with him last week, and he said that day he was late because he and his wife had an appointment to find out if she was. He was so excited to share the news. 

He was also reportedly receiving 2-3 personal phone calls each shift through our system, all from his wife (cell phones aren’t allowed; employees leave them in a locker room and can check them during breaks and lunch). I only know this because our receptionist complained about the frequency this week. Apparently the wife would keep calling back if the receptionist was on the other line, and the wife would hang up and call back again if it took more than 30 seconds for the receptionist to track him down in the building. 

The employee was keeping up with his work, so we didn’t think his tardiness and time on the phone was an issue, until a few nights ago. Apparently he was struggling to keep up so he and his two oldest kids would come in after hours to help him catch up on his duties. We were not aware this was happening until we watched security tapes to find out who propped the main office door open two nights ago. He was not clocking in to do this, explaining to me today that this job was everything to his family and that it would be devastating to lose their only source of income.  He propped the door open so his kids could get in – they had been closing the door behind them but this one instance they forgot and the security discovered it. 

When I let him go, he was in tears. I had scheduled a meeting with him this morning to address the phone calls and his continue tardiness; this was supposed to be his written warning meeting. However, leaving the door propped open is an unforgivable offense. I also wasn’t really sure how I was going to address his children in the workplace, doing his work. I’ve never had that happen before. And then the not clocking in piece.  

Should I have let him off easier? Should I have advocated for him to get another chance? Or am I asshole status?",165,555,0.96

He also hired me in a state with no laws against transgender discrimination before my name was legally changed. Most of the coworkers are fun and goofy. One coworker I get along with pretty well, except she keeps trying to get me to go to church with her.

Now I'm a trans guy and have been transitioning for quite a while so most people just assume I'm gay if anything and nobody can tell that I'm trans even other trans people so I don't think this really has anything to do with that, however as a trans person obviously churches are rather terrifying places and I do not feel safe in them. 

She just keeps trying to get me to go to stuff and at first I said no thanks and was actually kinda happy she wanted to hang out outside of work. Then she asked again when they had free Olive garden for some function, We are college students so free good food is the absolute shit, but I am still scared of churches so I said no. After that she asked again and I kinda got a little annoyed, I told her I was an atheist and churches made me uncomfortable. She still kept asking. To me, trying to get someone who is an atheist to go to church is that same as trying to get someone of a different religion to go to your church.

My mom would give you the shirt off her back and I think my aunt is threatened by how kind my mom is. My aunt (we’ll call her Julie from here on out) has made my mom cry more times than I can count. But I kept on inviting her to shit like my wedding and my kids birthday parties because it was important to my mom. 

Then came the straw that broke the camel’s back. It was my son’s first birthday party. Everyone was at my house and we were waiting for Julie to get there. My mom gets a call and it’s Julie saying that her car is broken down and she needs my mom to come get her. My mom and my brother go to pick them up. Now according to my mother, the second Julie got in the car, she started in on my mom. Saying shit like we were ruining her weekend by having my sons birthday party on race day (we live in Indiana and she’s a big fan of the Indy 500) but I am not a race fan so I had no clue it was race day. She was complaining about having to come to my house because it’s “in the ghetto”. It’s not but whatever. Just generally shitting on me and my life choices. Julie would NEVER say this shit to my face because she knows I would have called her out. 

Anyways, they all get back to my house and my mom comes in crying AGAIN. I ask her what happened and she tells me all the stuff Julie said. I tell Julie she isn’t welcome in my home and she sits outside and smokes on my front porch until her husband picks her up. She left all of her cigarette butts in a styrofoam cup on my front porch when she left which I thought was extremely rude and gross. Basically, my sons first birthday was ruined because all anyone could talk about was Julie and I spent the majority of the day just calming my mom down. 

I decided right then and there that I was done with Julie. I haven’t invited her to anymore of my family events. I don’t go to family gatherings when she might be there. I haven’t spoken to her in over two years. My mom thinks I’m overreacting. She always says that family gets unlimited chances.

So anyways when I got my drivers license when I was 16, my parents bought me a 2008 Honda Accord which is a pretty nice car in my opinion and I was really grateful. Fast forward to when my brother got his driver's license, my parents didn't have the time to look for a car for my brother so he ended up driving my car when I wasn't using it. After about a couple of months of him driving my car, he ended up crashing my car into a tree because he wasn't paying attention to the road. Since the accident wasn't my fault, my parents offered to buy me a new car which I was very grateful for again because I spent majority of my savings on my first year of college and I'm still saving up for a new one. Anyways, they ended up buying me a car that many people would call a beater. It's a 1998 Toyota Corolla and honestly driving that car scares me but I sucked it up and didn't complain because I didn't wanna sound ungrateful and I appreciate them for buying the car for me. Well today, my parents told me that they found a car for my brother. It's the same car I had before but with better mileage and it looks newer. I asked them if he could take the beater and if I could take the new car instead because he was the one who crashed my car so I should get the better car. They said I had to talk to my brother and it was up to my brother if he wanted to drive the beater and obviously he said no. Now they're saying the car is gonna be for him and I'm honestly pissed about it but I feel like I shouldn't be because it's not even my money that I'm spending on the car.

Now I'm 20 years old and I work and pay my own bills. My friend has been my best friend since high school.

We were chatting about people we knew at our favorite kava bar she then mentions a guy who had everything paid for him, I just nodded along to the conversation until she mentioned how I'm not very different from this guy and I became a little confused. I asked for an explanation and it's because of the trust fund from when my mother passed away.

1578,No A-holes here,"A few days ago this really sweet cat tried to run into my house as I was walking in. I didn’t let him in. The next day when I got home, he was sitting outside my door, so I stopped and pet him for a bit. I noticed how skinny he was, so I brought out some food and water. It was supposed to storm, so I brought him in overnight. 

The next day I took him to the vet to get him checked out as I have a dog, and didn’t want him to transfer any diseases to my dog. The vet said he had a tape worm and dental disease, and may have more problems (I didn’t have him tested for everything as I intended to find the owner and didnt want to spend a hundreds of dollars on tests and vaccines). 

I’ve had him for a couple of days now, and just found a flyer with his picture on it. The flyer said he went missing the exact same day I found him. With the condition he was in, I would have thought he was out for at least a week or two! I’m reluctant to return this cat to an owner who does not properly take care of him. Does that make me an asshole?

Edit: I’ll be going back to the vet tomorrow to find out if she thinks there’s been a history of neglect.

Edit 2: Apparently some details need to be added. The last few days I was actively looking for the owner as I was not trying to keep the cat. Therefor, I was not looking for justification to keep him either. I just became concerned when I realized he was not gone for very long at all when I found him. 

I have reason to believe that they have been keeping him outside, so he definitely would have been caught in that storm if I hadn’t taken him in. For context, this is not a safe place for outdoor cats at all. Not sure I can say why without giving away too much detail. 

I still plan to call the vet and get their opinion. I’ll be doing that right after typing this. If they say there’s no cause for concern, I’ll of course call the owner immediately. After that I plan to call the property owner and find out if you’re even allowed to keep outdoor pets here. If you’re not, hopefully that will deter them from leaving him outside again. I think it’s very likely that they keep him outside in order to avoid paying the pet fee. I’ll update again after my conversation with the vet.

Edit 3: The vet has assured me that they have no reason to believe the cat has been abused or neglected. I called the owner, and they will be picking him up at some point today. Thank you to everyone who gave rational advice rather than just telling me to just keep him or to just give him back without questioning abuse or neglect.

Edit 4: Okay this is probably my last edit. The owner’s friend came and picked him up a moment ago. I explained everything to her, and she was very thankful for everything I did and the way I handled it. She said that she won’t be letting him outside again, which was quite a relief to me.

1581,Everyone Sucks,"Earlier today, I treated myself to one of my bimonthly sushi visits. I always go to the same restaurant, and I order the same thing. I’ve been doing this for at least 3 years. Like many, I have the occasional sushi craving, and I know exactly where to get my fix.

But on to the story... I marked the rolls I desired on this laminated menu. This is the typical ordering process at the place. My waitress came over, and I told her I was ready and handed her the my menu. She took it, and went away, skipping the usually step of reading what I marked to confirm my order.

Later she shows up with my food, and I see a different roll on the plate, and I’m sort of just confused in the moment, wondering if it was someone else’s plate or maybe I ordered the wrong thing. She leaves before I can figure out what’s going on. 

I see that I do have the rolls that I ordered, but there was also this order of a fancier roll on my plate, way too extravagant for my modest sushi desires. But I’m a chill guy, I’ll just start eating and wait till she comes back to explain.

So she shows up as I’m eating, and I explain. The convo goes roughly...

Me: hey, I didn’t order this roll from the menu

Evil Waitress: yes, you did. It was marked on the menu

Me: well, I did not mark it. Maybe there was a mistake, or possibly the menu wasn’t cleared from a previous customer.

Evil Waitress: I read it.... 

Silent staring

The end

So she leaves, not concerned about the problem now laid upon me.

My first instinct was to just take the loss, and get over it. Then a small movie played in my head of me laboring at work exchanging sweat for an honest wage, a simple man trying to make it in the world.

I’m here to have a nice meal, trying to make a Good Friday into a Great Friday, and I have no desire to have to take on this burden of confronting a manager and trying to explain my way out of this unjust $11.00 charge.

Little did she know that while other people were going on dates and having families, I was studying the dark arts of petty passive aggression, a worthy student of Costanza.

I decided that if she, knowing my issues, places the item on my check, then my potential tip will be reverted to that cost. I’m a nice guy, I usually give 20% standard, 30% if they put any extra effort at all.

So I guess today injustice was on the menu. The bill was $40, including the $11. So in my perspective, I’m giving 38% on a $29 meal.

I leave the extra roll completely untouched and the receipt folder empty of any money gained through extortion. It was my silent message to this poor woman that didn’t know what she was up against.

1582,Not the A-hole,"First, background info.

My parking spot is challenging on its own. My parking lot is in the back of my building and each spot is long enough for two cars. The first few spots of the lot are on a decline towards the building (meaning the part of the car closer to the alley is higher than the part of the car closest to the building). To make things worse my spot is the very first one and is next to the sidewalk, which is level to the alleyway. My spot has a giant manhole at the end right by the alley and sidewalk. This manhole is so messed up if you aren’t careful going over it you bottom out. Finally, and important to note, there is an entire parking lot on the other side of the alley that is empty and does not tow.

Next door to my building is another apartment building; however, this one does not have any parking spots allocated to it. In the past couple weeks there has been this same car that parks off the side of the alleyway blocking my spot. Earlier this week as I was leaving for work and she was blocking my spot. She didn’t move until I shot her a look.

So today, I was on my way back from work. Full disclosure, I was in a bad mood because school, work and life exist. And, I had accidentally slammed my entire hand in the car door while leaving work about 15 minutes prior. I get to the lot and SHE WAS BLOCKING MY SPOT AGAIN. I had to come in from the other side and finesse my way into the spot like I’ve never had to before. Took me an extra 5 minutes, and I only had one good hand at the moment.

So, then I see her come out of the building next to mine (as the door is literally RIGHT NEXT to my car). So, I get out of the car and I just look at her and I say, ""Not to be a dick, but do you think you could stop parking your car there. We both know this isn't the first time you've been in my way and that's NOT a parking spot. There is quite literally an entire EMPTY lot right beside where you are parked and you chose to BLOCK me so that you were, what? 5 feet closer to the door? Do you think you could maybe not? I'd hate to be forced to have your car towed"". (And yes, that is almost exactly what I said and I have an attitude when I'm in a good mood so I'm sure it came out assertive and sassy) She looked shocked/scared and let out a meek, ""okay"". I rolled my eyes and just walked away.

Now I'm not a stranger to lecturing people who deserve it, but this is the first time I've ever just snapped on a stranger. I'm afraid of turning into a bitter old ""can I speak to the manager"" lady. Not that it's really that extreme.

I guess you could say she's a love addict, and she usually ends up seeking out guys who are sex addicts. She goes to meetings and shit but say they don't help. And her longest relationship was like a month long.

&#x200B;

And when I say toxic, I mean TOXIC. Like her brother found her passed out with her wrists slit after her boyfriend got another girl pregnant. And it's not always the other person being shitty, she's cheated and abused people too.

&#x200B;

So she asked me to set her up with someone I know and I was like ""Welllll, honestly, I don't know any single guys""

&#x200B;

THEN THE NEXT DAY, she asked me again and I was like ""Idk I don't set me friends up""

THEN SHE ASKED ME AGAIN .-. AND I'M LIKE ""Honestly I don't want to get you into another shitty relationship. If you find a man yourself, alright. But I'm not going to find someone for you because I just don't think it'd be good for you.""

&#x200B;

And she's all ""UGH HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME???? Maybe my problems would go away if I found a guy who was nice""

1591,Not the A-hole,"I went on vacation with my school to Japan for a period of two and a half weeks.  My sister was the only person home, so I asked that she take care of my saltwater aquarium and my cat in my absence.  I gave her very simple instructions, pour in freshwater every two days, feed the fish exactly four pellets every two days, close the window blinds so that algae doesn't grow, etc...  I never asked her to do complicated things like test the water, clean the filter or skimmer, or perform a water change.  I left a paper attached to the tank glass which listed all the steps of care and the order they should be performed in.  I told her to follow these steps and to not stray off under any circumstances.  

When I returned home, however, I found the tank in dissarray.  The water was clouded green to the point where the back of the tank was not visible, and all coral in the tank was white, all the fish left in the tank were stressed as hell, and there were a couple fish and a shrimp missing.  I flipped my shit, admittedly a little too much, and asked what happened.  She told me that she lost the care instructions and, apparently, never contacted me about the tank.  She said that she did only half of what she remembered, since she said she thought the rest was unnecessary.  She also fed the fish more than 7 pellets once a day, which was over twice what I specifically told her.  Food is the largest pollutant in the tank and causes wild problems with the water parameters if overfed. She blew it off like it was nothing, saying it ""wasn't a big deal,"" that it ""could be easily fixed,"" that they were ""just dumb fish,"" among some other things.  I lost my favorite fish named Wally, a yellow tang whom I loved as if he was a pet.  I played with him all the time, teasing him with my finger on the glass.  My clownfish, Franz and Kohler, used to do the same with me when I fed them, and the two ate out of my hands.  These weren't just fish to me, they were my pets.  They had the same value to me as my cat.  I tried to save what was left, but in the following days, I found all six of my fish and all of my countless coral dead.  

No amount of testing, water changes, reef-safe medication or husbandry could have fixed the damage that was done.  She's treating me like I'm the asshole for getting angry and incredibly sad that she neglected and killed my pets.  My poor pets who didn't deserve to die.  I am devastated, and she seems to miss that, and now I feel like an absolute cunt for yelling at her like I did.  But is that excusable?  Am I really being the asshole here?

What I do know is, I have work to do.  I buried my fish and inverts in a grave in the backyard.  I have to replace all 45 gallons of water in the tank.  I have to clean the filter, skimmer, and pumps. I have to replace thousands of dollars worth of fish and coral that I myself earned and cherished dearly.  It's not pretty.",88,260,0.96
1592,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I got engaged over a week ago.  Unfortunately we’ve had to keep it under wraps because her father is really old fashioned and she’s asking me to ask her father for permission first and then we have an “official” engagement.  This has been a point of contention ever since I proposed, her father and I do not have a good relationship.  

I’ve never been anything but respectful to the man.  He on the other hand has just been a straight out asshole to me ever since first meeting me.  He mocks my appearance, my job, my personality, even has made comments about my parent’s divorce.  At first I was hoping he would warm up to me once he got to know me and would accompany my girlfriend on her trips to visit her family.  When it became clear that he was never going to keep disrespecting me even at his wife’s and my girlfriend’s objection I stopped going with her on her trips.  

The man obviously loves abusing this imaginary power he has over me as her father, me asking for her hand is just another opportunity for him to do so.  It’s especially imaginary this time because my girlfriend has told me that we’re getting married no matter what his answer is.  Respect goes both ways and his constant disrespect for me has lost him all of mine.  I’m really not interested in his answer or even his opinion on it.  I’ll keep feigning respect and politeness when I’m forced to be around him, but I’m not really looking to take another long trip down there to give him another opportunity to spit in my face.

1593,Not the A-hole,"I live in a house share of 4 people. My girlfriend (lets call her ‘Sam’) will usually stay over one night of the week, and one night on the weekend. We cook dinner then eat and watch a movie in my room. For context, I am usually at Sam’s place two nights a week also. 

Only one roommate has a problem with this, and asked to have a warning/schedule of when Sam will be staying over. This is difficult since I work irregular hours, and usually only know on the day if mine and Sam’s schedules line up.

I asked my roommate why she would like a schedule, and the reasoning was to make sure Sam does not feel uncomfortable/intruding on ""mood setting"". I reassured my roommate that Sam never feels uncomfortable and they are not intruding, and asked if my roommate feels uncomfortable as we would not want to cause that. My roommate assured me she doesn’t, but still wants a schedule. The thing that triggered me is when I asked my roommate about having friends or guys over, she replied saying she does not need to tell me when her friends are coming over, and that she has guys over (whom she referred to as ‘creepy’ and ’revolving doors’) all the time in the middle of the night without letting the rest of us know.

1594,Not the A-hole,"Hello, this is my first Reddit post and I'd like some advice please. 

I have 3 great children.  17 Male, 16 Male, and 14 Daughter.  I don't claim to be the prefect parent and neither does my wife, but we definitely think we are raising them to be good kids.  

I am not stupid either.  I know kids have sex, but we have always had what I thought was a fair policy.  Both sons are allowed to have friends spend the night if they're boys, and my daughter can have her female friends spend the night.  We allow opposite sex children to be over but they can't be in the bedroom with the doors closed.  

Well my middle son (Noah) has found a loophole.  Turns out he's gay.  We have suspected for awhile, but my wife recently confirmed it.  Now I am totally okay with him being gay, that's not the issue.  He has a ""friend"" (Tyler) who is a pretty nice kid.  Well he spent the night last weekend and we did what we always do and put the blowup mattress in my sons room.  

Breakfast came the next morning and my wife went to go get the boys to eat.  She went upstairs to get them and knocked on the door, no answer.  So she opened it slowly and low and behold they're both sleeping in Noah's bed spooning each other.  The sheets on the blowup never touched.  So she closed the door and went up 30 minutes later and knocked louder.  This time after hearing some running around Noah opens the door with Tyler in the blowup.  

So we have both decided we want Noah to tell us when he's ready and not to call him out.  We have made it clear we'd be okay with anything.  In the meantime though, that creates a problem.  Noah is having his boyfriend (or I assume) spend the night and hooking up with him.  

So in order to be fair against all 3 kids, Tyler shouldn't be spending the night.  So my oldest son has two twin beds in his room, and my daughter has pullout second mattress in her room.  So my wife's idea is that we ""break"" the blowup mattress.  We can set them both up the family room which is downstairs, a couch for each of them.   So this wouldn't change the rules for the other two as they already have extra room in their rooms, but Noah wouldn't have the room in his full (although he proved us wrong on that), and he would have to sleep downstairs with no more blowup.  

I admit I go so back and forth on this one.  On one hand, it's not fair to the other two kids, but on the other hand he did find a loophole.  

My other concern is I don't know how Tyler's parents feel about homosexuality.  I am afraid their could be backlash if they find out he's been sleeping in the bed with my son.  

So AITA here?",49,178,0.99
1595,Not the A-hole,"Some background info: Together with my girlfriend for almost 2 years, we live together and we're both 20.

Alright, so my girlfriend was having issues with her birth control. I'll admit I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to that stuff but I'll support her no matter what, and it was bothering her so I encouraged her to look at her options and she decided to switch to a different type of birth control.

It's been over a week since we went to a clinic and she got an IUD or something if I remember correctly. Everything has been going well for her outside some minor cramps but she says she's feeling way better, and I'm happy when she's happy. She was very excited because we could finally ditch the condoms, and told me about how she was looking forward to that.

Now don't get me wrong, no rubber sounds great. But I *really* don't want any kids at the moment, and I know my girlfriend feels the same way. I don't want to take any risks, but my girlfriend insists that it's fine. She got a little bit mad when I told her I wasn't too keen on no condom and we got into quite the argument yesterday because of it, and she kept saying it would be okay. We had sex afterwards and she was very much not into it and it today she's still visibly upset. I understand that she was excited but we're in no position to raise a child right now and how nice it may sound, going raw is a risk. Am I the asshole here though?

Edit: I feel really stupid. Pretty sure I confused the IUD with something else, should have done way more research. Didn't know about any failure rates or anything like that. Definitely considering ditching the condoms, will have to talk with the gf. Thanks for the info everyone.",120,35,0.84

1599,Not the A-hole,"WARNING: The post is based on the controversial topic of abortion. I am not here to try to sway any of you, but it is important to the context.

&#x200B;

Context: I (22F) have been with my SO (21M) for 2 years. He is originally from the other side of the country and goes to uni in my city. He has a 16 year old sister who is important to this story. I've been made aware since the very beginning, of his family's very religious and conservative political leanings. Fine with me, we don't all have to agree with our parents, he doesn't agree with his. That said, my SO has requested that I engage as little as possible with his family as I will be meeting them for the first time at his graduation this upcoming May. He;s not close with them and we wanted to keep it peaceful.

&#x200B;

If it's not already obvious, I identify as pro-choice. I do not give a shit what you want to do with your family planning. BUT I believe that should be able to make whatever choice is best for them. This includes having access to a safe and legal abortion. Like most young people I re-post things I believe in on my social media and on this particular day had posted something about legal abortion.

&#x200B;

Now, I assume that people look at my Instagram story the same way I see theirs; Read: In passing while on the toilet. So I was surprised to see my SO's younger sister had commented on my story  The message read as follows:

&#x200B;

""You know, there's this thing called ADOPTION. Killing something is never okay just because you were stupid enough to get pregnant. Abortions shouldn't be birth control for women who are too dumb to use protection and anyway, sex is for procreation not pleasure.""

&#x200B;

Now, I'm no dummy, I know that by speaking my opinions I am opening myself up to criticism Speech is free, but free does not mean without retaliation. I considered saying nothing, but I felt it would have been irresponsible of me to not explain myself. I saw it as a learning opportunity for her. I'm the first person in her life who isn't a Republican and I feel that to really understand any topic you must understand both sides. So I answered. It resulted in her getting upset with me and telling her dad that I antagonized her. He then called my SO saying I was being mean and telling her ""inappropriate things"" and my SO is upset with me for arguing with his sister. I have kept posting since it happened and he has asked that I stop because she might see and he doesn't want another argument.

&#x200B;

I recognize I'm in the wrong for engaging her in the first place, but frankly, for him to try to tell me what I can and can't post on my own social media pisses me off. SHE chooses to follow me and I'm now supposed to  post differently because he wants to avoid her getting her feelings hurt? If she doesn't like what I post, and can't discuss without getting upset she can just as easily not follow me.",80,28,0.79

This whole thing has made me realize how little I am ready to make that next step. I am not ready to settle down. I want to break up with her because I don't want to be pressured into settling down and I want to enjoy my 20's more.

So, we're watching it and maybe about halfway into it she asked a question and I answered her, but then told her that I don't want to answer anymore questions because I'm just trying to watch it and there's too much for me to catch her up on. She kind of agrees, but then a little bit later she wanted to ask me another question and instead of answering I straight up just told her that I'm not going to answer any of her questions. 

My tone might have been a bit abrupt so she got a peeved and said something along the lines of *""well, maybe I should get a boyfriend who would answer my questions""*, and then something like *""you know, if you had a question about something I would answer it""*... to which I responded *""if I didn't watch 7 previous seasons of a TV show and just started watching during the very last season I wouldn't even have the nerve to ask questions about the show in the first place""* and told her that I'm just not going to watch the rest of the episodes with her cause there's too much to catch up on and I don't want to spend the time answering her questions while I'm trying to watch the show.

After the episode was over we're kind of at an impasse and snark each other a bit and then she says something like *""well, it was only two questions it's not a big deal""*... to which I said something like, *""well, it's not just two questions because you probably would have asked even more if I didn't say I wasn't going to answer them... are you going to ask questions if we watch the next episode together?""* and she said *""yeah probably""* so I straight up said I'm not watching it with her anymore.

I explained to her the situation and she said, what's the point? I said, if I did have ADHD, then they would have to prescribe medication to me so I could focus and study.

Okay, so, I go to university and I live on campus. My campus is pretty big (about a square mile). I also work on campus at a restaurant famous for their chicken sandwiches. I got the job in early February so I haven’t been working there for THAT long. My first week there we just would compost all the left over food we had and wow, it was a lot. But then we were allowed to take it back with us, how much we wanted. Now, when i mean a lot, I mean about 10 sandwiches, 5 nuggets packets and 2 fries each along if we had any desserts left.

Now, I can’t eat all that so I started giving it away to people on my floor at my dorm (we have a group chat our community assistants put us in), and because everyone on my floor loves that restaurant, they would come running to my door within the minute I sent the message.

But then, people started getting mad that someone took what they wanted or if I didn’t have anymore or just being greedy and taking a lot when I know damn well you by yourself don’t need 4 sandwiches and a nugget box. They also got mad I didn’t bring sauces. So I told them what I had and to claim it in the gc so you would what was left. But then I started working more hours and had to walk half a mile after a full 8 hour shift to get to my dorm. So I started leaving it in the common room at our floor as I just wanted to sleep after work and not deal with constant knocking. Then I found out someone would just take all the food (and the food doubled as my roommate also got a job there/closing shift)

Then after maybe a month or so of doing this, my CA told the gc how they all should be thankful we were giving away free food when we didn’t have to. For 10 hours the gc was quiet, no one gave a thank. And it’s not like they did it in person either, just stuck their hand out for the food. So I got fed up with these entitled college kids for thinking they’re doing me a favor by taking food I could have just composted or given to someone else. So I said “thank you guys for none of the appreciation or thank yous, I’ll make sure to never bring food again” then suddenly everyone had the nerve to say thank you. 

It’s been a month and I haven’t given in as I find people while walking across campus and such if they want food, but I can’t help but wonder if ITA for at least expecting a thank you? I know college kids are broke, I got a job so I wouldn’t be. I know ramen is a staple too so having some good food that was 2 hours old at max for FREE probably made their night. But everyone has a meal plan here, I couldn’t help but notice all the death stares I got after they saw I was serious and as if I was taking away their right to food.

A little backstory. My niece is 14 and absolutely loves the Pokemon games. She had a 3DS that she used all the time, but a it met it's unfortunate end in an accident a couple of weeks ago.

My brother's financial situation is a bit unstable at the moment. His long term GF of about 7 years (who I'll call my SIL for simplicity) lost her job and either can't or won't get a new one (Idk the reason, it's none of my business.) My brother makes enough to support his family, he can put food on the table and pay all of the essential bills, but some of the more luxury things like Netflix/Hulu and his internet had to be cut out. He recently found out that his car will need a bit of work so he does have a financial hurdle he is trying to work around at the moment.

So here begins the actual conflict. My nieces birthday is coming up and my brother was talking to me a few days ago about how he may have to push any potential gift back by a few weeks because he can't really afford it. I'm single with no kids in a 2 bedroom apartment, so I have much more leeway in my budget. I offered to replace my nieces 3DS as a birthday gift. He gave me a bit of pushback because he didn't want me to have to cover his ass and there was no way he could pay me back in a reasonable amount of time, but I told him it was fine, that I didn't mind it at all, and that he didn't owe me anything. He is totally ok with it, he just wanted me to take credit for it and not put his name on it. I told him that I want to at least put their name on the $20 Nintendo gift card I want to get so that she can have something to open that is from them. We both agreed to that, he thanked me and I told him I'll buy it soon.

I found this badass Galaxy looking 3DS that I think she will absolutely love. I bought it, along with the $20 gift card. No problem.

This morning I woke up to a text message from my SIL. She's upset with me because she feels that the money I spend on a new gaming console could have gone to something like bills or the car payment, something that would help their family in the long run. She doesn't think it was a good idea to purchase my niece a 3DS at all and is upset with me because of it. She's even asking me not to give it to my niece and to take it back.

I haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say or how I feel about it. On one hand, she is totally right. The 200 dollars I spent on that game system could have really helped my brother and his family out. On the other hand, I should be able to do what I please with my money and it would be awesome if my niece could open a gift on her actual birthday. On top of that, my brother is totally fine with it and gave me the ok. I haven't talked to him about this yet, but I am pretty sure I am still going to give her the 3DS on her birthday.

So am I the asshole?",105,355,0.95
1611,Not the A-hole,"I went to a girls college Bible study (10-11 girls). The girls seemed nice, especially the leader, Rachel. We'd work out together, get coffee, etc. They all found out that I'm engaged and planning a wedding which made me 10x more exciting to them. The wedding and my engagement are practically all they talk about.

These girls are fake AF. Two sisters, Jamie and Lola, pressured me into inviting them to the wedding (couldn't say NO in front of everyone) which resulted in me inviting everyone from the Bible study. I don't really know these girls and had my wedding list planned.

Sometimes, I feel dehumanized by them, like I'm just a golden ticket into a fun wedding. They don't give a crap about me. They want to talk about the wedding and how much fun they're going to have there. As soon as I invited the girls, Jamie already found a dress that SAME NIGHT, then made herself a wedding attendant without asking me. She invites her cousin, then invites herself to the honeymoon (she's dead serious). Lola introduces me to her crush - and everyone else from the campus ministry - as ""the friend whose wedding I'm going to."" Lola invites her crush to my wedding. Another girl, Alice, hangs out with the girls, but never invites me. In fact, when I want to hang out with the girls, they make up an excuse (especially Lola) or bail early if they do hang out. Yet, they all gush about my wedding and magically have time to go cake testing with me.

I quit going once I realized how fake everyone is. Alice is promiscuous and sleeps around, but acts like she’s never heard of sex, is a virgin and naive. The girls (especially Lola) hate Rachel. Rachel tried to break up Alice and her BF because he isn't ""Christian"" enough. Rachel yelled at me in front of an entire church. Rachel told us to ignore a lesbian who came to Bible study because she’s a ""distraction"" and to not get too close to her because we'd encourage her to keep being lesbian. Everyone complains about how fake Rachel is. Yet, everyone keeps coming back and sucking up to Rachel.

Unfortunately, I ran into Rachel and her new BF a month later. She already invited her BF to my wedding. She also rudely told me that her BF (never met him) knew all about me and my family issues. I previously shared a personal family issue as a prayer request (ONLY w/her) because I trusted her as a Bible study leader. She not only told BF, but also her roommate and the other girls my issues. She says they always talk about me every week, but also that they’re all praying for me. My trust is completely broken. I couldn't believe she'd share personal details with other people. No one except Jamie checked on me to see if I was okay; they all gossip in their ""Bible study"". I'm just the ""girl who is engaged/has a wedding.""

I want to uninvite all of them and don't care to have them as friends. They're all hypocrites. AITA here?",295,1155,0.96
1612,Not the A-hole,"To start off some background information.

 I'm gay. I've known this since I was 13 and o well nothing I can do about that; believe me, I've tried. Still in the closet due to numerous reasons so family as absolutely no idea.

&#x200B;

So with Easter coming also comes family, and their dumb questions. How's school going?  Relationships?  Wow, you're so tall, etc, etc , and you know through the typical Spanish inquisition somehow we get to talking about if I'm seeing someone or am in a relationship, to which I reply no.

Then, mother says ""well better start. Otherwise, how am I supposed to eventually get grandkids if you're not even dating,"" I tell her almost automatically and without thinking, in an almost 'Duh!' tone of voice ""well you're not getting grandkids either way"", small quick pause where I think about what I just said and then I say  ""At least not biological"" ""No point in bringing another life into the world were there are so many unwanted kids"".  Thinking phew nice save! to which all hell starts to break loose, she telling me  ""I deserve ""real"" grandkids, not someone else's"", me arguing that like I said adopting a kid is better because it is someone who otherwise may not get a home and a better option than just bringing another life into the world and off course, family decides to get involved and just make the situation worse which ends with me being sent to my room.

1613,Not the A-hole,"I'm using a throw away for obvious reasons. I'm also changing a few things but over all it will be the same story.

One month ago I broke up with my fiance. It's been emotional, stressful, and downright awful. I've had almost no contact with him since that night but from what I hear he's a wreck. I didn't hold back and told him the truth, except for one thing.

Me and my ex met in college and hit it off really quick. We dated for 5 years before he proposed. My ex comes from a very traditional Asian family who immigrated here right after his birth. Both of his parents are extremely successful in their careers and make a ton of money. So when he brought me, a Cuban girl, home to his parents they did not accept me. They made it very clear that they thought I was not worthy of him and for the years I dated him they treated me like a sub-human. This never bothered me. I loved him and thought we could get through this. He never seemed to really care what they said about me either.

After we got engaged I began to realize that he's not too different from his parents. In the year that we were engaged he became extremely controlling. He wanted to know where I was almost every moment of the day, at one point he even said after we are married he wants to schedule out my day so he knows where I am at all times. Along with this I found out he is an alcoholic who can become very belligerent when drunk. These red flags were enough for me and i've been thinking of stepping back for a while now. The real tipping point was when he told me that he feels like he has to ""settle"" for me and that he can do better.

I distanced myself from him emotionally for some time now and have been holding off till I felt ready. That was until last week when his mom called me out of nowhere and wanted to meet up behind my ex's back to ""talk"". We met and had lunch. During this time they made it clear they knew me and my ex were having trouble. They told me they didn't like me, they knew I hated them, and that we would probably never be amicable. They ""saw how unhappy both of us were and that it would probably be best if we broke up"". They then offered me 10 thousand dollars to break up with my ex. To help me ""get over him"".

I took the money

We made an agreement to never tell my ex or anyone else about or ""exchange"". And so that night I went home, packed my bag and broke up with him. I moved out that next week and haven't seen him since. He's called me multiple times but i've ignore him. Mutual friends say he's a wreck and that he still ""loves me"". His parents contacted me once since then thanking me and wishing me luck in life.

I was planning on breaking up with him anyway, that was never going to change. The money though, did help. Was I wrong to take it? His family mistreated me so at the time I just saw it as way of them repaying me for that.I feel like an asshole for taking the money. Am i?",693,3903,0.97
1614,Not the A-hole,"So last weekend I (24M) went on a first date with a girl I met on tinder. I felt it was going pretty good, although maybe a little bit awkward. I casually mentioned that I am bisexual and she was shocked. She sat back in her seat and raised her eyebrows and started nervously laughing. I asked if that was a problem and she said no, but it's a wierd thing to share on a first date. She then compared it to talking about your kinks to someone you just met. I explained that I thought it was an acceptable thing to tell her, and that it was my sexuality, not a kink. She didn't understand this and said it was just plain creepy. 

The rest of the date was VERY awkward and we both just quickly finished our meals and asked for the bill. Just before we left I apologized, she said it was okay, but still couldn't see how I thought it would be a normal thing to talk about on a first date and said it was WAY too forward. We haven't talked since the date now I'm left just feeling confused as to whether it was a wierd thing to say or if she was being wierd about it.

I’ve taken her to the ER twice from her threatening to hurt herself (no actual signs of her ever doing this, she wears skimpy clothes and has never had a cut/bite/bruise)

She is admitting to being severely depressed, off her meds and not seeing her therapist.

I’ve read up on her behaviors (ranging from super happy one minute and having a major meltdown seemingly over nothing 5min later.)

It’s making my son depressed now, he’s not the same at all. He walks on eggshells for her, his mood matches hers now. He defers to her mood, which validates her wild behavior, and it’s making me crazy.

1616,Not the A-hole,"So, I just turned 18. Living with my parents and my younger brother under the same roof. And I´m planning to move out as soon as I can. Why? Well, it´s a long and stupid story.

Since I was a kid (I was the smart one), I had to help my brother with his homework, not a big deal at all. But since I´m about do graduate high school, and get ready for the university I want to go to, I, of course have to prepare myself and get some **me time**.

Problem is:  my parents don´t understand that, and push me to do **ALL** of my brothers work. By all, I mean all. I have to do his homework, teach him for his tests, help him via text on his texts, and that little kid has no respect at all (he is 16 right now). By no respect I mean, when I study he turns the volume of anything he watches to max, comes into my room and talks 24/7, he just distracts me at any free moment I have.

The worst part, my parents  told me I can´t go to collage so I can help him with his high school. I  got pissed (sorry for language, I´m in the same mood rn). So I´m planning to move out as soon as I can.

There is another part to this story. My parents are also controlling af, even my brother. He asked friends to look out for me so I could not go to my boyfriend home. And my parents allow me to go out only once a week, with my brother, so he can watch what I do and take me home. So my social life is basically zero.

They also got pissed at me for me wanting to spend the New Year´s Eve with my boyfriend, there was a lot of arguing and screaming involved and my brother told me in the end that I am a shame for our family.

At the beginning of May (May 3rd, to be exact) I have an appointment for a tonsillectomy. I chose this date specifically because every other available time was at the end of May. Im a karate teacher, and at the beginning of June we are having a black belt test for some students, which I need to be there to spar as well as run a portion of it (which I need my voice for). Obviously I need to be fully healed from surgery and off pain medicine for that, so I planned a month for recovery. 

My parents just called me downstairs to ask if I could reschedule my surgery. My brother (who is severely disabled) has something going on with his leg (I’m not exactly sure what, but it isn’t serious enough for the emergency room, they just want a regular doctors visit). My brothers doctor had May 3rd open and May 8th.

I told them I wouldn’t reschedule, seeing as I need my tonsils out and I also need more than a week of recovery before the black belt test. My mom then put me on a guilt trip (which she tends to do) and said “I had an appointment on May 8th that I was looking forward to, but I’ll have to cancel it. Whatever. It’s fine.” (she had a massage scheduled). Then I said it wasn’t very fair of her to get mad at me, to which she said “I’m not. I’ll just cancel my shit.

1620,Not the A-hole,"For the past year I have been growing out my bleached blonde hair back to my natural dirty-brown color. It's grown out about 7 inches, and I decided it's time to chop my hair to right below my shoulders.

&#x200B;

I decided to look up a cheap place with good reviews and decided on the Super Cuts a few miles away from me. The girl came cutting my hair and was SO sweet and we instantly hit it off with some girl talk.

&#x200B;

Before the hair cut started, I was EXTREMELY FIRM on what I wanted and she seemed to mutually understand. All of my hair one length, no layers, and how many inches needed to come off.

&#x200B;

We went on talking while she was cutting and it went by super fast. At the end she asked me if I wanted it blow-dried and I said no thank you, since I have not put any heat on my hair in almost a year. I got up and she checked me out for the $19 cut and I tipped her $10 but it was such an awesome experience and I felt she deserved it!

&#x200B;

Flash forward to when I get home and take my hair out of my semi-wet bun and brush it out, my hair is literally TWO INCHES longer in the front than in the back. I could not figure out how this had happened!!!! I understand I should have checked the lengths before I left but honestly I didn't even think about it. She seemed so confident and I had a great experience. Now being slightly annoyed I tipped $10 I decided to call Super Cuts and ask if I could stop in tomorrow before work to get it evened out.

&#x200B;

I got in right as they opened at 9 to make it to work at 10am. It was just me, the manager, the girl that cut my hair, 3 other employees in the salon, and 1 other customer. The manager literally asked me to point out which girl had cut my hair the day prior, so I did assuming she'd be like ""omg I'm so sorry I'll fix it right away"" and it would all be over. But, no, the manager proceeds to sit me down in a chair and have everyone gawk at what a horrible job the girl did. I tried my best to be like it's okay no worries I just need it fixed no hard feelings, but the manager was clearly on a mission. She then takes the girl that cut my hair into the back with her and assigns someone else to fix it.

&#x200B;

The girl who evened my hair out barely spoke a word to me the whole time, but she did get the job done. She gave me a mirror and made me check all angles to make sure it was finally even so ""I wouldn't have any further issues with them"" and then right as I'm about to get out of the chair, the original girl who had cut my hair walked out with all of her stuff in her hands, in TEARS. The girl who just cut my hair chuckles a bit and says oh she's finaaaaally gone.

&#x200B;

I feel horrible about what happened, but maybe this happened before? I feel 100% like I am the reason this girl got fired and she told me she's newly engaged and just bought her first car by herself.

When we got the bill on the 2nd date she asked if I was going to leave a tip. I told her I wasn't planning on it, I never tip unless it's especially good service, but the waitress we just had was alright but nothing special. She then said that she would leave a tip then. I then realised that it was important to her so said that I would since she left one on the first date but she declined and left the tip herself. We then left the restaurant and each made our own way home. I texted her a few times in the next couple days and she seemed to be less flirty and interested in me in her replies than before.

1624,Asshole,"Background: My boyfriend 57M) left his marriage of 30 years for me (37F) 3 months ago after meeting me and working with me for 2 years. His children (30F and 32M) have drawn back from him and all text messages seem to come across as fairly angry at the change in situation. Needless to say I am sad to see this happening, but i also have little experience with how upsetting a divorce is to an adult child, as my parents divorced when I was 8. 

On looking further in to the marriage, the standard was that dad was there to pay for things, and mom constantly berated his ideas and opinions. She had also had several affairs. He was a good provider, but often drank too much early on in the marriage, causing a rift that had never been resolved by the time the affairs began. 

I personally had left my own abusive relationship after 4 years, with a child of 16 months, and had a difficult few years with my ex while my son underwent heart surgery for a congenital birth defect. After now 8.5 years we are amicable, and are about to have easter dinner (me, bf, son) with my ex and his family, who have always been incredibly supportive of the fact that we need to co-parent regardless of our failed relationship. 

I have tried to come up with solutions to resolve some of the anger his kids have for the situation, by recommending he meet with them for coffee, start conversations of neutral content, and now finally to meet with us for easter. We received the response that "" until you can think of someone other than yourself  and your own selfish right to be happy, the answer is no, im not interested, and even if i was, you dont deserve it.""

I personally believe everyone has the right to be happy, and to change their life so that they are actually happy, not abused, and not degraded in any way. But i also understand divorce is hard, and even further, change is hard.

She talked about V a lot on how he helped her. Never she talk about their other convos like when I later found out that he was passing notes to her in class and hugging her (big no-no in the army).
I confront her and let her know how I feel and she said she understood completely but that there was nothing there and I shouldn’t worry at all because he’s like a mentor not a person she would be with as she only wanted to be with me.
After that convo in feb, things started going downhill. Over the next month she became distant and we took a break. She wanted me back after a week.

I decide to continue and 2 days later she drops it on me that V had kissed her and she let it happen. She said it lasted for 2 seconds and that was that she regretted meeting him and she would stop having contact with him(I had to push for the last one really hard). She told me how sorry she was and how she wanted to be with me only. Why did she put herself in a 1 on 1 situation with him?
The possible fuck up: 
Me and her family were really close. They would invite me over even when she was gone, I was a part of all the family events. I asked her sisters ,K and M, for advice in confidence.
We broke up eventually but I remained in contact with her family. They didn’t care if we were together. They were supportive. One night we were having a convo and K dropped that the situation happened slightly differently. He did kiss her, she did let it happen, but she kept it going. She lied to me again.
I was destroyed again and her sisters were on my side. They knew what I was going through and they didn’t defend their sister at all.

Me and her go have a convo. She said she fucked up %100 and that she knows this and she regrets it all. She then turns on me and says I had no right to tell her family. 
She told me that when I came up to the door, K,V and their husbands told her “We know what you fucking did you better be nice to him”.
She asked if I can forgive her and we can work on fixing and moving on with our relationship together. There’s no trust.
She told me she had 0 contact with V. I asked her for a reason to trust her again and she said that the only ones there are, are the ones I make.

1634,Asshole,"I'm one of the IT heads of my college's computer science departments. We have computer labs open to students 24/7 and part of my job is to ensure it's well maintained and used in a respectful way. Students use these labs to work on their assignments, print them, etc. This is the only place to work on assignments on campus as only these computers have the programs installed to do the work (unless students use their own computers/laptops/etc). You can print anywhere on campus in our nine other labs, it's just these two specific labs I maintain that are meant for CS students so they have the necessary tools installed onto them.

Over the last year, I've had complaints forwarded to me from students and professors about the noise level and cleanliness of one specific lab. Specifically it's about 8 students causing disruptions out of a student body of about 200. These students actively disrupt the use of the labs, leave them in disarray, etc.

I sent an e-mail in November to all students in the program to familiarize themselves with the lab rules. Another e-mail in January to all students that lab access is a privilege, not a right, and it can be taken away. And finally one more e-mail in March being more specific about the situation: if you're causing disruptions, you ruin it for others, etc. I threatened that action will be taken if it does not stop. I stressed students need to be proactive in stopping others: you're part of a community by being in the program and if you see people disrupting the use of the labs, speak up, tell them to stop, etc.

Well, two days ago it happened. With permission from the faculty head and the support of numerous professors, I've banned **all** students from using the lab whenever they want. The labs will only be open on an appointment basis for groups, and single-student use will be allowed for one hour every weekday under supervision. It's stupid I had to go this far but the complaints against these students has not stopped and I had to enact drastic measures to get the point across.

What do these students do? They eat lunch in the lab (which is expressly forbidden), leave their garbage/food waste, spill drinks, etc. They also leave computers signed in or go onto other students' accounts who are left signed in by accident or if they have to run to the washroom. I've even had some mice and keyboards stolen as we don't lock those down (but we do PCs and monitors). But the biggest issue students bring up is the noise level.

AITA? The only reason I see I am is I've taken away one of the only places students can work on campus on their assignments. But I've given ample warning to what would happen if it doesn't stop. These aren't outsiders, either, and you need a swipe card to get in, so they're definitely CS students who are abusing the CS labs.

edit: because it came up, the swipe card is permissive only, not tracked. We don't have systems in place to track when Student A or Student B enters a lab, only that the lab was entered. I've asked the broader IT department for the college for some budget for this but was denied every time I've asked.

And I don't know the students involved names. Students have only mentioned a group of people, the same group every time. I don't know who they are.",56,89,0.94

1636,Not the A-hole,"So backstory my parents particularly my Mum got angry at me for wanting to change my last name with my partner rather then keep my name  because neither of us want each other’s name (we both love our families and respect them we just don’t like each other’s names), but want to have the same last name so we are a unit this happened a month ago, long story short my Mum told me I shouldn’t marry my partner cause she won’t take my name and that she won’t come to our wedding if I do. I’m a male. Any way my Dad has come around he’s upset but he understands that I want to have the same name as my partner and future kids. They’ve come over for Easter. My Dad is acting normal Saying I love you and have missed you, and giving me a hug and kiss (yes I still kiss my Dad. We are both very affectionate people), my Mum on the overhand hasn’t said I love you back to me and when I went to greet her with a hug and kiss she was very cold towards me. My partner and I have tried all night to be cordial with my mum. We tried to spark conversation with my parents which my Dad happily talked but my Mum would give us abrupt answers and stop the conversation leading to many awkward pauses. I brought her some desert after dinner. I said “I love you Mum and I’ve missed you and Dad”. My Mum proceeded to cry and say “I can’t say that back you really hurt my feelings”. I want to say “Well you hurt mine and my partners by threading to not come to our wedding over a name change” but I didn’t cause my Mum always plays the victim card and I didn’t want to make my partner and my Dad upset. Instead I just said softly “if you didn’t want to come you shouldn’t have”. She said that she had to, that Dad forced her by saying that we shouldn’t alienate our son over something so small”. I decided to put on a funny film in order to cool things down. This just led to her making everyone uncomfortable but making near crying sounds. I acted as if I was bored with the film and now we’ve spent the last two hours in near dead silence. I really just want to tell my Mum to Fuck off and go home so the rest of us can enjoy our weekend. But I also still love my Mum and also don’t want to hurt my Dad’s feelings by being rude to Mum. They are here for the whole weekend so I don’t know how I can cope for 4 days straight of this.",99,374,0.96
1637,Asshole,"I was at a party and this new girl who had just recently moved to our town was there. This was the first time me and many others had met her and things were great in the beginning.

I striked up a conversation with her to learn more about her and we had surprisingly a lot in common and I thought we had a great conversation. After about an hour of us talking alone on the couch she gets up to go to the bathroom and then when she comes back she starts going over to other people and talk with them instead of me.

I don’t think too much about it since she’s new in town and want to get to know as many people as possible so I understand not wanting to talk to one person the entire night. So I start talking with friends and other people at the party and we don’t really get a chance to talk more that night.

Fast forward to past midnight and I’m outside talking to a friend and I see her leaving with some guy who I didn’t know (most likely a friend of a friend). Both of them were very flirty and it was obvious what they were going to do later that night.

Our eyes met and I just smiled and said something like “Bye, nice meeting you” and she smiled back and said the same.

I’m not going to lie, as lame as this sounds, I felt a little bit hurt that we had such a great conversation and I felt we had a great chemistry, but in the end, her main focus was with another guy.

Fast forward to 2 weeks later, I’m at another party with and she’s there too. I still felt a bit hurt about last time and as petty as this sounds, I decided to just ignore her. She said hi to me when met, and I just replied hi back to her, gave her a quick smile and then looked away and pretended I was focused on somewhere else.

Later that night she came up to me to strike up a conversation with me about a subject we had talked about last time and I just kept giving her short answers or one word answers. After maybe a painful 1 minute she excused herself somewhere else and I didn’t see her anymore that night. I even tried actively avoiding her by not sitting near her or go in the same rooms that I knew she was in.

It’s not that I was feeling jealous that she slept with another guy that night. I personally never sleep with a girl until after 2-3 serious dates. But more the fact that there was another guy she felt was more interesting that night. I know it sounds pathetic, but at the same time I can’t help but feel my self esteem took a bit of a hit. As petty as my behavior my have been the next party, it did make me feel better about myself in a way.",123,169,0.77
1638,Not enough info,"My colleagues and I disagree on the following issue:

About 6 months ago, I started seeing someone. That someone happens to be a student (22M, Jack). I happen to be a professor (27M) at the same faculty. I am not Jack's professor. We didn't meet at the school. He is the student of one of my friends at another department (Prof. Mark). I do not talk to Prof. Mark about Jack. Jack doesn't talk to me about Prof. Mark. We barely even talk about school.

I think I am doing nothing wrong. We like each other, he's an adult, and we don't come into contact at school at all. For the sake of clarity, let's imagine this is all happening at a Faculty of Arts and Humanities, where I work at the department of Spanish Language and Literature, and Jack is a student at the department of Philosophy and History. The Faculty consists of 5 buildings which means we've never seen each other at school. We still don't see each other there even though we're a couple.

My colleagues think it's unethical to date him and that he might be trying to get to Prof. Mark through me. Apparently, his grades in Prof. Mark's class aren't that great, so my colleagues think he will try to use me to get on Prof. Mark's good side. If he tried to do that, I'd leave him immediately, but in the past 6 months he's done nothing to imply that might be his end-goal. I didn't even know Prof. Mark was his professor until I mentioned to my colleagues that I was seeing someone who is a student at Prof. Mark's department.

So I'm currently being accused of being unethical, a bad friend, dumb and an asshole.

I think their lack of belief that somebody could possibly date me because they like me, and not because they want to use me, is a bit offensive. And I think calling it unethical is offensive because we have literally nothing to do with each other in the academic sense and our relationship would have no impact on his success. (Unless Prof. Mark decides to punish him.)

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Our faculty handbook says it's against the policy to date students who are minors and those we have direct power over, in the sense of teaching or supervising. Teaching and supervising in other departments never happens, so there is 0% chance me and Jack will ever come in contact at the school.",99,43,0.83

1641,Asshole,"My partner and I are in our mid-twenties and have two young children. She knows I’ve always wanted to join the military since I was young but when I turned 16 instead of going through with joining I just messed around with my friends drinking and taking drugs. 

Me and my partner have now settled down, we’ve got two beautiful boys who are still very young and she would really rather I didn’t leave for months on end to join the Army.

1642,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé is very upset with me because I won’t spend all my savings on our wedding. 
I don’t have an insane amount of savings but it’s enough for a ‘big’ wedding. Problem is I don’t want to spend it all on the wedding, I don’t even want a big wedding. I’d rather have a small celebration with close family and friends and keep some of the money for our future as I’d like to have children some day and possibly travel a bit before that. 
My partner has no savings so isn’t in a position contribute anything. 
I’m not prepared to ask my parents to pay for something I’m not prepared to pay for myself, and I haven’t explicitly asked but I don’t think my partners parents are in a position to pay for the wedding either.

I’ve been standing fairly firm in my belief that it’s unreasonable to be expected to empty my savings for something my fiancé isn’t able to contribute to at all. However this has been going on so long now I’m starting to doubt myself and worry I’m maybe not appreciating how important a big fancy wedding is to some people. So I’m doing what every reasonable person does in this situation and turning to reddit for opinions!

EDIT: I didn’t state this initially as I didn’t feel it would or should influence people’s opinions. But we’re a same-sex couple so my fiancé is a he not a she!

EDIT 2: No I am not Chandler Bing!! I’m a huge friends fan and was expecting a few comments about this. Funnily enough when I was younger I really felt Monica was being unreasonable in that episode!

Update: Thank you for all the responses and advice. I’ve had more than I expected so can’t reply to them all. I may have accidentally painted my fiancé in a worse light than I meant to. He’s not being a ‘groomzilla’ about it, and we have discussed it and he does understand and respect why, I just also know he’s upset/disappointed about it also so I do feel guilty and was questioning if I was making the right decision. He is also aware that he should have made more of an effort to save for his/our future.
I am going to talk to him about it again and see just how upset he is by this. If he’s going to regret not having his ‘dream’ wedding I am going to suggest we postpone (we haven’t even set a date yet) and both start saving into a separate wedding fund to go towards it on top of what I’ve already agreed to contribute. 

I’d also add, a few people have said I need to be open to compromise. The amount I’ve offered as my maximum amount is a fair bit higher than I had initially wanted so I do feel I did already offer a reasonable compromise.",401,1577,0.95
1643,No A-holes here,"I’m sorry for the long post there are just a lot of variables!! Here’s the deal: my fiancé (24M) and I (22F) are high school sweethearts. What that means is because we share the same hometown, holidays are usually a frantic attempt to visit all 3 families  (my parents are divorced, but stayed in the same town for the kids).

My fiancé wants to spend all of Easter weekend staying at his parents house. Which we have never done before, because usually when his family does holidays they also invite both sets of grandparents up so his family needs the space.

We also haven’t stayed overnight because his mom and I don’t really get along. I went no contact with her for two years during college because of the way she treated my fiancé and spoke about me. (if you want that drama for context check my JUSTNOMIL posts). It has since gotten better and we can be in the same room and talk to each other. However, I’m still not at ease around her.

When my fiancé mentioned staying at his parents place I told him he could stay there if he wanted, but I didn’t want to and I was going to stay at my dad’s house. Not it like a passive aggressive way, just I didn’t want to sleep there and I have other options.

He asked why I insisted on staying at my dad’s and said that his parents “would think it’s weird”. I’m not staying the weekend with him. I explained it was for a few reasons:  

1. The room we would have to sleep in at his parents house is tiny, it’s hot because it’s right over the boiler and it shares walls with his parents. So basically if something goes down where I need to vent I would physically have to leave the house, we are talking zero privacy. 

2. His mom still makes me uneasy so I’m going to sleep like sh*t. We have to move the next weekend so I don’t want to start the work week running on an empty tank.

3. My dad has a king size bed in his BASEMENT, which doesn’t matter to most people but we both LOVEEEEE basement sleeping.

4. I want to spend extra time with my dad because he scheduled a trip to go visit my brother over our move. I’m fine with it, but it’s one of those dad things where he feels really bad about missing a chance to help.

He kind of made a face, but let it go. I’m going to Easter church with my fiancé’s family and I’m spending all of Sunday there so it’s not like I’m avoiding them. I just don’t want to sleep there as I have options that are far more comfortable to me. But now he’s go me wondering, AITA?",44,164,0.96
1644,Not the A-hole,"This kid (S) definitely has special needs. S doesn't shower unless told to by his resident assistant (RA), doesn't do his laundry, doesn't do any of his homework, constantly follows girls around, and doesn't understand social cues. It is very hard to understand when S speaks. S is prone to loud and high pitched outbursts, repeats peoples names to himself (often girls' names), and cannot hold a normal conversation. Everyone on our floor tried to be nice and include S when he is around.

&#x200B;

First incident: S made up an imaginary friend and made a very serious threat involving that ""person"" doing something that could harm students. S went home for a few days then returned the next week. The school never even addressed that a threat was made. After S returned, his roommate decided to move out.

&#x200B;

With no info, we had to figure it out ourselves. We were all under the impression that S would be leaving for weekends (S's dad had been coming to do S's laundry and wash S's sheets on weekends). Near the end of first semester, my friends and I were in the lounge playing a game. We had no problem with S joining us and accepted and included S but S wasn't winning, S started to assume that it was because we hated him (which wasn't true). I had to go to the bathroom, but S stood in front of the door and didn't let anyone out of the room. My guy friends told S not to keep people trapped. S let me leave the room after a while and I called the RA on duty who told S to go to bed and there was never a report made despite the fact that S trapped us in the lounge.

&#x200B;

There have been even more things like this. My friends and I were trying to watch a movie and S just kept yelling. The RAs on duty basically told us to deal with it and didn't help. S chased some girls going to a party. Right before spring break, S said he was being forced to go home for 2 weeks. S was then gone for a two weeks before spring break and a week or two after spring break. We still don't know why.

&#x200B;

It seems that S's parents' gave the university zero warning about the situation. Many RAs seem to be oblivious to the problem which means that whenever there is a problem with S, S's RA is the only one who knows how to deal with it. S's RA had ZERO idea about this before and this RA never signed up to be S's caretaker. 

&#x200B;

We try our best to deal with S because we don't want to be rude to someone with special needs who might not know they're doing something wrong, but are all getting upset that we have to deal with S. We just want to tell S to leave us alone but know that will cause more issues so we're getting even more annoyed every time we have to deal with S.

1645,Asshole,"Edit: The question here is not choosing one over the other. The question is if I am an asshole for not waking up early to go to an appointment vs waking up early for going on a one day trip hiking? I am going to the appointments. Please read carefully. 

For a little context, my wife is pregnant with our second child and we have to go every month for a check up. This office we go to is terrible, they make you wait for a long time and once the doctor comes in he is only there for less than 2 minutes! And then we’re done. 

Sure I know that it’s important to know about the baby’s health but this office had previously scared my wife into thinking she had placenta previa. Which turned out to be false once we went to a high risk clinic.

Anyways I work late and get home around 12-12:30am and I don’t go to sleep till 2am(my wife and daughter are always waiting for me and sleep late as well). The other day I had planned to go hiking and I had even requested the day off to go because my friends are off during the week and I am off the weekends, they work morning I work nights. I woke up early  around 5:30 am and got ready to go with my friends as they were going to pick me up. I was going to sleep while in the car ride(which was a 2-3 hour trip).

Now her appointments are at 11am but she wakes me up at 10am and I’m not in a good mood. I have to drive because she never likes to drive. On days of her appointments are the same days I have to go to work. So once we’re done and go home I have to get ready for work.

Today my wife pointed out that I get up early to go hiking but to go to her appointment I don’t and that I am never in a good mood when we go. 

I don’t go out a lot, I haven’t really played video games or do any other hobbies and I am mostly just working and with my family. She doesn’t work and just stays at home with our daughter. Ami an asshole for wanting to enjoy time with my friends?",252,277,0.85
1646,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been together for 17 years, been married for 10 of those years, and have a young child together. 

For ambiguity’s sake, I won’t go into too much detail. Over the last year, I’ve noticed a female co-worker cross the lines of professionalism with my husband. She’s left him personal notes at work, she’s texted him a photo of herself sitting at his desk in his chair, touching his things with a flirty text, she’s treated him out to lunch, she’s very chatty with him, and a mutual friend of ours/former co-worker of his has commented on her being inappropriately weird and overly friendly, as a reason why he didn’t join them for lunch. After this, I expressed I wasn’t comfortable with it, but it was brushed off by him. I trust my husband and since he’s always been transparent, I dropped it. 

This is where I’m unsure if I was just being an a*hole. It had been a long day. I’d spent all afternoon volunteering at our child’s school and all of my evening entertaining our child and a friend for what turned into a 5-hour playdate. My husband didn’t get home until just before midnight for a guy’s night out, which is typical for the event he went to tonight. After I’d put our child to bed, I scrolled through Facebook and noticed he’d added a new female co-worker, but hadn’t accepted the friend requests of other male co-workers. It felt off. When he got home, I asked him how his night was and if he’d won any of the games and talked about our schedule for the next day. After he’d changed out of his clothes, I asked him why he accepted this new female co-worker’s request, but not the other male co-workers he’d worked with for longer. He got extremely defensive and very upset. He then said one was a horrible co-worker and the other he didn’t know well enough. This seemed weird since the female co-worker was super new and why add someone you don’t know on a personal account? He continued being defensive, reasoning he had to add her because they literally work together, which still didn’t make sense since that could’ve easily applied to the other co-workers, too. 

After I attempted to de-escalate the convo and tried fo relay that I was just trying to openly communicate my concerns and how they likely stemmed from his other female co-worker’s inappropriate behavior, he refused to communicate or hear me out. He was getting so defensive, he woke our child with how loud he was projecting his voice. He told me I have no say in any of it and he’d take away all access to his Facebook if I brought it up again, and that how I feel has no weight in anything, which is unlike him. I reminded him that we’re married and it should matter, but dropped it at his request, despite it still bothering me. Am I an a*hole for bringing it up? Was I out of line? Should I have just kept it to myself?

TLDR I brought up concerns about female co-workers with my husband and was told it wasn’t my place.",124,110,0.94
1647,Not the A-hole,"**Edit: I sent my friends the link to this post about 3 hours ago and I've been left on *seen*. Thank you all for the input, I got hundreds of comments so I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone, but thank you for the words of encouragement and all the advice, I really appreciate it!**


I referred to myself (26M) as a gay man for a long time and in my whole life I've always dated only guys.

I started dating my boyfriend when we were both 20. My *boyfriend* transitioned last year into my *girlfriend* and we're still together. So I no longer call myself gay, I say I'm bisexual, and my friends are freaking out.

Not sure if a disclaimer is necessary, but here it is: There are no bisexuals in my group of friends, just gay men and lesbians. They all fully accept my trans girlfriend, and, listen to this shit - they accept that she now refers to herself as straight, because ""she can't help it and that's who she is"". LOL! And yet... they think I'm ""erasing my identity"" by calling myself bisexual.

First of all, I'm a man. Second, I like men. Third, I think my girlfriend is fucking hot. I feel like she's mostly the same person I fell in love with and have loved all these years, so of course I still adore her, maybe even more, but I happen to also be attracted to her ""new"" body, the boobs, the curves, the softness, everything. Do all of these things not make me, **by definition**, bisexual???

No, my friends think I'm a complete fucking asshole, GIVING GAY PEOPLE A BAD NAME by ""changing my mind"". They say that I'm not attracted to the worldwide female population, but just one transwoman, and therefore the word ""bisexual"" is too extreme. ~~They think I should say I'm gay, and every time I tell someone, I should also emphasize that I'm dating a transwoman.~~ *Editing this part because it was not worded right! They think I should say I'm gay, but every time I tell someone, I should also emphasize that I'm currently dating a transwoman/woman. They don't care about me pointing out whether she's trans or not, they just think I should say I'm normally gay, but I'm with a woman AT THE MOMENT.*

So yeah, they think **I** am an asshole, and I happen to think **they** are assholes, greater assholes than they may even think, but there are 6 of them and one of me (or me plus my girlfriend). This has been going on for months now, and it's gone so far that I'm actually starting to question myself. It's true that I'm not attracted to women in general, just my own girlfriend. I'm 99.99% sure that if we broke up, I'd go back to dating men.

So, am I a gay asshole or should I get new friends?",307,582,0.92
1648,Not the A-hole,"I have been dating my gf for about a year. I had my daughter yesterday as it was my day off work, and usually drop her home at around 7pm, so I had plans to collect my gf and her 2 daughters from a school show at around 8. The school is only a few miles ( EDIT - 0.7 miles ) from their home but I offered to pick them up as I'd be visiting anyway. At around 6pm my ex gets in touch, and says she isn't feeling well. I had known she hadn't been well. She says she's getting worse and is thinking about going to the hospital, and asks me if I can hold onto our daughter to allow her to do so. I say alright. I tell my girlfriend sorry, I can't collect you guys later, I still have my kid (who was sleeping in my bed for 7). My gf totally lost it and has now blocked me. She considers this me putting my ex before her, rather than me handling my responsibilities as a father and the other person responsible for creating this child. Ofcourse if one parent is unwell the very first option is the other parent. Right? My girlfriend says my ex should have got one of her friends or family to watch my kid to allow her to go to the hospital, as it was officially ""her time with her"" and not my responsibility. She says my response should have been ""not my problem, I'm only responsible for her til 7"". I completely disagree with this. I think my gf isn't used to this as she has 2 deadbeat baby-dads who don't pay for, or help her with her kids in any way. I have tried to tell her I have done nothing wrong here, but she has made me doubt myself. I am keen on hearing opinions from people in similar situations, especially women in relationships with guys with kids. I am not looking for validation here, I really want to know if I should be apologising and fighting to fix this... I don't have much relationship experience other than my child's mum which lasted almost a decade (I am 28).

Thanks for reading.

edit - typo.

edit - (additional info since this is kinda blowing up and I'm seeing the same questions being asked) - I didn't leave them stranded. She had made arrangements to go to this show before even telling me anything about it. I found out earlier that day and said I could pick them up as I'd be coming to see her anyway. Her mother and sister also went. She was going to this show regardless of me. I also offered to pay her cab fair but she was beyond all reason. I let her know an hour in advance I wouldn't be able to come, and she'd have to just do whatever she intended on doing before even bothering to tell me that day that she was going to a show. I offered to collect them still with my child sleeping and she said ""don't bother"", she is quite open about the fact that the cause of her anger isn't losing her ride home, but me ""choosing to do a favor for my ex over spending time with her and being there for her and her kids"" - this is what we disagree on. She said she felt mortified that she told her parents I was coming, but now I wasn't. Her words were something like ""Shall I just tell my parents that Oh \*\*\* isn't coming because his ex decided to go and have bloods taken? LMAO @ my life. I'm mortified."" I said ""Yeah, tell them that. I'm not embarrassed.""",417,1174,0.92

Within 3 months of University he dropped out. He started going to community college, but in 2.5 years he hasn't gotten enough credits for his associates bc he can't handle more than 2 classes/semester. 

He doesn't work and his parents pay his insurance, gas, food, and everything else. Even stuff like movies/comics/games.

Meanwhile I have been doing 5-6 classes a semester and I'm on track to graduate early, all while keeping up extracurriculars and working a part time job to pay for my insurance/gas/expenses.

So tonight I asked abt his 5 year plan and he said he'd like to be moved out. I asked how he was going to make that happen, he doesn't know. What does he want to do for work? No idea.

I told him his answers scared me bc I feel like I'm outgrowing him and like I'm going to have to let him go if he doesn't start figuring stuff out. He started crying and begging me not to leave him and I feel so bad and just stopped talking about it but it's really bothering me am I being an asshole ???",43,31,0.83
1651,Not the A-hole,"I recently purchased a new house and after a few weeks of living here realised the previous owners had failed to disclose a pretty serious pest problem. Including everything from cockroaches to house centipedes, and a fair few redbacks in the backyard as well.

I really like the house other than this so I am committed to getting rid of the pests. I’ve tried exterminators and DIY stuff, but none of it was effective. I got the idea from online that people often release predator species as a way of natural pest control. So I got my hands on 10 huntsman spiders ([picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsman_spider#/media/File%3ASparassidae_Palystes_castaneus_mature_female_9923s.jpg)) from a friend of mine.

I want to stress here that despite their appearance, huntsman are completely harmless to humans, and pose literally no threat.

So I release these guys in my house, shed, and backyard hoping to decimate the critters infesting my house, and it works well for a while, until they vanish.

When I tell my neighbour about this, he blows up at me saying he and his wife have been terrified by the buggers showing up in their house. Apparently two other neighbours have also had the same experience.

So now I’m the most hated person in the neighbourhood for releasing harmless spiders on my property.

I understand why they’d be upset, but at the end of the day it’s my property, I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. After all, they’re native to Australia.

1652,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much says it in the title. My mom is a covert narcissist, and even though i am 22 years old and don’t live at home, she has this crazy need to be in control of every aspect of my life.

She told me I was ugly when i was little and still to this day comments on my appearance. 

Her nastiest habit is verbally assaulting me anytime i “disobey” her or do something that she doesn’t agree with. The latest conflict is that I would like to drive myself to my cousins wedding 3 hours away instead of driving with my whole family. She called me today and tossed out a whole list of insults, telling me how i’m not a nice person, and I’m selfish and rude and *just* like my dad.

1655,Not the A-hole,"A little back story here. My GF got accepted to present at a national conference which was near a major theme park. So with that we decided that we should all take a vacation and have the company pay for her airfare, the hotel and rental car. We had a couple months to prepare but I told her I most likely would not be able to help up front because I am doing an internship that doesn’t pay too well at the moment. She said no problem. 

Fast forward to trip time and I’m really strapped for money. We make it through the trip and when we get back she sends me an invoice for half the price of the hotel and the rental car on top of all of the other expenses (theme park tickets, airfare, food, etc.)  I ask her why I have to pay for the hotel and rental car since her company is covering it. Her response was because she earned it and not me. So AITA for not wanting to pay that since she told me her company was covering it months ago?

EDIT: I just want to clear up that she has not been reimbursed yet as she has not submitted all her receipts from the trip (we got back two days ago).  She works for a major healthcare company so chances are high that she will get reimbursed. However if she does not get reimbursed then I am totally willing to to pay my fair share.

1656,Not the A-hole,"Before I go into details, I had told her my only remaining grandmother had died the day before her wedding. The funeral was out of state so I told her I'm not dropping out of the wedding but mentally I'm just not in a good state of mind. This was my moms mother, and not only was she gone I had lost my mother 4 years prior.

-

So we have been friends for a long time in school but we lost contact years ago until I get a message asking to be a bridesmaid. I said sure, knowing she's only asking me because she needed people to be there and things started going south since.

• I'm working a minimal wage job and the majority was going towards paying the bills but she expected me to pay 200$ for a dress I was going to wear one time. I obliged. 

• She expected me to drive an hour to do her wedding decorations with the other bridesmaids because she was planning an entire wedding in less than 6 months. I made every single appointment she set to do this except the sleepovers because I don't party anymore and I don't like being being around alcohol. 


• The maid of honor paid for her bachelorette party but because she was such a bridezilla the M.O.H dropped out entirely. 

• lied to us and got me to take off work thinking it was a mandatory meeting, to only find out it was an Avon sales pitch to get us to buy 16$ eyeliner  

So I endured the snide comments about me not pitching in any money to help and all of this, and boom. My grandma died. Told her the day before the wedding, I didn't want to add the stress to her but she needed to know that hey, I have shit going on in my life too. When she actually realized I wasn't there at the after party I get called an asshole because she paid out of pocket for my dinner and a 5 paragraph text to follow up. I mentioned how I didn't get reimbursed for the dress I was forced to pay for and that I'm mentally exghausted over a death of someone very dear to me and as someone who's recovering from alcohol, I didn't want to be around the partying. She wasn't having it. We haven't talked in 8 months which before that we didn't talk at all for 5 years  because we were only friends in high school.

However, recently she's been making an effort to call me by my preferred name and pronouns. Everybody in my family says I should be grateful that she's making an effort, but I don't think it's like that. She's not making an effort to accept me and my transition. She's just humoring me so I don't cut her out of my life or worse. (She's aware of these possibilities) But every once in a while her true beliefs will still come up. She'll say something about how I shouldn't change my name because it will make de-transitioning harder or that my girlfriend isn't really attracted to women, since I'm not really a woman. Or just something like that. I don't know.

1660,Asshole,"My SO and I are buddies with Dan* going on a couple years. About a year ago, Dan married a generally nice girl we'll call Sasha. Sasha has kids from previous relationships and Dan takes them on as his own before they tied the knot.

we started to hangout both as couples playing dumb games and getting wasted, and occasionally Dan would come hangout with my SO and I on his own. During one of the times Dan hung out with my husband and I around 6 months ago, he was telling us about their struggle to get pregnant. Dan has no biological kids and is eager to be a biological father in addition to fathering Sasha's kids. He explained that she had over ""a dozen miscarriages"" and it just wasn't working out and he was obviously upset as he really wants to experience being a father in the ""typical"" sense he always imagined.  The whole thing just seemed off I guess? That's alot of miscarriages for the time they wouldve been together or whatever but I've never been pregnant/has miscarriages or anything and my SO just got snipped so I honest to god just didn't know enough to say much aside from giving my sympathies and handing him a shot.
2-3 weekends ago, my SO and I went over to their place we were all pretty drunk& Sasha pulls me aside and she tells me that for the past 6 months shes been taking BC and hasnt told Dan. I really*** wanted to clarify and mentioned how he told us that there were miscarriages and she says ""well yeah there were a couple but idk yeah I've been taking birth control for 6mo and it's like almost too late to even tell him you know?""We left the next morning and headed home when I unloaded all of this on my SO who was equally wigged out.
Yesterday Sasha started posting those anonymous question things on facebook (I dont know the name of the app or whatever makes it possible for people to get anonymous msgs) but one asked her about she and Dan having kids, and she responded that she doesnt know if she ever would have more kids. To which Dan responded  along the lines of ""idk what Sasha is talking about but we're gonna try for 2 more"" 
Obviously I'm all about a woman's right to choose anything about her body but this guy is a couple years younger than Sasha and kids are a major want for him knowing this may give them a much needed conversation that could save them both time and pain in a potentially unmatched marriage, or help initiate a conversation that's essentially inevitable? I don't necessarily want to be the friend that unloads that info on someone but that's such a huge lie that's actively causing him pain and confusion. Would I be the asshole to tell him that she told me?

1661,Not the A-hole,"For a little bit of context on why I didn't tell my parents I got married. I am a bisexual woman married to a woman. When I came out as Bi to my extremely Catholic (and homophobic) parents they were less than supportive. I had dated both women and men but just never mentioned the women. So it was quite a shock to them when I told then I had been dating the same woman (now my wife) for a year. My mom and I didn't talk for a few months.

They have been slowly coming to terms with it and have made some progress. Back in July, my wife's health insurance was ending and we decided to elope. We chose not to tell either of our parents, because of their homophobia.

I finally told my mother today. She was really devasted about not knowing for so long. She accused me of living a double life and I tried to show her my point of view.

Back in July she was still being very hostile. She had even said that she couldn't come visit me and my ""GF"" because she couldn't stay in a house with gay people. She got over it and ended up coming in September (after we were already married). She was judgemental and made my wife cry and questioned us about our reproductive choices. But overall it was as good as it could have been. We didn't tell her we were married. We put our rings in a box.

She has come really far in the last 9 months (more than a year since I came out to her). But I truly feel like she would have spoiled my good mood if I had told her back then that we were eloping. I probably shouldn't have waited 9 months to tell her, but it isn't true that I am living a double life. She knows who I live with, what I do for work, what I do in my spare time, my vices, my virtues. I just didn't tell her I was married because I didn't want negativity around my marriage and then it just never seemed like a good time to tell her I had eloped. But does that make me an asshole?

TL;DR. My parents are homophobic and I got married without telling them. They are now a bit better at dealing with me being queer and accused me of being unfair for not telling them when I got married. AITA?",18,27,0.84

I’m a 16 year old working at dominos to make some extra cash and buy a car of my own at some point. I’ve been there for a bit more then a year so I know the ropes.

It was a busy weekend afternoon in the store, mostly online orders but we had a couple in-store orders at the time. Then a mom and daughter came in and after placing a order, they sat waiting for the 15 minute wait time.

If you didn’t know there’s a little step stool at the front of the store to watch the “dough show” and it gives the kids a chance to watch and pass the time.

Like I said it was pretty busy and sorry to burst anyone’s bubble but... we don’t spin the pizza into the air everytime we make a pizza. Actually we rarely ever do and normally only do it if we have a kid watching us, but like I said it was a very busy day and we really didn’t have time to be putting on a show.

So when the little girl and mom standing behind her came up to the glass, I gave them a smile and continued to make the pizzas we were backed up on. I prepared the dough on the counter and spread it out. Keep in mind the daughter never complained and even at a ripe age of probably 5 or 6 she was embarrassed by her mother’s actions. The next conversation then ensued.

Mom: Aren’t you gonna throw it up in the air?

Me: I’m kind of backed up right now, if I get some room to breathe by the time your pizza is up I could probably do that for you.

Mom: it says “dough show” you have to throw it up

CoWorker: I’m very sorry but we really don’t have time to be giving a show right now

Mom: Well you don’t have to do the show, he does (me)

Me: I’m sorry but I’m not gonna be doing a show right now, your daughter can watch me make pizzas all she wants.

Mom: Well if your not gonna do the show then you must take the sign down

I was loosing my cool at this point which doesn’t happen often.

Me: I’m not doing a show or taking the sign down, your pizza is almost done anyways.

Mom: Fine, (daughter) come here.

They sat down which the daughter wasn’t very happy about because she was actually pretty interested in my form of pizza making.

The coworker next to me and 3/4 of my managers think I handled it well but 1 of my managers and a couple other co workers said it couldn’t hurt for me to throw up a pizza or 2.

TLDR: Grandma died, family is insisting that we visit her grave everyday for up to two hours, I loved her, hate doing this. Am I the Asshole here?

Background: I should mention that me and my immediate family live in town A, and the rest of both sides of the family live in town B. Okay so before she passed away, she had cancer close up to 2 years so I think we all knew that the day would come. When my Grandma was predicted to die within the next two days we all flew down to town B asap. We were all in the room when it happened. My mum, Grandpa, uncle, brother and me. My dad flew down a bit later and missed it but was there shortly thereafter.

We missed a few days of school as they were planning the funeral, but they were relatively quick and it happened within the next week. We went to the funeral and she got buried. We flew back to town A (where we lived). We had to come not even a week later because of school holidays. For those who don't know how Australian holidays works it goes like this (approx).

Holidays (8weeks starting in Dec)
Term 1 (10 weeks)
Holidays (2/3 weeks)
Term 2 (10 Weeks)
Holidays (2/3 Weeks)
Term 3 (10 Weeks)
Holidays (2/3 Weeks)
Term 4 (10 Weeks)
Holidays (Same 8 weeks starting in Dec going into next year's school term)

So anywhere from 14 - 18weeks of the year I am in Town B. My mum flys us down every single time. They insist that Everytime we are in Melbourne, every day we should visit the grave as a family, get a chair and stay there for 1-3 hours. It seems ridiculous. Maybe once a week, but that is everyday for 14 weeks! That Is almost 98 - 254 hours of my year. Am I being an Asshole??! That seems like so much time. Don't get me wrong I loved my Grandma so much, and I wish I could've told her how much I love her and I miss her, I even was learning Spanish so we could have proper conversations. I loved her. But this seems so excessive. I haven't said this to anyone in my family yet, but I don't see any point of going this much. She's gone. Forever. And I'm not quite being spiritual on it 

I haven't said anything because obviously my mum and Grandpa would be suffering more than me but am I being the asshole here?

Keep in mind I'm only 14, so that is 4 times the amount of time I'd already mentioned. 

Note whether I'm being an asshole or not here I'm never ever gonna say anything about it.",37,36,0.95
1665,Not the A-hole,"First time poster, go easy on me. 

First, context. Recently, our troop has been losing tons of older guys since they are all aging out after getting their eagle rank. Because of this, we have been taking in an influx of new scouts, mostly middle schoolers. Currently, I am the ASPL (Assistant Senior Patrol Leader), which means that when the SPL is absent, I run things.

During one meeting, I see SK (Special Kid) walk in with his guardian. I can tell from a first glance that he is special needs, though I only found out later that he was deep in the autism spectrum with many learning disabilities. I mention it to our SPL, and he noticed as well, but had no clue why. Usually when new scouts come in, it means that they are ""shadowing"" to join our troop. I ran this through my head and realized that SK was trying to join a troop which was not ready to accept him. After the announcements in the beginning, our troop breaks into patrols to get requirements done for the new boys so that they can advance in rank. Lucky me, the SPL assigns me to go through the book with SK.

After talking with him for a bit, I learned just how badly he was mentally disabled. He had a lot trouble understanding what I was saying, so much so that I had to baby talk to get him to understand. This made getting the requirements done for him very difficult, so I signed off on some of them that he probably shouldn't have gotten.

After the meeting, I went to the adults who filled me in. Apparently, one of the moms of our new scouts was advertising the troop to her friends. SK's mom was delighted to be able to have her son in a boy scout troop. Little to her knowledge though, our troop was not made for those with special needs. The worst we had were boys with ADHD-- definitely not on par with the level of management someone like him needs. When the new mom came into the meeting, the adults quickly brought the first mom (M1- advertiser) and the second (M2- mom of SK) into a separate meeting. They told M2 that because her child would need tons of supervision and we had no one to supervise him, that he would not be welcome in our troop, so they instead advised her to join a troop better prepared to deal with those like SK. M1 was VERY displeased with hearing this (she is a bit entitled, and so is her son), and told us that we needed to accept him. The higher ups didn't budge on it, and refused to accept him, much to the dismay of M1. It's important to note that M2 was very understanding and respectful of this.

For the next few meetings, M2 came back with her child and, as before, the SPL assigned me to deal with him and get some work done with him, as I was the only one to be trusted with him. I wasn't necessarily peeved, but trying to get through what was essentially a language barrier to get things done with him was very frustrating. Eventually, M2 stopped coming to the meetings altogether.

1666,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my brother has the hygiene of a homeless man. He takes a shower maybe once a month, never wears deodorant, and hasn’t brushed his teeth since his last dentist appointment in October. He also wears dirty clothes. 

Bottom line is, he reeks. So much that it makes me gag. It’s gotten to the point where as he walks past he leaves a lingering odor. 

I’m absolutely fed up with having share small spaces with him and am considering just outright refusing to sit in the car with him or just generally staying around him until he adopts basic hygiene. I don’t even want him to take a shower everyday, just every other and to also wear deodorant. 

I’ve gotten on his case about it before but my parents have gotten to on my case about it. About how I’m not his parents ect ect. Still I’m absolutely fed up with him and how he smells like shit, literally.

EDIT: Since I’ve been asked my brother is 15 and is mildly autistic. I feel like the reason my parents don’t push for him to clean himself is that he is a holy terror. He throws temper tantrums whenever he doesn’t get things he wants, gets violent and is just generally an abhorrent person to be around and as such my parents have given up. This has left me feeling like I should do something.

Edit 2: I’ve seen a lot of posts saying that my parents are negligent and both my therapist and I agree with this however trying to get him to do anything is impossible. When I say temper tantrums I mean hours of shouting and slamming doors. Once he bit my dad. Both of my parents work nine to five jobs and coming home to a lazy asshole who screams and breaks shit when you ask him to do the most basic chores isn’t exciting.

Not only is he emotionally abusive, but he can also be pretty aggressive and often calls her names during arguments. He also cheated on all of his ex girlfriends, and possibly her as well, and constantly disrespects her family. Tara is a real sweetheart who wouldn't hurt a fly, and he doesn't deserve her at all.

Tara's been telling me these things ever since they've been happening, and I've always made it clear how unsupportive I am of her relationship.

They keep breaking up every few months, and she swears on her life she'll never get back together with him, yet as soon as he whistles, she runs back like a faithful dog.

Miles ghosted her in November for no reason whatsoever. After 2-3 years of relationship, he just ghosted, and found a new girlfriend 2 days later (I suspect he was already cheating). Tara was devastated, but honestly, I was so used to it, and knew they'd get back together eventually. He texted her a few days ago saying how he wanted to marry her, and she flew back to him.

Now he dumped her again, literally two days later. She's been crying on my shoulder again, but I'm so bored of her relationship drama at this point that I just told her ""Why the fuck are you even crying? We both know that as soon as he gets horny again, you'll run back to him, because that's what you are to him - a rag that he keeps reusing over and over again, and dumps it once he gets sick of it.

1675,Asshole,"I’m probably going to be ripped to pieces on here, but I’d genuinely appreciate an insight to see if I need to change my mindset. 

I am 28 years old and my partner is 36. His child/ my stepchild is 14 and lives primarily with his mum. 

I and my partner do not make much money. When we got married, 3ish years ago, my family gave us some cash as a gift. We used it to fund our honeymoon as neither of us really had savings. 

Last year husband and I were going through some heavy shit in regards to my husbands health and I decided I would book us a holiday. He flat out said he couldn’t afford ANY savings to put towards a holiday, but I said I would handle it and saved about a grand to take us to Egypt for a week. I worked overtime for it, and paid for literally everything including food + dining out + drinks. Last year he expressed a strong desire for us to take his son,  but I gently told him that I could only really save for both of us. An extra person would incur a £500 extra charge and I just didn’t feel comfortable spending that out of my money. He didn’t argue it and was cool with it.

This year proved a bit shit again- only for me this time. I would like another holiday but finances are extra tight because I have lost my job and would be paying for this holiday out of small errands I’ve begun to do for neighbours and the like. My husband has started a new job that literally pays 50% more what he was getting paid before, but he’s also helping out with paying for my car and paying off other of his debts. He said that in a few months he can slowly start to put away cash for a holiday but right now he can’t. I understood that to mean he couldn’t commit. He also said that about getting me an engagement ring when we got engaged and sadly he’s not been able to save for that either, so I know I’m not to expect anything. I understand life is hard. 

However he also said that he really really wants to take his son away too. I said that again, I could really only afford to take myself and my husband away if we are solely doing this on my dime. But the truth is, I just don’t feel like I should be paying for my stepson, and strictly in the confidence of Reddit, I find him stressful to be around and so a holiday wouldn’t at all be a holiday for me. He is very needy of his fathers attention, quite spoiled (which his father has admitted to me before- he feels as though his son has a hard home life with his mother so wants to make up for it at our place) and is generally unable to give much more in terms of conversation beyond fortnite and pewdiepie. I knew getting married would mean that I needed to give him my money and time the same way as if it were my bio child, and I *do* buy him games and contribute financially sometimes for him- I just think a holiday is a really big ask.

1676,Asshole,"So my husband is an investment banker (the type that work on IPOs) and right now he has a team of 4 people that he leads. 3 women, 1 man. 

I really wish his team was all men but he says he had no choice. They were just appointed to him. It bothers me because he will go on business trips a lot with 1 of the women at a time. These women are all young, mid to late twenties, and gorgeous from what I’ve seen in pictures.

He says he needs to be there to answer any questions because they’re all still at work but I feel like it’s overkill. We’ve been fighting about this because I feel like he’s ignoring my fears and he thinks I’m being unreasonable.

But when I was telling him I totally forgot what the word was in english and I said it in Norwegian: “fagott”. Once I said it he got really offended and accused me of being homophobic. I apologized and said it was an honest mistake. He said that I should’ve known better and threatened to report me to HR.

My wife found out about my affair two days ago.  I’ve been trying to explain to her that I’ve been feeling like there’s no intimacy between us for a long time. This isn’t something that just happened, we’ve been in a downward spiral for the last six years. Up until last October we barely saw eachother. She would go on walks before leaving for work and I wouldn’t see her until later that night when I climbed into bed next to her sound asleep. We’ve been living like roommates and staying together for the sake of our kids, who are six and eleven. I don’t know if she’s cheated on me, but I suspect so, and really I don’t care, our relationship isn’t about us anymore and it hasn’t been for a long time.

I say until last October because she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I’ve been by her side giving her the emotional support she needs and taking care of her when she’s helpless due to chemo. If she’d gone to screenings like I’ve suggested to her over the years they could have caught it early enough that treatment would’ve been more effective. But at this time we’re planning our last Christmas together. 

I know it was wrong of me to cheat, and that probably makes me an asshole. But she wants to tell our kids that mom and dad need space from eachother and that she wants to move in with her mom. I think it's better if we act like nothing happened for the sake of our kids so that they have the memory of a happy family for the last year with their mother.  And if we live separately the kids will eventual find out why we split and they might hate me for it, causing lasting damage to our relationships. Of course, if she somehow makes a recovery, I'm more than open to the idea of a divorce.

1679,Not the A-hole,"Last Saturday me and a friend ran an obstacle course. By the time we got home, after 4.37 showers each, we were simply exhausted, mentally, physically, emotionally. I had not trained for the race at all, I joined last minute so he wouldn't run alone, and I am pretty sure I died around mile 6.

We decide to go to a well-known, classy, and expensive restaurant, and the place is packed. We are too tired to drive elsewhere, so we wait the 30 minutes to be seated. We both immediately melt in our seats, and don't even realize we had to wait 10-15 minutes before a waiter comes over with water and a basket of garlic cheesy bread (whose days were short-lived). 

I order a petite filet, and my friend orders a ribeye steak. 

What feels like centuries later (but was really just short of an hour) I notice our waiter in the distance, with a halo of light, walking to us on a cloud of baby angel hair. I don't know if it is the complete body meltdown, or my eyes being as hungry as my stomach loudly protested, but my fillet looks... bigger, juicier, thicker, more inviting. I glance over at my mate's enormous ribeye - he is staring at it with such reverence, as if he had discovered the sensational secrets of the female orgasm, or indeed what does the fox say.

We glance at each other in a ""I will try to not eat like a pig but make no promises"" way, and with a silent nod, go medieval on that meat's ass.

In a nanosecond (but probably closer to a minute or two) I see our waiter rushing over, and feel a disturbance in the force. If you have ever gotten a horcrux destroyed, that's the feeling I got, so I knew the news were not good. Apparently we were given a different table's order, a fillet mignon and a whopping porterhouse steak for 2. The waiter apologizes profusely, takes our plates, and says he will do his best to rush in our order. 

It is now almost 2 hours since we arrived, our hunger barely quenched, that we decide to throw in the towel and admit defeat. We let our waiter know we can't wait for our food any longer, and we will be leaving. He apologizes again, and asks us to please allow him 2 minutes to sort this out, and he would be right back. 

We rejoice for a minute, thinking he is bringing our food... but instead, he returns with a bill. The other table's bill, which is little more than twice what ours would have been. He explains that, though we got the wrong order, we did actually eat the food, so we should pay for it, and they shaved 20% off for the inconvenience. We point out that I hadn't even eaten half of my filet, and my mate was less than 1/3rd into the porterhouse steak, when the waiter took our plates. He says he will have to ask his manager, and I tell him not to bother as we are not waiting a minute longer. I leave $10 on the table, and walk out.

This is as close to a ""dine and dash"" as I have ever come, and I feel a little asshole-ish for leaving it like that, so AITA or even, was there a less assholish option I could have gone for?",42,140,0.8
1680,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for the usual reasons.
 
I (28F) live with my older siblings in a house my brother owns. We all lived independently on our own before we decided to move in together five years ago to save on rent. My brother decided to buy because it made more sense for him financially.
 
Recently there was a bit of conflict around my long-distance boyfriend visiting. I asked my siblings in advance if they would be ok with my boyfriend staying with us, to save on hotel costs, and they said yes, laying out some basic house rules. All fine. Then my brother added some extra rules: 1) My door has to be wide open any time my bf is in the room with me, and 2) he isn’t allowed to sleep in my bed.
 
He stated that this was to “protect me” and that he “would hold [himself] to the same standards if [he] brought over a girlfriend.” It was clear this was about sex. I am asexual, and my boyfriend respects this. My brother is aware, but I doubt he understands or believes me. I reminded him of this and told him his concern was unnecessary, I would still want privacy, and I don’t need assistance keeping my own boundaries. He responded to my assertion by saying that “well, when people get in that situation, stuff happens that they didn’t think would.” Any further attempts at appeal were shut down.
 
Some pertinent information:

- We had no previously established rules about SOs in the house. My siblings are single.

- We don’t have a signed lease. I have never missed paying rent.

- Due to money, my bf and I only get to see each other 3-4 times a year. I only have so much PTO, so when he comes here, I still work most days. This makes evenings/nights most of our time together.

- My room is in the basement, and everyone else’s upstairs. The room just outside of my bedroom is my brother’s entertainment room, which means when he’s awake and at home, he’s right outside my door. However, once he goes to bed, he can’t hear anything reasonable that goes on in the basement.
 
I thought it was ridiculous that my brother felt the need to police his twenty-eight-year-old sister’s virtue, firstly because it’s none of his damn business and secondly because nothing was going to bloody well happen anyway, and I just wanted to go to sleep cuddling my boyfriend. So I broke his rules and snuck my bf into my room several of the nights he was here, stayed up late talking and being silly, and went to sleep with the door shut and the bf very much in my bed with me.
 
That said, my family was entirely on his side about making the rules, and it’s left me wondering: What right trumps the other in this case, my right to be treated like the grown-ass adult I am, or his right as the landlord to impose restrictions on me as the tenant? So, Reddit, tell me: AITA for breaking my landlord brother’s house rules about letting my bf into my personal space?",55,45,0.9

The studio has a rule that requires one parent to be present for all the classes. Didn’t think much of this and went to watch my daughter, but the other parents quickly became nasty. They’re all much better off and made a lot of passive aggressive comments towards me about the clothes/shoes I bought for my daughter because they aren’t the nice brands. I stopped engaging, but they’ve escalated to talking about me loudly, ripping on my daughter’s skills constantly (never in front of her, but they do it in front of me), talking about how I shouldn’t have had her so young and I’m a shitty parent because I can’t give her the best life etc. I’ve tried ignoring them, tried calmly addressing the behavior, tried talking to the studio about it, but nothing has changed, and it’s starting to get to me.

I decided to pull my daughter from the studio and enroll her elsewhere.

1683,No A-holes here,"A new sandwich shop opened up right next door to my office. We have all been seeing the shop slowly come into existence, and have been eagerly awaiting its opening (because what else exciting is there to do when sitting at a computer for 40 hours a week?).

&#x200B;

They finally opened on Monday, and announced that they would be offering 50% their entire menu all week to celebrate. Of course, I took advantage on Day 1 (of what will now come to be known as Sandwich Week). The food was delicious, so I made it back for Day 2. Then Day 3, and now Day 4. The sandwich artisan knew me by name by Day 3, and today called me his best customer.  Every day of Sandwich Week I've rallied 3-5 coworkers to tag along.

Usually I will do a celebratory ""pay day lunch"" every other week, if even that.

1684,Everyone Sucks," So wow, not sure how to begin here. I'm still very much waking up and having a pretty massive let down of serotonin after the substances we consumed last night and I'm not feeling so hot, physically and mentally. 

So girlfriend and I (maybe ex now?) have been pretty open sexually since we got together. I agreed that when I was comfortable I would have no problem with a MFM threesome. We went out last night, did a ton of the new stuff going around, danced and had a great time. She ran into an old FWB of hers and she asked if it was cool if he danced with us. I said that was cool and on the dance floor we were pretty sensual...and this is where it gets weird. I've never had a gay experience but this dude started grinding on me and giving me OTP reach around and I figured it was sort of in the spirit of the drugs and evening and didn't stop him. He also kissed me but I definitely didn't kiss him back if that makes sense. 

at like 1AM, she came up to me and asked ""do you think tonight can be the night that we do two guys? I'm really feeling it."" I told her that it would be cool. So we all went to his hotel room and for the first 30 minutes or so it was pretty amazing. It wasn't like a porno at all and we sort of took turns, would take a break, watch, two at a time, and on and on. So it was my turn and my girlfriend got on top. I was really feeling the booze and e at this time so I sort of closed my eyes to enjoy the ride. Maybe a minute later I felt this dudes dick on my face, then he sort of pressed open my lips and shoved it in. For what seemed like an eternity (in reality it was 30 secs to a minute) I was like ""holy shit there's a dick in my mouth!"" When I got a hold of myself I jumped up said ""whoa I'm not into f*g stuff"" My girlfriend freaked at me for using that word. I was like I mean ""I don't want to touch him or him to touch me!"" The guy was like ""look bro, I've been touching you all night long and you didn't object"" I was like yeah but that's a huge difference between blowing him and dancing. Both he and my girlfriend said ""no it's the complete same thing!"" I was like I gotta get out of here.

1686,Asshole,"Went out to lunch yesterday with my parents, and my aunt and uncle. It was already decided that bills would be split by couples. I didn’t have my boyfriend with me but it was me and my two kids on one bill. I had absolutely no problem with this.

The restaurant was not very upscale, and our waiter who I could tell was not very busy but maybe new, was very inattentive. So we eat, and towards the end I make sure my area and my kids area is totally clean. Nothing on the floor, plates stacked, and wiped our area. 

When the bill came, my total was $36. I didn’t ask or even think about asking what everyone else’s was because why would I? So I tipped $3. Didn’t really think too much of it. We left.

Today I get a phone call from my mom asking if I know how to tip. I said yes. Then she proceeds to tell me that she looked at my check after we left and was appalled that I only left $3, so she “took care of him for us”. At this point I get a little pissed because 1. Why would she even need to look at my bill? 2. I don’t want to be in debt to anyone, so now I feel like I owe my mom money she left for the tip. 3. I kinda figured everyone else was tipping too, so $3 would be better that not leaving anything.

My FIL is known exclusively by his middle name, as was his uncle who raised him, but my husband has always been called by his first name.  When my son was a baby my FIL started calling him by his middle name. I asked him to stop, and told him how important the name was to me. FIL then said that he would always be known as C to him. I told him, mostly jokingly, that if he kept calling R that, then I would change his surname to my maiden name. Everyone laughed. 

Since then however, both MIL and FIL refer to him as C, but not around me, only around my husband. R doesn't like it, and has told them C is not his name.  My husband has asked them to stop, but there is a pretty strained relationship there so he's reluctant to rock the boat. In Christmas and Birthday cards they only ever write ""To our grandson.""

Today the in-laws had come round for a visit, and just as they were getting up to leave FIL called my son C in front of me. I said ""who?"" very loudly, but FIL just walked off to the car. MIL had missed it, but could see I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told her and said that I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. I did swear a few times, but then apologised and explained it was just because I was so angry. She was not impressed, she told me that I was being ridiculous and that it wasn't important. I that it was to me, and that if it wasn't important to them, then they should call him by his given name.  FIL had then come back to see what was happening, and MIL was laughing when she told him that he'd upset me. He also laughed and said ""story of my life"" before going back to the car.

He's right in that we can't change them, but my current attitude is that if they can't call him R then they don't see him.

1694,Not the A-hole,"So a little background first, I am one of 2 head foremen of the plumbing company I work for. Both the other foreman and myself take on massive responsibilities in running multiple large projects with several plumbers and apprentices on each, and both see eye to eye on this issue.

Now legally, any scrap materials belong to the company. However several years ago after a discussion involving a pay dispute, the owner of the company agreed that any scrap copper and other materials would be split between the other foreman and myself as an unofficial bonus for completing projects. Because copper is worth a lot, this amounts to literally a few thousand each per year. None of the other workers officially know about this arrangement.

We have also agreed that at the end of each job we would cash out what ever scrap we have, buy lunch for the guys, and if any of the other plumbers went above and beyond, we would give them a couple of hundred or so, at our discretion, and split the rest between us. As far as the other guys know, they got some money as a  bonus if things went well, the boss looks good, we get our bonus, and everyone is happy.

Fast forward to this week. One of our new apprentices is the son of our company's secretary. He isn't exactly a great worker, but he is young and has a lot of learning and maturing to do. The other day I caught him trying to put a bunch of scrap in his car. I told him that he wasn't allowed to take it and to put it back. He argued with me about it, but I told him it belongs to the company and taking it would amount to theft. He ended up complaining to his mother, who poked around and found out about the arrangement and he went around telling the rest of the guys and demanding that the money should be split equally. 

The boss doesn't want any conflict and asked us to decide what to do. While I want to let the apprentice go and cut the problem at the source, we are not going to do that, yet. We decided that we would document all scrap and return it to the company, they boss would cut us a cheque for 40% each and he will distribute bonuses to others himself (which probably means nothing will ever get paid out). Everyone will be worse off.

But, I just finally caved and asked her and she said she will come, but it had to be on her day off. Which whatever I'll accommodate for her no problem. 

Here's the thing; I've only told her my MOH and BM are coming, but I also invited my future MIL recently. My mom hasn't said anything about the try on since I told her the date and everything a month ago. My mom seems to hate her for no apparent reason, she's only physically seen her a handful of times. 

Since my MIL has been nothing but supportive and encouraging about everything I want her to be there because her opinion has meant more to me than my moms at this point. I've been finding myself telling her about things for the wedding before it even crosses my mind to tell my mom.

So, AITA for having my MIL come wedding dress shopping without telling my mom?


UPDATE:

Thank you all for the advice and kind words. 

I told my mom my MIL is coming and she seemed fine and doesn't really care either way. I also told her that if she really doesn't want to go then I would be okay with her decision and she says she wants to go, but ""be prepared for my opinion and dont get upset when I tell you the truth."". Which I'm sure will be fine and I'll probably just ignore her if I feel differently. In the future I am going to just be upfront with everyone and not try to push anything on her with the wedding.",25,88,0.96

1701,Not the A-hole,"I had a baby two and a half weeks ago, and prior to his birth I had warned my family that I wasn't going to let anyone know when I went into labor, and that I wanted the first week to be a time for me and my partner to bond with our child and not have a bunch of visitors.

I had a natural birth at the hospital and was only there for 6.5 hours total, from 3am to 930am so even if I had wanted visitors at the hospital it wouldn't have made any sense.  When I got home the first day I crashed after my 25 hour labor.
I had called my mother when I was discharged and heading home from the hospital and she was upset on the phone but wouldn't say much.
When I called her the next morning my dad answered and mentioned she was upset and we could figure that out later.  I asked them to come meet their grandson and when they arrived it was clear they were upset and it was a very uncomfortable visit. My dads only comment was to ask if I had any regrets about the whole experience.

I didn't hear from my mom much after that during the first week and I received other passive aggressive communication from my siblings about them not being at the hospital and not getting to meet him soon enough.  So out of guilt, instead of having that week with my new family I invited all my siblings over to meet him.  
Since then, I have recieved texts from my sister telling me how I am doing this all wrong, this isn't how families should act and that she isnt going to contact me again.  My mother has also had two separate phone conversations with me where she has said I'm doing this all wrong, she didn't have children for it to be like this. She wanted to be there more, she also has brought up how she wanted me to have a wedding and share with me in the moments.

I am a very introverted person and didn't have the closest relationship to my family prior to the baby.  We would maybe see each other on a monthly basis prior despite living within 45 minutes of each other.  They do not come over regularly, my siblings have only been to my home one time prior to meeting my son since I bought it over a year ago.  I also find them to be a source of stress, as they are very different personality wise and values wise from me and tend to make me feel like I am wrong or weird for doing things my way.

I have no regrets about the way I have done things, I feel very bonded to my child, we have figured out breast feeding and spent the first two weeks snuggled up together.  
Am I the asshole for not allowing family and friends more access to my son in his first weeks?",68,230,0.93
1702,Not the A-hole,"My stepdad moved in with us when I was 14, 8 years after my parents separated. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy who made my mum happy, so I was willing to form a relationship with him at first, but he quickly began to rub me the wrong way.

Within weeks of him moving in, he would keep bugging me to start calling him dad. Even when I told him I wasn't comfortable with that, he kept insisting that I should at least try. The thing is, I still have a great relationship with my dad. I see him every weekend and during holidays, and I didn't want to call someone I'd known for less than a year 'dad' when my real father was still very much involved in my life.

Things only seemed to get worse as time went on. Every birthday and Christmas he would drop continuous hints about wanting to adopt me. Any time I asked what gifts he wanted, his answer would always be: ""To adopt you."" In a way, I understand that he had started to view me as a daughter - he'd never had children of his own - and part of me found it sweet, but he wouldn't stop asking about it. Even my mum told him it wasn't possible. My dad would have to terminate his rights and everyone knew that hell would freeze over before that happened.

I sat him down one night to explain how uncomfortable the whole situation was making me, hoping he'd at least listen and turn it down. Instead, he called me ungrateful and told me I should at least ""give him a chance"" to be my dad because he looked after me much more than my real father did. That pretty much put an end to any attempts I made to build a relationship with him. I was more than happy to accept him into my life, just not as a substitute dad, and he wasn't happy with that.

Overtime, things got to the point where it seemed like he was trying to wear me down. Art was and always has been my passion, but shortly after our talk he put down a rule that I'm only allowed to do art in the garden as he doesn't want to stain the carpets. Paints and similar, I can understand fully, but I wasn't not even allowed to use COLOURED PENCILS in the house anymore. Even if it's raining, I was basically told: go outside or find something different to do. 

I couldn't have friends over or go out with friends, no matter how much notice I gave, as it distracts me from my school work, yet every time I tried to do anything related to studying, my stepdad would come and drag me away to do chores or some family bonding activity.

 About a year ago, I gave up and moved out because I couldn't take it anymore. I moved in with my dad - 2 hours away. It now takes a little over 2 hours to get to school, but I'm much happier.

My problem emerges now. It's my 17th birthday in a month, and my mum wants to bring my stepdad down to celebrate it. The thing is, I don't want him there. We have no relationship whatsoever. I explained this to her, and am now being told that it's unfair and selfish of me to exclude him. I feel guilty, because he's not a bad man, but I just can't stand him.",82,403,0.98

She doesn't pay me for gas when I drive her to her friends' houses and whatever, and I'm totally cool with doing that stuff for her. We also go get our nails done together every other week, and I pay because I like doing stuff like that with her, and I feel like it strengthens our relationship. However.

She's the crabbiest person in the world sometimes. I love her, but my sister is definitely not a morning person. I don't know what it is, but she's awful every single morning when we go to school. She's snappy, rude, won't let me turn the radio on, and has to have the car a certain temperature. I can't even bring coffee with me because she says it makes her nauseous. I feel like she should be a little nicer to me, because I'm doing her a favor. She could take the bus, or my dad could drop her off on his way to work, which is what he used to do before I drove her. It's gotten to the point where I really don't want to drive her to school in the morning, because it always puts me in a bad mood. The thing that kind of kicked this off was on Monday, I was trying to park the car and her violin case was in the way. I moved it so I could pull up the emergency brake, and she got mad at me. She said I ""could have just told her to move it"" and then smashed my hand in between the gearshift and her case before going in to the school. I think I have a bruised tendon or something because it's still sore and my hand is really stiff. Anyways, I told her I wouldn't be driving her any more, and she started yelling at me. 

She was a lot calmer later that day, but one of her friends came up to me and told me I was a jerk for telling my sister to find another way to get to school. I know her friend is pretty biased so I brushed it off, but then my mom called me later that day while I was at work, and told me I had to keep driving my sister because ""she and my father trusted me with the responsibility of a car and I had to show them I was still adult enough to handle it"".

A few days ago I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to come, and he did, except he stays and comes to the same room daily now. I have expressed to him in the past that I find it really distracting to have someone really close to me working in this space (one of my best friends recently came for 2 days in a row and I found it hard to work after the first day). I know it's a weird mental thing I have, but I guess I get distracted too easily, even if I 'can't even see him', as he brought up. I suggested he go to another room, I checked and there was enough free space. He got quite annoyed at me over text (I wasn't in the library at this point) and said I need to just get over it, he's stressed too, not everything is about me. He is right, we are both stressed and it is just a stupid thing I have. 

I thought I should probably get over it and I wanted to meet for 5 mins to chat because I thought it would be better to communicate things in person and compromise, but he said he didn't want to waste time given he woke up late today and I think he is already annoyed about that. I get his whole point of I can't see him so why should I get distracted and he had his folders set up so he just wanted to get on with work, and I'm starting to think that I am way too particular.

His older sister wanted to major in computer networking and got a nice gig at the local hospital doing small tech support that said they'd hire her on the network team if she got a degree in it. So yeah she met the job qualification so I did pay for that.  Youngest kid(15) wants to do pharmacy stuff, and if he still wants to fine theres jobs around here for that I dont mind paying for that.

Hi , I found this female sound cloud rapper with 10k followers on soundcloud who I really like because her music is good. I liked her tweet teasing her new song and my girlfriend flipped and went off at me like “this is fucking terrible why did you like this” etc etc. And I defended myself obviously because what the fuck? She never says that, I swear it’s only because it’s a woman. 

So skip ahead a few weeks and the rapper drops the song and I love it because the teaser was as good as the song so I decide to make an alternative cover art for it to show appreciation to the rapper and so I could express myself visually. It was nothing fantasying or looking up to the rapper , was literally just her picture and some text with a little logo and some filters. I post it on my small art page along with other pieces I have because I like to look back at progress. I captioned it with the rappers @ and “this song is fire” and where I got my inspo for the piece from. 5 minutes later , my girlfriend sees this and flips again saying it’s “weird as fuck” because the rapper only has 6k followers on Instagram and that makes it weird? I am honestly baffled and removed the post after a day because my girlfriend starts saying maybe we should just be friends because if we can’t see eye to eye on this then we won’t with things down the road. And I got hit with the “good luck finding a girl who is fine with this”. It was literally just because it’s a woman and not a man like wtf. She even admitted to it that she only reacted like this because it’s a woman.

I stayed civil and tried to be as nice as possible when she was being rude to me although I do admit I got snappy in the last 3 texts because I got fed up. It’s settled for now because I apologised because I sort of see where she is coming from but a massive part of me thinks this is bs.

I've worked for Stop and Shop since 2016 and have been a service desk clerk since 2017. I have no personal issues with anyone that I work with. The management likes me, as well as the regular cashiers and other department employees. 

As some of you may know Stop and Shop went on strike last Thursday because the top guys want to take away our insurance benefits, pensions, limit our wages, etc... even though they made a few billion last year.

When the strike began it was cool because it just felt like a little break from work, but now 8 days in it's just discouraging and annoying. I didn't go Thursday because I was busy with school, but I went Friday to Sunday the days after. I'm not a social person. I can handle a 1on1 conversation for a minute or two before I don't know what to say anymore. I've always had trouble with crowds and people and get anxious but over the last few years I've been working on it. 

I'm that type of guy that everyone knows and everyone likes and will talk to but when other people or friend groups are around I become sort of an outcast. The 3 days I was at the strike I stayed for hours and mostly just stood by a telephone pole by myself even though I made an effort to talk and joke around with people.

Monday I told myself I was taking the day off from striking, I have college work to do and personal life to utilize during this little break from work. Tuesday I said the same thing, and then again yesterday on Wednesday. It is now Thursday, April18th, Day 8 of the strike, and I just don't wanna go anymore. It's not at all required to be there, but I feel guilty I'm not supporting co-workers I've known 2-3 years (I was hired end of 2016). I dont like being with a group of people for a long period of time just standing around by myself (and I've even tried going to the strike high to no avail).

Going there just makes me feel alone and outcasted while the situation itself just makes me feel sad and discouraged. I've already made the decision to start looking for other jobs in case this goes on for too long. My close friends and family say that I should be going regardless even if it's just for a little bit (an hour or so) just to show support. The job is only 7 minutes of a drive from my house. I just hate that isolated feeling. The worst part is that every time I've gone when I pull in I'm showered with ""Yeah! BoneDaddy2224 is here!"" and stuff like that but after a few minutes if being there no one even talks to me. Then when I leave people get upset like they were socializing with me in the first place.

1715,Not the A-hole,"I \[21\] was never close with the cousin in question. Over a year ago, she moved to the city I live in to pursue her acting career.  I was nice to her when she first moved here because we're cousins and all but after I helped her move into her place and drove her to a job interview that was on the other side of the city, but after that she would constantly call and ask for rides. Since then, I've been distancing myself from her (screening her calls, making up excuses so I wouldn't have to hangout with her, etc). Before she moved here, we never really talked. Maybe a phone call once a year or a facebook message her or there. 

She isn't really close with anybody from her dads side of the family except her siblings. She never sees any family members and is always getting into fights with family members. This stems from the fact that everyone on her dads side of the family **really** dislikes her mom since her mom was having an affair when my uncle was on his death bed (it's been proven, 100% not an accusation). She also has a habit of making things all about her (which honestly really irritates me).

**The issue**: She called me yesterday at work and asked if I wanted to go out for supper with her and her friends for her birthday. I really didn't want to since I had a final after work and had been up since 5:30 am but she said it would be after my final. So I decided to be nice and go out for supper with her and her friends for her birthday. Everything was fine until she brought up my dad.

Her and my dad don't really talk and don't get along. She mentioned to her friends how my dad and his twin (my uncle) both married Filipino ladies.  I love both of them to death. She has never met either of them since she doesn't really talk to any family nor visits them. She then proceeded to tell her friends that my aunt **and** stepmom must be mail order brides and asked me if my step mom was submissive to my dad because apparently"" the men in our culture (Aboriginal) except women to be submissive (I've never seen this before in my life). The Aboriginal men in my life (grandpa, dad, uncles) have never expected any women to be submissive to them.

I proceeded to correct her and said that my step mom and aunt were **not** mail order brides. My dad and step mom met online and talked for about a year before my dad went to the Philippines to visit for the first time and then got married about a year after that. My uncle met my aunt in the city that they both live in. The fact that she told her friends this assumption without even consulting me really stuck with me and hurt me.

Besides that comment, she made some more comments (that she knew nothing about the situation) regarding our family which rubbed me the wrong way.

5 years ago, I'm 15M, I have a gf. Madly in love with her and decide to bring her to gatherings every now and then. She starts being distant and breaks up a month later. Shattered my heart. I tell my cousins the next week. One of my cousins, ""Billy"" 15M, isn't there but his younger brother, ""Wally"" 11M, is. Wally tells me later on in private that over the past month, he's overheard Billy on the phone talking to my gf ""Jane"", hearing him try to convince her to break up with me and saying stuff like ""I can't wait till Jane breaks up with him"" to his friends. Wally is a prankster so I thought it was a stupid joke but I confront Jane that night and she admits to it all. She promised that she never did anything with him physically, which I believe. Some people may not see anything wrong, but I think ""emotionally cheating"" is a lot worse than a one time physical thing. Anyway, after this I cut her off completely. I talk to Billy. He simply shrugs it off like he did nothing wrong. Billy stops talking to me and I stop talking to him.

My cousins are thinking about going to Disneyland. Billy is definitely going to be there. Parents ask me if I'm going and I say no, they tell everyone I'm not going. While I never stated it, everyone knows exactly why. The fact that Billy and I hadn't talked in years and that I actively avoid him is no mystery. Everyone in my family tells me that I need to forget about the past, that ""boys will be boys"" and I shouldn't blame Billy for what he did because he's family. They tell me that I'm being pathetic and immature for not wanting to go and that I'm ruining the event. Like I said, I never state or even hint to why I don't want to go. I continue to tell them that I just don't want to go but they don't buy it. I don't really want to go on a trip if Billy is going to be there. It'd be like if someone handed me the most delicious looking burger but they put a small drop of piss on the top of it. That small drop is going to ruin the whole burger for me.

He is quite boring and I have nothing to share with him but he is not a mean guy and it don’t coast me anything to stay a bit with him. Last year he told me that he was in love with me (probably because I’m the only one who is nice with him), I told him that I have a boyfriend but we can stay friends though. The following months he was really weird with me and told me things like « I can’t visualize your chest. Can you describe it for me please ? ». He was also really flirty and gross and English class next to him was more and more complicated for me. I was really ill at ease with his behavior. But I felt pitty for him so I accepted it. But 3 months ago he sent me a long letter. In this letter, he described his dick and the way he masturbated while thinking about me, and other stuffs like « my dick is so hard when you accidentally touch my hand in English class ». At this moment, I didn’t wanted to sit next to him anymore. This letter was really rude for me (even if I understand his pain, it’s not easy to find love when you’re blind), i was seriously chocked and I even cried a bit.  Anyway, the blind guy told the teacher « Coline don’t want to sit next to me anymore » so the teacher was really upset. She told how much my behavior was bad, that the guy was a poor disabled guy and I had no heart. I was super angry against the teacher so I said in front of the class; « I don’t want to sit next to you because you’re a perv ! ». Since this day, people are angry against me. They tell me things like « you humiliated him » or « siting next to you in English was for him a sparkle in the middle of his dark  day » or « he has a sad life and you make it even worst »

1719,Asshole,"Hi,

Today I went to pick up a cake I ordered at a bakery for my daughters birthday tomorrow, thought I would pay with a bankcard, they didn't have that option.

The price was 28,90 € but I had only 28 € cash on me so I said I would bring the money on saturday (tomorrow is a holiday here) but the clerk said he could give me the cake only for the whole amount of money.

I was in a huge hurry because I had workers coming for a big repair job to my home, so I asked a kind stranger in the shop and he gifted me the money.

I live in Germany, I would believe that we have a high level of trust in strangers here, so I was disappointed she didn't believe me or even say that this was no problem, that I could get 90 cent discount...

Am I the asshole for expecting the clerk to give in?

EDIT: Thanks for your replies, I now learned that **I was the asshole**. I came here to understand, because I felt bad about being angry. Next time I will be a better customer, Thank you all for taking the time to respond

For the r/entitledparents fans, I never mentioned my daughter in front of the clerk and I didn't make any scene or pressure on her, I also never asked for the discount, just expectet her to think it's no big deal. I was disappointed but never rude in any ways.

The workers are almost done, I have to leave, my final comment to this:

I now know that it was too much to ask to pay later and to expect a discount, happy I learned something more.

The ATM thing didn't cross my mind, can't say why, I guess it was because my anxiety to get this done was already very high.

I think it's ok and not embarrassing to count on a strangers help to solve a problem.

I am happy to bring the cake to my daughter, whatever happened.

I believe entitled parents are those who feel entitled of something because they have kids, and this was never ever a point in all this matter.

1720,Not the A-hole,"Some background first. I was abandoned by my bio mother with my grandparents before I was a year old. She was 16 and didn’t want to deal with a kid. My dad went into the military and wanted to have contact with me but due to deployments etc he never could have the relationship he wanted. No blame there. She spent her life coming in and out of ours(I have a half sister I’m close to that was raised by gparents also and a half brother that wasn’t). She was always addicted to drugs and went to prison multiple times for manufacturing and possession. Always had a string of druggie boyfriends, husbands or friends that stole from her or beat her including incidents where one of them put a pillow over my sisters head when she was a small child. I have nothing but horrible memories of her and these people. I remember bloody fights and abuse no matter where she lived. One of her husbands even burned down the house with a meth lab. She never contacted us unless she wanted something and used the kids to get it. We eventually moved out of state to get away from her and won custody of my sister in the 90s. 

I haven’t spoken to her in around twenty years. She has tried multiple times to contact me through other people but I have no interest in ever seeing her again. My sister spoke to her a few times over the years but she feels the same way as I do. We have refused to ever let her meet our children also. We received a call from our half brother that she had a stroke and a brain bleed two days ago and underwent emergency surgery. She has been placed in a induced coma for the next 72 hours but doctors do not think she will live. I’m not going to her funeral because she has been dead to me for the past twenty years.

1721,Asshole,"So last night me and a couple friends went out to this popular bar downtown. It was super busy but we managed to get in and grab some seats. 

At some point in the night after I broke the seal I had to go to the bathroom. To get to the bathroom you have to walk past the bar, which had a bunch of people around it waiting for drinks. 

So as I’m making my way to the bathroom I have to go by this group of girls standing at the bar. 

As I make my way past them I wanted to let them know that I’m trying to get by so I lightly put my hand on one of the girl’s lower back so I could squeeze by her. 

As I do this she turns around and starts going off on me about how I shouldn’t be touching her and that it wasn’t necessary to touch her there and that it’s gross. 

I apologized and said I was just trying to sneak by her to go to the bathroom and she said that next time just tap me on the shoulder and don’t be “so creepy and touch girl’s backs”.  She then turned around with her friends shooting daggers at me. 

I was honestly kind of shook and when I got back to my table I told my friends what happened. They all agreed that it was kind of an overreaction but we were all guys so our perspective is probably not great about this.

1723,Not the A-hole,"Alright here goes. For reference, I am a 24y.o. straight male, my sister is 26. Lets start with some background.

For the past 5 years or so, I have started growing my hair out. In my biased opinion, I have amazing thick, curly hair. In public, I often receive random compliments on my hair. People who know me know how much I love my long hair. If given a chance, I will usually talk about it. Everyone has their favorite thing about their appearance, and my curls are my favorite.

Now, a few years back, I made the decision to donate my curls. So I chopped 9 inches off, and began to grow out my hair again. After about 2 years, I made a second donation. I rather enjoy doing this. I get to help people, and indulge my ego at the same time. Win-win. 

My family is somewhat conservative (politically, but mostly just about life), and as such, my parents have never liked my hair long, as it looks 'unprofessional'. But I am an adult, so they just make side comments about how I need a haircut. Nothing to hurt our relationship over. My sister is the only family member who outright supports my hair choices. Since I didnt grow up with long hair, she is usually where I go for advice on issues with the curly struggle (and r/curlyhair of course).

Now, for the dilemma. My sister is getting married in a few months. She has asked me to cut my hair before the wedding so that it looks more 'appropriate'. I get along great with her fiance, but he has a more conservative view on life, like my parents, so she has developed that a bit more herself. I assume that it part of the thinking behind her request. As of now, it has been ~9 months since my last haircut, and it usually takes about 2ish years to get the length needed for donation. If the wedding fell around that 2 year mark, I would have no problem making the cut and donation and satisfying her for the wedding photos.

*BUT...* thats not the case. I have tried telling my sister no light heartedly, but she seems firm that since its her wedding, its her call on whether or not I cut my hair. It even came up once with my mom on a phone call, and my mother is 100% for the haircut. I dont really want to because I have finally hit a length I can actually do stuff with, and I dont want to lose the 9mo of growth Ive gotten since my last cut. 

Yes, I am in the wedding party as a groomsmen, and I think this is the biggest issue for my sister. All of her wedding photos with me will have my long hair, and she would prefer it to be short for her eternal memories. 

TLDR: AITA for not cutting my hair for my sisters wedding when my entire family supports the cut?

Edit: Just fyi, my sister is not (yet) close to what I would call a Bridezilla. This whole debate has been cordial, and we get along pretty well as a family. Im just looking for an outside opinion on the situation, not insults to my sister. Love ya reddit

1724,Not the A-hole,"Last night, I (20M) ended an almost two year long relationship with my girlfriend (19F), let’s say Kelsey, after she gave me an ultimatum that I need to attend church every Sunday or she would break up with me. 

Background: Kelsey knows my history with being forced to go to a Southern Baptist Church from the time I was born until I left for college, which is ironically about the same time we’ve started dating. Being forced to go to church services with messages I did not agree with pushed me away from religion instead of helping me develop a healthy relationship with God. 

Last year, during my first year of college, I only went to church a couple times throughout the year, mostly when Kelsey asked me too. Going to a Methodist church and hearing a different message of the gospel being preached was refreshing and I didn’t mind going whenever she asked. I had begun to grow a healthy relationship with the church and God again. 

During the first semester of this school year (Fall 2018), we went to church a few times again but nothing too seriously. She is a freshman and college and it took some time for her to adjust and figure out what she wants and needs. After winter break, she decided she wants to go to church more often and I support her 100%, as I believe in helping her grow as she needs to, and I’d even been attended church more too as I have been feeling much better about it again. 

The problem happened two weeks ago when Kelsey hit me with this ultimatum: either I start attended church every Sunday, or we break up. I took some time to think about it and realized that’s not where I’m at in my faith and if I start feeling forced to go to church again, it will ruin the relationship I have built back up with it. I tried to explain this and she countered that I truly just don’t want to grow and that I need to force myself to do it. I told her I could build up to going every Sunday but I can’t just flip a switch right now, and she said it’s something she needs long-term. I asked Kelsey to please stay with me and continue to support me by helping me build my faith as I have been doing so that this long-term relationship can happen, because I do love her and she truly makes me happy. She said she can’t do that and I have to fully commit myself how to going to church every Sunday because that’s what she needs in a boyfriend.  I told her I just can’t do that for her right now as it would feel as if I’m controlled and forced to go, despite my feelings on it. She wouldn’t budge even after I tried so hard to find ways to make it work. 

Eventually, I realized I was just beating a dead horse, and said that if there’s nothing we can agree on other than her way, I can’t do that right now. I feel that faith is a very personal journey and at 20 years old, that journey needs to be decided my right now.

1725,Asshole,"My typical driving speed is between the speed limit and 5 under. Sometimes there are people in the right lane driving slower than I am, typically semi trucks going up hill. When I encounter these vehicles, I pass them at the speed limit. Sometimes this takes a while if there is a long line of slow vehicles. I know sometimes this pisses people off who want to go 10+ over. They tailgate me and act agitated, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I'm using the passing lane for exactly that, passing, and I get back in the right lane as soon as I pass the leading slow vehicle.

Edit for clarity...

Some have commented on an apparent incongruity between stating that I drive under the speed limit in the left lane and that I pass at the speed limit. A typical scenario might go something like this...

Speed limit is 65. I come up on some tractor trailers going up a hill at 45. I slow down to match their pace while waiting for a spot to open up in the left lane that's large enough that I can use it without cutting somebody off. When I get that spot I merge left, at that instant I'm still traveling at the same speed as the tractor trailers, 45. I accelerate to 65 as quickly as possible to get around them. If the line of tractor trailers is 6 or 8 trucks long I may have somebody behind me by the time I get to the front of the line who wants to go 75 or 80.",145,41,0.7
1726,Not the A-hole,"So at my school there is this class called HOSA. HOSA stands for Health Occupations Students of America. So I signed up for this class, had an interview, and got accepted into the class. After I got accepted into the class, the teacher sent out an email to all the parents of HOSA applicants. The email basically said that parents had to come to this meeting if they wanted their child to be in this class. This is because HOSA is involved with local hospitals, and the hospitals require that parents are aware of certain rules and codes in the medical field. The parents would also have to sign some forms and what not. Anyways, I called my Dad and told him about the meeting next week. My Dad was very reluctant to go. He said “Why should I go, it’s your class?” and “ You know I don’t appreciate being forced to these meetings” He works at home and isn’t very busy most of the time, so I tell him that he could take a little time out of his day to go to this meeting. He wasn’t very happy with my answer so he called the teacher of the HOSA class and just kept arguing. After that he called me and said “ I’ll go, are you satisfied?”

1727,Not the A-hole,"Recently I moved out of my partent's house into my own apartment. This has been a dream of mine for a very long time because living with my family has been very annoying and frustrating for many reasons. For example: my room didn't have a door until I was 16 and when I finally got one it had a big glass window in it so people could still look into my room at all times and my father would look through the trash regularly to see what others threw away.

So I moved into my own apartment as soon as possible eventhough it wasn't easy because I really wanted to live alone for a while. Then one week after i moved out my girlfriend of 7 months asked if she could move in with me. I told her she couldn't because I wanted to live alone for at least a few months and I told her my reasons for wanting so and I even told her that she could move in after those months were over. But she got mad at me anyways and called me selfish and claimed that I don't love her and that I don't want to spent time with her and I really don't undestand why because I think my standpoint is quite reasonable. She wants to move out of her parent's house as well but her parents would support her with rent and everything else so it wouldn't be a problem for her to get her own apartment at least fo a couple of months.

1728,Asshole,"This is one of my biggest pet peeves when I’m driving. To the point where it legitimately pisses me off. If there’s no one in the slow lane I’ll just pass them and let it be, but when two people are driving side by side it drives me absolutely insane!

You should only be in the fast lane if you are passing someone. That is it. And if you start passing someone but for whatever reason you can’t, then slow the fuck down and go behind them. Or speed up for 5 seconds to pass them. It is so irritating when people block the fast lane.  

If it’s late at night and they do this, especially when there’s almost no one else on the road, it makes me even more pissed. Sometimes I drive to the side so my headlights are in their mirror, if they don’t get the hint. If they still keep doing it I’ll flash my headlights.

So am I the asshole or is this kinda justified?

EDIT: IK this doesn’t justify it, but if the other one is open, I will just pass them. I only do this when they’re driving side by side with another car and it has been like this for like over a mile. And they are both going under the speed limit",253,88,0.77

I kept having to lower my working hours and spend my savings on medical bills. Cut to three years later. The migraines now cause temporary paralysis and make me fall down. I finally gave up my job.

I told him that was enough and we don't use that sort of racist language at school (or anywhere i hope). He gets sent to the principal's office and he gets a detention. A lot of students then started yelling at me saying that i shouldn't punish him for that because he's black.

1733,Not the A-hole,"So I (26F) live in a shared house with one guy roommate (21M) and another girl (23F). 

Guy roommate - D

His gf - L

So since its Easter break, D has left to go on a trip and my other roommate has left to go home. And I'm home alone for the next 2 ish weeks. 

D informed me he's given his keys to L, so she can check up on his cat and also feed his pet snake. Which I've no issue with as long as she can inform me when she's coming etc etc. 

I am good friends with them both and I'm quite close to L as well. 

I get repeated texts from L today asking when our cleaning lady is leaving so she can use D's room to study and check up on the pets etc. Then about an hour later she texts me, that she was supposed to meet a friend in the city for dinner, but since the weather is rubbish, she wants to know if she can have dinner with her friend at our house instead. She said she asked D's permission and he's okay with it. And now she's asking me. 

 Just to be clear, I'm not invited to this dinner, so I'll have to stay up in my room, while they wine and dine downstairs??

Just to make it clear, she lives about 10 minutes away from our house, in an apartment all by herself. Plus our cleaning lady just left so our house is pretty clean. Neither D nor his gf have a history of cleaning up after themselves (think unwashed dishes left soaking for a week until our cleaning lady comes back). 

I'm not okay with it since I know she wont take responsibility for the dishes she will use and they'll just lie in wait until the cleaning lady returns next week. And I end up living in a mess that's not my own.

1734,Not the A-hole,"No throwaway because I don't think 85 year olds use Reddit too much.

Anyway, here's the scoop...

So my grandma moved in with us last year; she got too old to take care of herself so this was the next best option. I love her, and have always been very close to her, but this has turned into a different ballgame. Over the course of probably the last six months or so she's continued to get worse in terms of how she treats people, but I don't know how I'm supposed to respond to it. She's called my girlfriend a brat - to her face. She constantly guilts me if I'm not home that night to eat supper (even though I'm there like 4 times a week), and has just started being passive aggressive overall. Her and I share a bathroom, and she started locking my entrance to the bathroom to try and keep me out - plenty of small things like this that have just continued to add up.

My conundrum is this. She's 85, I'm not entirely sure if she understands what her actions are doing, and sometimes she speaks before saying what she wants. Each thing she does isn't enough to warrant getting pissed about, but all this added up seems like enough. I just don't know if this is a battle worth picking.

Also, other family members in the house have mentioned minor annoyances with her before, but she just turns it into a guilt trip saying she's a burden on the family and starts crying. WIBTA?

Edit: Not literally ""fuck off."" Definitely a fairly harsh conversation though because of previous experience with her guilting behavior since normal conversations haven't worked.

I know it's a cliche and a shit excuse, but I had a very rough childhood and I started doing drugs at 14. By the time I was 19, I was addicted to heroin. Between 19 and 23, I overdosed 3 times, once on purpose. I tried to quit several times, and my longest sober period lasted for about 2 years, from 23 to 25. That's when I relapsed ONCE (meaning, I did heroin just one time and stopped again).

I'm currently 1.5 years sober and I'm feeling much much better, I'm in therapy that actually works for me for the first time in my life, I take medication, and I have my shit together - I'm healthy, I have a nice job, a nice place and a nice boyfriend.

He gets in one of my friends face and pushes him. At this point, I decide to text my brother to come get us, we tell him we had a good time, he seems to cool down, and we leave.

Now. I did tell Kaylee this the following day and she was embarrassed but we told her it was okay but very uncomfortable and a little scary and to watch out. She says that he claims to not remember doing any of that. (and since he doesn’t remember it wasn’t really “him” and dismissed my concern) And he told her we all seemed to enjoy the conversation (what?) 

This happened 2 months ago. Ever since, every time she’s asked me to hang out, if I know that her boyfriend will be tagging along, I kindly decline saying that I can’t. But if she says it’ll just be me and her I will gladly go. Sadly they don’t spend much time apart so I’ve been declining many invitations which I know bums her out and irritates her. 

AITA for not wanting to hang out with her if her boyfriend is also present? And any tips on how to proceed would also be helpful! Ty!",14,29,0.93
1744,Not the A-hole," 

In Oct. I moved in with two of my best friends (all 23M) from high school. We all stayed pretty close and had discussed moving in with each other for sometime and once we found a property that met everything we were looking for we all jumped in. Our agreement was to split all bills.

One of my roommates, lets call him B, has a long time girlfriend (nearly 10 years) who stays over maybe 4-5 times a month and I don't have a problem with that.

My other roommate, lets call him M, has a new gf who has stayed almost every single night since they started dating on NYE. At first she would constantly stay over 6-7 days a week. In Jan. I figured it was a temporary thing since they had never been in an official relationship. Then this continued into Feb. and Mar. Me and B sat down with him and expressed how it's unfair that she basically lives at our house and uses our utilities without paying anything. He said he understood and that she would stay over 2-3 nights a week instead of 6-7. We let him know that we don't have a problem with her coming over but if she spends most of her nights at our house she needs to help financially and with chores. It hasn't changed since and it's mid April now. She never cleans the dishes and I am constantly cleaning up her hair from everywhere in the house because she sheds worse than dog. She leaves trash everywhere and I've gotten on M to clean up after her but she makes so many messes that it's almost impossible for one person to keep up with.

We are allowed to change names on the lease as long as it gets approved. She has moved in her pet rodents (which smells awful. she rarely cleans their cage, leaving M to do it). I find it nearly impossible to relax in my own home because we have a permanent guest. She won't have a conversation with me or B so it's impossible to have an opinion about her. She's glued at the hip of M so it's impossible to have a 1 on 1 conversation with her.

Now every time she stays over my roommate M has some sort of an excuse as to why she needs to stay 15-20 nights in a row. He says she has anxiety so she can't stay at her house (I'm pretty uneducated about the topic so I mostly let it go because she is my best friend's girlfriend) and that his car is broken down so he needs rides everywhere and it's just easier if she stays. It seems pretty ridiculous to me and we've (me and Brad) have brought up how it is an issue and Marshall doesn't seem to care. She has been left at our house alone on multiple occasions. This especially bothers me because I own a few firearms and I don't own a safe (I have firearms for self defense not for sporting so a $3k-4k safe is useless for me). It makes me uncomfortable that someone with mental health issues has free access to my room/firearms and I never agreed to live with her.

1745,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone,

for context: I'm a dancer and due to classes that I teach & various contests, I've been dancing in my flat since I moved in. First time my downstairs neighbor complained: I was dancing with shoes on (for better friction) and full power, my downstairs neighbor came ringing my doorbell saying the steps were too loud. That was his first complaint in the 1 year that I've been living here (Might be that he just moved in, not sure). Totally understandable so I stopped.

Next day, I danced in socks and only at 50% power to respect my neighbor's wishes, and again he rang the doorbell and this time he completely lost his mind, telling me that a home is only for sleeping and resting, I'm not supposed to use it for anything else and that if I want to dance then I will have to rent a dance club. Keep in mind I dance in the afternoon, around 3pm - 7pm, and only for maybe 30 - 45  minutes maximum at a time which is - in my opinion - a totally acceptable time for tolerating a little bit of noise. My upstairs/next door neighbors play instruments, regularly do drilling or listen to loud music which tbh doesn't really bother me and I know it's not a day-long thing - plus, I respect their hobbies and interests so I let them be. Also, it's in the noon or afternoon which is fine to me. 

No one's ever complained about it before, the music is non-hearable, I legitimately only do tippy taps and I really need the mirror in my flat to keep pursuing my hobby. I think he's really overreacting and just forcing his bad mood on me, because the steps are bearly hearable. I do believe I am entitled to a few dB a day. WIBTA to tell him off?",98,172,0.93
1746,Not the A-hole,"So I’m in uni with a major in comics. It was really hard for me to get into the program because the whole thing was topsy turvy and I was previously animation (same major, different concentration). A fellow student ripped into me when they looked through my sketchbook and only saw classwork/notes. She asked where all my personality/passion was. I said I don’t draw in my spare time because 1) I have chronic pain in my dominant hand (I think it’s carpal tunnel, getting diagnosed tomorrow) and 2) drawing is work for me. My hobbies and art that I do for fun is either making costumes or knitting (not lately tho, rip my wrist).

She then said that I should be a sculpture student instead. I said hell no, I’m a 3rd year already, and I want to make/write/draw comics. I initially wanted to be in the comic program when I came to uni but I only went the animation route at first on the recommendation of a professor (and as a result I’m behind in the program, only by a year tho). 

She later asked me what my favorite comics were. I listed off a bunch of webcomics, along with a lot of manga, and said that Spider-Man was my favorite superhero. She said “don’t you read any REAL comics?” I said “what do you mean?” She starts listing off really obscure (some recognizable ones like Asterix) European comics, and then some more recognizable marvel and DC titles. 

I tell her “I don’t like reading a lot of print comics because they’re hard for me to find a starting point. I just like to make them.”

She then says “well i think you should go back to working on the computer, since you clearly aren’t meant to be drawing. You’re just making it harder to for other students to get into the program”

At that point I put my earbuds in and ignored her. I know that I’m not preventing anyone from getting into the program because anyone else who applies from now on is going to be on a new plan that’s under studio art instead of design (the topsy turvy bit I was referring to was the major changing spots).

When my entire portfolio was being reviewed, I had one of the professors ask me “where is the heart in your drawings?” So I feel like the student has some validity

I DON’T draw in my spare time, while others around me are sketching while taking notes or just for fun. Drawing isn’t fun for me, it’s work, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy it. 90% of my work is within A range so it’s not like I’m drawing like I did as a 12 yo weeb. I’m already halfway through the program,so I won’t change it, but am I not an artist if I only do it for work? Am I insulting other artists?

EDIT: Thank you for your comments. Thank you for those who validated my disability (I’m registered as such in school bc I cannot hand write my notes).  I also agree that the teacher was doing her job, and that classmate can suck it. (Tbh apparently a lot of other students can’t stand her). Thank you especially to those who didn’t make me doubt my career choice. Even if I don’t work in comics, I can at least still have a job in illustration, concept art, or animatics (I love those).  Again, I don’t hate drawing, I just don’t do it for fun/outside of class.  I have an insane amount of assignments to do so I don’t like to draw after I get them done. Thank you for all the input",18,30,1.0

1748,Not the A-hole,"**UPDATE [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/user/confusedbfthrowaway1/comments/bgi725/update_aita_for_not_being_able_to_accept_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) BC I'M APPARENTLY NOT ALLOWED TO POST THEM HERE**

I know how the title of this sounds but please hear me out. Also, this is a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and I don't want her to see this. 

About a year ago my (20M) partner (25F) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. She told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. I'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell I even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but I'm pretty into monogamy and told her that I wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. Note: I'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.

Long story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that I told her I was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when I came out as bisexual. I eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) I don't have to hear about it in detail. She agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. She became noticeably happier after she started this, so I've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. 

Thing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. I'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point I'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. It's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. It feels like we're just mates who share a bed. Conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and I'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. 

I brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying I had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that I was trying to police her sexuality. I'm now in a place where I'm completely torn. As I said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course I want her to be happy. And she really was very supportive of me when I came out as bi. But it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. I get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than I am, but it bums me out that I'm not enough for her. 

So what do y'all think? Am I being an arsehole and should I just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? Or am I justified in being upset?

ETA: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so I'll post an explanation about how I'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. When I was a teen I was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. A dude in our building who I would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if I needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. My now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking I was ~17 (age of consent in the UK is 16). I didn't turn down her advances because I was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. Clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.",784,12418,0.89
1749,Not the A-hole,"I am 20 and work at a strip club as a dance tracker which means i keep track of how much the strippers make. I take my job seriously because Im working to be a manager one day. I put on my social media that my club was hiring and a friend (we’ll call her alyssa) i hadnt talked to since middle school said she was interested in the job. i immediately told my general manager manager (GM) and alyssa got hired as a waitress when she came in. 

her first day was saturday and she kept disappearing from the floor to be in the bathroom or locker room. she told my GM she was sick, and then told me she actually saw her uncles in the club. after a while my GM called me to the office and asked me what was alyssas deal. im not in any way a snitch but my GM asked me and i could tell it wasnt looking good on alyssas end so i told her the truth, her uncles were in the club. instead of the GM making alyssa stay because she had a “minor stomach ache”, she was understanding and let her leave because my GM was once a dancer at a club and has empathy. 
yesterday was her second day at work and everything was smooth but she told me she was thinking about calling out  for her third day which was today because she doesnt like it so far or some dumb reason. i said okay do what you feel is right. 

so today comes and alyssa texts me that a family member is in the hospital due to a stroke or something and that she needed to call off, i said okay and gave her the GM number (not sure why she doesnt have it). alyssa then texts me saying shes afraid shes going to get fired so she might as well quit. i told her it would make me look bad if she quit because i got her the job there but to do what she had to do. she then tells me the reason she’d quit is because she already looked bad because  i “ratted her out” on her first day since i told the GM the truth about why she was avoiding work by staying in the bathroom for 20 fucking minutes and it made her look bad. i explained i didnt rat her out only saved her from getting fired that day because the GM had called me down and was starting to form judgement until i explained what was going on. i also told alyssa in that text regardless of the situation i support her. then alyssa tells me i gave her attitude in the text messages and she’s in a bad situation because her family members in the hospital  and she’ll take note that i didnt care. i never told her that i didnt care, she assumed it.
keep in mind alyssa knows i got her hired because i thought highly of her and im trying to work my way up to become manager (which my GM said will happen very soon) so i thought bringing in a good person would help plus we are short staffed.

so here’s my question for you reddit... am i the asshole for telling my GM that alyssas uncles were in the club so she could get out of the uncomfortable situation? and am i the asshole for telling her she’d make me look bad if she quit?",16,29,0.94
1750,Not the A-hole,"Let me preface this by saying I'm an atheist and do not support the indoctrination of children (baptisms, communions, etc.) because they don't fully understand what's going on and shouldn't be committed to a religion as newly born humans. If they choose that path as they get older, then it's their decision. Not trying to hate on religion here, so I digress.

Anyways, my fiancé's niece is having her first communion in a few weeks and, while his family is not expecting us to go to the mass since they know we are atheists, I guess we're going to some luncheon celebration with them afterwards. I'm also not good with kids and don't particularly enjoy being around groups of them, so I think it goes without saying that I'm not looking forward to this. Earlier today, he texts me while I'm at work and says that we should each give her $100 as a gift. My immediate response was along the lines of ""that's crazy, no 8-year-old needs $200 cash as a present for this kind of thing, or anything else for that matter"". I suggested $50 each, which is what my mom advised. She's not Catholic, but has been to many more events like this compared to myself so I figured she'd have a better frame of reference. She's the godmother of my cousin, and said that she and my dad gave him $100 total for his communion. I told my fiancé this, and he thinks I'm being cheap. Sorry, but we have bills to pay and some things coming up that I'd like to be able to do. I don't quite have money coming out of my ass at this point in my career. That extra $100 can be used so much more wisely. If it was going to a college fund, I'd be more inclined, but, in all seriousness, they'd probably just use it to buy more of those LOL dolls or stuff like that. Honestly, I thought I was being generous with the $50 each offer since it's not an accomplishment-based event like a graduation. Am I the asshole/cheap bitch, or is my fiancé being unreasonable and expecting too much?",66,57,0.81
1751,Not the A-hole,"My parents live a few blocks away from me and my family.  My mother occasionally watches my 3 year old and 1.5 year old.  She clearly loves them and does all the grandma things, but she is SUPER religious.  Which in itself isn't bad.  However she's taken to trying to indoctrinate my kids with colorful propaganda books and toys.  My wife and I are not anti-religion, but we also don't want someone pushing it on our kids; especially at this young age.  We would prefer that they make that determination on their own.

We had mentioned to her in the past that we didn't feel it was appropriate and would prefer she not give them religious toys/books.  She might listen for a week or two, but often reverts back by testing the waters with small trinkets.  Then we stopped letting the kids take them, or donating them instead.  So she stopped giving the gifts, and we thought things were okay.  But then my daughter started talking about how 'great God is' and 'God is magic'.  She's 3, and she isn't exposed to that kind of worldview other than when she stays with my mother.  So I took my mother to lunch and politely told her again to not push religion on my kids.  She scoffed, rolled her eyes, and begrudgingly agrees.

Well today, without any prompting, my 3 year old says that she 'doesn't like gay people' and that 'gay people are bad'.  Obviously we were shocked.  This wasn't some sort of fluke.  She said it at multiple times.  When we asked her where she heard that from, she always says it's my mother.

I draw the line when someone pushes their bigotry into my kids head.  My daughter has no concept of what gay/straight is.  And I know that why my mother wouldn't outright say that to anyone's face, she views homosexuality as a sin.

I can't prove she is the reason why my daughter said that.  But there has been enough precedent to make that a highly likely scenario.

My wife was furious.  And for good reason.  She vented on social media without naming anyone, but describing how terrible the situation was.  Anyone who knows my mother knows that's who's being referenced.

My mother is a habitual victim.  You can't have a rational argument with her.  She instead chooses to be mopey and make the rest of my extended family feel sorry for her.  They then push on me claiming 'she didn't mean it' or I should 'be the bigger person'.  No one keeps her accountable.  No one holds her accountable for doing shitty things to my family.

So, sadly, I think this crossed a line that can't be uncrossed.  No one in my family is doubting that my mother has homophobic views.  Yet no one will explain to her that it's wrong to pass that along to my kids.  They would prefer we accommodate her because she's doing it out of love because she wants them to get to heaven.

We aren't going to allow my mother to be unsupervised with my kids and she'll see less of them because of this.

My wife's post on social media garnered a lot of support.  To the point that some of my extended family members and friends commented on how terrible that behavior was.  My Father (who has never done social media) decided to become my Mother's PR agent and write a post essentially saying that my daughter misunderstood and that they love us and forgive us.    


There was no attempt to apologize prior by calling/emailing/messaging us.  And there definitely wasn't an apology in their post.

1753,Not the A-hole,"So, I work IT in a hospital. Around the same time I got hired, they hired a mentally challenged guy who did the same program as I did, at the same school. Because of this, I know he didn't really...earn his degree. He was sort of passed along and never had to do the work we did. I know he couldn't finish at least two of the required courses, and there he was with us at graduation.

Now, when we started, he did ""Bench Tech"" level stuff. He would take the easiest tickets, he would build new and disable old users. He would also build new and disable old computers. All real easy stuff. So, at this point, he's just an awkward dude I had to remind to try rebooting, and to chew with his mouth closed.

Thing is, he's smart enough to know that he can use his...status to his advantage. He started claiming he had too much work. So they stopped making him do any tickets at all - and you know what? Cool. Awesome. People didn't really always know how to interact with him, and he didn't always know how to interact with people. Awesome.

Thing is, he kept going. Over the course of a year and a half he just kept complaining about having too much work. So here we are, all he has to do is the BASE IMAGE of a computer. A process that - on a really bad day where EVERYTHING goes wrong - should take two hours max per machine. He's set up to be doing seven machines at a time.

He only does one per WEEK though. So I have to go out and get chewed out for new computers not being done, while he gets praise showered on him for doing literally nothing all day. He just eats...all day...with his mouth open.

I will openly admit, part of it is jealousy. I wish I could literally do nothing and be paid. But really, this is a REAL job. A real job that a person who needs their foot in the door in the industry could have, and actually be helpful.

Hour or so later I get a call since I was the one that placed the order. Got told I had to return the extra order of food I had taken. I was pretty confused but told them no, we had eaten it. Woman then proceeded to say I need to pay the 30ish bucks for the food I ate. I told her no again, more annoyed this time.

My son (8) heard from someone in school that god wasn't real, and so he's been asking me and his mother questions about that a lot after that. I personally am not really religious one way or the other. I'm not atheist per se but I definitely don't have any solid belief in anything, but my wife is and always has been very Christian. She's been trying to convince him Jesus is real and honestly has been kind of concerned about this whole situation, while I kind of couldn't care less. I think he's going to make his own choice one day like I did and it's his to make not ours. Anyway though, he came up to us last night real excited and told us he had a way to see if god was real. He was going to put a letter on his dresser for god and in it he told god to take the letter with him if he was real. He was excited this morning because he couldn't find the letter anywhere, and basically my wife just told me that she took the letter.

Often, when I leave this particular Chick-Fil-A I’ll go ask for a refill on my soda; there’s a little spot off to the side of the registers where all the soda seekers seem to stand in order to be noticed and helped.  

So mom and kids finish their meal, leave the table with ALL their trash still on/around it, and go stand in the soda spot.  So I’m thinking, dafuq? They’re just gonna leave this shit for someone else to clean up? They’re seriously over there waiting for their to-go refills and are gonna peace out without cleaning up.  What a twat waffle....

I hope your crotch monsters sneeze in your eye balls and draw on your walls with your most expensive lipstick”

My son Matt, 12, is a decent kid with very mild ASD. He is incredibly smart but can be too trusting of people. He will give the shirt off his back if someone asks and often over looks other people's shitty behavior.

Two years ago he made friends with a neighbor kid, Nathan (same age). They would hangout over the summer, after school, sit together at lunch and recess. Honestly, it was a friendship that any mother with a special needs kid could hope for. But it turned sour about a year ago with Nathan trying to alienate all the kids in my son's class and calling him a sociopath.

It got so bad that Matt's personality ended up drastically changing with many indicators of depression. Luckily we caught it relatively early and got the school involved and Nathan was removed from his class and prevented from having any contact with Matt.

Last week Nathan approached Matt at school asking to be friends again. Matt said they could try it out and see how it goes. Today, they were hanging out at Nathan's house and Matt said it went well.

1763,Asshole,"I am graduating this semester and I haven't told my mom yet. The thing is, I am graduating in 2 years instead of 4 so my mom has no idea. She knows that I have been taking extra classes and that I was ahead of the curve, but I think she assumed I would be graduating a year early maximum. 

I still live at home with her so all of my university mail comes here. I have taken most of the graduation related mail before she saw them, but she noticed one piece of mail regarding graduation pictures. She asked me about it and I played it off saying that the school probably made a mistake. 

The reason I have not told her is because I know she would make a huge deal about it and tell everyone. We have a very large family and pretty much everyone would come to the graduation party which I just don't want. She brags about me a lot already which just makes me really uncomfortable. When I mentioned that I was a Teaching Assistant for a class, she told everyone about it constantly for several months. She was a single mother (my dad died when I was a child) so I think she is just proud that I turned out alright, but I just don't like being the center of attention. I disliked high school graduation and I am sure that college graduation would be even worse if I told her.

I am going to be starting graduate school next semester, so I doubt she will notice any change in my routine. When I graduate from grad school, I would probably have to tell her.

I told my sister [19F] that I am graduating and she told me that I was being extremely selfish because graduation is for the entire family rather than just the person graduating.

Buuuut, I added that I Googled her username beforehand just to make sure she wasn't an axe murderer. I said this in jest but I really did Google her username. She asked me what I found and I didn't want to lie, so I told her I found her Fetlife profile.

For those not in the know, Fetlife is a social media site that's pro-sexuality, pro-kink, etc. It's not something I use but I had an account because my ex had one and she encouraged me to make one. I had a blank profile pretty much. First Google result was her profile so I had to find my old login details and go in to see her profile.

I did see her photos on the site. Many of which were topless, bottomless, etc. In an artistic way, though. I told her this and she was disgusted with me and said I stalked her and that was private. I told her nothing on the Internet's private and it doesn't matter anymore because we're together. It's not like it made the decision for or against me messaging her on Okcupid years ago. She also said I was a peeping Tom and I should be ashamed of myself.

Me: No. 

Prof: Oh, Spain?

Me: Nope.

Prof: Then you must have some Middle Eastern in you then?

Me: aha does it really matter?

Prof: I guess not-

Me: Great so-

Prof: but where are you from?


And by now I’m just annoyed cause I just want the class to actually start. So maybe I overreacted and snapped and said: “does it actually fucking matter? Can you just teach the class?”

My professor then gets flustered and apologised and does get on with the class, but then I leave the class and my friend tells me I should have just told him my nationality and didn’t see why it annoyed me. But I get asked this everyday and it just gets to the point of should I be carrying around a damn ID?

So am I the asshole?  And how can I better deal with this question so I don’t feel like a Guess Who tile.

Hey Everyone,

​

So there I was driving down the street and I could see a dude on a bike about a quarter mile up. I'm watching him as i approach to avoid hitting him, and I see his wallet fall out! I honked and pointed but the dude flipped me off and continued on. I pulled over and picked up his wallet. He has a crisp hundred dollar bill and a few photos and debit cards, ID etc.

My first reaction is to keep his money and continue on with my day, but after seeing the photos of his very young kids I could tell he was a new dad and prob needed that money. I recently had a child of my own and I know that feels man. So being a good person, I drove to his house ( address on ID ) which was around the corner and I pull up our front and park.

Now...lets call our missing wallet dude ""john"" for obvious reasons.. I approach the house on foot, very large and duplex style.I went straight to ""unit A"" as the ID stated and knocked. A 20 year old looking guy (possible brother) opens and I ask for ""John"". The dude immediately responds with, ""He doesn't live here, never has"". Just basically dismissing ""john"" completely. I look behind this dude and I can SEE PHOTOS of the ""john"" hanging on walls and what not. I attempt to explain the situation and the dude slams the door on my face. I'm a little annoyed now. I knock one more time to try to explain and nothing. Fuck it..I turn and walk back to my car. .As I'm walking away...I hear someone behind me yelling..

Low and behold...It's my guy John! He's cursing up a storm. Telling me that If I ever come back He'll kill me and to not fuck with him or his family. I couldn't believe it. I hadn't even told them what I was there for and I'm being threatened. At this point I realized this was a complete waste of time and went straight to my car.

I told my 14 year old daughter that if she could find another adult to take her I would let her go, but it has to be a adult.
I explained to her that this pride parade ends at 11pm and I dont want her alone with drunk adults, and she has also never been to one so I worry she could get lost.

I think she only wants her parents to take her. 

I also asked if her pride group was going and if she could tag along, but they are not. 

I then told her that there needs to be a adult or she can't go, simple as that.  she got super mad and stormed into her room.

My girlfriend and i have been together for 2 months. We have been having sex maybe 4 times a week for almost as long and we have used a condom every time. She has recently started telling me to stop using the condom because she doesnt like how it feels. I told her that if she wanted to stop using a condom she needed to get on some sort of birth control. I dont want kids-she would be ok with one. 

Ive gone so far as to list all the options, the potential benefits, costs, and possible downsides of each one. She refuses to try the pill ""because she doesnt want to"" and/or she is afraid of possible side effects (she has never tried it) and doesnt want any sort of implant or surgery. At this point she wants me to just pull out every time  (which i did successfully for 2 years back when i was in college-stupid i know)(she knows this). I told her im not going to take that chance. She told me she did it with her ex for 3 years and i still told her i dont care- Im not taking the risk. Ill admit i have been pressuring her to try the pill or at LEAST talk to a professional. But this whole argument has spiraled and now she has refused to have sex with me since then since she doesnt like the condom and says im not respecting her wishes. She is mad im pressuring her to consider it. She is mad i wont go raw.

Before I married my husband he had 3 children with his ex wife who were (2,2, 5)When we got married. His ex was still bitter ( I say this in the most respectful way possible. But it’s true) as they had only been divorced officially for a year. 

After that custody was a big issue with us with her and my husband fighting for full custody. 
Unfortunately we only ended up getting weekends and the complete months of December and July while they were out of school. So it goes without saying i wasn’t much of a mother figure to them rather than their fathers wife . My husband passed away 2 years ago in an accident and I haven’t seen them aside from the funeral in all that time. 

His wife called me up sometime last month to reveal she’s suffering from a terminal illness (a brain tumor) and that she was hoping I could take in the children after she passed. Both her and my husbands parents are far to old to even care for themselves completely (I still take his mother grocery shopping as she can’t do it alone) and that there was no one else who would be able to care for and support the children in a proper way. She said her  sister suffers from addiction and I’m not sure if that could be something the state would consider if there was truly no one left. 

I told her I’d consider and needed to think it over and would call her in my mind I feel that even though it’s heartbreaking that she has to consider who will care.

1778,Asshole,"I have been taking my godmother grocery shopping every Saturday for the past 19 years. We are not related, but she cared for me when I was young which is another story. I also help her around the house with small maintenance issues, pay her bills, listen to her voicemails, etc. She is 88, can't drive, is very stubborn and is starting to lose her memory. 

I had a baby 2.5 years ago, 'Amy,' and she has attended everyone of our 'Saturday errand days' since she was about 5 weeks old, and she and Godmother have gotten very close.

Three months ago Amy was sick and not in a good mood. She got in a fight with Godmother over something dumb, and Amy said ""I don't like you!"" during the fight. Reminder, Amy is 2 and a half. Godmother got upset and made me take her home without finishing her errands. The next Saturday I let her know Amy has said that to me and my Husband as well, so its no big deal, she didn't mean it, etc. and we laughed about how a 2 year old hurt her feelings. 

This past week, Amy didn't want Godmother to sit in the front seat and she hit Godmother on the arm. Godmother got so upset she attempted to walk home from Vons. I first had to talk to Amy about hitting and saying sorry, then I grabbed Amy and chased Godmother on foot through a Vons parking lot so Amy could say sorry. 

Godmother said to Amy she wanted nothing to do with her, she was a hateful child, she was not like other children, she was mean, and Godmother doesn't need us to take her shopping. Amy was crying at this point. I got really angry and shouted ""She's 2 years old! You are an adult! You are hurting Amy's feelings right now for something all 2 year olds do. You don't need us? Fine, me and my hateful child don't need to waste our Saturdays with you anyways."" And I walked away. 

I eventually drove her home because 1/4th mile later she had fallen down on the sidewalk (I was watching her). I forced her into my car, dropped her off and told her she never had to see either of us again.

Not a terribly unusual problem, and I know it's not too uncommon for people to stay in the closet for financial reasons. My family and I get along well enough, but I wouldn't describe us as particularly close either.

Here's my predicament. I'm about to start graduate school in the fall, and I've spent the past few months getting a budget together for how much I'm going to need to cover my tuition and living expenses. The total I have for the next three years isn't terrible, particularly considering that I don't have undergrad debt, but it's still an amount that I would appreciate help paying off. My parents and I have talked a little bit about all of this, but no solid numbers were ever put forward about how much they would help me financially.

I want to be clear that I NEVER told them that I expected help, not that they ""needed"" to give me any amount. I was totally prepared to take on whatever loan burden I needed to, if they wanted to help me or not. I simply presented a budget with my projected costs and living expenses, and told them I would just appreciate as much help as they felt able/comfortable giving. With both of them having jobs and nearly being able to pay off their house (within a couple of years), my family said they would be willing to cover a significant portion of my loans once I finish my education. I was expecting a little help with living expenses, but they are now offering to cover that and then a decently generous amount beyond that. Their idea is for me to take the next three years out in loans (including tuition/fees and living expenses), and once I graduate, they will help me pay off the loans.

 I was planning on coming out to them soon-ish, in the interest of transparency and not having to worry about it anymore, but now I don't know if I should. While I can't claim to *know* how they would react, I think it's a safe bet to say this will at least bring a wedge into our relationship. I don't want to risk losing the money that they are more or less offering, and so I'm considering waiting until they help pay off, or at least contribute to paying off, my student loans before telling them I'm gay.

I'm feeling kind of torn. On the one hand, I feel like they would be shitty parents/people to renege on help they offered just because I'm gay, and that this is a ""them"" and not a ""me"" problem. Basically, if they want to be homophobic, I don't have to care how upset they might be about this situation when it's over and done with. On the other hand, I feel like I'm being a little manipulative by purposefully withholding information that would affect a financial arrangement like this.

After a lot of struggles, including a relapse, I reached a year clean and reached out to my family. They tentatively agreed to establish contact with me and now call me semi regularly to check up on me. 

Since getting a pretty decent job a few months ago, I finally felt financially stable enough to afford a car. 

Last week after leaving work, I felt spontaneous and decided to go on a road trip out of the city since I had a few days off coming up. 

I rented a hotel room, grabbed my dog, and spent a couple days hiking and spending time in nature by myself. I turned my phone off as well because when I go hiking I like to really disconnect and I wanted to spend the entire weekend disconnected from the internet and just be with my own thoughts and my dog. I find this has been really beneficial to my sobriety. 

I didn’t even think of telling anyone as I live alone and am a fully grown adult, so why should I have to? 

When I finally turned my phone on, on my way home, I received hundreds of text messages and calls from both my parents and my older sister. 

They started out with just a request to call them back but then went on with being concerned about my whereabouts, to saying things like “We are worried and we don’t care if you relapsed, we just want to know that you are okay.” To phone messages from my sister crying that she is worried about me. 

When I got home I called all of them and explained where I was and what I was doing but they were so upset with me and started yelling that I caused them so much pain and that I should tell them where I’m going before I do these things and that they all thought I was dead somewhere. They said it reminded them of when I was using and would disappear for weeks on end. 

I told them that while I get they were worried, I am also an adult and I shouldn’t have to tell them my every move, especially when I’ve been clean and responsible. 

They continued to get upset with me and when I called my sister she straight up called me an asshole and said that she thought my mom was going to have a heart attack worrying about where I was. She said that there are different rules for “people like me”.

My brother and I are best buds, but I do NOT have a relationship with my sister because she's a really terrible person. She thinks her tirades against people with other religious beliefs, life choices, and diets (yes, really) are okay and acceptable, and will dismiss you if you ask she not do that.

We have never had a good relationship. For the record I don't have a relationship with most of my family for the dysfunction and maybe-borderline abuse, the exception being my little brother.

He didn't even have to be doing anything for her to start in on him; his mistake would have been as simple as going in the kitchen for a snack and she bitched to him how he should eat something healthy that she approves of. After a couple of days of this shit she asked me why I don't initiate conversation with her... IMMEDIATELY after insulting our brother on something just as ridiculous. I couldn't stay quiet and told her it was because I didn't like her and her constant barrage of insults. I didn't say anything more insulting than ""Because I DON'T LIKE YOU"" because I went outside to rake leaves immediately after I said it so I wouldn't say anything harsher/start screaming.

Well, me telling her ""I don't like you"" caused her to have a breakdown. I got this information from my dad right before ending my visit. He went outside to speak with me right before I got in the car so he could tell me I ""have some SERIOUS issues"" because she cried about it. He said that my sister suffers from insecurity and that she was hurt I don't ever talk to her or offer guidance about how I made my own way in the world. I brought up her constant insults towards our brother; he said ""that's how she shows affection!"" We parted after he ordered me to go get some therapy.
It's now April and I haven't talked to anyone in the family since then except for my brother. On one hand it's been a relief not to speak with them, but on the other hand this is an issue because you're not supposed to have a bad relationship with your family. I know I could have tried approaching her in a more constructive manner but didn't. I'm also not sorry for it either, but don't know if I should be. Am I the asshole?",29,50,0.88
1792,Asshole,"My daughter is 17 and still lives at home. Her best friend has an anti-vaxx mom.

I have let our daughters be around each other from a young age despite protest from my husband, but in light of everything that’s been happening with preventable diseases coming back, I want to keep my daughter healthy and safe. My daughter’s friend has said that when she’s 18 (in 5 months) she’ll get all her vaccines herself. AITA for banning my daughter from seeing her until she gets her vaccines? She can still call, text, and communicate with her, but is not allowed to see her in person. My daughter is understandably upset because it means that she’ll miss her best friend’s graduation (daughter is homeschooled, friend goes to public) and their last summer together before leaving for college.

1793,Not the A-hole,"I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years so we often talk about marriage and children. I have an Italian last name and I’m very proud of it and where it comes from, and just the heritage it holds. But, my boyfriend on the other hand has a hyphenated last name he isn’t fond of. It causes problems because some credit cards are hyphenated and some aren’t but on his license it is. Booking reservations they go by your legal last name but he so used to using one last name that’s what the reservation is under and it has caused problems for us. He is getting one last name dropped, but honestly I like my last name better and would like to keep it if/when we get married.

I’ve told my coworker and she ripped me a new asshole pretty much because I’m proud of my Italian last name but the ""Italian tradition"" is to always take the guys last name. So how could I be proud but not follow tradition? I just rolled my eyes. My boyfriend could give to shits if I changed my last name or not but he gives two shits because he doesn’t want him child to have a hyphenated name because he first hand knows how complicated it is. I respect how he feels but he laughs in my face because he said his child will have only have one last name; his.

Sarge is an affectionate dog in his own way. He doesn't like being hugged, and typically will leave the room after he gets his quota of scritches. He prefers not to sleep in anyone's room, opting for the family room which is a bit more spacious and has a view out the front window. 

My roommate has mentioned (bragged?) That Sarge spent the whole night in bed with him on a couple occasions, however that only happens when he closes the door behind Sarge, not giving him the opportunity to leave. I've already told him that this bothers me, and that if Sarge wanted to spend the night in your room that would be fine as long as you left your door open. Sarge doesn't spend the night in his room If the door is left open.

To the best of my knowledge my roommate no longer closes Sarge in overnight, but he still will keep him in his room like that for an hour or two at a time, and it bothers me. Am I just being jealous or am I justified in telling him to give my dog the option to leave?",22,68,0.92

For the wedding, she’s having her dress custom made. She wants to lose “at least 10 pounds” in a month before she sends off her measurements. She is now going on a crazy diet, eating only 800 calories a day, exercising like mad, and it worries me.

Now I've also been searching for a job, but I wasn't really expecting to find as great of an opportunity as I did so quickly. I am leaving a job that wasn't going to interfere with my plans to babysit. I applied for this job I didnt really think I'd get less than a week ago and was offered the job yesterday. I then texted my family member to let them know that unfortunately I wont be able to babysit anymore due to being offered this job.

1798,Not the A-hole,"Every year, the HR department for my company (mid-size software company) puts on an Easter egg hunt for the employees.  Most eggs are filled with candy, but as some of the eggs can contain cash (one egg with $50, a few with $5 or $1) or vouchers for time off, people tend to take it very seriously.

Here’s how the hunt works - there’s a strip of grass that runs between the employee parking lot and a major road.  There’s some generic office-park style landscaping on this strip - hedges, small trees, bushes.  HR hides several hundred small plastic eggs, most in plain sight and easily grabbed.  The employees wait at a designated spot, and when given the green light everyone runs for the eggs.

Unfortunately, I was busy this afternoon so couldn’t participate.  However, since my office window looks over the egg hunt site, I thought it would be cute to video the hunt for HR to use in future promos (since they put a lot of work into it).  I prepped my phone, got a good angle, and waited until I saw people moving to start filming.

I hit the video button when I saw movement, but what I realized I was seeing was a woman who had been hanging out between two employee cars with a plastic bag go shooting out into the hunt site and start wildly stuffing eggs into her bag (another girl appears in the frame as well, not sure if she was hiding between cars too).  The video shows a solid 30 seconds of them taking maybe 70% of the eggs.  Then, a wave of other employees (coming from the official start location) comes into frame. The rest of the eggs are gone in seconds, with most employees visibly disappointed not to find a single egg.

So, WIBTA if I sent the video to HR as originally planned?  I don’t want to call out the cheating, but they’ll likely see it in the video if they watch it.  I’d just say, as originally planned, “Hey, I took a video of the egg hunt and thought you guys might want to use for promo material or something.”

One compounding factor - I don’t know the woman personally, but I do know she works in a department notorious for low pay ($15 an hour) and boring work - basically just outbound calling from a list all day.   So, I have sympathy.  But, I also know it meant other people on her team probably didn’t get any eggs.

1799,Everyone Sucks,"We're both 20 and been together for little over a year. We actually had our anniversary 3 weeks ago and (I thought) all was good, we live together.

So today she snooped through my phone. I was sleeping and I woke up to her using me phone, no biggie. But when I dozed off and woke up again like 15 minutes later she was still on my phone and I asked her what she was doing. She straight up told me that she was going through my phone to see if I had anything to hide. I got mad and told her to stop but she didn't and locked herself in the bathroom. She came out maybe 10 minutes later and said everything was fine. I told her it wasn't, and that this was not okay and she got mad at me and we got into an argument and she called me a jerk.

Now about 2 months ago I made a mistake. I was at a party and got almost blackout drunk, and I ended up making out with another girl. I felt an extreme amount of guilt and shame, and I went home straight after it happened and told my girlfriend. I didn't use the alcohol as an excuse, I'm just mentioning it because it did play a role. I told her that it was completely my fault and that I would understand and respect it if she wanted to break up, but that I would do everything to make things right with her if she decided to stay with me. Thank god she did, and I thought we were doing better already. I don't drink anymore and share everything with my girlfriend. We have an open phone policy but only if we need to use it real quick or something, not to investigate and go through my entire phone to find proof of me cheating.

1800,No A-holes here,"For background, I live in a state that recently legalized medical marijuana. I have a group of generally pretty close friends that I hang out with pretty often, and they all smoke a metric fuckton of weed. One friend, Gavin, has a medical card for weed, but everyone else just goes for it and banks on the fact that technically no one can ask if you have a medical card. I used to be a fairly big smoker too, but I quit almost five months ago because I have to think about my professional future. The industry that I am planning on going into requires regular drug tests, some of which being hair tests, which can pick up secondhand smoke.

Once I quit smoking, I asked my friends if maybe they could use a smoke buddy or turn on a fan to get better ventilation in the room while we were playing board games together so I didn’t have to deal with their secondhand smoke. They were cool about it, which I appreciate because the smoke and smell were genuinely bothering me at that point. A few months later though, they’re back to just blowing their smoke everywhere, sometimes even into my face. I’ve tried to kindly ask if they could either not smoke for the little bit of time that I spend with them now, or go out on the balcony, or even use a smoke buddy, but the last time I brought this up, my friend Crystal, who does not have a medical card, snapped at me about how I was being a douche and that weed is her medicine. I got mad at this because her medicine can affect my chances at getting a job in my field. I’m not taking anything away, I’m just asking to not have to be around smoke constantly when I want to hang out with my friends. I left and have not been back since. I think that the only thing I can do at this point is tell my friends that I can’t hang out with them anymore, just to put my own anxiety about secondhand smoke showing up on drug tests at ease.

1801,Not the A-hole,"A bit of backstory: I live with my boyfriend and we have been together for almost 3 years. He’s seen me at my best and my worst and everything in-between.

I have known my best friends for 5+ years, we’ve always been there for each other even with our rough patches that we go through. They are seniors in high school and I am a fresh graduate, so we don’t get any chances to see each other outside of going to each other’s houses. With these friends I have had many frustrating low points which I openly explain to my boyfriend about, however, I never hold a grudge against them.

Living with my boyfriend, I am happy and comfortable but he will never allow my friends to come over unless he is out because he doesn’t want to hear “girl talk”. This would be perfectly okay if he had anywhere to stay when I wanted to see my friends; I don’t want to boot him out of his own home. So genius me thought that asking if I should go visit them was a good idea. 
It went something like this:

Me- Hey I want to hang out with (friend) next Saturday, it’ll be at her place so you could stay home and play video games and eat pizza if you want!

Bf- Do you really think that’s a good idea, after all she’s done to you?

Me- she’s not an asshole for doing some things like that, we just fight sometimes and it’s okay. I just miss hanging out with her.

Bf- What, am I not good enough for you? Do you really need someone else in your life that badly that you can’t stay here and be happy?

Me- It’s not like that trust me, you make me the happiest I’ve ever been! Why would you think that you’re not enough?

He went to our bedroom and didn’t speak to me for a few hours.
I went to my friends house, had a great time yet he still resents that I chose to stay over with her. Am I the asshole for staying with my friend?

UPDATE: I spoke with my boyfriend about his manipulation. At first he got defensive and didn’t want to accept that he was being manipulative, he told me he doesn’t like my friends because of how I let them roast my relationship and I apparently let one of them think he was an abuser. I told him that it’s not about wether or not he likes my friends and that he needs to stop or we weren’t going anywhere. He just looked at me and sighed, “Do I really do that to you? Am I a monster to you?” I told him he’s not a monster but he needs to fix this. He nearly broke down and I’ve never seen this man so broken up about himself. He kept his distance from me and said, “I’m so sorry, I won’t do that to you again. Please forgive me.” I paused, and then I did. And to extra make up for it, he made my favorite meal and we watched YouTube videos for the rest of the night. Happy end!

1802,Not the A-hole,"Pretty straightforward. 

I’ve tried both the hormonal spiral and the regular pill, but both had more than undesirable effects on my physical and mental health. The only thing that I *might* consider trying is the implant in the arm, but I am not in a rush and will make that decision when I feel like it. (Or never)

I use condoms. I had sex when I was on the pill and used condoms most of the time as well (I’m concerned about STDs and pregnancy - safe sex is very important to me). I say most, because there were some drunk occasions with my ex-partner where we didn’t use one, but since I was on the pill it was fine. 

To be honest, I didn’t feel a difference *at all*.

However, I’ve recently started seeing a guy and when we had sex, we used condoms. He started bringing it up more and more often that he wants to do it without a condom - and that I should start taking the pill or some other form of hormonal birth control. 

His reasoning is that it feels a lot better for him and the condom is like a penis-prison (he said this jokingly, but meant that it’s restrictive and he feels a lot less). 

I believe that guys can feel the difference, I’ll even believe that it’s a huge difference. 

The thing is - I don’t feel the difference at all. My only incentive to have sex without a condom is so that the guy feels better, which in itself is not a bad thing, but I’m not willing to alter my body for it. 

I’ve tried several methods and each time my depression got *a lot* worse, my hair started falling out, I gained weight from nothing and I had bad pain. 

He reasons that it takes some women many tries to find the one pill/method that works good for them and encourages me to try - but I don’t want to. It’s as simple as that. 

As mentioned above, if I do have a long-term partner I might someday consider the implant, but that’s far in the future. 

He also gets pretty annoyed that I don’t blow him often enough, but he barely goes down on me. This is something that we’re communicating now though and it’s getting better. (I’m all for fair oral sex - it should be roughly the same amount of giving and receiving)

AITA? He does have a point that it takes many women a few tries to find the right BC, my gynecologist said the same. Am I being selfish for not wanting to try any more methods right now?",402,495,0.94

1804,Not the A-hole,"I feel like such a moron here, I don't even know how to really begin. I feel like I'm a smart woman, swore up and down I would never get myself in such a situation and would never put another woman through this. But here I am. 

For some background, I am 23f in my first year of grad school and doing a paid internship in my field. In February a sub-con (Richard) came in and literally charmed the pants off me (I mean literally). He's 15 years older and basically hit all my buttons. Within a week of meeting him he took me on a trip to Hawaii (it was a business trip for him), he bought me an insane amount of gifts and I was between living situations he set me up in a nice hotel for a month hotel with all expenses paid (also had to do with his business) and I was on cloud nine. He paid for damage deposit and first month's rent on my new apartment 

What was really happening is I was a moron and blinded to the glaring fucking red flags that he gave me. He would disappear without contact for days and up to a week at a time, the only number he gave me was a google voice number. He could only sleep over on Tuesdays and I never saw where he lived and he lied about not having social media. I never even thought to check. 

Maybe 2 weeks ago a friend and I went to the movies. I saw Richard and what turned out to be his gorgeous wife and even more gorgeous two kids. I was stunned and wanted to faint. He absolutely saw me but I apparently am so easily manipulated by him he essentially told me with his eyes ""be cool and don't make a scene"" and I didn't. I left and have been crying my eyes out essentially non stop for the last two weeks, for me and for his family. I never wanted to be this person but here I am. 

I finally looked him up on facebook and sure enough that was his family, he posted ""happy"" pictures at his kids swim meets and on dates with his wife while I was in the hotel room he was paying for. The level of deception is insane. 

I know I have to tell his wife, but would I be a raging asshole if, as opposed to just saying ""I'm so sorry, I had an affair with your husband,"" I basically laid out a list of everything he did for me; the trips, the gifts, the hotels and on and on? 

Or is that too much and I need to allow her the space to process the information and extent of his affair in her own time?

Edit: I just called his wife and told her that I needed to her and told her my name, not what I was calling about. She just called me a whore and hung up. Now what? I can’t believe I got myself into this. I’m devastated, I can’t even imagine what my parents would say if the ever sound out about this. I’m so ashamed.

Edit 2: lots of people telling me to break it off with him, just to be clear I hadn't seen him since weekend before movie. The night of the movie, he ghosted me. Deleted his google voice, didn't answer an email I sent asking for an explanation. It's over with him and it would be even if he hadn't ghosted me.",364,2353,0.96

1808,Asshole,"This is another warning, this is pretty graphic and very NSFW. This is a throwaway and my GF doesn’t use reddit so I don’t feel I’m exposing anything about our lives

So we’ve been together for about a year and a half. She’s great and we get along well and our sex life is decent. I’m just gonna jump into the meat of it.

Early in our relationship, I expressed that I prefer women to be bare. That’s just my preference and she said she preferred just keeping herself trimmed down there. Sometimes she goes a while without shaving her legs or pits too but whatever, it isn’t a super big deal because she still keeps it neat but I’m not super into it. 

(I’ve never told her to do anything, I get that it’s her body and choice, I just told her my preference)

Anyways over the past month we started experimenting with anal. I’ve kinda noticed she has hair in her ass (I don’t know how to put it gentler) while we were doing regular doggy and it was kind of a turn off but I just ignored it.

But now that we’ve been experimenting with anal, it’s a lot more noticeable because I’m interacting with that whole area. She has dark and long hair on her head and it looks the same down there (sorry). Just really gross to me. Her area is kind of discolored too which is really unappealing but I wouldn’t ask her to bleach, it’s just a really disappointing experience with anal. (She’s clean, it just doesn’t look great)

Anyways I asked her if she could shave it at least before we do anal. We don’t plan anal really but we imply it while we‘re getting heated. I told her the hair there is a turn off for me and I just don’t find it attractive. It’s gross.

She looked at me all hurt like I asked her to kill her cat. She said “Ummmm” and she was blushing so I think she got embarrassed. Then she got really offended and defensive and asked me why I even have sex with her if I find her unattractive, that life wasn’t like porn, that if she never shaved to begin with then I should’ve just kept it to myself. I was shocked and told her that I didn’t find HER unattractive, just the pubic hair, and she told me assholes weren’t supposed to be pretty and that I was acting really immature.

So we had kind of a fight about it that really derailed. I don’t think I did anything wrong. But she seems really different now, she doesn’t like when I compliment her, she scowls at me, she doesn’t want to have sex anymore when I initiate. She’s just acting really bitchy ever since.

I really appreciated everybody’s responses to my previous post. It really helped me gain perspective and made me feel better about my choice to put myself first in this situation. 

I don’t know why, but I just wanted to share with people that Jack has since passed away since my last post. 

I found out the week after I ran into him through Facebook. We went to the same high school so I guess I ended up being Facebook friends with a lot of his old friends and when I logged on to my Facebook, the first post I saw was somebody sharing his funeral notice on Facebook talking about how the opioid crisis has “taken another victim” and how they were friends in high school. 

I’m not really surprised that this happened to him but I’m still sad about it. I don’t think Jack was a bad guy, just didn’t know how to get away from that life. He didn’t have anybody, I still had a friend willing to help me. 

I feel bad that I couldn’t help him after he saved my life but I talked to both my therapist and sponsor who walked me through these emotions and helped me process that it’s not my fault Jack overdosed and couldn’t get clean. 

I know that it’s not my fault but I still feel bad. He was the only person I could trust for a long time during the hardest moment of my life. 

A memorial service was held for him but I couldn’t bring myself to go. 

I guess I just wanted to tell people that he wasn’t a bad person. Just dealing with a bad thing.

1810,Not the A-hole,"Went to my grandfather's (mother's father) funeral last Friday in my hometown. When the funeral and everything was done me, my three brothers and our mom decided that we should get together at my oldest brother's house and have dinner and hang out together since it was so long ago that we last met (I live 11 hours away from the hometown and my family almost never meet with each other if I'm not home). Before the dinner me and my younger brother and my five year older brother (M) drive to M:s house to chill out a bit. Me and my younger brother sits down and starts talking about grandpa and memories and stuff that we have of him growing up, while our older brother M is just sitting in a chair with his phone in his hand. During the whole conversation M keeps interrupting just to show pictures of a girl he just met three days earlier and just go on and on about how amazing she is and won't stop talking about her. He then proceeds popping the question if he should bring her to the dinner at my oldest brother's house in a few hours. Both me and my younger brother then tries to convince him that it's probably not the best idea since all of us there probably will be a bit gloomy, especially mom since she just lost her father, but that it would be nice to meet her in another setting. He then tries to convince us that it's a good idea by making some ridiculous arguments but after a while we manage to change his mind.

A few hours later we arrive at our oldest brother's house and his wife and children, our mom and her husband is there also. We have a lovely time even though we just put grandpa in the ground. It was great seeing the family together since it was long ago I last met them. After an hour M whispers to me that he's going to drive and pick up the tinder date and bring her to the dinner. I tell him I think it's a idiotic idea but he's a grown man so he can make his own decisions. This girl then later arrives, fully aware of the situation but still decides to come, when the dinner is ready and we all sit down to eat. She gets seated next to our mother and M. Seeing my mother trying to acquaint with this new girl while holding her tears back, since just loosing her father, made me super furious. I got even more irritated seeing M all cheerio and wanting to make a good impression of our family to new girl by making some shitty jokes and being some kind of an alpha-type character. I continue to get more and more irritated during the dinner but tried not to visibly show my frustration. I replied to questions very short and did not show any interest in chit chatting with neither new girl or M for the rest of the night. I took the early train the next day and now I'm considering about calling M and tell him how I feel about his idiocy.

Her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200B;

In my opinion I think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. At least until yesterday. A email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". These requirements were a joke. Some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the ""gift requirements"". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with ""Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200B;

This is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. I called my mom to make sure this was not a late April fools joke and it was real. I told her that I won't be going because of this. That was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that I'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:. My parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. My parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but I still think that all of these rules are a joke.

Would I be an ass if I skipped out on the wedding?",2953,17067,0.92

1820,No A-holes here,"So me and this guy were friends during university. We were in the same social group, were on the same course. We even ended up living together with a few others in our 3rd year. We fell out of touch not long after university, but I still remain in touch with a few friends and we would remain roughly updated on each other's lives.

A few months ago, out of the blue I get a text from this guy (got my number from another friend form uni) and wanted my address to send out wedding invitations. Naturally, I congratulated him and had a short back and forth about how he was doing, etc.

Once the invitation came through the letterbox, i swiftly replied with a confirmation of attendance.

&#x200B;

However, and this was rather foolish of me, I didn't properly check out the location. I presumed it'd be relatively easy to get to. But this was not the case. It would have been a full day of travel before even getting to the wedding, and the cost of the hotels and travel would not be cheap either.

I could get around this however, by arranging a twin room with one of our mutual friends. All in all I reckon I'd be spending at least £300, probably £400. But I did not let this put me off. After all he was a good friend at uni, and he is the first of us to get married. Also a good excuse to meet up with old classmates.

But events have transpired to make this more and more difficult. The friend I would be rooming with at the hotel got a gf and said he intended to go with her. This put the costs up to at least £500, probably closer to £700. On top of this I got a place on my Masters course which I have been saving for the past year.

&#x200B;

It was still within the window of returning attendance letters, so I emailed and cancelled my attendance. He was understanding and congratulated me on getting onto my Masters course.

Regardless, I still feel like a bit of an arsehole.",24,45,0.87

1822,Not the A-hole,"So my roommate ( we are both girls) throughout the year has brought guys over in the middle of the night to have sex with them, I wouldn't have an issue with that if our beds weren't ten feet away from each other and in the same room. So we've talked about this before and I've told her to not bring over guys anymore, or to at least tell me beforehand because her sucking dick ten feet away from me at 3 am make me uncomfortable and unable to sleep. She did stop, however, until recently.

&#x200B;

She has a boyfriend, first time this year and she started spending the nights at his place, which I didn't care at all cause it wasn't my problem. However, yesterday morning I was woken up at 4 am by loud snoring, like louder than I have ever heard before. Turns out she brought her boyfriend over in the middle of the night. I was upset but understanding deciding I would talk to her later about it, I was not, however, able to get back to sleep.

&#x200B;

So I politely talked with her about it, asking her not to bring him over as his snoring prevented me from sleeping, and she explained she only did som because his roommate's girlfriend was moving in and the two of them were arguing and he couldn't sleep. I tried to be understanding but politely asked her not to bring him over. Cue this morning

&#x200B;

I am startled away at 5 am by a particularly loud snore and I am livid because I immediately knew what happened. So I just got done a half-hour ago telling my roommate to no bring him over or ""I would kick him out myself"", she explained once again it was his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend arguing again to which I said ""Well since she doesn't live there he can just kick her out of the room and be done with it.""

My roommate seems upset with me and I feel bad, I hate the fact that his snoring renders me unable to get a good nights sleep but, I mean, he is her boyfriend?

1823,Not the A-hole,"I (33M) work at a college. One of the higher-ups (let's call her Mommy) has hated me since I was a student at that same college and she keeps trying to find a reason to fire me. She constantly interrupts my classes, talks shit about me to her students during her own classes, talks trash about my exams, my teaching abilities, the success of my students, and worst of all, she lies about me to the chair of the department. In fact, it's been so bad that I've been applying to positions elsewhere and I have a chance of getting a job at another college in a few months, because I fucking hate waking up every morning knowing I'll have to deal with her.

I also recently met her son (30M, Sonny) through Grindr. We had several ""casual meetings"" and by our third ""date"", he shared just enough of his life for me to realize who he was. In fact, he started telling me about Mommy and apparently, he hates Mommy more than Mommy hates me. So, I felt encouraged to tell him I know her and we spent hours talking about all the ways she's treated us like garbage. The worst thing she did was kick him out when he was 17 for being gay and then beg him to come back and pretend she loves him (while making his life hell) because his grandmother threatened to cut her out of the will.

The thing is, Sonny and I kind of get along, but we're not really each other's type. We both agreed on that. Like, the sex is good, but the rest is meh, we have nothing in common. However, Sonny had this idea to pretend we're an actual couple just to spite her, and I like it. Sonny's birthday is coming up and he is having a barbecue with his friends and family. So he wants me to come so that we can giggle and hold hands and kiss in front of Mommy.

I told my girlfriends about it like ""ha ha, listen to this funny story"" and they were all appalled. They said I was an asshole, a pervert, petty (I agree that I am petty) and that I have ""no moral compass"". They said they'd be very very very disappointed in me if I went through with it and to ""think of the rest of his family"". They've also been ignoring me on Messenger since last night lol.

I honestly don't think it's *that* serious. I don't expect Mommy to get a heart-attack and drop dead or something, I only expect her to fume and feel humiliated while not being able to react in front of grandma. AITA because of it?

**Edit: One of my girlfriends finally replied to my messages and I very clearly explained to her that both Sonny and I are in on it and that Mommy deserves even worse things. She said she misunderstood and thought I was using him, and her interpretation was confirmed by the other two girls freaking out and not letting me finish. Also, apparently, one of the other two called me all kinds of names behind my back (gay slurs mostly) because she was bothered by me having sex with someone I'm not in a relationship with, lol. If she heard what kind of stuff I did when I was younger, she'd have to wash her ears with holy water. Anyway, the friend that reached out thinks I'm NTA, so yay for that.**",444,2341,0.97

1829,Not the A-hole,"Title is a bit confusing, so stick with me. On mobile, so apologies for formatting.

I make pet portraits. I had a client ask for 5 pieces. 4 contained a single pet each, and 1 contained all four pets together. This commission was finished months ago, but I had still not received payment ($45), so I never sent them the high resolution, watermark-free versions of my work.

This morning I woke up to find that they had removed both watermark and signature of the group portrait of my piece, and posted it as 'fan art' and made this their new profile picture. Needless to say... I was livid.

I contacted them, demanding payment. I posted a public comment on their post explaining how unhappy I was with the situation, and I posted in my story what had happened for my followers to see. For 6-7 hours I do not get a response.

When I do, they have removed the profile picture, and removed my public comments (some of my followers commented too, those were also removed). They said they will pay today, and post a public apology. I will only remove my story after these terms have been fulfilled. I don't trust them.

They have multiple people running their page, and the one in charge of the profile picture has been spoken to by the original creator of that page. I have since seen the public apology, but have not yet received payment (its only been half an hour-an hour).

So my question is, WIBTA if I still fill in a copyright infringement form? I will write in the notes section that the problem was resolved between the page and I, but I still find that this form was required considering what had happened. But I'm not sure. Some people tell me to report it, others tell me not to. What do you guys think?

Edit and update: they have blamed me for a falling out in their family and followers. They believed that I said I would make one free commission, and 4 paid commissions. This was not the agreement. I was (and agreed upon) going to give a discount, which ended up totalling at one free piece. The discount would only be in effect if they paid for all 5 pieces together. They have since refused to pay me, and demand I remove all posts about them from my story. I refuse to remove my posts, as they have posted a claim that I was going to give them a free portrait, and have purposely neglected to include the commission work for the other 4 pieces involved in this situation, thus pushing the blame onto me.

I posted an update to my followers to make it clear how our agreement was made, it is very clear that the free portrait was included in the price of the other four. I have received two threats, one of which is a death threat, thus supporting my claim to post my defense argument. I was informed that some of my followers sent my client hate and threats, so I posted a story (this entire thing was only in my story), telling my followers that such behavior is unacceptable and unprofessional.",42,145,0.96

She constantly ignored dogs in recovery (they’d be intubated and sitting upright and she still hadn’t pulled their tubes), she would leave exposed needles right next to patients, she couldn’t restrain dogs and constantly allowed us to almost be bit whole refusing any suggestions, she was way too rough with sleeping animals, she’d try drawing blood and bruise a dog’s entire leg because she couldn’t find the vein.... the last straw was a few weeks ago. She fell asleep in recovery, while she was alone at the end of the day, and the dog died. It was a super high risk situation, but still. She was asleep when it died. She woke up and it was in rigor mortis. She STILL TRIED CPR even though it was stiff.  Ugh. That still disgusts me. She has at least 4 concerned employee reports filed on her from me specifically, and I know at least 2 other employees have put in several. She failed out of tech school while working at our clinic. I cannot believe she hadn’t been fired during the 1ish year she’d been there. 

So then she just up and quits. And she’s going to work at another clinic as a vet tech. She is NOT a registered vet tech. They hired her at vet tech wages and with the job title vet tech. This means she can euthanize, anesthetize, the works. She’s incredibly dangerous to have in a clinical setting and I honestly want to call them and tell them how terrible of an employee she was. I think she needs to be in an entirely different field.

Edit: I feel I should clarify that in my state, you do not have to be a registered vet tech to be hired as a vet tech, although in most states you do; most facilities in my state won’t hire someone as a tech unless they are an RVT but it’s not legally required. That being said, most clinics won’t hire someone as a tech unless they are an RVT. My clinic, and this other clinic, just so happens to be some those that don’t require them to be RVTs.

In December, I took leave again for the holidays and flew down to Tiffany’s because my mom was already there so I figured I could be with almost my entire family over Christmas. Tiffany was an absolute wreck but I tried to be a strong brother for her and it was nice seeing her boys again. Andrew also flew down. It was a decent trip and Tiffany said my presence there really helped.

1841,Asshole,"So, background: where I live we have a trash tax for all homeowners. The city then provides you with a garbage can (which, technically still belongs to the city) and collects the garbage weekly. Because of the width of the can vs the trash bags we all use (grocery store bags) , there is some extra unfilled space.

A while ago I was having a conversation with a friend and it came out that when I walk my dog, I will throw away the dog shit I picked up in the first garbage can I come across. I do this for a couple reasons and have never thought twice about it. Additionally I don't care if people throw things away in my garbage. It's garbage, not the family treasures. My friend, however, was horrified. She told me this was tantamount to stealing. I was shocked and argued it was in no way. First off, using their garbage for small bags while I'm out for a walk in no way gets me out of paying for my own trash removal. Additionally, it doesn't in any way prevent them from using their garbage can to the fullest extent that they always have (can diameter-bag width=lots of empty space). She saw my point and I felt justified.

Fast-forward a bit and I am living in a neighborhood that sits right between the student center and some trendy bars. My neighbors are pissed because the students use their trash cans to throw away beer cans and 711 hotdog papers on their way to and from the bars.

Now they spend every Sunday picking trash up from their front lawns (and I'm sitting over here like 'wtf did you think was gonna happen?')

Last weekend, I posted a trampoline for $75 on Facebook marketplace. It was in great shape with the safety net included. I got an offer for $50 and took it just to get it out of my yard. 

My partner and I had the trampoline mostly taken apart by the time the man arrived. He asked if we had all components and springs to which we said yes. All of the pieces were there and intact before we took it apart. We offered to count the springs out for him, but he seemed in a hurry and just started boarding everything into his truck. I checked the yard for any missing pieces before he left. 

Today I got a message from the buyer saying, “You didn’t tell me there was a missing spring.” I messaged back that all of the springs should be there, but that I’d check the yard. I looked around for it and couldn’t find it. My yard is very small so I would be able to spot it easily if it were here. 

I messaged that I couldn’t find the spring. I explained that everything was there before we took the trampoline apart and asked did he double-check his truck bed & the box? He replies back that I was dishonest about the sell & he’s driving down to get his money back. I sent, “I’m sorry, but I will not be doing that. All pieces were there when we took it apart. I even offered to count the springs for you. You had every chance to check and/or back out of the sale.” 

Well, now he’s pissed. He’s demanding I give the money back and soiling my name on local Facebook groups. I don’t want to refund him because I feel like he may have lost the piece on his own. AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the perspective Reddit! I've decided against giving money back and I will NOT be buying a replacement. He got $25 knocked off listing price so he can easily buy one for $3 as some of you pointed out. I don't have any intentions on selling through marketplace again after this ordeal.",142,1265,0.98

1844,Not the A-hole,"I was asked by my roommate's sister to make Japanese pork katsu for a game of thrones viewing party. She specifically asked if my gf could make it because she is Japanese. 

Come Sunday, we couldn't find the right ingredients so we went to an Asian market. Couldn't find it there so we went to a Japanese market. My roommates sister stated that there would be 5 of us in total. We were pretty much in charge of all the food. They were literally not going to contribute because the sister can't cook and neither can her bf. They did however buy the pork loin She literally has served hard, undercooked rice and thinks it's okay... the girl is Vietnamese so idk how she can't tell the difference.

My gf and I decide to make it a meal and make a small salad and miso soup for everyone. The other guest she invited canceled so it was just the four of us. My roommate's sister, her bf, my gf and me. My roommate is out of the country but I'm not sure if I should talk to her about this when she gets back.

I remember seeing her bf have some of the miso soup, and finishing it. I don't remember if she finished hers. I enjoyed the soup and had multiple servings. 

Earlier that day she asks that we just split up the cost of everything. Apparently the price of the meat was $8. My gf and I spent about $36 so $9 a person. 
I texted this to the sister and never got a response back. This morning when she comes back from her bf's place she says, ""I'm sorry I didn't respond to your text. I don't mean to be rude, but the miso soup was too salty and I couldn't enjoy it. Can you figure out what my bf and I owe you minus the soup."" 

Am I missing something here? I will say that she frequently goes back to the grocery store for refunds after fruits and veggies go bad, or when things expire after she doesn't use them. 

My gf wasn't happy. We just agreed never to cook or share any food with her or her bf.",22,34,0.9
1845,Asshole,"So, a little backstory. 

I have three children, 2 sons and 1 daughter of which the sons being the elder (31 and 29) and my daughter being the youngest (23). 

I am reaching the point of my life where it is time for me to retire and take it easy for the rest of my years on this planet. 

During my prime I got a fairly well paying job and saved almost every penny of it (except for money I used to get my basic necessities, and maybe treat myself a little here and there) and have managed to save around $500,000

My two eldest children are both fairly well off, one of which working as a medical physician and the other owns his own small business. 

My daughter, on the other hand, has been going to university and collected a fair amount of student loans, only partially getting by working as a waitress. 

Around 2 weeks ago I decided to make a will in which I left every penny of my savings, my Vehicle, and my home, to my daughter,believing she would make the most use out of it. 

I gathered my children and wife around the table a short bit later and discussed the contents of will, and immediately felt tension between my two eldest children. But, I decided to let it go.

Yesterday night my two sons told me that they needed to talk to me, and asked if they could come over. I agreed and shorty after they both showed up. 

They immediately let everything off of their shoulders, saying they felt like they mean nothing to me because I decided not to leave them anything after my death. I tried to explain to them the reasoning behind my decisions but they couldn’t care less. Finally, I told them they have no right to tell me how I should leave my possessions after I die and that it was my, and only my, decision as to what happens to my assets, thus causing them both to storm off,get in their cars, and drive off. Since then, neither of them have called or texted me. AITA here?

TD;LR: left a little over $500,000, a vehicle, and ownership of my estate to my youngest daughter because she isn’t as well off as y other two children, and now neither of them wish to speak to me or have anything to do with me.",555,1604,0.95
1846,Not the A-hole,"I have this chill relationship with a friend (F) who has the opposite personality as me. This person tends to tease and make fun, in this case, name calling or insulting. Previously with this person, small things like, “you’re ugly”, “you are not cute”, “shut up, nobody was talking to you”....I tend to let that stuff slide because I know it doesn’t mean anything. 

Today, I was late for an event that I was hosting, and my friend was volunteering aswell. She brought food and coffee, and because I was late, she decided not to give me food and coffee (which makes sense and I completely understood why). While the volunteers were eating before the event started, she continues to insult me whenever I would speak, like “nobody asked” or “nobody was talking to you, shush”. 

My patience wears super thin at this point.

Midway through the event,’it’s a little stressful and obviously I was in “focused mode”. My friend came
Up and asked 
HER: Do you have a laptop for me to use?
ME: No, I don’t
HER: Why are you so useless? 

This is when I snapped. I raised my voice and looked down at her saying “Why the fuck would I have my laptop on me? Even if I did,’I don’t bring my laptop for you. I don’t bring my laptop everyday for you to use either. I don’t know why you’re fucking calling me useless, you’re the one without the fucking laptop” 

I walk away. But then I return minutes later and my friend is ignoring me because said I was rude.

Was I overreacting? AITA? 

tl;dr friend who constantly insults me, I exploded and got mad st her and now she’s giving me silent treatment

EDIT: The reason why I emphasized she was a female, because I’ve described this situation to others. And they’ve always assumed if my friend was a male, it was considered light jokes, but if it was female, others assumed it was just normal teasing and I shouldn’t be sensitive to it. 

Also, I thought it was important to note my friend is a girl because she has had feelings for me in the past

EDIT 2: I’m very introverted and quiet. So many of you are right, I am the friend who’s the “punching bag”. So it is my fault I let her continue tot treat me this way. But yeah, I barley speak up about anything. So I bottled it all.

EDIT 3: Just spoke to my friend about it. She apologized and said I don’t have thick skin to handle jokes. Lmfao done.",85,231,0.97

Before they left us with her, they told us very specifically not to play any ""x-rated"" video games or movies. Now, I'm very lenient on that stuff. My two girls have been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 recently. Before my niece came over, I told my kids NOT to play any violent games while she's here. I thought they were listening to me until I came into their room and they were playing Red Dead Redemption. I was going to put a stop to it until I saw how much fun my niece was having. She was ecstatic. They weren't doing anything violent, just riding around on horses and walking around town.

Jump to today, and I get a strongly worded text from my SIL, saying that she ""googled the game we let her play"" and that she was ""horrified"".

1849,No A-holes here,"Me and my SO adopted an 8 week old Maltese Shitzhu nearly 2 weeks ago. I did a tonne of research and it was mainly my idea to get the puppy, tho my SO loves dogs and was fine with it.

I was so excited, I read about crate training, potty training ect and knew it would be hard work but felt i was ready for it.

Important : i have been diagnosed with GAD (generalised anxiety disorder) aswell as a panic disorder, tho i have been off meds for over a year and panic attack free for nearly as long)

Then we got him and ive cried almost non-stop since, ive had no appetite and stopped eating, im exhausted, ive had at minimum 5 panic attacks per day, horrific dihorea and i honestly did not expect the huge emotional toll this would take on me. My SO has also had stomach problems which he first thought was a stomach bug but now seems to line up with my crippling anxiety.

I am going to the drs tonight to get back on my meds, no matter what i do. But they are the sort of tablets that tend to make my anxiety alot worse before i get better (its not a magic overnight or even week long fix).

I also want to say that the puppy is amazing, he sleeps thro the night now in another room and he is sort of potty trained already (so long aa he gets hourly pee breaks) so this is no way the dogs fault and i honestly love him so much. But i feel like i cant even look after myself atm and my SO works alot because i dont right now so he is doing what he can to help but im the primary carer.

Everyone keeps telling me i can do, that i need to push thro it because it wont be like this forever but i just feel totally at the end of my sanity and rope and idk what to do. Everyday is worse. And from what ive read now (discovered puppyblues) this could last weeks or months or even an entire year. I feel like im failing the puppy who doesnt understand what's going on and im also afraid he will develop anxiety or social problems because of it.

So my partner asked a coworker who is totally into dogs if she or anyone she knows is willing to adopt him and she or her BIL are capabale and very willing, honestly she has been amazing about it all. He would be living with other animals and ppl who are more than capable of taking him out to play in the backyard without sobbing.

My SO and i both thinks its for the best to rehome him and admit we arnt ready and focus on ourselves and maybe try again with an older dog in a few years and that doing it aooner (before puppy gets attaxhed even more..or us for that matter) is better than trying to stick with it a few more weeks, but i cant help feeling like im an asshole and maybe i should just 'buck up' and try harder eapecially with family all telling us (except 1) that we will be fine. Theres also the fact that despite being two weeks, i love the little guy and ita6 going to really hurt to rehome him.

Idk WIBTA if i rehomed him?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your responses, i guess it's clear now that I am not an asshole for doing this. I wish things had been different and im truely dissapointed in myself for not being as mentally healthy as i thought i was. This has been hard to realise that despite all the effort ive put in so far for my mental health, that i am still not at a place i need to be in long term.
But i will use this awful situation (as will my SO) to learn and keep trying to improve and hopefully one day we will try again (as fosters this time!) and it will work out. For now i need to think of the puppy and his wellbeing.",47,60,0.82

She has no social media at all, except a snapchat which she barely uses (she’ll respond if you snap her, but i’ve never seen her post on her story). She seems pretty normal, and frankly I find it really hard to believe that a 21 year old girl in 2019 doesn’t have any social media at all (facebook, insta, etc). She’s also pretty photophobic, I tried to get a picture of her doing something for insta and she refused, saying she doesn’t like people taking pictures of her.

I am worried I’m the “other man” or that she’s hiding for some reason. She claims that social media just makes her feel anxious and paranoid so she doesn’t like to use it. She's not a total luddite and is up to date with pop culture and stuff, so she must be on something. I’ve tried to ask her about it, but she mostly just dodges my lines of inquiry. She laughed it off the first couple of times, but when I did it this time she got annoyed and said i was an insecure asshole for accusing her of lying about her identity and basically told me to fuck off.

1854,,"My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years, married nearly 3. Hes very close to his family and my family is kind of standoffish so I'm a little unsure if my reaction to some issues is just me not understanding close family or not.

We're thinking of moving. The place I love is about an hour and a half from most of his family. We live near them now but there are NO jobs in my field here. None. Zero. Prehaps even negative one. 

I've been searching since October. I graduated with two degrees, a minor, and completed the honors program at my college and maybe had a decent future in store.

Instead I'm stuck in a town with 6 buildings and no jobs.

Every. Single. Time. We get to some agreement about moving to the one town (that is in the middle of two huge cities and perfect for jobs) his family steps in and talks him out of it  and I lose my shit.

I'm seriously thinking this may end in divorce because I'm not about to waste away while he stays in his family's ass.

I appreciated the idea, but it meant another week delaying me from job-hunting, and they also knew I had no savings so there's really not much I'm able to do here outside of walking around town (and it's a small town with very little to do anyway). My aunt and her family are lovely but all of the adults are working the entire time I'm here, and my three cousins are all under 14 and are on school holidays. We have very little in common, and all my attempts at conversations with them just trail off into awkward silences. I've literally spent the last four days babysitting the whole time, walking them to the park or watching cartoons. And taking them out for lunch with the little money I have, since the family basically survives entirely on bread, soda and sliced meats. My stomach is in so much pain from the lack of fiber.

I've got another five-ish days here and I'm honestly just so sick of it already. It feels like my parents used my birthday as an excuse to get me out of the house for a week, which kinda hurts enough as it is, and I'm feeling kind of lonely since the only substantial interaction I'm getting in the day is with my aunt when we're having dinner.

It's been going on for the past 2 years where I started to notice them hanging out in front of my house all the time. They like to ride their bikes, toss around a baseball, or play touch football in the street. 

The issue that I have though is that, quite frankly, they're just annoying. They used to jump all over my hedges when they chase each other around. I've approached them about this once and asked them ""please guys, just don't be jumping over this."" To which they replied ""ok."" Fair enough. Until they keep doing it. To which I approached them another day and said ""guys..."" and immediately they respond ""sorry."" and keep playing. 

Other times they leave trash (bags of chips, water bottles) in my front lawn for, yes, me to find and pretty much clean up. To which I picked up 2 water bottles and approached them with them again, and said ""I don't appreciate this. Clean up after yourselves."" to which they said, again, ""Sorry."" and just continued to hang out and do what they do. 

They're generally loud even into the night, playing football in front of my (and my other neighbors') lawns. WIBTA to ask them ""Could you guys kindly take it somewhere else? Tbh I don't feel comfortable with you guys in front of my house all the time.""

I get that I come off as a ""get off my lawn"" guy, and I was a kid at some point doing what they do too. But quite frankly, it gets annoying that they keep diving onto my lawn 5 feet from my window where I hear them yelling all the time. I can sometimes hear balls being tossed against my garage door or up against my car. Also, these guys are teenagers. I really don't want to approach these people's parents. I would expect that they know better to just be respectful of other people's homes. I honestly don't even know why they don't just play in front of one of the other kids' houses, probably 6-7 houses down from mine.

-28 years old, no kids, hate teenagers lol 

-Work 12 hour day shifts as a nurse. I have the internal dilemma that these are just boys trying to have some fun like me growing up, but I just want some peace and quiet when I'm home. 

-Asked 2 of my neighbors to my left and right and they agree that the kids are annoying. The one on my left said she ""hates them"" and ""word around the block is that not many are fans of them either."" Neighbor to my right built a fence. 

-I've heard that fences may help, but I feel like that's not the *issue* if the kids can just go away to somewhere else. 

-To the people calling me ""nice"" or ""patient,"" thank you! In this case it's not a good thing lmao, but I'm a guy that always tries to remember that nothing is ever the end of the world. I pick and choose my battles carefully, this one being one that's been bothering me lately.

Her car was in the shop, so I offered to pick her up. I got off work at 4pm, and then I was ready to go get her. 

I texted my wife these plans and she got upset. 

She said she had to get the kids from school, get groceries, make dinner and get the kids ready. She said she didn’t want my mom to be sitting there watching her going 100 miles an hour while she did everything and that if I was getting off work early she could use the help instead of me driving and getting my mom. 

The drive to my mom’s is about 10-15 minutes, so it wouldn’t take much at all to go get her. 

She told me to try and see this from her side, but all I saw was her getting mad that my mom was coming over. 

She told me that I could get off work a little later than 4pm so I could time it and be able to pick my mom up and then go directly to the school. 

But I already told my boss that I was leaving at 4 and so that’s the time I was going to leave. 

I tried to explain that the timing wouldn’t matter, and that my mom could sit in the driveway and wait until we were ready since she didn’t want her sitting inside. 

She said the timing wouldn’t matter for me, since I was just driving, but that she had 100 things to do and didn’t need an audience. 

We argued about it for a while. I just didn’t understand why I couldn’t get my mom. I kept telling my wife this, but she went on and on about the timing of everything and kept listing all she had to do and asking me to try and see it from her perspective. 

I told her fine, she could just have her way and my mom wouldn’t go. 

But this made my wife even madder, she said that that’s not what she was saying at all. She asked me to come up with a solution instead of arguing because I ‘obviously wasn’t listening’ to her, and I told her that me going to get my mom when I got off work at 4pm was the solution. 

But whatever, my mom just wouldn’t go then. 

I told my wife she could just have her way and that whenever she doesn’t agree with me we fight because she doesn’t get her way. She said that it was the opposite. That if she disagrees with me or brings up her concerns I ignore them or don’t listen.

If that’s the case,  why is she the one always yelling and calling me a selfish asshole?

She then told me that since I need her to be my mother and problem solve for me, she suggested that I go run a quick errand that I’ve been needing to do for a while now, and then after that go pick up my mom and go directly to the school. 

That made sense, so that’s what I did but I just don’t get it. My mom could have easily just sat in our house and waited until we were ready to go.

My wife (30) and I have been married for around 2 years. She didn't want children when we met but now does. I have always been on the fence about it. She recently has decided that we need to begin trying for children \*now\*.

&#x200B;

The main reason why I do not want children right now is finances.

&#x200B;

I am in grad school which pays enough (call it $12K a year) to cover half of the  expenses and enough to have put together an emergency savings fund for the both of us. By the time a baby came, I will have at least one more year of grad school wages to go.

&#x200B;

She is working full time and earning twice as much ($24K/year) - but has remained consistently broke over the last 5 years. We each pay for half of everything communal (groceries/car/internet) but I pay for my hobbies and she pays for hers.

&#x200B;

She owns and boards horses, with board (how much it costs to feed  and house them at a nearby barn) at $6K a year at the cheapest in the area. This is a bare minimum as riding equipment  / vet costs are non-negligible (even without additional competing/showing costs).

&#x200B;

Should we have kids, her expectation is that she would be a stay-at-home parent while I worked and brought in income. I don't mind if she stays at home or has a career, it's her life to choose.

AITA for the following:

&#x200B;

I do not want children while she keeps horses. That is money/time that should go towards the children/children's future/our retirement.

&#x200B;

Without the horses I am okay with having kids and supporting the family alone, but I do not want to try supporting a family and the extra costs.

&#x200B;

She has said getting rid of the horses would \[sic\] ""make her resent me for the rest of her life"", the same is true of not having children at all.

&#x200B;

Maybe I am weird but I think about as: what would you say to me if I said I wanted to spend 500$ a month on, let's say, clothing for the next 20 years, while being a new father?

&#x200B;

So AITA?

1870,Not the A-hole,"EDIT 2: After thinking about this all day and reading these replies, I think I’m just gonna go with my gut and not say anything to her. I thought about her confronting her mother, and then her mother making even more statuses about how she can’t trust anyone and being stabbed in the back or something. The whole situation is sad, and I feel so, so terribly for those kids. Thanks for the help, Reddit. 

Hey all—long time Reddit lurker, fairly new Reddit user here.

I've been Facebook friends with a woman who I met through work for about 8 years now. I also know her daughters, who I also met through work. One of which is now 16 or 17 and works at a movie theater that I frequent. We make small talk whenever I'm there, ""how's it going, how's the family,"" stuff like that. She's a good kid. 

Her parents have been divorced since I've known them. I know her mom but don't know her dad. Her mom has always been on Facebook making very, very personal status updates about how her ex-husband took all of their friends in the divorce and how she feels excommunicated from our community. That's all well and good, but where it gets weird is when she talks about her kids.

She says how she feels unappreciated by her children, and how she resents them for saying anything nice about their father. She uses their names when recounting discussions, events, or fights they've had together. She tells us about everything, from their bed-wetting problems to their sexual exploits. Specifically, catching her oldest in the act and documenting how humiliated she was. Her second-youngest has a chronic disease which keeps her in a wheelchair, which she documents in the most undignified way. It's extremely private stuff, stuff that I know that no child would want their parents telling their thousands of Facebook friends.

I've brought up how weird this is to her in the past, but she laughed it off like it was a joke, and nothing changed. I know it's none of my business, but I think it's wrong and that her kids deserve better than to have the most awkward parts of their lives be public diary entires. 

WIBTA if I told her oldest?

1871,Asshole,"Throwaway since he knows my account.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, lived together for 3 months. We don't usually use the bathroom at the same time, but the other day I was taking a shower and he needed to pee so came in. I saw him and didn't think anything of it, until he sat down on the toilet.

I was shocked that he was going to take a shit when I was right there and asked him why he was doing that. He said he was just peeing. I thought guys stand up when they pee and only sit when they need to shit. I spoke to him about it after my shower and he says when he's at home he sits down since it's more comfortable and theres no risk of missing the toilet and having to clean it up.

I don't see the point in that, he is blessed with having the ability to stand while peeing and he chooses not to use it. It feels so unhygenic that he wishes to make contact with the toilet seat when he doesn't have to. I told him I didn't like him doing that and was told I'm being ridiculous. He agreed that he thinks most guys stand, but said a lot also sit, which I have never heard before.

AITA for wanting him to stand up when peeing?

She is currently staying with my family for Easter and was so excited about her gifts for my kids that she gave them before the date.

I have three teenage daughters. The youngest was adopted internationally and we are not sure of her birthday let alone the exact hour or minute. So instead of getting her natal chart on her pillow, she got her favorite constellations (which my mother called her to find out). All the pillows were beautiful and my mother clearly put many hours into making them, but I could tell my youngest felt left out.

1875,Not the A-hole,"I just got a message from my best friend of 15 years that she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I am absolutely devastated.  
  
  
I’ll call her Leah. We told each other everything, and we always said we'd go to the same retirement home one day. I love her to death. I left the country 5 years ago, but Leah and I always skyped together to bake and chat at least once a month. Then, I got run over while crossing the street, two months before Leah was getting married. I was gutted. Recovery took over a year. I reluctantly settled for watching her go down the aisle through my sister's phone via video chat.


Over a year later, I was finally able to fly up and visit my hometown, and Leah. The best part was that she had arranged old friends from school to come meet up while I was visiting.  


So, we’re all chatting and drinking, and we start bugging each other about who had finally managed to get laid. Leah hadn't said anything either way. She is very religious, and believed in waiting until marriage. In my mind, there was a learning curve when you waited to have sex. All the painkillers from the hospital must’ve made me a bit fuzzy on the date of the wedding, because I also forgot it had happened over a year ago. That was my fault. I was so into the sex positivity ideology too that it just made sense to ask instead of assume. So I asked her. My friends laughed. Reminded me she was married. I sheepishly shrugged it off. Leah hadn't said a word. When everyone retreated to the patio to cool off, she asked if she could talk to me alone.



I had never heard her speak to me the way did then, it was true outrage. She said I humiliated her in front of all of our closest friends. I tried to tell her that I had really just embarrassed myself. She dropped it then, and I thought it was over. However, while driving home, she brought it up again. We were still arguing by the time we got home.  
  
  
I grew up in a non religious household. It hadn't been an issue for our entire friendship. However, this meant I had no idea how important sex and marriage was to her beliefs. I eventually pieced together that from her perspective, I had l implied that her marriage was failing. I swore that I didn't mean to say anything about her marriage. I apologized and told her I never meant to hurt her, but she seemed inconsolable.


I didn't hear from Leah for a whole year and a half when I got home. Finally, yesterday, I got a message from her saying she doesn't want to talk to me anymore; that we're too different.  
  
  
I want to know if I missed something. This feels like mourning a death, I don't want to feel this again. I'll answer any questions. AITA?

1887,Not the A-hole,"This past week I was staying with my brother at his house for his wedding.

The weekend after the wedding, my bro hosted a cookout for family and friends. His best friend from childhood, who had been his Best Man, was present. I haven't seen this guy in about 20 years, but we were both happy to see each other again. He is a police sergeant with 14 years on the force, a gun-owner, and a conservative. I work in social justice, and as I was on vacation, visiting my conservative family, and interested in relaxation over conflict, I chose to abstain from any and all political conversation. To be clear, I didn't talk to ANYONE about my opinions or beliefs on ANY TOPIC, AT ALL the whole time.

At one point in the afternoon, the conversation turned to guns. I'm not a fan, so I excused myself. The Sergeant chose to show off one of his guns to the family, an [AR pistol](https://www.google.com/search?q=ar+pistol&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIp9HDn9XhAhVkdt8KHdIDB90Q_AUIDigB&biw=1280&bih=585#imgrc=yWXduNZsymoJ2M:). I wasn't present for show and tell, as I was outside helping my brother on the grill.

A few hours later, the Sergeant left with his wife. About 20 minutes after that, my bro got a call from him, saying he realized he'd left his gun behind. It was sitting in the middle of the living room in its backpack.

He returned for it and that was that.

The following day, I texted him: ""It was very irresponsible of you to forget your gun. Good to see you, tho!""

He replied: ""You're just saying that bc you're antigun on your plantation- wait, you're antigun for a black guy to own. Lol"" (he's Black)

I said ""Did you hear any of those words come out of my mouth? You left a deadly weapon behind in somebody's house. I wanted to remind you not to do that again, for your safety (you own that gun) and everyone else's too""

Then I changed the subject to thanking him for being there for my brother on his wedding day.

I was really rankled by him accusing me of calling him out only bc, in his words, I'm ""antigun for a black guy to own."" I was poking fun at him for being irresponsible with his gun. In my mind that is fair, bc not only is he a gun-owner, but also a cop, so he should definitely be held to a higher standard when it comes to gun safety, which I believe begins with *knowing at all times where your gun is*.

The conversation bounced back, but I felt like his reply was unfair. I'm sure no one else would have mentioned to him that this was irresponsible, so I wanted to get in his ear about it, bc I didn't think he should skate by without hearing it from someone. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR: Old family friend, a Black, conservative police Sergeant, showed off his AR pistol at a cookout, then forgot it when he left and had to come back for it. I texted him later saying this was irresponsible of him, and he said I was ""anti gun for a black guy to own."" We had never discussed my views on gun ownership.",112,34,0.85
1888,Update,"

Hey guys. This is an update to my previous post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/acqo2b/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_wife_for_going_out/

as I got a lot of feedback about how to handle the situation. Thanks a lot for all of that. It was an unexpected and overwhelming response and I went through as many as I could. 


I know it’s been a few months, but I needed time to think and talk with my wife about the whole thing.


It’s been brought to my attention that I may have not been the best husband. We both have many flaws, and have been far from perfect in this relationship, and it turns out we both have terrible communication skills. 


Long story short, when she came home that night we talked -well, argued- about it. The argument led to me walking out to go stay at my brother’s house for two nights. My brother, who is also married, suggested marriage counseling to see if we can get any suspicions or issues out in the open easier, so I called her, recommended it, and we had a session booked for the following week.


Yes, she admitted during counseling that she did occasionally make out with other guys when going out drinking with friends. On her behalf, her issue was that she felt I was not prioritizing her enough. That I wasn’t giving her enough time. Also that I never bothered that ask what she wanted from me. She has been considering a divorce for about a year now, so this might be what our relationship would ultimately come to.


I’m purposefully leaving out a lot of personal information as I don’t really like sharing everything, but all I have to say is that this past year for us hasn’t exactly been the best for us. This might be the most time we have spent talking every day for a while- discussing divorce plans, where we plan to go, who’s keeping what, etc. 


We don’t hate each other. We both realized we are drifting apart, sooner than we realized. But we aren’t really motivated enough to keep ourselves together. This might be for the best. If I hadn’t posted anything about the ring situation and approached it head on, I probably would have been in even more of a mess.


Thanks guys. 


tl;dr: We went to marriage counseling. She admitted she made out with other guys. I don’t prioritize her enough. We are getting a divorce.",363,5257,0.98

The child was a little girl, she was the daughter of one of the men in there. There was only one cubicle and two urinals. All three people were queuing for the cubicle toilet. So I walked by and went up to one of the free urinals. 

The father then said to me could I please not use the urinal as his daughter was present. I hesitated and said ""ehh.. ok sorry, sure"" and so joined the queue for the toilet cubical behind them all.

1897,Asshole,"Some background is in order and I'm using a throwaway. I have history with my BIL that predates him dating and marrying my sister. In college he dated a good friend of mine and I was certain (still am) he was cheating on her so I told her and she dumped him. He lies about it to this day but needless to say we don't get along. When he started dating my sister I tried to warn her about him but she was so ""in love"" she refused to heed my warnings. They've been married for 18 years and I'm certain there's infidelity and abuse but I have no proof and my sister cuts me off when I bring it up. 

So to the crux of the issue. Two weeks ago I picked my nephew (11) up from baseball. I asked him how things were going and asked him if he had any issues he'd like to talk to me about. He said no so I asked if he'd been offered drugs. He sort of perked up and said no but that his dad said ""I don't care if you do cocaine or smoke pot."" 

I was livid so I stormed into their house and tried to discuss with my BIL. He said he was too busy to talk and asked if I was freaking out about ""nonsense"" again. I told him this was about what he said to my nephew. He said to stay out of he and his kids business and he wasn't even comfortable with me driving the kid and would talk to my sister about it. I stormed out and thought about what I should do. 

So the next morning I went directly to the kids principal and told her what I'd heard. She profusely thanked me and said she would address the issue. I was very happy that at least some sort off authority figure knew. 

Later in the day I got a text from niece saying ""Aunt Shana, what did you tell the principal?"" I told her that was adult stuff. She texted back ""My dad never said we should do drugs!"" I told her ""honey, let the adults handle this ok."" Her response was ""he told us that he doesn't care if we do drugs like smoke pot but he wants us to realize that if we do drugs, we have to get them from drug dealers who can be really awful people! Please take this back!"" I told her again that if that's what he said it's just as bad and she needed to let the adults handle this. I got a text from my sister later that night saying ""please leave my kids out of whatever your issue is today."" I told her ""I'm always here to talk about what is truly going on in your house."" 

Well fast forward to late last week and I guess my sister and BIL got a visit from our state's version of CPS. CPS called me, I told them the truth that I feel my BIL is abusive and an adulterer and the thing about the drugs. My sister called me later that day apoplectic at what I'd done, so did my parents and other siblings. Everyone is furious with me. I told my sister that I was always here for her if she ever wanted to talk about the abuse I know she receives from my BIL and she told me that she never wants to speak to my ""fat, ugly ass ever again"" and hung up.

I have hbo that I pay for alone. I have granted access to my account to some of my friends from college whom I know are huge GoT fans. Normally I have no problem with them using my account as much as they want to watch whatever they want. 

Last week I told the only one of those friends who lives in the same city as me that I was off on sunday night (I'm a bartender and normally work sunday nights) to watch GoT and would she like to get together and watch it. She said no, she had other plans that night but maybe next week. Ok cool.

I just found out through the grapevine that she had a huge GoT watch party at her place and invited all our mutual friends including some of my coworkers (how I found out). She even invited them over next week because she ""has her own HBO account now"", her words according to my coworkers. She's still using my account and I never got an invite, explanation or anything from her, just a ""no, I have other plans"".

WBITA for kicking her off right before her party next week?

Update: Sorry for the long time before the update I tried to forget about it. With how this season has gone I decided to wait until this last episode to cut her off. It should be glorious. Also I told all my coworkers and friends that they should come to my place for the last episode. I didn't tell them why, but I didn't want to screw them over as well, that just seems like a dick move.",638,4819,0.97

1901,Asshole,"Background info, college freshman student stuck with a roommate whose been an absolute nightmare. He plays games screaming until 5AM and then gives me an attitude if I'm eating breakfast at 8:00 because I have 8:30 classes. Since the beginning of this year I have been returning home late from work and all I wanted was sleep, I've discussed this with him on numerous occasions but at this point, two quarters in he does not seem to care. On top of this, all of my other roommates think that he's the victim because he was outspoken about how I was waking him and in turn how this affected his academic life. I wanted to scream and say the reason why he was falling asleep wasn't because I was waking him for 1-5 mins but because he wasn't sleeping and causing me to lose sleep as well.  As if this wasn't bad enough he's already talked to my RA and gotten close to him so even after I talked to my RA it was like talking to a stone wall. My RA actually recommended me to eat outside in the mornings and work to ""show respect and kindness"" to my roommate. I've been sleeping over at my mates house on the days before midterms and finals and it sucks that despite a room supposed to be a 50-50 he makes it a 90-10. I feel so powerless and at this point I don't think it matters if he changes, he can't fix this. It hurts knowing that a lot of this is my fault for not setting clear boundaries on the first day but I was shy and hated confrontation and here I am. So back to the main topic, I want to break his monitor so he can't play games, I don't care if I get caught I'm willing to buy him a new monitor if it means I'll get even a month of rest, maybe I'll make it an accident so I don't get in any legal trouble. I'm going to go back and look at what monitor he uses to see if its within my financial ability to replace it, but if it is then I am going to. I just wanted to know if responding like this after exhausting all other resources makes me TA, it isn't even for revenge at this point just for some peace and quiet. I'm receiving therapy but its not helping.

Okay small update for everyone telling me to talk to the coordinator/someone above my RA. I emailed my Community coordinator and they replied saying I can set up a meeting with them and my RA + Roommate.

1902,No A-holes here,"My son's (18) girlfriend (18) is currently renting a room from her friend's parents.  The friend and girlfriend have had a serious falling out and she has been given one week to move out.  My son asked me to consider her staying with us for a couple of months while they save up enough money to get a apartment.  My husband (his stepfather) has said he isn't ok with it but says I'm ""selfish and will do whatever I want regardless"".  I don't feel like I'm being selfish I feel like this girl is in a bad situation and really doesn't have many options.  She isn't able to stay with her parents because they recently took custody of her younger cousins so there isn't any room.  She has a grandma who lives about 50 miles away so not ideal but an option.  If I let this happen it will cause tension between my husband and I but I cant imagine being in this girls situation.

AITA if I let her stay?

EDIT: A little more info.  Girlfriend does have a stable job.  She was paying very little in rent and I have looked at some rooms to rent in the area but even a room is $400+.  My husband doesn't want her to stay because he feels like if they are old enough to play house they are old enough to be in their own place.  He is a very good man and I don't want to cause problems in our relationship over this.

EDIT 2: Now I do feel like an asshole. I was telling my husband that I have talked to a couple of people I know about her renting a room from them. They haven’t meet her so they weren’t comfortable with it. I was disappointed but understood. He said I love you and you should do what you think you need to do.  I told him I knew he didn’t really like the idea but he said if this is what you think is best I’ll be ok. He had some super basic no tolerance rules like both of them working full time and cleaning up after themselves. We’re also moving them to the empty room in the basement so everyone has space.

1903,Everyone Sucks,"It's pretty simple actually, but I do feel sort of conflicted.

Been with her for 3 years, we're both 22 right now and live together. 

I went on our laptop and she was still logged into her Facebook. She was talking to a friend of hers, and she was telling her that she felt really guilty for something. I got curious and scrolled back a little bit, and it turns out she had a one night stand with some dude she met at a party. She claims she was drunk and everything and that she deeply regrets it and feels absolutely terrible about it. She tells the friend that she's been debating on telling me, and her friend just tells her that she should keep it a secret. She told her that she doesn't know what to do after that. This all happened last Friday and the conversation took place today/yesterday.

It all lines up with her behavior. She was being incredibly affectionate for no reason and was spoiling me the entire weekend, she was way more kinky during sex too and I was wondering what happened with her, but I wasn't complaining. My birthday is in about a month from now, and she's buying me a pretty expensive gift I've been wanting for quite some time, and I decided to not confront her until after my birthday. I plan on breaking up with her afterwards, meanwhile I'm trying to keep my act together but it's pretty hard. 

Edit: I do wonder if she decides to confess, she told her friend she didn't know what to do today so who knows. That's also partly the reason why I didn't break up straight away.

Edit 2: Well fuck me. She just confessed everything. She wanted to tell me this morning but I was in a very bad mood because I just read her messages. I don't even know anymore. Cried like a little baby even though I already knew. She's a goddamn wreck but so am I. I'm just going to drive for a little bit.

1904,Not the A-hole,"This is a throwaway account.

My mom is 80 and I have been caring for her for 20 yrs. She does not get enough social security to afford living on her own and I made the decision to be with her. I accept responsibility for that. She has begged me not to put her in a facility and I have honored that.

I am the youngest of 5 and my siblings are a lot older than me. There is a lot of history here, but I have to keep it short. I will gladly answer any requests for more info.

3 of my siblings do very well financially and the other one gets by OK. 2 of them live close by and the other 2 live in another state. None of them have helped out with my mom over the years and I accepted that. I have been a single mom for 24 yrs and things have been tough at times.

My mom has been very ill in the past. I have worked 2 jobs and my adult son moved back home to help. My siblings who live close by did not help with getting her to dr appts, caring for her at home, or any financials. Despite this, they want to remain in contact, be kept informed of my mom's status, and have a say in her affairs.

My son, who was working and going to college full time, quit school to help. I did not ask him to do this and it kills me that he did. When my mom got better, my son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.

My mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My son stayed home, I left my job and withdrew my retirement money so I could stay home to provide the 24 hr care my mom needs. My retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on my son.

My siblings think I should be home caring for our mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. I’ve been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries. I told them that I don't think anyone is obligated to provide assistance, but I would like for them to make their intentions clear so there are no false expectations or angry reactions to decisions I may have to make (e.g. one of my siblings was unhappy with potential funeral plans due to my financial constraints). I have to get a job and cannot leave my mom alone. She probably does not have long to live so we’re not talking about a situation that will drag on for years. I can try to work overnights while my son is home, but I don't know when I will get any sleep due to so many dr appts. My siblings have the resources to help, but they are not doing so. Yet they cry on the phone when discussing her impending death.

AITA for thinking they should sacrifice a few luxuries in order to help keep our mom happy in her final days and/or the ones who live close by at least help with getting her to appts and taking turns caring for her while I work since they claim to care and want to be involved in decision making?",89,52,0.9

1906,Not the A-hole," 

I'm vegan and have been vegan for almost 10 years. Since I became vegan around the time I started cooking for myself, I never learned to cook/prepare meat. My husband and I have been together for 7 years and while he is not vegan, he enjoys my cooking and will only occasionally indulge in non-vegan items when we go out. He supports my decision and he's never complained. He's not the issue, my friends are.

My husband is well off enough that I am lucky to stay home, and we have a fairly large home with an oversized patio area. This means that I like to host a lot, I do a lot of cooking and gardening so I end up hosting dinners at our home about twice a month. There have been some grumblings from friends, but nothing major, about the vegan fare. I tell them that they are always welcome to bring their own dishes if they want, but typically they just bring along beer.

In the past couple years though, my friends have started getting married, engaged, and pregnant. My house has become the default hosting venue for all these events. It started with my hosting my best friends engagement party and subsequent wedding related events, but then our larger group also expected me to host. I don't mind offering my place up, but somehow they all also thought that meant I would be catering the parties as well. I did all of this for my best friend, but we did get into an argument about the food. I told her that I did not want to splurge on catering since I can prepare everything myself, but that I would still be creating a fully vegan menu since I don't cook non-vegan foods. I told her that if she and her partner wanted meat, they could pay for it and I would display it. She said that I was being selfish and controlling. We went through a rough patch but we are ok now. This has spread throughout our friend group though and now they complain about the food almost every time I invite people over.

I stopped hosting a few months back, and yes, again, I hear nothing but complaints. I'm pretty frustrated and don't know what to do. I don't want to host anything anymore, period. But this means that I haven't really seen my friends much in the past few months. Was I being an asshole?",556,3061,0.96

In the middle of a conversation I said “how did you even get that, you barely went to the events.” She got super pissed and treated her like she put in no work into it. I frankly don’t know whether she went to the events or not. Last time she told me she was ditching one so I based it off that. I didn’t mean it offensively but I thought it was super competitive to get it and thought she didn’t go to them. 

She said I undermine her and think she’s not capable. Little did I know, she actually did attend a lot of events and put in a lot of time toward this club. She even got an award for high attendance and I just didn’t know. I admit it was a kinda rude thing to say but I meant no harm and I was genuinely curious. 

She got extremely pissed off, made a huge deal about it. We fought all night and almost broke up. I kept apologizing but she didn’t take it and I was getting frustrated and started to ignore her at one point.

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did).

I come from a poor background and my mom has gone from one homeless shelter to another before I was born. I am fortunate enough to study in a private school due to my grades though.

So just the other night my best friend (who's never had a girlfriend) posted a screenshot on his snapchat story of texts with someone he had named ""wifu"" followed by the typical teen relationship emojis. In the little we could see they managed to call each other wifu, babe, cutie, and teddybear (Which is what I call her.) And after asking my friend who it was because obviously I'm excited if he finally got a girl, I'm told it was my girl, and he was treating it like a joke. So I admittedly exploded to my girlfriend saying something like ""so you're going to get pissed off that I liked (Instagram model she followed on my phone's name)'s post even though you know I like literally everything that comes in my feed. And then I see screenshots of you flirting with my best friend and letting him call you my pet names. Fuck you, leave me alone tomorrow and probably longer.""

1917,Asshole,"I am currently 18 years old and have been out of school for about half a year or so. I currently do not have the requirements eligible for college/university so last year I decided I would want to try and fix my education and start post secondary schooling next fall rather than immediately join the full-time workforce. While I am working to get my education back on track I wanted to maintain a steady amount of hours at my part time job and maybe save a little bit of money. I am at fault for slacking off a bit in high school and being in a position that results in having a gap year, but I think that I now have a good plan and I am genuinely ready to start taking school seriously once I have my footing.

Early on my mom made it known that she wanted me to pay rent if I decided to stay here. We live very comfortably compared to most and because of that I didn't take her very seriously whenever we discussed it. I knew that this wasn't about money but instead more about teaching me to be better with it. I am admittedly not best with money and have not saved nearly as much as I planned to at this point so she does have a point here honestly. 

After months of periodic fighting, a few days ago she finally gave me an ultmatium. She's asking for $500 a month and is willing to reduce it to a lower unknown amount when my gap year is over. I currently make $1000-1100 a month and pay for most my expenses (food, hygene, gas, etc). I have tried talking alternatives such as suggesting she restrict access to my bank cards or even asking her to lower the amount to $200 or $300 but she is very adamant about this number.

We live in shared housing on campus. Most of my housemates are friends, but one of them moved in later on and we're not very close to her. She's usually drunk and when she has her friends over, we can't get any sleep because of all the noise she makes. We sometimes find her passed out on the top her mountain of stuff in her room that she never cleans. She (or her friends) had also stolen the sandwiches I'd packed before a day out (which I found out after I'd gone out).

Recently, my other housemate had noticed that her shampoo had been going down more than she was using it. By process of elimination, we guessed that it was probably that housemate. We are quite done with her shit by now, and we're thinking of spiking some shampoo in an opaque bottle with hair dye to teach her a lesson. If it doesn't go in her hair, at least her hands will be coloured.

So, in doing this, AITA?

Edit: Due to valid concerns, her hair is dyed. It would be unlikely that she's allergic to substances she's already used.

We've talked to her about it, kind of harder to forget when you've stumbled out to the kitchen at 3 in the morning after a 12 hour shift (medical student, so he does regular training in medical facilities) to a bunch of drunk people howling and pounding the kitchen table in.

Right now she's got friends in her room, door's closed and we can hear her howling in the opposite end of the place with our door closed. 

We've also talked to her about the sandwich, she blames it on her friends (that she doesn't control or take responsibility for). My boyfriend's only plate (heyyy student life) was also ""loaned"" once and he couldn't have his daily cereal. He caught her a few days later trying to sneak it back to the kitchen, which when confronted, she broke down into tears.

She's also left Indian food in her room once, for half a week. The entire house stank of rotting food and then her cloying perfume because she thought that was a good idea.

She's only been here about one and a half months. We're quite tired.

I thought it would be good for her motivation and confidence, although during trainings she didn't work as hard as the other, less talented girls.

She chose to stay with us. Even though I advised her (and her parents) to level up. As expected, this season she's won every competition so far and I can't think of anything to teach her anymore. In addition, I think it's not fair to the other super hard-working girls in our group. 

That's why I sat down with her and her mother and told her that we wanted her to level up and can't stay another season. She could however decide for herself if she wanted to go 1 or 2 levels up.

You can also check the responses I already received in another post over at [r/relationship\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice). Breach yourselves for a lengthy read if you do so however.

I (32M) have been married to my wife (29F) for 7 years now. I met my wife during college and now she is a stay-at-home mom to our two kids. Our two daughters are 7 and 5 years old.

I work as a marine engineer on rigs and ships for a large part of the year. This leads to me spending a lot of time away from home. The time I'm away from my family isn't very easy on me either, but maritime technology is my passion. I love life at sea.

These are not the ideal circumstances to raise a family in, I realize, but my career choices have always been consensual between husband and wife. For years all was well and good because we found a balance.

However, a new lucrative contract entails me working on board for 3 month stretches, only being able to briefly return home by plane when shore-side at certain ports. My vacation time inbetween is 45 days. It's been like this for almost a year now. When I told her about this offer she was not very elated, rather disappointed even, but she acquiesced seeing my excitement and when I laid out the numbers. Also, this isn't a permanent arrangement either.

Fast forward to last week. I return home after an assignment, eager to jump into vacation with my family. Instead of a heartwarming welcome, I get sat down by my wife in the kitchen. She took my kids to her parents' house, so they weren't around. She starts telling me that she has had a long time to think about this, 'literally', seeing as I'm away from home so often and for so long, tells me I never listen to her concerns and she proceeds to issue me an ultimatum. Either I seriously think about changing careers or she moves back to her parents' house (with my kids) and she files for divorce and custody. My eyes almost popped out of my head.

Talking to her about it later, she still wouldn't budge. I proposed getting more help around the house if she needed that (a nanny), but she would have none of it. The only thing that could appease her is hearing out of my mouth that I would quit my current position or that I would go into therapy with her. So I ended up agreeing with the latter, because I cannot just promise the former. But I have little hope for this interim solution.

Why is there no mutual compromise possible? I work my ass off every day I'm out at sea, to provide for this family. I absolutely LOVE what I do, and I would have a hard time letting it go. But neither do I want to lose my children, which I'm sure I would, with the exception of visitation rights.

AITA for seriously doubting my marriage here, and possibly hurting my kids in the process? WIBTA if I chose my career over my family.

EDIT: My expectations were not betrayed in regard to the response. I recognize everyone's concern for my family and believe me (or don't, as is your right), I have their best interests at heart, even if it seems like I don't considering my absence. I have tried a lot in these last few years, to make things easier on them: I set them up with all the necessary equipment to have some quality Facetime, Skype, ... moments ; I bring little souvenirs from every port city we ever moored, to give them little reminders; I always pick out a nice gift to return home with for my wife; I pray to God every night that the shitty offshore internet would not give out before I got to make my call for the day; I have long chats with my wife, where we (used to) laugh together, talk about our day, where she could tell me anything, share her frustrations (and yes, sometimes she would voice her loneliness, her workload, her envy at other couples. As would I, but we always came to a mutual understanding, knowing that this would not be permanent, would only be until I safely secured my position with my employer - I guess I did indeed push my luck and now have to face the fallout), I try to play games with the kids over video chat which they always seem to enjoy and have them tell me about their day, their friends, about scouting and soccer games. It saddens me that I don't get to attend all their games and events, but when I can I'm their fiercest supporter on the sidelines. But that's the only thing I'll ever be, won't I? A dad on the sidelines...

I know I am largely at fault here. And sadly, I cannot deny that I do carry around some resentment towards my wife, because of the events of the last weeks, and that I should work on this, seeing as she has every right to call our current game plan into question if it doesn't work for her anymore. But I NEED room to transition.

This work schedule is very recent (I'm not even a full year in) and the previous arrangement was much more in favor of family life, with more frequent and longer home visits. Also much less paid of course. I am already in the process of negotiating with my employer, looking at prospects of reappointment. Seeing as my work on the drillship is not compatible with my wife's plans, they might agree with relocating me to another offshore platform, closer to home, maybe in the Gulf of Mexico, lending itself to more time at home. It happens that contracts can be revised in face of family troubles and there are provisions that take this into account, but it'll always come down to time. And I'm not sure how much more time she is willing to give me. If I come to an agreement, I will bring this to the table as my 'compromise'. If she still refuses, then I can propose a stationary position at the port of Miami, which would entail me moving there. This isn't a given either, knowing that she would like to stay close to her family, them being local to the area we live in, as a few commenters aptly pointed out.

I have written down all my thought these last few hours. I've got a clear strategy. I'll use this as a backdrop the coming days and weeks. The final say will be hers. If she still wants a divorce, she'll get one, and I won't make it hard on her. I do recognize the sacrifices she has made these last years, after all.",561,1205,0.94
1925,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in the habit of not always answering text/whatsapp messages that I receive right away. Not that I wait a week before responding, but a few hours is common. Sometimes it's simply because I did not notice the messages, as I don't check my phone every five minutes and the sound usually is turned off. But sometimes I don't respond right away because I 'don't want to'. I don't want to feel forced to give people attention and get in a conversation right away whenever someone feels like sending me a message. I don't want to be obligated to pick up my phone whenever it buzzes.  If something is so important that they need a response right away, they can call me. Otherwise I'll respond when I feel like it.

Now, most people that know me are fine with this. But recently, a slightly drunk friend told me that he thought I was being a dick by behaving like this. His argument was that it barely takes any time to respond to most things and that it implies that I don't give a shit about others. I see his point, but for me it's more the principle of the matter.

So, AITA for not always responding right away when someone send me a message?",31,66,0.89

We are fortunately doing really well in our respective careers and she became the editor for a major news publication last week:)
Since I have a sprain and I cannot help with the food too much, I arranged two parties, one with close friends and family and the other with her new colleagues.
The first party went fabulously well, but the second one went to shit. (For me)
Me and my girlfriend have this thing of saying jokes that people might consider offensive or sexist but it's just dumb sarcastic fun.
If I feel stressed my girlfriend shall give some great advice and then say something like 'but you are a man so the best thing would obviously be just to suck it up' 
Harmless fun and it lightens the mood because we are a goofy couple.

Back to where I left, her work colleagues came to the second party. It was going fabulously well for the most part and they seemed like good people. 
I was leaning against the door and my girlfriend got up to serve the salad. I asked her where she was going and she replied by asking me to move aside to let her go to the kitchen.
I just whispered 'oooh back where you belong, finally!' under my breath by moving close to her ear.
She giggled and gave a sarcastic sure, I cracked a smile. I wished it was the end of story.

But somehow a colleague was like a feet away from us the exact moment I said that. She confronted my girlfriend in the kitchen saying that she was in a 'mentally abusive' relationship. 
My girlfriend explained her it was just a dumb thing and she was really happy.
But this coworker goes from one person to another throughout the party and everyone basically looks at me in disdain or ignores me.
Now on the first day of my girlfriend's job, everyone is really sympathetic to her and telling her it would be nice to break up with me because I am a terrible boyfriend while I am face palming to no end.

I just wanted an honest opinion on the matter. It would genuinely help,thanks!",209,635,0.94

What I'm not cool with was the fact that while he has this standard, it only applies to me. He talks about he ex wives fairly often, and his refrigerator is covered with post it notes with phrases people have said that he find memorable. Many of them are about sex. For example, one said ""all I have to offer are band aids, beer and boobies."" 

I brought this double standard up and he took a few if the notes down. He kept saying,""I should just really take them down."" I kept waiting but he didn't.

I mean she did her assigned part but she didn’t really provide many ideas or have much initiative. So I had my grade to her reflect that although it was hard since she is my friend as well. I also provided comments so she would know why I graded her that.

The peer evaluation marks came out the other day and although they were anonymous I think she could tell that it was me who gave her the bad grade bc of my style of writing.

1941,No A-holes here,"My husband (32m) and I (30f) had decided to try to get pregnant this summer. I’ve always been pretty on the fence as to if I wanted children or not and in the earlier parts of our relationship (we’ve been together 10 years, married 4) my husband also said he could go either way. In the last couple years, after seeing most of our close friends become parents, my husband came to the decision that he does really want kids. He never pressured me and understood I may decide I didn’t want them and always said he’d be ok if that were the case. 

In the last few years a lot of great things have fallen in place for us. We bought a beautiful house, he was promoted to CFO at his job and now makes really good money, I found a teaching job in the district I had always really wanted to be in (I spent the first 5 years of my teaching career being laid off or bounced between schools). I decided that I was really comfortable with where things were and I was ready to start thinking about getting pregnant and starting a family. I told my husband and he was elated. We decided this summer would be a good time to begin trying. I talked with my OBGYN, began taking prenatal vitamins, and everything was good. 

Then a couple weeks ago, I got a lay-off notice from my job. There’s a huge budget deficit this year due to state aid not coming through, and the outcome looks pretty bleak. I’ve been here for four years and honestly felt blindsided by it because we haven’t had any budget issues in the years I’ve been here. I’m still contracted through the end of this school year but that’s it. There is a definite chance I could be called back before next school year, but also a chance I may not. 

I told my husband I no longer want to try to get pregnant this summer because of this. He feels like this is really unfair and I’m letting a situation out of our control dictate the future of our family. I told him I’m incredibly stressed at the idea of losing my job (I love my district, coworkers, curriculum, etc) and that it’s devastating to think about not being there next year. I don’t want the added stress of trying to get pregnant or being pregnant with so much uncertainty. Also, I’m very close with my current coworkers, and the thought of not having them as a support during a pregnancy is really scary. He argues that his job is very secure and that he makes enough money to support us (and potential children) without me needing to work. He also says we have his family and coworkers as support systems throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth.

We’ve talked about it a lot over the last week and he ascertains my decision is unreasonable and is very upset. He also feels like he has little say in the matter, that I’m making this decision without him, and that’s frustrating him. I’ve stuck by my stance that I’m uncomfortable starting a family unless my current job calls me back. Am I the asshole for changing our pregnancy plans?",44,46,0.92

1943,No A-holes here,"I'm going to be moving from community college to the wide world of University this fall. I had filled out all the paperwork, and one of the last things to do (as of April 6th) was pick a dorm room. I picked the last empty room in an apartment-style dorm so I could have both privacy (since each of the four occupants gets their own bedroom), and a decent kitchen with stovetop and full-size fridge. 

Everything was quiet until April 14th. I checked social media, which I don't often do, and noticed one of the girls I was rooming with had sent me a message on Twitter on the 11th, 5 days after I had picked my room. She said she was trying to save the room that I had chosen for her friend. Neither she, nor anyone else occupying the room, had put in their ""about me"" profile that they were trying to save it. Nevertheless, I chose a different room because I didn't want to be a douche, and there were still other apartments I could choose. There were six, to be precise. Two immediately ruled themselves out because two of the girls put in their bio that they was trying to save the rooms. Of the remaining four, I chose a room with people who I felt I could get along with. I switched rooms this morning. At 1pm this afternoon I recieved another message telling me one of the girls was trying to save the room for her friend. I saw the message after work at 7pm. By this time, all the other apartments had been taken. If I switched rooms I'd have to take a double occupancy room and forfeit both my personal space and the ability to cook.

The thing is, the girl who messaged me said that her friend had lost her mother recently and had to figure out a place to go in-state on short notice, due to tight finances, and that my roommate was her only friend in my state. WIBTA if I refuse to give up my room to this girl?

UPDATE: I had asked my roommate why she and her friend couldn't give up apartment housing and do double occupancy. She explained that she ""couldn't switch because she had already paid for the room"". I called the Resident's Office this morning and was told this was a lie. She can totally switch.

1944,Asshole,"I grew up on a farm, and we had a dog. We got the dog when I was 4. My dad didn't believe in vets or anything, and growing up with my dog, I never saw her get sick, get seriously hurt, even get fixed. Our dog lived a long life until she hit 14 or so, which as far as I know is pretty old for a scottie. She was as lively as you could possibly be for someone of her age and we always got comments that she acted like a puppy even days before she passed. I don't know why she passed, but she wasn't hurt or sick, she just went to sleep on our kitchen floor one afternoon and didn't wake up.

We got a new dog, another scottie, My family still lived on a farm but I moved out when the dog was about 6. I brought her with me, and now I live in a more urban but not quite a city area. We never had her fixed or get any shots, no nothing. And I never did either, when I left.

My dog is 13 now. I'm married with two kids and my family adores my dog. I joke sometimes she was the wingwoman in keeping my wife around when we began dating. She's as springy as a puppy still, the trend continuing from my first dog. People are genuinely surprised when we ask them how old they think she is, only to find out she's 13. Most people guess 4 or 5.

Recently, however, I noticed a small growth on her belly. My wife thinks it's uterine/ovarian cancer. I love my dog to death but I worry about bringing her to a vet. She hasn't had any shots, isn't fixed, has never even set paw in a vet. The unreasonable part of me thinks they'll hurt her or take her away. I talked with my wife a bit and she said it's my decision as I've known this dog the longest.

I don't think I could bring her to a vet. She doesn't seem affected by this recent situation. But this also means I don't think I could get her put down if it got to that point where it becomes bad. I can't definitely say at this moment because we're not at that time, but knowing my first dog died in her sleep maybe makes me think this one will be a similar ordeal. Peaceful, without stress.

My girlfriend had told me (before I purchased tickets) that she has her sorority formal in April, and wanted me to be her date. She didn’t tell me the date, but I told her I’d love to go. Weeks went by in March with me repeatedly asking her what day the formal was on, but she kept telling me “I’ll find out soon”. I asked her if she could talk to someone in the sorority directly to find out, but she never did. Eventually, tickets were going to sell out, so I bought four tickets (for me and my friends) to the premiere.

My father would beat us whenever he was drunk and sometimes he would just beat us for no reason other than he's having problems at work that he would take out on us.

1949,Asshole," Since high school, I have had the same tight-knit friend group of 4 people (I’m 22). A few years ago, one of my buds, Nick, has gotten a girlfriend, let’s call her Tracy. 

Tracy actually got pretty close to most of us and hung out with us whenever we hung out together. I didn’t *particularly* care for her. She was nice enough, but we didn’t have anything in common, and I didn’t find her sense of humor very funny (she liked to tease me a lot about my height).

They dated for about 2 years, when they broke up because Tracy found Nick sleeping with his ex. They apparently have been sleeping with each for a couple weeks, when Tracy found Nick at a local motel thanks to Find My IPhone. 

Obviously the group is affected. Tracy wants nothing to do with Nick (understandably) and didn’t want to be in the same room as him. 

The issue is that we play Dungeons and Dragons every Friday. Tracy pretty much expected to be able to still come (so it’d be her, me, and friend 3/friend 4 which I’ll call Friends). I told Friends in a group text that if Tracy wants to hang, they 3 can just hang while I’ll just go ahead and hang with Nick by myself. 

Friends asked why we couldn’t hang out with Stacy occasionally and I just told them that I just didn’t really want to. That we pretty much only hung out with her because Nick brought her along, and now that she’s no longer with Nick, there’s no reason to hang out with her. This started an argument which leaded to Friends telling Stacy what I said. 

They are **FURIOUS** that I’m “on his side” after what he did to her and that I’m cruel for cutting her out of my life like that. I told Stacy that I would’ve told her a lot more tactfully, but I didn’t really consider her that close a friend, and that she’s nice and all, but we had nothing in common and I rather hang out with my actual friend. 

They called me a piece of shit and posted about how I rather hang with a cheater than them on Facebook. I responded to that post and told her that she was a crazy stalker who used a tracking device on her boyfriend and needed to leave me alone. She blocked me on everything after that and there’s a lot of annoying drama and everyone’s pissed off.",50,37,0.85

**Clarification:**

**These are his biological children**

He took the kids 8F, 11M to Costco yesterday. He says it was perfectly fine in the car trip to Costco, and there wasn't a problem when shopping. The only problem was when the kids wanted to stop by the food court and get pizza, when they were already going to meet with my family and grandparents in a couple of hours for dinner. 

11M starts wailing and having a tantrum, and starts screaming how my uncle isn't his father, and 8F picks up on this and is screaming in unison. There's people looking at the scene, and some employees were talking with each other. 

I think my uncle's a pretty level-headed guy, so I'm sure he tried explaining that they're going to eat anyway so that they didn't need pizza right now, and they'll probably get pizza the next time they go to Costco. 

Eventually it comes to the point that my uncle just leaves the kids and went to the car with groceries in tow. The kids were still screaming, but eventually they got the sense to walk back to the car. By this point, my uncle had finished loading and was in the car, locked. The kids tried to get back in the car, but were repeatedly told that ""I'm not your dad anymore."" 

By his account, the kids were crying for about 5 minutes until he unlocked the car and let them back in. After he gave them the verbal lesson of why it's wrong to act like this, they went back home and came to our house for dinner. 

Personally, me, my dad, and my uncle think it's a good lesson to teach, but my aunt, mom, sister, and grandparents think my uncle went too far. I guess my uncle could have let them in the car when they were crying, but that's for a different argument.",313,1659,0.97

1954,Not the A-hole,"So throwaway for reasons. Update at the bottom.

2 weeks ago I reached out to a guy that I met some time ago to go on a date, and we did! It went really well and made plans for a second and then a third. I am a little naturally resistant to dating and I wasn’t particularly attentive to his texts. But I always responded, apologized when my response was delayed, and to be fair for going on 2 dates he was a little overzealous with the texting. So our third date was derailed due to a miscommunication and I invited him over last night, but he said he had plans to see the GOT premiere. All is well perfectly understandable.

Cue 730 pm and he texts me that he’s not really interested in the GOT premiere and wants to hang out. I resist initially because I just wanted to relax but he insisted he just wanted to chill for a bit and see me before the workweek. So I invite him over, he gets here at 930, and we watch a show and have a couple glasses of wine. We made out, he told me he really liked me, and I invited him to stay over.

So he did, we slept together and it wasn’t.. great.. he lost his erection pretty quickly and I asked what was wrong and he said nothing but seemed embarrassed. So I was like all good, went to sleep, and when we woke up I asked again if everything was ok. He said no, left and said see you soon! I should mention that I have an ED so my body is whatever the opposite of voluptuous is. My mind immediately went to shit he’s disgusted by my body. So I text him and say “hey, I’m feeling a little weird about last night. Is everything ok? If you aren’t feeling this we can end things here if you want” he responds, “I’m not feeling it, we should end things” 

I texted him back with the following message: “Ok, to wrap things up, I do just want to be clear on what changed last night. I was ambivalent about going on dates and I mentioned above ^ that dating is hard for me right now. I’m feeling a little bit used because you pushed to come over, I invited you to stay over, you said that you liked me, we had sex, I asked you multiple times if something was wrong and you clearly said no, and now you aren’t feeling it. I just want to clarify if it was something I did or said or if I’m just not attractive to you? I can handle the truth but it feels really icky and I feel used and, out of respect, I just want resolution from the situation. I am fine with whatever the reason is, because I definitely wasn’t sure that these dates were going anywhere, but having sex and ending it so abruptly can be really damaging to a person without communication.” 

Am i being super psycho and an asshole, or am I justified in feeling used in thinking he’s a total asshole?

Edit/ Update: So he did respond! He was kind about everything and wrote “Again I’m sorry for last night and not communicating how I felt. That was not fare to you. I was also unsure about the dates we had and if it would go anywhere. I am not as attractive to you as much as I was hoping for. The sex ended prematurely because of the position I was in with my wrist and when I wear a condom I usually need oral before I put the condom on. Those were things I should have said or ask for. I have a hard time expressing how I feel in the moment, it’s something I know I need to work on. I honestly think you are an amazing person and wish you the best. I hope this helps” 

To be honest, I think that was more than fair and I definitely feel relieved that it ended for those reasons, rather than feeling like someone used me to get in my pants. I appreciate all the feedback on this cause I did feel a little crazy asking for a reason, I’ve just never been in a dating situation that had such poor communication and it did my head in when it ended like that. I am grateful that we didn’t continue to date just because we had sex and were on the same page about the actual relationship. Wasn’t going anywhere and in retrospect, I should follow my gut a little more if I find myself resistant/reluctant to dates BEFORE sleeping with a guy and setting better boundaries— that might make me the asshole to begin with. Also, 29 and mixing up fare and fair? Dealbreaker as it is. /s Anyways thanks for the support and input!!",56,54,0.85

1956,Not the A-hole,"I love my roommate. We have lived together for five years and have never had issues before this.

She recently started dating this guy from a very different background. We both moved out before we were 18, this guy still lives at home with his parents. He’s not allowed to have girls over so he *always* has to come here. Not a big deal, they usually hang in her room anyway and he has been cordial. We’re not friends but we’re at least civil and friendly.

He’s just so fucking loud. He comes in and slams the door. He starts greeting the cat by yelling at it. He’ll start having extremely loud conversations on the phone. He puts his phone on loud so everyone can hear him screaming with his buddies. And he only comes over late, since he works part time in a restaurant. It’s pretty much after every shift, he’s here

All of that is a lot and I’ve brought it up as an issue, and now if I’m trying to sleep I’ll text her asking to be quiet and she’ll usually answer with a “Sorry! You got it!” etc.

But the TV is mounted on the wall we share. And I hear it on low. I can sleep through a lot, but not a western film on 11 with shootouts and shit. 

One night was particularly bad, it was loud as fuck. I didn’t know if they were using it to cover up sex but it was 2 am and I had to be up at 5 for a meeting — and roomie was aware. I was absolutely exhausted. I texted her, waited 10 minutes, texted again, waited 5, and then sent “Hey, I really need to sleep and don’t want to knock in case you passed out or something, but you’re not answering me so I’m unplugging the Wi-Fi. Just plug in the green cord if you’re still up but please turn the volume down.”

It takes a second for her TV to lose the stream so I was in bed by the time it cut out. He ended up just leaving (i heard the door slam on the way out) and apparently she didn’t see my texts until the morning. We had a very nasty conversation the next day and things have not been the same between us.

1958,No A-holes here,"Recently at work, a customer asked me (23F) to coffee and I politely declined. I have one female coworker and she is a good 30 years older than me. She overheard this incident happen and watched out for me just in case I needed help (I was a little freaked out - this has never happened to me while I was working and this guy was the last customer to leave the building before I locked the door). Then, a couple days later, another customer asked me to dinner. Again, I declined and told my coworker about it because really? Twice in 3 days? What are the chances? We had a bit of a laugh.

THEN, a few days later, while I was walking to our building, I got catcalled from some guys in a passing car and just a day after that, I was helping train a new volunteer and HE asked for my number. Honestly, at this point, I was just feeling ticked off because I think it is incredibly rude to hit on someone while they're working. Like, I'm not smiling and being friendly because I'm flirting, it's literally my job!

I expressed all this to my coworker and the rest of the staff who knew the story. All of them are significantly older than me and they basically told me ""Enjoy it while you can, one day you'll miss this"" and I sensed that I had put them off with my complaining. I get the feeling they think I'm just fishing for compliments, or maybe flaunting my youth in their faces. I already felt embarrassed by all this and now I'm even more embarrassed.

I literally created a reddit account just because I had to ask somebody about this. So tell me . . . AITA?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a 8 months.  Prior to that he was in a relationship for about 2 years with his ex.  My boyfriend has a conference in NYC (its legit I checked).  However he told me he plans to stay with his ex since they are still friends.

Reddit, I really hate to be controlling and untrusting but this makes my insides turn upside down.  His ex only has a small studio with one bed which he said they would be sharing.  He said there relationship was long over and they were just good friends now, and it was normal for good friends to share a bed.  I asked what size bed and he didn't look at me in the eye and said ""twin"".  I broke down and told him I didn't want to control him but I was really not comfortable with this, and if he went through with this I would seriously have to consider ending the relationship.  I then said i wouldn't mind if they caught up for dinner in public or hanged out one night but this was too much.

He retorted that he was being open, and I have to trust him.  He then said me breaking down and crying about this was equivalent of ""manipulation and abuse"" and I was being ""abusive and controlling"".  We haven't talked about it in 2 days but he leaves friday.  AITA reddit for being a controlling GF?",231,385,0.95

1966,Not the A-hole,"I get a lot of deers in my front lawn, the neighborhood is full of little wooded areas where animals like to hang out. It's a shame that they had so much of their land taken, but for whatever reason the deer seem to congregate in my yard. I can have anywhere from 1 to 10 at a time on any given day, they're comfortable enough with me not to run away when I walk through my yard while they're around. 

The downside is this happens in my front yard facing the road. On a daily basis I have numerous cars stopping outside my house to look at the deer. Some only drive by slowly which is totally fine, but some will stop for 5-10 minutes outside my home. Some take photos, I've even had a handful of people get out of the car and start trying to talk to the deer. This happens easily 5+ times a day. 

I understand that deer are cute and that it's cool to see so many hanging around. However, I feel like this majorly reduces my privacy. I can't sit on my own porch because people are deer watching and I don't want to feel like I'm in a zoo enclosure. I don't want my home and inside my windows showing up in photos, nor do I want to show up in photos. I certainly don't want people getting outside of their cars and coo'ing to the deer in my yard at my property line. Most importantly, people don't watch the road when rubbernecking about the deer, we've had 2 near accidents already this year.

So I put up a privacy fence along my front yard property line. This ensures that unless someone comes into my driveway they cannot get a clear view of the deer in my yard. Since I did this, I've heard some complains from people around town as well as neighbors that I was being unfair and rude and that I shouldn't be bothered by this.

1967,Not the A-hole,"I'll try and be as factual as possible.   


In the middle of January my wife's family moved into the basement when their former home was condemned and their temporary housing ran out. The family consists of Mom (50s), Dad (50s), three brothers (from 19 to late 20s) and her trans sister (mid-30s) The only source of income for the entire family is dad's military pension.  Besides Dad, the only one who has any work history is the eldest. She sold cell phones for an electronics retailer for about a year, however it is now several years since she has worked.   


My basement is finished, has a second kitchen, but no bathroom, so we must share the only bathroom in the house which is on the second floor. There are many trips through our family room to go upstairs. Cleanliness has been an issue as well, there have been several times that I've found urine and feces on/around the toilet. Today, when I went to take a shower I found feces all over the shower... on the floor, in the drain, and the wall.  


At this point I feel like we are enabling their lifestyle, but also delaying the inevitable. I've asked my wife to have them leave by May 1 (I did this several weeks ago) but now as the day approaches I feel very guilty for returning them to homelessness. That being said, it is very hard to come home some nights (I work full time and have two side gigs) to a grown people who seem to be doing nothing to improve their situation.

1968,Not the A-hole,"This happened last night and it's still kind of ongoing. I think that I'm being reasonable but she is upset, and we're both not really speaking because of it.

So, a little bit of backstory first. Been with my girlfriend for 3 years, living together for 1. She's 25 and I'm 21 if it matters. We have a very good relationship and (IMO) a healthy sex life. Girlfriend has an extremely high sex drive, and I think mine is somewhere between average and high. This is probably our first semi 'big' argument we've ever had. Generally speaking we have amazing chemistry together.

Well last night we both went to bed, and my girlfriend tried to initiate sex but I turned her down. We had already had sex in the morning AND afternoon and I just wasn't feeling it, I wanted to go to sleep. Now after maybe 5 minutes I'm hearing my girlfriend moan and make a lot of noise and I realize she's masturbating. To my knowledge she's never done it before while I'm laying next to her, but she claims I usually already sleep so it could very well be. I thought it was weird but I brushed it off and tried to sleep.

This went on for at least 15 more minutes and she got louder and it was impossible for me to sleep, and I felt uncomfortable just laying there. So I turned to her and asked her if she could go to the bathroom or living room and do her thing there. She looked at me like I shit in her shoes and told me she wasn't going anywhere, and if I wanted her to stop I could help her out. I wasn't up for that so I told her to not do it when I'm trying to sleep and that it made me feel kind of weird. Again she refused and instead went on with masturbating, getting more loud and obviously taunting me. I eventually fell asleep after she was done. 

The next morning I confronted her and she still thinks she shouldn't have to go to a different place to masturbate, and that I'm making things weird. It sort of makes me uncomfortable and I just wanted to sleep. She gets really moody when she's horny so I understand she needs to take care of herself, but I would rather not be laying down next to her when she does.

Edit: Clarification: When I'm sleeping she can masturbate because I won't notice, but when I'm still awake I would rather see her go somewhere else.

Edit 2: I will be talking to her tonight, it doesn't sit completely right with me. Yes, she's a very needy person when it comes to sex and when she's in the mood we basically always have sex, because I want her to be satisfied. It doesn't exactly matter if I turn her down or not, it will happen anyways. Also I've seen people accuse her of rape because she sometimes starts riding me when I'm asleep, but I think that's taking things way too far. Once I'm awake I'll roll with it usually, but I would rather be awake in the first place of course.

Am I the asshole here?",645,1663,0.95
1969,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory this did not happen recently.

My birthday is a week before Christmas. I have a twin and an emotionally distant/inactive family. So my birthday has been mostly ignored my entire life.

My boyfriend thinks that’s awful. His family does huge birthday parties and dinners and cakes – the whole nine yards. He and his mom were horrified that my mom didn’t even call on my big day.

Last year, my actual birthday fell on the same day as BF’s family Christmas party. That’s fine and important, so we decided to do my birthday 1 day early.

My BF is loving and sweet, but he sucks at time management. He’s always showing up hours late to my house when I have dinner ready for him, making me wait 30 minutes while he fiddles with something on the way out the door, etc.

The day of my “pre birthday,” we planned to spend the day together –hiking and grabbing cocktails, then getting a nice dinner.

BF got distracted by something in the garage that had been broken for 5+ years. He decided to start working on it while I waited for him upstairs. Every so often, I checked in with him and he always said he was almost done.

Fast forward 8 hours. It’s 7pm. I’m starving and I’ve been alone all day waiting. He finally comes up and seems confused that I’m upset. The entire day is basically wasted, and to top it off, he never made reservations for dinner, so we end up having to try 3 different places and finally get seated around 8:30pm.

I was not pleased. He didn’t understand. The dinner was expensive and the waitress brought a scoop of ice cream to the table, so he was dumbfounded that I was irritated. He said because it wasn’t technically my birthday until the next day, it wasn’t a big deal we didn’t end up doing anything fun.

Next day was his family’s xmas party, so I spent my whole birthday watching other people get presents. His grandparents did give me a puzzle, which was really sweet of them. Still, call me a princess, but it’s not that fun to watch BF receive $1,000+ in gifts from 10 family members on my own birthday.

I cried in the car on the way home. I wasn’t mad, per se. It’s just that he and his mom had promised for months that my birthday would be special, that they would make up for the lifetime of neglect I’d had with my family, and then when the day actually came, it was the usual letdown.

Late that night, BF gifted me an expensive watch. His POV was – “See? I got you something nice, don’t you feel silly for being upset?”

He wasn’t trying to be demeaning. He really was just trying to say, see, it’s not all bad, it’s okay. And I think he was disappointed that I wasn’t giddy just because I got an expensive gift. What I really wanted was a special day with him.

We don’t talk about it anymore, and we’re in a great place, but I still think about it. I did get a birthday dinner and I did get a fancy watch… but I still feel like my time and priorities were disrespected. AITA?",61,270,0.98

We just moved in this week and haven’t had any time to move in any furniture such as couches.  All we really have is our beds, desks, drawers and some chairs for the living room and a table.  I have a double bed in my room while he has a single.  

Tonight his GF (22F) iis coming for the week (Until sunday morning) to visit.   She graduates in the spring.  This is fine and isn’t a problem.  She is also bringing her sister (18 f) who is a senior in high school and shares the same spring break as her sister.  This also isn’t really a problem except we literally have no where for her to sleep.  I thought they would figure it out, but my roommate just approached and asked if she could bunk with me for the week.  Now I will admit, the sister is very smart (going to school in Biomedical Engineering) and she is very attractive and pretty,  and I actually would love to get to know her and spend time with her however I just don’t feel comfortable with this arrangement.  

I told him sorry, but no.  He then said she had a huge crush on me and this was every guys dream, he said she told her sister she wanted to share the bed with a older, mature male.  This was really tempting as I don’t really have much experience being intimate with girls.  However I still said no, i said too much could go wrong.  I suggested my roommate buy a air matress for her but he said no.  His GF then called me and said please, it would be so much fun and she would make sure her sister behaved.  I said I would think about it.  My roommate then began to get angry and said “so you think she’s hot, smart, and a great personality, but you’re playing hard to get.

1973,No A-holes here,"A month and a half ago, we hired a new guy named Joey who is in his mid-20’s, and who has high-functioning autism. He is a very bright guy and a good addition to our team. While people like him very much, he struggles a bit socially. His special interest that everyone who works with him gets hears about involves the box office grosses of movies. Joey, since he was a kid, has been doing unending research and extensive calculations to determine the inflated box office grosses of thousands (or maybe even much more than that) of different movies, and their rank in the “all-time” list. As ticket prices are constantly inflating and new movies are constantly coming out, this continues to be a full-time hobby/interest for him.

He talks about box office grosses of movies and his calculations **endlessly** in the workplace. I have never heard him discussing with his coworkers any of the things usually talked about - family, school, things going on at work, sports, the news, etc. Just box office grosses of movies; and once he gets talking about it, it’s hard to get in a word edgewise or get him to change the subject. Joey has an extremely photographic memory and will recite countless numbers, statistics, percentages and dates purely from memory in a professor/scholar-like manner. Like, “Did you know that “Despicable Me 3” had a 2019 inflated box office gross of 1.43 billion, which is 10 percent greater than the inflated gross of its predecessor, “Despicable Me 2”, and a 14 percent greater gross than the first, “Despicable Me”?”

In moderation, his statistics are interesting, but he has talked about box office grosses **so much** that I now see employees’ eyes glazing over whenever he brings the subject up, and sometimes even people leaving the room. Joey doesn’t seem to notice this at all. The other week, during one of his shifts, I pulled him into my office and had a quick talk with him. 

I told him how admirable I find it that he’s put so much effort into researching box office grosses, and what an interesting topic it is, naming some of my favorite movies and having him respond with their grosses. But I told Joey that it’s a topic that, like any other, is best spoken about in moderation. I emphasized how much everybody would love to hear more about **him**; what’s going on in his life, what his other interests besides box office grosses are, about his school, etc.

He acted very hurt by this meeting, but seemed to be over it by the next day; and over the past week has taken my advice and started talking with his coworkers about things other than his special interest. I, and everyone else, have learned more about him in this past week than we did all the previous time he was employed here. He still talks about movie grosses, but much, much less.

I won the ugliest guy in high school competition 4 years in a row and was relentlessly bullied.
Fortunately college is a lot better. I still don't have any friends but I get to keep to myself and no one bullies me as such. I get to make my own little world and I feel fortunate:)

When I was walking to the library today, an extremely attractive woman started hitting on me. At first I was in disbelief and asked her if she had the wrong person. But she said she would be willing to carry my babies in a joking tone and had a chat with me.
After about 2 minutes and me literally holding back tears because I had never felt so loved in my life, she tells me she was filming a 'fun' YouTube video where she told random guys she would have their babies.
Apparently the channel is pretty popular and people like stuff like this.
I told her I wasn't comfortable with being in the video and that this was harmful and would ruin people's self esteem. She tells me I should feel good because I am 'definitely not the best looking guy on campus' and that they needed 10-15 more people to finish the video.

I was honestly indifferent at the ugly part because I was used to it but this felt like a shitty thing but I didn't want other guys to go through it and cameras were technically not allowed so I reported to the campus authorities about it and they have banned anyone from their channel from shooting videos at our university again.

No big deal it was an accident. I turned off the feature that allows fire to spread (but never told her or the kids about it so it isn’t an excuse for what happened-she can’t say she didn’t know fire spreads because after the first incident with both boys screaming in panic that their base was burning down, she knew what could happen.) I eventually had to do some tree clearing and turned the fire spreads option back on-and apparently forgot to turn it back off because today my sister joined the game and burned down the whole city as she jokingly laughed maniacally on FaceTime.

We’ve spent a lot of time talking about how much time and effort I have put into this game, so she was aware she was being mean, but said she thought it would be funny. She also said she didn’t anticipate that the entire pirate themed town we were in was made of wood and that the fire would spread to every building and the railway and destroy a hundred hours of build time. I can’t help but be angry and so frustrated. I know it’s just a game, but it’s also a whole big chunk of my time and creative energy that she destroyed because of a joke. And she also really upset my son and her own son and taught them what I think was a really terrible lesson. So, should I let this go? AITA for being angry that my sister destroyed my Minecraft world? She told me to “grow up” and that if I had that much time on my hands, maybe I should get a job. I hung up on her and haven’t answered her calls or texts all day. 

Tl:dr: AITA for getting mad at my grown sister for destroying my Minecraft world I made with my son and nephew?

Update: we are playing Minecraft Pocket Edition so as long as I prevent my phone from backing up tonight, I think I can restore the whole thing on the new phone I’m getting on Wednesday. I don’t want to bother with it since I also broke my phone today and I can’t play with this broken glass anyways-it was totally unrelated to the Minecraft misadventure. but I think I can get the world back since it backed up last night. A more important update is that apparently just before my sister joined us on my world, she had been playing with the boys by herself and they destroyed her house with TNT and even killed her dog and all her llamas. my son admitted it all. She had leave the world to stop their paths of destruction. She was trying to teach them a lesson about being bullies and really didn’t realize it would burn down the whole pirate town. I forgave her, especially after learning what my son had just done to his Aunt just before the whole thing happened. She does have a twisted sense of humor and I didn’t agree with what she did, but for the record, the boys only screamed and cried during the original accidental burning down of the house. They weren’t as upset today as I would have expected and that made more sense when I found out what had happened just before. Sorry for the typos and punctuatuon errors, it’s hard to see through my poor broken phone’s screen. Thanks again to everyone.",310,2775,0.96

We were playing this silly game yesterday and she asked me one superficial thing I would change about her body if I could.
I just replied saying her body was michelangelo's last creation and she was beautiful.
But then she asked me if there was anything I wanted to change.
So I just told her that shaving legs would be nice since they feel good when they are smooth and all.

1979,Not the A-hole,"I'm 22/F, sign and decal installer for a small local family business, I work alone for the first and last hour of the day, otherwise I work with my manager/boss' son. Everyone else works a town away in our second location. Business is slow and I know my boss is worried, so we need all the orders we can get. 

Last Friday a regular customer came into the shop to have some decals stuck on his car at the end of the day. He orders decals and signs regularly,  which we obviously need right now, he is also an obvious cokehead and yells every word and is very aggressive in his actions. He is a very large man. After paying for the decals, we walk to the back where the shop is and he grabs me by the shoulders and begins roughly tossing me about and making some joke about me messing up his decals, I fake laugh it off. He let's go of me and we proceed to the shop. 

I begin putting the decals on and he comes up next to me and says the following:

Him: So when does the strip show start?
Me: What?
Him: When are you gonna get naked for me?

I fake laugh and he apologizes. He follows me to the other side of the car and says the following:

Him: Are you a water girl?
Me: What do you mean?
Him: Do you like to swim?
Me: Yeah I guess so
Him: I knew it, what do you wear swimming? Do you wear bikinis?

I sort of started ignoring him and once I finished the decals he left like normal and it was fine. I didn't feel unsafe but I did feel embarrassed and I'm not sure if I'm justified in feeling that way. I have more installs coming up with this customer but I don't want to do them, and I'm worried that if I ask my manager to do them in my place he will think I'm being dramatic and a bit of a baby.

On the flip side, if he sees this as harassment he may cancel further orders with this customer and I will be to blame for losing us business that we need.

Would I be an asshole for making a big deal about something that may not even be an issue and possibly losing a regular customer for nothing? I didn't feel unsafe, I wasn't touched sexually and the man said he was joking around so I truly think I may be overreacting and would like an outside perspective.

1981,Not the A-hole,"First post EVER, so be easy on me. So a little background. I (29M) come from a family of 5, I have a girlfriend and no kids. I have one brother (38) and one sister (34). My brother is not married, nor has kids. My sister on the other hand, is married and has 5 kids. My sisters family is blended, 2 belong to the father, 2 belong to my sister and 1 they had together. 

So here is the issue...

Every time we plan something in the family, it has to revolve around my sister and the kids. Making the plans never involve me or my brother. 

I get it, when we have family gatherings, everyone should be there or it would be nice to attempt to have everyone there.

Well, Easter is coming up and I asked my mom, last Thursday, what we were doing and when we are getting together. She stated that she would have to get back to me on the Saturday after she can schedule something with my sister. Cool. But she didn’t get back to me and neither did my sister. 

So my girlfriend, who has a split family, made plans today with both sides of her family for the morning and the afternoon. I really want to attend her fathers side of Easter... buttt that would mean that I miss out on my family’s Easter. 
I told my mom this and she blew up on me and said that it is always about my girlfriend’s family. Then she texted my sister and my sister threw it in my face that “I’m not taking time for my immediate family.”
At this point in time, I don’t want to attend my family’s Easter. AITA for not attending until my girlfriend and I see both of her family’s? 

Thanks in advance.",23,38,0.95
1982,Asshole,"Had the day off today, much needed time to stay home and hangout with my wife and 2 year old daughter. 

During our daughter's nap my wife started tidying up a bit while I watched some TV. About 20 minutes later I (not so subtlety) hinted to if she wanted to ""take a break"" from cleaning. She scoffed and said no that she needed to finish cleaning. I was a little disappointed and probably let it show in my facial expressions, but said okay and went back to the couch. She came out 5 minutes later in an almost exasperated tone and said ""okay fine we can go have sex then if you really want to""

I felt completely belittled and almost like it would have felt like begging if I said okay. So I declined and and said, ""that's okay, you can finish what you're doing."" She countered with ""well you're just going to be upset at me if we don't so let's just go to the bedroom."" I then restated that I didn't want to anymore and it was fine, she could go back to what she was doing, which she then did. 

Honestly I feel a little degraded that my wife acted like it was such an inconvenience to have sex with me. We've been married 5 years and our sex life has definitely slowed down over the last 2 since having kids, but this is a first.

1985,Not the A-hole,"So I will try to make this concise. I own a home. Met gf long after I bought the house, she does not pay rent or contribute to the upkeep beyond the occasional groceries, which for the most part we split evenly, or I end up paying a little more to help her out.   
The loft in the house is more or less a gaming room. My xbox, ps4, switch, shield, they are all connected there. More importantly, I am literally the only person who uses the room. If anyone is in there, they are there with me. I have never seen anyone so much as using the TV to watch netflix. So I got some nice metal posters of some games I like, that are tasteful (no anime girls with giant tits). One of the posters is of master chief, another last of us, and one of mass effect. GF basically threw a fit that she didn't even want them to be in her eye sight as she left or went to the bedroom. I objected because I am a huge gamer and all of the posters were from my favorite games (minus FF7 cuz I didn't see a good poster). They are also the nice metalic ones, not some cheapy poster so they look clean. I tried to make, in my opinion, reasonable arguments that the posters fit the theme of the room, were tasteful, and I was the only one who used that room, and also it made me happy to see them because it brings back fond memories. She tried to tell me I could only put them in my office (yes, she in fact tried to ""tell me,"" not ask) so she would not have to see them. The office gets used occasionally when I have to type something, but I wouldn't see them often, and they'd just be scattered about in the room that in my opinion it doesn't even make sense to have them in. So I stopped debating with her, got the posters anyway, and put them up. This basically started WW3. Was I in the right here? I know the argument could be made it is my house and I can do what I want, but I am curious mostly what other women have to say about this. Obviously all opinions are welcome though.

1986,Asshole,"I am using a throwaway since I am moderator on several of the subs that have to do with my hobby of cosplay, anime and hentai. 

This is one of those ones where I see my self as being 80% right but I want to be fair because honestly I depend on my parents for a lot of stuff (rent, tuition, food, car insurance). 

I am huge into cosplay and gaming. It has been my dream to go to a big convention in my cosplay. A friend suggested we got to LVL UP since it has everything we like. The badges aren't super expensive but we decided we wanted to super splurge on accomodations so maybe we could host parties in our room. So the total cost of my trip including everything (airfare, room, estimate for food, badge) is about $3500. I had $2000 that I was supposed to pay towards my credit card but I decided to get the rest I would get a pay day loan this was back in march so the trip is all paid for. 

I wanted to keep it a secret from my parents but I accidentally missed my first payment to the pay day loan and for some god knows how reason the people at the pay day loan place did a search for my name since I as ducking their calls until I could borrow some money from a friend and they called my parents home number looking for me (I can't even imagine this is legal!?!) 

So here's the deal, I'm no like so dense that I don't understand I messed up. I mean I know that I **NEED** to pay my debts. But here's the deal, I mean I'm only in college once and I only get to do things like LVLUP while I'm young. I also think this was a very normal mistake and my parents should give me enough room to make mistakes and learn from them. 

But my parents are freaking the hell out. My dad has basically said this is it, that after the credit card debt and my grades and now the pay day loan and missing a payment I have shown a level if irresponsibility that he can't trust me any more and I either move home to go to community college and work for his company or he cuts me off for good. As harsh as that was my mom was even worse and she literally screamed at me like cussing names and told me that they didn't raise me like this and I acting like a ""spoiled Instagram asshole.""

We met at university and got married after 2 years of dating. He's a great guy and recently I've been wanting him to embrace his culture because I love my Mexican culture and I don't want him to feel that he has to hide it here in the U.S. or feel that he won't be accepted. However, my mom seems to have such a problem with it and always says racist things to him. One time in particular we were having thanksgiving at my Grandma's house and he was charming everyone and out of nowhere my mom comes in and says ""watch out for these people that come here to be students because they can secretly be terrorists"". He still to this day hasn't forgotten about that. Oh and on the day of our wedding, that my mom didn't attend, she admitted that she'd have preferred if I had married a white guy...IN FRONT OF MY HUSBAND!! She also has referred to his parents as ""those people"" numerous times in front of him. Honestly if anyone said that to me I would've gone full on super saiyyan so I commend him for keeping quiet. I told him that next time he should stand up for himself and not put up with this treatment. His parents are coming to visit in May for our college graduation and he doesn't want my parents to meet his parents because he doesn't want them to be disrespected, which I completely understand. He also doesn't want to come visit my parents for Easter Holiday which sucks because I love him and want him around. I know I have to have a discussion with my mom.

Ok so... We had been together for almost 6 years when ""John"" decided to break up with me. We had only been together for a few months before we moved in together. We were able to move into an apartment I knew was available just because of my knowledge of the area and at that time I knew the landlord (as I had been a previous tenant of his.) After living together for about a year we were allowed to get a pet. ""John"" didn't want a pet but agreed to let me take the dog when some friends were no longer able to keep her. My name is on all her papers, including vet records and microchip.

When we broke up it was out of the blue for me. It turned my whole world upside down. He assumed I would move out. I told him I would give him time to find somewhere else to go but I would be staying in the apartment and keeping the dog. My thinking behind this was because this was not a mutual break up and it pretty much blindsided me. This was his decision, not one that we made together. He's not thrilled about finding somewhere else to live, realizing he's going to miss the dog and he keeps saying it's not fair that I get both.

I could understand letting him have one or the other if it was a mutual breakup but since it was a big surprise for me I felt like he shouldn't get to take my home and def not my dog.

1992,Not the A-hole,"I recently got a new big boy job in a new city. My girlfriend and I will be moving everything across states to start our new lives together. I’m lucky that my new job will be paying for my moving costs. I’m supposed to save all of my receipts related to moving, and they will reimburse me once I get there. 


My girlfriend’s brother has a little towing business and also owns a truck that’s big enough to move all of our stuff. When he and my GF heard that my company will be paying moving costs, he got the idea to help us move our stuff, and invoice us through his towing company (not a moving company, he’s usually not in the business of moving people). He and my GF both think it’ll be a nice little road trip where the gas, food, and lodging will be paid for by my new company. On top of it, he would get to pocket a small profit. 


I think that while this little scheme isn’t fraud per se (GF’s bro will be proving us a service and we’re paying him for it), it’s not something I’m comfortable with. I think my company means to be paying for a moving company. I don’t feel comfortable submitting a receipt from a company that’s a towing company instead of a moving company, should my new employer google my submitted my receipts. In addition, I still have to do all the work of packing and helping load boxes and furniture, which would all be done by a legit moving company. In addition, their attitude just felt like it’s about pocketing as much money from my employer as possible, before I’d even started working there.

Going to try and keep it simple. My ex and I broke up about a month ago. We're still in contact, being civil and helping each other out. 

Last year my uncle got very creepy towards her. He had a big pool party with a bunch of family and me and my ex went. She didn't tell me until a few weeks later, but while there, he grabbed her ass twice. She was too afraid to tell me because she didn't want to cause drama and thought it was harmless, but was obviously uncomfortable.

Obviously I flipped out, that shit is not okay and I felt horrible that she was afraid to tell me and had to deal with that. Instead of freak out on him, I just cut him off. I knew the creepy fuck wouldn't care/change if I did or said anything.

Fast forward a few months, my ex was in Italy. He messaged her on Facebook blatantly asking her to come to his house when she got back. She immediately told me and sent me screenshots as proof. This time I messaged him and freaked out, his response was like 4 words. I made her block him, I told my mom, his sister, and my other uncle, his brother. They have barely interacted with him since but it's their brother, so I can't blame them for staying in contact.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I hadn't talked to my ex in a few days, but we got together to talk. Then she sheepishly told me he messaged her and not only tried to convince her to go to dinner with him, but he literally offered her money, obviously for sex.

I can't hold back this time, she gave me screenshots and I'm about to blow his spot up, sending them to his wife and son (who's like 22 and is close to my mom/siblings).",242,2724,0.98
1996,Not the A-hole,"We've been married several years now, and, up until the past 6 months to a year, I've had a very high sex drive. We used to have sex at least 3 times a week. We had a very rough year last year and almost split up a couple times. After that, my desire for sex practically went to nothing almost overnight and we have sex maybe once every other week, and only after he has spent days sulking and I finally give in just to keep the peace. It's gotten to the point now that I barely even want him to touch me, because I know it's going to lead to him trying to cop a feel.

We can be watching tv and he wants to try and rub his hands all over me and get things started when all I want is to be left alone and watch tv. He says me rejecting his advances makes him feel like I don't love him anymore and that it's my job as his wife. He says he feels used because we only have sex on my terms. 

I feel like we do need to work out some kind of compromise, but it's so hard when it seems like every time he touches me he wants sex. This is actually really hard for me as I'm a cuddler and now I feel like I can't even do that as it leads to him getting handsy.

ETA: Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to this. I figure it's best to just add all this here, rather than nested in replies.

The issue we almost split up over was I made a guy friend who liked me. I flirted back, but had zero intentions of taking it anywhere and always shot him down when he tried anything. Never hung out, just texted. Husband found out and then exploited it for his own sexual desire of me sleeping with someone else, which he'd been trying to convince me to do since we got married.

Took over a year, but he finally got his wish. He immediately regretted it, and flipped the psycho switch. Had me share my GPS location with him at all times, stayed logged into my Facebook to see if I messaged him, constantly went through my phone records... even went so far as to put cameras in our house (one in our bedroom) just to see if I was bringing him home. I literally felt like a prisoner. Couldn't talk to my best friend or even my parents without him acting like I was going behind his back to talk to the guy.

He tells me he doesnt want sex if I'm not going to be into it, but I have literally woken up with my pants down and him trying to stick it in. I'm humped and groped on all night long, even when he's sleeping. He gets manipulative and lashes out when he doesn't get his way, which only makes it worse.

1998,No A-holes here,"So, I posted on a thread in a Canadian subreddit about my Province’s new law, which presumes that, unless you opt out of it, you are going to be donating organs upon death. I said that I did not want to donate my organs, because of some personal reasons, which are as follows:

I) Not my thing (I probably could’ve worded this better, but what I should’ve said was that I don’t like people making decisions for me)

II) I’m not quite sure if all my organs are healthy, and I don’t want to waste the surgical team’s time cutting them out if it’s all for naught.

III) The fear of a 1 in a Million chance that I’m mistaken for dead after an accident, and wake up in the middle of being operated on.

Someone else responded to me, with what I interpret as hostility (I have Autism, so I can’t properly read people’s emotions, let alone via the internet...). They said: 

>It’s not your thing? What is not your thing, helping other humans. You would rather your organs go into a garbage can than helping someone live? So you are conscientious of wasting the surgical team’s time (aprox 1-2h – depending on how many organs), but you equally don’t acknowledge the extended life (and better quality of life), for up to the 8 recipients of the organs (not to mention skin/bones for burn/accident victims). Obviously, the surgical team will assess your organs for health prior to using them. Honestly, the chances of one’s organs actually being used for transplant are pretty low, but as a society, would you not rather have a large donation group with minimal usage, or a small donation group with even less usage. As for the fear… that is nonsense. There have to be extensive tests done prior to surgery (3 criteria). It’s not like your organs are going to be any use to you once you die.

https://imgur.com/a/DCOjWeg


I adopted the cat (or rather rescued it) during early winter. He was wet, skinny and ginger, clearly malnourished and it took me half an hour to catch him.

I took him to the vet. He was around 1,5 year old, sick, fur was in terrible shape, falling out, infected eyes etc

Now he is healthy, kinda on the fat side, black - not ginger - and full of energy. I thought i was taking a really good care of him - 70% meat wet canned food, no grain, raw meat with yolk once a week, 100% meat snacks, water fountain to encourage drinking etc. The best I can afford basically.

 But recently my aunt, a countryside vet, said i am selfish for keeping him. She applauded me for rescuing him in cold winter but she said I should give him away to a ""better home"". When i questioned why was mine bad and listed or food accommodations, she said it doesnt matter. That the cat should have the opportunity to roam the outside and ""live in his natural habitat"" and that i am robbing him of important cat experience when I keep him in my small apartment. 

What you need to know is, I tried to walk him but he freaked out on me, would jump in front of a car if i wasnt holding his leash and only stopped panicking back at home.

But she made a pretty convincing argument that I adopted him because I love cats not because I thought thats the best for him and that I should give him to a good family that lives outside of town or has a backyard at least. She used the vet card and how she knows she will be happier outside instead of being ""jailed"" in a 1 room flat.
