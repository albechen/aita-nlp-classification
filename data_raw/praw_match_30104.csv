0,not the a-hole,"So my SIL is about to pop, due any day now. My father's 50th birthday is in 2 weeks, and my fiancé and I will be taking a trip down to celebrate A WEEK BEFORE (keep this in mind it's important). This trip is to a halfway point about 3 hours from where we live, it's a small 2 bedroom hunting cabin that I spent my summers in. There's no cable or WiFi, no cell signal, just you and nature. The cabin is significant to my father and I so we chose there to meet up.

Now. My SIL Mary has been voicing that she wants to go too, which means bringing the baby. While I understand that Baby will be my dad and step mom's first grand kid, I have no desire to be stuck around a screaming infant for 4 days with no relief. Mary and my step brother live within an hour of my parents, they're over there all the time. I kind of want 1 on 1 time with my dad before we move across the country at the end of the month.

Further, my fiancé is not experienced around children, and currently has a low tolerance due to his stress at work. And my step brothers and SIL will be going to the actual birthday party on Dads birthday. AITA for not wanting a weeks-old baby at a small birthday celebration? ",19,61,0.95
1,COMMUNICATE,"A couple years ago I mentioned to my girlfriend in some conversation that I'd be fine with supporting her financially and the like. This was before I even moved out of my parents house and had my own stable income. Now that I've moved out and am living on my own and I've seen that she's not the best with money, I no longer see that as feasible. Over time my opinion changed.

One night she started a fight with me because I didn't buy her a drink after she insisted I buy it for her because it's ""only $1"". She has her own money from her parents and also lives with them. During the fight she went on and told me how I must've ""been lying"" about being fine with supporting her... 2 years ago. I told her that my opinion on that changed and I would expect her to have her own income if we get married

There have been other times too where she tried to hold me to opinions I had two years ago when we first started dating. I find her doing this to be incredibly childish because it's been two years and obviously since I'm now on my own and living in the real world my opinions on certain things change.",19,53,0.92
2,not the a-hole,"I started talking to this girl (we will call her Janice) a week ago, and we seem to hit it off on OKC’s chat. Janice’s profile seemed alright and I found her attractive, and we were both looking for something serious and long term.

The two of us eventually decide that we can meet over the weekend on Sun afternoon. Janice lives 2 hours away from me at a smaller city (I am at one of the bigger cities in the states). So, I decide to make the trip to a public place close to her so we can meet for the very first time in person, because I have friends in a different city not so far away from her. And I was planning to crash at their place for the night since I got Monday off. We also decided early on to not share any personally identifiable info (like last names, phone #s etc.). If we met at a public place at a specified time, it wouldn’t be that difficult to find each other since we know how either of us look like. And OKC’s app can be backup in case plans change last second. I always do that if I am meeting someone new through the interwebs/darkweb, and don’t share those details if both of us are happy with doing so until after the first meet/date.

Ff to last evening, we were chatting and somehow, we end up low-key sexting. We both gave in and did so for a good hour or so, it was hot, and I hate doing so with strangers, but my knees can only take so much. This morning though, Janice starts telling me that she can’t wait till Sun, and clears up Sat (which she was spending with one her friends). I cannot drive over on Sat because I had other errands. Janice is OK with driving over to my city on Sat and that seemed like an OK compromise. But turns out she gets super-anxious driving in big cities with traffic. The thing is most public places are in the heart of the city. Janice suggests if she could drive up to my place and if we could then drive down to the city or take an Uber together. I initially say no, but later end up going along with (even though I hated it). After some time, Janice starts complaining about how she has to drive 4 hours to meet me, and that she wished she had family/friends in the city I live in so she could stay over for the weekend, and that she’d be spending all weekend on the road. And kept doing that every time I tried to talk about something else. I do night shifts, and this really was cutting through my skin of patience, so I tell her that if our date goes well, she’d be more than welcome to crash at my place for the night or the weekend depending on her plans for Sun. That seemed to stop her from complaining. And by stop, I mean just completely stop sending me messages.

I assumed Janice got busy so I took a nap before my classes. I woke up at noon, and got several messages for her with a completely different tone. She called me a creep for trying to bring her to my place for an entire weekend before even meeting her. And doesn’t feel comfortable knowing I am OK with bringing complete strangers to my personal space like that. I re-iterate that I was offering in case she wanted to get some rest, if driving back seems exhausting and only if I feel comfortable with her after meeting her in person. Janice tells me how I am probably just looking for sex and want to force her into sex, and that our height difference makes it easy for me to rape her (she’s more than a foot shorter than me). This infuriated me like crazy because we’ve talked about the height difference before. She was always intimidated by it, and me being bigger than most people didn’t help that matter. I was cranky and groggy because naps are shit and I’ve still got a long day ahead of me. So, I tell her that she does not have to go out to meet someone that she isn’t comfortable. She lashes out further and calls me a dick for saying things she never implied and that I pulled the plug without even trying. That men like me are pigs and like putting their appendages in every hole they desire, regardless of age, gender or consent. I told her I found double-standards annoying earlier and she seemed to use it perfectly to provoke me. I call her the shallowest waste of a hole that no man wants to stick appendages into, yeah I suck at these (I have been told my use of profanity is cringe-worthy so I try not to use it), block her and delete the messages and was in awe how things turned out to be over the course of the week. 

I still don’t understand what I said, implied, assumed or did wrong. I know this story is biased and one-sided but that’s the most objective I can be right.

3,no a--holes here,"My wife thinks I'm needlessly being an asshole here.

We had a note through the door of our flat a few weeks ago with a little laminated ticket someone had made saying ""resident"" on it. Evidently the resident's committee of the building have decided that they want to keep an eye on who is parking where. I didn't bother putting it on the car because I know everyone (there's 20 flats) and we have a distinctive car that everyone knows is ours, which is always parked in the same spot of an evening because the other spaces are difficult with my wife's mobility issues and the car seat for our son.

Anyway yesterday I spot out the window one of our neighbours examining the car and noting something down on a clipboard. I ask him if he needs any help getting a closer look. He tells me if I don't put the ticket he's made on the car then it'll have to be towed. I tell him I'm not going to bother because everyone knows it's our car, it's in our space, they have no right to tow cars here anyway because there are no parking enforcement signs and that he can get over himself.

He tells me ""Well we've all decided this is what we're doing"" and suggests that we don't have the right to complain because everyone else owns their flat and ours we rent.

I feel that (and my wife agrees) some of the residents are opposed to the flats being let out and that they want to force us out and the owner of ours to sell up. However she thinks I'm being an asshole by not complying with what she rightly points out is a pretty bloody minor demand.

However I feel that if I'm not invited to be a part of the residents' committee and not part of the decision making process and have no contract or agreement with them, they have no right to try and enforce any daft demands on us. I told Mrs andthecircus that I'm nipping it in the bud here by ignoring this rubbish. She'd rather keep the peace.

7,not the a-hole,"I requested four days off of work, months in advance. It wasn't for any good reason, I got tickets to go to SDCC with a friend. I work in fast food and we're always short handed, but that's by design. There's a stack of applications on the desk but the RGM and the supervisor would rather hire very few people and force everyone else to work the jobs of three people so their bonus at the end of the year is bigger. I've also never called out sick before, and the only other time I requested days off was two days when I was part time and I put them in months in advance.

Now, I've worked at this store for nearly a year. It was my first job, and I started out part time. However, I was quickly made full time, and I'm the only full time non manager in the store. Many of the managers have complimented my work ethic. That's not even me tooting my own horn, most of the people we hire do the bare minimum, call out constantly, then finally quit a few months later.

When my manager told me that she probably wouldn't be able to give me my days off I started telling my coworkers that I was searching for another job and would quit  if I didn't get them. I didn't tell her directly, but because fast food is barely a step up from high school in that everyone lives on gossip and drama, I knew she would hear it one way or another. It should also be mentioned that this wasn't a hollow threat, either. I felt entitled to these days. I put in applications elsewhere and brought a letter of resignation with me on the day the schedule came out. This wasn't just over comic con, either, it was a culmination of fast food being a soul sucking hell, shitty managers unwilling to spend money to fix anything (we almost got closed down during our last corporate visit because so many of our machines were broken. They put in no uncertain terms that the reason our score was so low was because of how much shit was broken, but the supervisor bitched at all the employees who did everything right nonetheless), and just a generally shitty work environment. But me not getting those days off would have been the straw that broke the camels back.

Anywho, I know I turned into a bit of a prick at the threat of not getting my days off, but as one of the hardest working people in that store I feel like I deserved a little break. Now that it's over and done with I feel kind of bad for how things played out (not for going to comic con, I had a blast), but it's really not my fault that they fucked themselves over by hiring only a few people and placing a ton of responsibility on minimum wage employees.

10,not the a-hole,"So my girlfriend has been working at this new place for 7 months, and at first she really like it, but after a few months the work load increased. She was only contracted for 18 hours part time work a week (as she is a student), but is frequently being kept two hours after work to do things she is neither trained, nor contracted for, and often ends up working a 26+ hour a week.

He sometimes brings her in on Sundays, and after her day at uni has finished on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.

She doesn't always get paid for these extra hours either, and he keeps no records she was there on those days.

This might be acceptable if she wasn't also a part time student.
To top it off, she has been complaining for the last 3 months or so that her boss is constantly on her case. That he expects more from her than anyone else, and refuses to let her take holidays (that she is legally and contractually entitled too) on the days she wants,and instead just gives her them on random days, when she doesn't want them.

After the 100th complaint about him at dinner, I had enough, and called him up. My GF knew I was going to do it.

My intention was to get him to relent, but I was more than willing to follow through on my threat (see below), as I am financially capable of supporting her for a few months while she gets a new job.

After the usual introductions and why I'm calling, it went a little like this. I (OP), will be 'M'. My GF will be 'GF' and her boss will be 'B'.

M: My girlfriend has been coming home late every evening, she's tired, and when she gets home, she still has two-three hours of studying to work through, and you keep her late every day. She's not allowed to say no, but I can say no. She's not doing that anymore. She's going in on the contracting hours, and leaving on her contracted hours. 18 hours a week. 3 days a week. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. She won't be coming in on Sundays. She won't come in for 'a few hours' after Uni.

B: You don't have any right to speak to me like that. She will work when I say she works.

M: No. She won't. She will work what her contract says she works. If you want her to work different hours, draft a new contract, which says she will be paid for these hours, and stipulating her new role with these new duties, resulting in better pay. Otherwise she won't be coming in at all. And I will speak to you however I want.

B: Then she won't have a job.

M: Then you won't have a slave to boss around all day with no credit. And I'll be calling the Department for Work and Pensions and telling them of your business practices, if she suffers any negative consequences because of this.

B: ... Tell her I'll discuss this with her tomorrow.

M: I will. But just so you know she will be looking for a new job as of tomorrow. She will continue to do her best for you as she always has, but consider this informal notice of her desire to quit. She will give formal notice when she has a new job.

Hang up

GF, who was sat there listening quietly but not interjecting, told me ""I shouldn't have said that"" and ""It's fine"".

I said I don't think she has to put up with that, and to tell the truth I think she should have stood up for herself weeks ago.

GF: ""I can't get another job like that with those hours""

M: ""You can, there are loads of places. And it was only half serious anyway. You can stay there indefinitely so long as he behaves himself.""

GF: ""What if he fires me?""

M: ""He can't fire you for something someone else did. That's unjust dismissal. And you can take him to Tribunal anyway. He won't risk it""

GF: ""Then what if he just makes it worse""

M: ""Then I call DWP and you quit. I wasn't joking""

The conversation ended there. We didn't really argue but she was definitely in a mood. She was cold in bed that night and she barely said a word to me Sunday.

This was Saturday night. Fast forward to Monday (he didn't call her in Sunday, for a change), and she goes to work. He's fine to her, she arrives on time, and leaves on time, and seems fine when she gets back.

Same yesterday.

But my GF still seems off with me now, Thursday.

I was just trying to help her, because I know she wouldn't have said anything herself because she's not that kind of person and I know her uni work is starting to suffer for it. As is her health. I've never seen her so stressed.
AITA?

TL,DR: My GF boss is an asshole. Makes her work long hours. I call him up for a chat and make him stop being an asshole.


EDIT: I realise today is Wednesday but I drafted this for submission on Thursday *last* week. I just didn't post until now as I wanted to see if she changed. She is still in a mood with me, but it's a lot better.",47,33,0.95

12,not the a-hole,"Long story short, I live in a 3 bd house with two roommates. Next weekend we have been planning on moving out various large items/cleaning the house/ doing the landscaping before we move out in order to collect our full deposit.

Yesterday one of my roommates said he would be out of town for the weekend (vacation with his girlfriend that was planned after we said we are doing the work weekend) and that when he gets back he'll help out. However, he will only have one day to do it and now it's up to me to find a ""fair"" way to distribute the work, which I think is bullshit. It's a large house, so altogether it's probably 2 full days of work and now on top of that I have to play construction foreman and make sure there's something left for him to do.

On its own, this wouldn't bother me that much. But, and this is a big but, THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW HE HAS DONE THIS! Last year we had the same arrangement, and he went out of town for a week and didn't help at all.

I want to tell him this is bullshit and that he shouldn't be leaving again but he is known to be over sensitive and react poorly to criticism of any kind and I don't want to rock the boat before the three of us live together for another year.

AITA for expecting my roommate to reschedule his vacation to help us this weekend? Or is it fine for me to figure out a way to split the work?",11,37,0.97
13,asshole,"*Note: I haven't done anything yet, and kind of looking for advice as well. Mods please let me know if I should post this in r/Advice instead.*

Backstory: So my mom's side of the family is pretty huge, and pretty religious. I have 8 uncles and aunts, and then comes 30 something cousins. I've never been extremely close with most of this side of the family; I hated going to family gatherings (almost always at my rich doctor uncle's house), and the family would rarely come visit us at our house, one state away, even though we had plenty of room for everyone (2 acres of land with a sizeable 3-level house, can't remember exact sq. footage). So yeah - we'd always have to plan to go about 2 hours away (if I remember correctly) and spend the day there. Not much to do except socialize with cousins, whom I felt were all very much like their parents. Like I said, I was never really close with them and I didn't quite fit in with the family model - religion, college, money, family, kids, etc. The main ones being religion and college I would say, they would always ask about it and I would tell them honestly I had no interest in either. Eventually, I wound up working in the medical cannabis field which really separated me from that side, specifically because that uncle is a doctor and was completely against it. So much so that he was unwilling to let my dying grandma try using it to treat her illness. I have been receiving wedding invites of my cousins, none of whom ever ask me for my address or mention the wedding; I'm assuming they'd ask my mom who would give them my current address and I'd have a wedding invitation waiting for me one day after work. I'd always decline.

Anyway, hope that's enough to give you all an idea.

What I'm wondering is if it's okay for me to basically remove them from my Facebook and any other social media... possibly removing them from my life? I never felt like many of them were ever there for me or cared about what I was doing or interested in. It was just the whole ""family"" aspect of it. Sure, I never took too much of an interest in their lives but I feel like I was fairly honest about how I felt on that regard. I'm not into marriage, religion, college, etc. I know my mom knows how I feel about this, and I think she understands.

Am I an asshole for feeling this way? Let me know if any additional information would help. Any criticism, comments, advice are very welcome. Thanks!",37,32,0.88

19,asshole,"Good Morning! 

So, like the title says- my three nieces (who're like ages 13 and 9 or something IIRC) came down with my mother yesterday when she returned from visiting Hot Springs, AR. 

Let me tell you something about two of these three girls. They suck. So badly. The third isn't terrible only because she's pretty young and not really super cognitive of what's going on around her. Let's call them Molly and Susan for context. 

A little bit of history- I'm 24. I'm adopted. I don't live at home. I DO live in the same city as my family.  My mother has a son from a previous marriage who is ABOUTTT 40ish years old. He's ex military. VERY much a southern man living in Ft. Worth. He has the traditional nuclear family. Three daughters. A dog. A wife. A chevy. And him and I NEVER were on the same page until I was about 17-18. He always teased me about being a little more feminine (I'm gay) He wasn't particularly warm. The only real reason we're any closer now is because he apologized for not being very ""brotherly"" my whole childhood. 

Additionally- my mother does this shit where she'll put words in people's mouths and then swear to god she's telling the truth. For context, if I don't come rushing over to her home the first chance I get to see my awful spoiled rotten nieces then I'm ""breaking their hearts because ALL THEY WANT is to be able to see their uncle Youngaydult! It's ALLLL they've talked about"" (none of which is true). 

The major problem though is these girls are SO negative and unable to keep themselves from saying the first negative thing that comes to mind. 

""Why does your hair look like that?""
""Why does your face look the way it looks?""
""Why do you shorts come above your knee? You're boy""
""Why do your nipples poke through your shirt""  
""Why do you drink?""

It's like every time I'm in the room some critical analysis needs to be conducted of why I'm the way I am and what's worse is the same huge question is always promoted; ""Why don't you ever come over when we're here? Why don't you like us""

...? Like... it's not rocket science to me. Maybe it's ridiculous that a 24 year old is so insecure that the words of a child can dent my ego so badly but I just would rather not be around it. I tried to explain it to my mother but she doesn't get it and is afraid if she says anything it'll result in her granddaughters not wanting to see her. 

So- to me it's just better to stay at arms length. AITA?

25,not the a-hole,"**My side, you can call me Bob:**

I recently moved. In preparation for my move, I was looking into a short term rental for a few months while I looked for a more permanent place.

Though a networking group, I found a woman, lets call her Alice, who lead me to believe that she was looking to sublet her apartment for a few months. We communicated, tentatively agreed on price and arranged a time for me to see the place in person.

I get there, and Alice is not around, but the landlord is. Let's call the landlord Charlie. I introduce myself, and Charlie the landlord shows me around.

Charlie the landlord tells me that while he has offered to lease the apartment to Alice, and they tentatively agreed on terms, Alice has not yet actually leased the apartment. As in, had not gotten a key, not signed a lease, not paid a deposit.

Obviously I'd only be able to sublet the apartment from Alice if she actually followed though on leasing it in the first place. Charlie the landlord added that he personally disliked Alice in their previous dealings, and that it was too bad I only wanted a short-term place, because he would much rather have me as a tenant.

It was a nice place, a reasonable price, and I was actually looking for a long term rental in the area - I just wasn't expecting this to be it.  I told Charlie the Landlord that if it was really available, I would take it on the spot. Charlie the landlord agreed and emailed me the lease. I read it over; we negotiated for a few minutes; then I wrote a check and Charlie the landlord handed me the keys. Mine.

Charlie and I met the next day and signed the physical lease that matched what we'd agreed to. We made fun of Alice's unethical emails asking me to send her cash to secure my sublet of an apartment that wasn't hers.

Cool. I have a nice new rental. I finished my house hunting early. I don't need to deal with a temporary rental. I saved the cost of moving twice. Charlie and I don't have to deal with Alice, who it turns out is kinda-sorta a fraudster.

Alice was furious and sent me several emails threatening to sue various people.  She apparently also had a heated exchange with Charlie.  I replied to Alice once, to say that neither of us had any say in who Charlie ultimately decided to offer a lease.


**Alice's side - I'll try not to speculate on her motivation:**

I was about to rent a great new place. The only wrinkle is that I was going to be traveling for work for a few months and I couldn't really justify renting it and leaving it empty. Then I met Bob, who offered to sublet it for a couple months while I was away. Perfect!

I arranged for Bob to meet the Landlord and see the property. He said he liked it, everything was going smoothly. I just needed Bob to send me a security deposit before I leased it, so I wouldn't be locked into the lease with no one to live there.

Then, Bob and Charlie showed their duplicitous colors because the next thing I know I'm getting a call from Charlie that the property is no longer available.

Fucking Bob! What am I supposed to do now?! I was counting on this lease going through. And Charlie offered to lease it to me, everything was arranged! I thought that paying and signing a document were just formalities at this point! Where am I gonna live?! Assholes.",11,51,0.98

They are mutually shitty to each other and I told my mother I'd go to my sister's next wedding. I just don't want to deal with the drama and headache for something I don't really support. I'm not close with her and I'll send her a card, but I'm really not keen on spending 1k just to fly there (wife and I). ",27,57,0.95
27,not the a-hole,"I don't ""not let him,"" to be clear. But when he does see her, I tell him I'm worried and that I'd rather he didn't, and ask him to keep me updated. I also give him a certain time where if he doesn't contact me I'll go apeshit and start calling his family to find out where he is. I have told him he is under no circumstances to tell her our address, that we will not accept furniture from her (we're furnishing our apartment and she has a fair amount in storage) so she can't ever say we ""owe her"". I've also told him, if we ever had kids, his mom may not be in their life at all, supervised visits *maybe* when they're older.

Context is this: his mom is abusive, and he's stuck in the victim mentality of hoping she'll change. She has physically abused him (once threw a brick at him, threatened to hit him in the dick with her high heel, punched him in the face, and even defended my boyfriend's brother when he pushed my boyfriend down the stairs). She has financially abused him and ruined his education by forcing him to model from the age of 7 to 11, which he missed on average a day or two of school a week to do, and he only ever saw $400 dollars of what we estimate amounted to thousands if not tens of thousands. He missed so much school his friend thought he was dying. She was severely mentally ill at a point (delusional parasitosis) which made the abuse get worse, even though my boyfriend was essentially her only caretaker and essentially parented his little brother (yep, same one who pushed him down the stairs). She has also disowned him multiple times and said heinous, awful things to him. She even once tore into me, called me a bitch and a slut, because we wouldn't do what she wanted. His parents went through a terrible divorce and continue to use their adult children to antagonize each other.

I grew up in a really good family and my parents consider him part of our family. He has friends he hangs out with, he loves his brother (whom I'm a tad more forgiving for since his multiple concussions apparently caused him rage issues but I'll still never forgive him for pushing my boyfriend down the stairs) and his sister, who was also abused by his parents, is amazing and I encourage him to stay close to her. 

I just know that it's so shitty to prevent your partner from seeing someone and I worry I'm being overbearing. Part of me thinks he's an adult, he should make his own decisions, but I just think about him coming home sobbing and bruised because his mom hit him again. But now that all her kids are going to be out of the house this fall she's turning on the charm and I think trying to maintain control over him. And every time I talk about the cycle of abuse and how he can end the victimization he just gets heartbroken and says ""she's my mom"" and I don't fucking know what to say to that. I've never had a family member hurt me like that, I don't know what he's feeling. I want to protect him but I don't want to overstep his boundaries either. I know his mom is the real asshole here but AITA for trying to convince him to distance himself from his own mother?",11,37,0.98
28,not the a-hole,"I currently live in my girlfriend's country. I've lived here for over a year in total (with 3 month breaks). Whenever visa application time rolls around we always fall into the same problem - she acts like it's all on me.

She moans and groans whenever she has to do anything for it or help me with it. Often citing achss and pains she's had for months as reasons as to why she doesn't want to take me to x to get paper y. What's worse is I don't really speak the language here all that well. Definitely not enough to communicate what I need.

She always insists that it's entirely my responsibility and tells me I'm being ungrateful when I don't recognize her ""helping me"" when she does help me get a document I need.

I feel the opposite. I feel it's both of our responsibilities. I'm already doing most of the work just being here, and honestly I don't think she'd do the same thing for me. I feel if anyone is ungrateful it's her for not recognizing how difficult it was to move here away from everything and have to live in a different culture that I can't even understand the language of for over a year just to be with her.

29,asshole,"I'm a supervisor at my job with a very strong union. Because of this we have attendance issues with many employees so to help with this, we have raffles on days that have historically low attendance such as the day before or after a holiday. We give everyone who came to work on time a ticket and our safety supervisor will draw 1 to determine he winner. This particular days prize was a bike with the company logo on it. Well I happened to walk in when she was drawing (she does it kind of privately) and I saw who the winner was. Well this particular gentleman has horrible attendance. Don't get me wrong, he is someone I would consider a friend so it's not like I have a grudge or anything but there are plenty of other hard working employees who deserve it more.

31,asshole,"I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole when I do this, so I'm more asking for help understanding why it's an asshole thing to do and what I should do instead.  I don't exactly have great social skills, so please help me. While I don't really get in major arguments that often with people, I do get into somewhat trivial arguments with my close friends and family at least once a month, and a common aspect of those arguments is that I'll continue to argue if they backpedal, unless they also give a good apology.  I'll give a specific example that happened a couple days ago. I'll do my best to be as accurate as possible, but I don't think the quotes that I'll give are 100% verbatim. I think they're close, though.

My boyfriend and I, who both play a lot of video games, were talking about video games over the phone. We talked about Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I had mistakenly thought that my boyfriend had played it before, and he corrected me, telling me that he played it for only an hour before stopping. He likes the series, but he didn't like Dragon Age II much, which discouraged him from continuing the series. I like the entire series quite a lot.

After that, we moved on to talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, which is one of his favorite games, and I'm looking forward to playing it someday. He talked for a while about everything that he loves about it, and at one point, he said, ""Oh yeah, the reason that I stopped playing Inquisition is because Xenoblade Chronicles does it better."" It wasn't clear what ""it"" was, but I think he was referring to the sidequest system and the gameplay.  I don't know much about Xenoblade Chronicles, so I don't really have an opinion on that, but I actually don't especially like the gameplay in Inquisition either.

Based on his tone and his words, I found what he said to be a bit dismissive about a game that I really like, and while I tried to let it go at first, I ultimately decided to tell him that that was a rude thing to say about a game that I like, and I went on to say that that is a foolish reason to not give a game more of a chance, especially when that game was pretty well-received and many of his friends like the game. While I tried to say that calmly, I'm sure I sounded a bit irritated.

He, also sounding irritated, responded that it wasn't dismissive or rude because he also likes Dragon Age (the first game, anyway) and he intends on playing Inquisition someday, too. He also said that he was praising Xenoblade Chronicles and not insulting Inquisition. 

This is the part where I think I was an asshole. I told him that he was insulting Inquisition because of the way he phrased it and because he gave it as a reason for why he stopped playing after an hour.  We then got into an argument about what he originally said, and after a minute or so, when it was clear that this wasn't going to be resolved with a ""Sorry, I was rude,"" I said, ""I'm willing to drop this, if you want. I don't think there's any point in continuing to argue about this."" He was very quiet for a minute, and when I asked if he was okay, he said, in a forced calm voice, that he was sorry for being rude and dismissive and that he didn't want to talk any more tonight. ""Good night.""

To be honest, I actually wasn't that upset about the conversation anymore and more worried about him, which is why I decided to ask about my behavior on here.  We have since apologized to each other, and he even sent me a gift on Steam (because of the Summer Sale) to apologize, though I actually feel uncomfortable when I receive apology gifts, especially when I consider myself to also be at fault.  I thanked him for it, though, of course.

So, in those types of arguments, where I argue with someone when they backpedal and they try to say that they didn't say/mean to say that when I believe they did say/mean to say that, am I an asshole? I think I was, at least a little bit, because what if he was telling the truth? I think for him, regardless of what he actually said, it probably was the truth.  On the other hand, I've backpedaled before, and I remember a few times in high school where I tried to lie and pretend that I didn't say what I know I said.  Either way, assuming that I know someone's thoughts is rude, too, right?

What would a kind person do, in my shoes? Accept their not-apology? Explain my point-of-view, let them tell me theirs, and drop it? Don't bring it up in the first place? 

TL;DR: Am I an asshole for arguing when someone tries to take back what they say? Specific example: Boyfriend and I got into an argument about video games. He said something dismissive about a game that I really like. I said that what he said was rude. He said he didn't mean to insult the game. I said he did mean to insult the game. Am I the asshole in that situation for not dropping the argument after he said that he didn't mean to insult the game?

Edit: Typos.

Edit: Thanks for your replies and your verdicts, everyone. And an even bigger thank you to those who went out of their way to explain their perspective. I apologized to my boyfriend again, and he took it very well and doesn't seem to hold any negative feelings regarding our argument. As for my question about arguing when someone qualifies or takes back what they said, the consensus is not to do it when it's a trivial argument, I think? And also to believe the person when they're qualifying what they're saying. I'll try to do that. I probably won't respond anymore because I need to focus on other stuff and I'm not sure that anything new will be said.",36,30,0.94
32,asshole,"So long story short, 

My family has moved country and have been here for about 2 years. Recently I (23) made friends with some guys (all 23) and we quite often go out skateboarding together. 

My younger brother (18) asked to come out with us on his scooter (Note- Not skateboard). I said no. I feel as though its important to have seperate friends as I already live with him, it's good for me to be able to hang out with friends to have a break from this. 

I have no issues hanging out with him in general or going out and doing things but I do like to have some friends that we don't share. I can't help but feel a little bad for saying no though as I feel it might be a bit selfish. 

He does have his own friends but not people that he could go out and scooter with, however he hasn't made many attempts to find friends who share this interest.

Am I being an asshole by not wanting him to come out ?",19,33,0.93
33,need couples therapy,"Formatting, on mobile and kinda POed 

On our way to a BBQ that a friend of mine who lives in my area is having, we are dropping off the kids (2) at my mother in laws. The wife decides to stop in a 'T' intersection of the parking lot halting any possible traffic from 3 directions. I ask her to pull forward so I can unload the kids better and not have to worry about cars that might come from in front of us or behind us (the way we came in), let alone from the passenger side. I cede my end of the point/argument, swallow my pride and get out to get the first child, then as I'm unloading my 2nd child out of the car, a car tried to exit facing us from the front. She then aggressively tells me to hurry up so she can let the car out. (My original point was realized and validated).  I continue getting the second (non walking) child out. I grab the hand of the first one to go to the building. 

An older man whom I don't know, is behind me by about 10 meters, as I get buzzed in, I hold the door open long enough so he can get to the door before it closes and locks since it takes about 5-10 seconds for the door to close (because of the thingie that slows doors down) all while keeping an eye on the older kid (only 2 but as tall as most 5 year olds) because I know she will press any buttons in the elevator she can reach. By the time the elevator opens for me (and my kids) he is in the building and right next to me, we get on the elevator. The front door had NOT closed YET. Only later I discovered that my wife was behind the old man AND SHE THINKS I CLOSED THE DOOR ON HER ON PURPOSE. She didn't even see the older man somehow. She only noticed me before she looked for her purse (I assume that's why/how she didn't see him) plus I thought she was staying in the car.  

Now she doesn't wanna go to anywhere. This is THE ONE THING ALL YEAR (so far), I WANTED US TO GO TO. 
In the interest of trying to keep this as fair as possible, I won't mention HOW other times, she seemingly sabotaged other trips I wanted to go on, just know that things like this have happened before. (Let alone she is the side seat driver 99% of the time.)

35,not the a-hole,"So my friend sold me an old Yamaha YD3 250 for £500, for 'spares or repairs', it didn't work at all, it didn't even start. In fact, it didn't even have two wheels.

He says that I should give him 'at least' £450 as 'his share' of the profit because without him I would never have had the bike, and he wouldn't have sold it to me if he had known my plans.

37,call CPS,"We had new neighbors move in on the right hand side of us(if you're facing the street) about a month and a half ago. A young couple (somewhere between 26-31) and their two young boys (ages 4-6), plus 3 dogs.

We live in a quiet part of town, the houses are modestly priced for their size and sit on tree-lined streets, both a high school and an elementary school are within walking distance, kids ride their bikes down the sidewalks(it is not safe to ride them in the street, we sometimes have speeders) and play in their front yards without fear of unsavory characters or flying bullets, the metro station is within walking distance, there's a park also within walking distance; its the perfect type of place to start and grow your family.

After talking to them, I learned they came from a gated manufactured home(see also: mobile home) community (coincidentally, the same one my ex just moved into, so I know it well.); where they come from security patrols regularly, kids play outside in the street, and the speed limit within the community is a strict no-nonsense 10 MPH(you WILL get caught, you WILL receive a ticket), the  lots are about 3 feet apart so if you so much as SNEEZE your neighbor knows about it, and there's absolutely no parking on the street. 

Their old community was basically the real life equivalent of a ""tutorial level"" for a life simulator game. 

When they first moved in, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. It's very easy to hear what's going on over there because they don't have very much furniture, and nothing on the walls. The adult male has an older model mustang in bright red. As a car girl, I was impressed, until I heard him start it and realized he'd taken the muffler off. On purpose. **Strike one.**

Then, one day I'm coming home from work (around 8 pm, so it was starting to get dark), their moving van is parked in front of the house. I park my car, and I'm sitting in my car, with it turned off and scrolling through my phone when out of the corner of my eye the cab of this moving truck lights up, the passenger side door opens and a child no older than 4-5 clumsily climbs down out of the cab of the truck, he stands in the street for a couple minutes (door still wide open. We occasionally have speeders down my block, no kid is safe in the street) and looks down the street, and then at me sitting in my car. He has a pacifier(binky, dummy, whatever you like) in his mouth and he's chewing on it. He then walks around the door, and pushes it closed with all his might(but it doesn't close, and the light in the cab stays on), he walks up the driveway of his new house, and disappears around the back of the house. Its then that I see his older brother(6-7) is sitting in the cab of the truck, in the driver seat, pretending to drive. He gets in and out of the truck several times running around  in the street, to the passenger side of the truck, climbing into the truck, climbing across to the driver side, then doing it all over again. Eventually the older boy goes inside too, and the moving truck sits there, cab lights on, both doors slightly ajar. I wait; thinking someone is going to come close the doors(surely people know where there kids have been?), it stays on all the way after I shower and change my clothes and I am heading out for the night with friends. I walk over, close the doors, and make sure the interior light turns off, get in my car and leave. Letting your young children play inside of a truck and in the street unsupervised? **Strike two.**

The next morning, I'm awoken a few minutes before my alarm to a man SCREAMING in obvious rage; his voice is low, guttural, and dare I say scary, I've never heard a man talk to ANYONE that way (my own father is rather soft spoken, and so are a lot of men in my life), he's yelling at someone to ""just leave it the fuck alone, stop touching it"", and when I hear the answering cries of a small child, I peek out the window in our kitchen and see him wailing on the youngest boy with a closed fist. There's an open moving box on the driveway near them, and some foam puzzle pieces (the big toy ones, for the floor) are strewn about. I'm a little shocked, and part of me *knows* that he shouldn't be hitting his child that way. But, I am not a parent, and don't feel it's my place to say anything. I have to leave for work, so idk what the conclusion of this particular incident is. Beat your kids in the driveway for just being kids? **Strike three.**

Over the past couple of weeks there's been more incidents such as these, and other incidents as well. 

- Screaming matches between parents (""Are you really going to sit on your ass and not bring up the laundry so I can fold it?!"" -a presumed loving wife to her lovely husband). I had a friend over and we were sitting on my front porch just talking, and the screaming was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk.
- I thought it was a little weird that they left all their lights on, and left the doors open and the A/C on, but figured that they knew what they were doing. They got their electric bill after a month of living there, and Dear Old Dad almost had a coronary. At their old community the way their electric bill was calculated was that the whole park got charged one fee(by the electric company), and it was devided by the number of lots that were occupied at the time, meaning it wasn't unheard of for a family of 4-5 to have 45$ electric bill no matter how much they blasted the A/C, or left lights on. It's not like that out here in the real world, where your electricity is your responsibility. 
- The male counterpart getting in his (NOISY)mustang and peeling out of the driveway doing 45 to ""cool down"" after every argument. Considering there's a fight at least twice a day....
- the children misbehaving within the home and getting screamed at/punished. Seriously, I always know when they are sitting down to eat dinner because it's always a screaming match between the parents and the kids, with plenty of threats, swearing, and punishment. These kids can never escape the table without an ass whooping.)
- the dogs barking for some unknown reason (not a problem with me, we have a rottweiler, he barks too), and both adults full blown screaming at, and hitting all three dogs to the point that the dogs are crying/coweri away from them. 
- the older boy has some sort of anger issue (I wonder where he learned that from), and if he gets frustrated at all or doesn't get his way, a screaming match will ensue.  Just wordless, seemingly endless, piercing yells because he cannot think of any other way to relieve his stress other than screaming. 

Today, I don't work until 4pm, so I've been home all day. During lunch, I heard what I thought was another screaming match between the boys break out next door, and then heard the father laughing. While cleaning the kitchen, I listened to what was being said (oh, this is also not hard to do because since getting their electric bill, they now leave every window open instead of using The A/C. If I stand in my kitchen, I can hear the dad's Pandora playing on his cell phone. I am privy to every. Single. Conversation. that happens within that house, whether I want to hear it or not.), and the dad had a toy the older boy wanted. The dad was playing the ""up high, down low, too slow"" high-five game, and if the older boy could hit his hands, he could have the toy. Clearly an adult is going to win this game every time, and every time the boy lost, he would let out a scream that could wake 3 centuries worth of dead folks, getting louder and louder as his frustration grew. Eventually, the boy was crying in frustration, and his dad was just laughing his ass off, loudly. Probably the only time I've ever heard the guy laugh. While not abusive, still he's being a fucking dick, and the kid's screaming had my anxious (and old) rottweiler pacing back and forth and panting. 

**TL;DR: my new neighbors are trailer trash, the father beats both his kids and all three of his dogs. His wife is a giant cunt who never watches the kids and let's them play in the street. There's constant screaming matches that have disrupted my sleep, and caused friends to look at me like ""wtf is going on over there?"" The constant screaming is making my own dogs anxious. Would it make me an asshole to file a noise complaint?**",28,41,0.86

She messaged me again when Uni started back up, and we sort-of dated for about a week before she broke up with me. 

Since then we've been on-again off-again friends, though only really over text. We hung out for a bit after breaking up, but over Christmas we got into a row and never really starting hanging out again. After end-of-year exams she messaged me again asking to go out for drinks. However, every time I tried to schedule a time she rejected me without suggesting a new one, so I assumed she didn't actually want to.

Everything at the bar went alright until we were gonna order the second round. I said I was gonna get another and asked if she was going to get one too, she asked if she could. I basically said ""well it's your money"", and she got very upset with me. We ended up leaving soon after because of it.

I kept chalking it just a difference of opinion that isn't really a big deal, but she just kept being so over the top about it and drawing conclusions like she thinks I'll restrict finances in marriage (but no way in hell I'm marrying her without her having her own income after this) and talking about how others (friends) have treated her to more things and stuff

At Christmas the whole taste testing in Hershey (which we had to pay for) was ruined because TWO families brought in their brat kid who screamed throughout, making it not only unnerving, but impossible to hear the presenter.

Last night at the Titanic museum we had a guided tour, paid extra for it in fact, and the presentation was nearly impossible to hear over the little screamer.  My wife could see me starting to
 boil.  Several of the tourees grumbled loudly.  Brat continues.  The tour guide started actually starting the presentation before the stroller was pushed into the room so the rest of us could hear something.

45,not the a-hole,"Today my girlfriend was upset she wasted $8 on a skirt she couldn't wear for various reasons. We were originally going to go out to eat and take a walk, but since she was torn by this she had me come to her place. I told her I was gonna buy the food first and that I'd be 20+ mins. She responded passively aggressively and acxused me of only going to her part of the city to eat. We argued a bit, I didn't buy food because the argument went on too long, and went to her place.

She started crying about wasting the $8 when I got there and I did my best to comfort her. After about 40 minutes I glanced at my watch during a hug to see the time and then adjusted the position on my wrist slightly. My girlfriend jumped back a bit and asked me if I was looking at the time. I said yeah and she bursted out crying.

I checked the time because I was anxious about missing the tram I needed to get home without a 1+ hour walk after midnight. I explained this to her and she kept crying really hard and accusing me of not caring for her and etc. I tried to comfort her again but it just got worse.

Eventually I remarked that I didn't want to walk home alone so late at night and referenced a previous argument we've had because I left her a minute before we arrived at her apartment building (because she was acting awful at the tinr). She went into absolute hysterics. I'm not kidding when I say this is the absolute loudest I've ever heard anything cry or even scream out in pain. I was sure she was going to wake up the entire apartment building including her mother (who takes sleep medication and wears ear plugs). I'm almost convinced she was trying to be as loud as humanly possible. I know this is a weird thing to focus on but this was genuinely disturbing. She literally sounded like she was dying.

And I know ""I'm almost convinced my girlfriend was trying to cry as loud as possible"" and saying it nonchalantly really makes me sound like a piece of shit but I have no other explanation for it. I'm not exaggerating at all. She has taken the death of family members better. I almost suspect she was being as loud as possible just to wake up her mother and put me in a very uncomfortable situation. All in all I feel this was a gross, gross overreaction and if intentional despicable. I don't think she WOULD do it just to get back at me but I don't know how she could've been so loud without intentionally trying to wake people up. Lile she was sitting there mouth wide open absolutely no attempts to cover her noises and generally not wake up the building (she can hear a cough from the neighbors).

Anyway understandably - at least to me - I panicked the fuck out. She sounded like she was dying. At first I was like ""ok shit I'm leaving"" because I was clearly not helping the situation at all and generally panic. After the first few seconds I decided against it for obvious reasons.

She... ""calmed down"" a bit after that. Still crying profusely because I was worried about missing the tram. It was a bit before this point where there was no way in hell I'd be able to make the tram. Talked a bit yeah yeah she's still pissed I looked at my watch, etc etc, still maintaining crying for hours over wasting $8 and me looking at my watch wasn't an overreaction.

Several times during I brought up that I didn't want to walk home so late. To which she replied that she would've paid for a taxi for me. Which is bullshit because she just got done crying for 40 mins over wasting $8. Mind you $8 that she likely could've gotten back from returning it and if not that reselling it. And she seemed almost offended at the idea that me not walking home alone late at night on mostly empty city streets was more important to me than consoling her over $8. Like yes, my satety and arriving home before 3am are more important than your minor inconvenience

46,no a--holes here,"Hi Reddit

My BF is getting back from a work trip tonight, and he's been away for a while so I figured it would be nice to pick him up from the airport. He missed his original flight which was going to get in at 7:15PM, and had to catch another one getting in 12:30am (ugh). When it came time for him to depart, he told me that the plane was about half an hour late in taking off, so he'd be getting in at one (uuuuugh). I say no biggie. Not ideal, but ok.

I go to check the flight schedule to see what's up, and lo and behold, his flight is actually delayed by more than a full hour, so it looks like he's scheduled to get in at 1:45. He's in the air, and it'll be a couple hours before I head to the airport, but I feel like A) he should know that he's going to be delayed quite a bit longer than originally expected and B) should probably try to contact me about this? He's on a flight that definitely has wifi, so he's more than capable. I sent him a few chagrined messages when I found out asking why he wouldn't try to let me know what the actual delay was, and I feel like I might have been too harsh. At the same time, I'm majorly going out of my way for him and feel like he should at least be making some attempt to keep me in the loop about this. It seems like he doesn't seem bothered that I might be sitting in my car at arrivals pick up wondering where he is.

47,asshole,"I planned a birthday party for my fiancé at our house. We live with ""Roommate"", our friend, who has a fiancée who is a very picky eater. Let's call her ""Picky.""


Picky is a juvenile/sheltered eater: plain chicken and rice and pasta are her main meals, takes lettuce and tomato off her burger, minimal seasonings and veggies, didn't know what a kiwi was in person and never tried hot chocolate until she was well into her 20s. Weird mix. I can never guess what she will or will not eat because it varies wildly. She has no medical dietary restrictions. Despite this she never makes a fuss of her food out loud, if she does its a meek whisper to Roommate. She's a nice girl who fits with our friend group well.


Back to the birthday party. Most guests are mutual friends with Roommate and Picky too. The time comes to order pizza from my fiancé's favorite pizza place where we crowd around the computer looking at their menu and deciding what toppings to get. Normal pizza topping decisions are discussed and made by all. (If it matters, I think we decided on a veggie, a pepperoni and sausage, and a cheese.)


Right before we call to order, Roommate has us add a specific chicken finger meal for Picky. I do not recall the exact exchange of words. This is for her only, not to share by the other guests. She could have expressed her pizza preferences along with everyone else, but didn't. I don't think she had any pizza other than sampling a bite at Roommate's coaxing.


I paid for the entire order myself as it was the main food for the party. However, I and my fiancé both felt I should be paid back for Picky's specific meal.


Later in the night Roommate and I are alone in the kitchen where I matter of factly ask him if he/Picky has cash for her meal or if he'd Venmo to pay me back. (I worded it this way on purpose to avoid any sort of ""Where going to pay me back?"" awkwardness) He paid me back and that was the end of it. I had no resentful vibes from him or Picky at all for this, but then again they're both very non confrontational and could have grumbled about it in private. Did they complain or didn't they? Are they secretly annoyed by it? I'll never know.


But it's been in the back of my mind since. So, am I the asshole for not paying for her meal?",34,49,0.87
48,not the a-hole,"Update: She got home from work and wants me to apologise 

TLDR: My job requires me to sleep early, partner prevented me from sleep. She's mad at me for pointing it out. 

So first some context. I work early mornings and have to be awake for work between 02:50am and 05:50am, so getting a good night's sleep is important to me.

My partner likes to watch TV before bed and won't do it in the living room as she likes to fall asleep to it too, we've only been living together 3 months and I could tell I was going to have to get ear plugs straight away. However, often I feel like the TV could be a little quieter as I can still hear it relatively cleary. Whenever I ask her to turn it down she responds with “I can't hear it” but what I think is happening is she just wants to keep it at a comfortable level. When the roles have been reversed I've turned the TV down to a level where I can just about here it so she can sleep, bearing in mind she never has to be up super early. 

So last night I wanted to start trying to sleep at 9pm, I put my ear plugs in and turned over. The TV though was very loud, at least for that time and when someone is trying to sleep. It was at the level I have it on in the day sometimes. I ask her to turn it down and she says “Can we not do this again” and I respond with silence to try and keep the peace. I try for an hour to try and get to sleep but I just can't, so I start playing with my phone hoping she'll get the hint. 

She asks me why I'm not sleeping and I gesture towards the TV. It's at this point she gets really defensive. Now I'm a little grouchy, but she seems offended that I'd even ask. The subtitles are on, so why not turn it down if you can read it? I didn't ask this as I thought she wasn't going to listen. 

I get up and say I'm going to go sleep on the couch, to which she becomes more agitated and eventually says she'll go sleep on the couch instead. While leaving the room she says it's not all about me and “what if I can't sleep!?” and slams the bedroom door. 
She eventually comes back in and goes to sleep, I'm still up as the altercation made me very awake. 

In the morning I'm leaving for work and I hear her ask me “no kiss?” (I usually kiss her before leaving) and I respond with a no, and walk out the door. 

So I get home from work and it's still morning, she's at her work. After an hour I go to turn the TV on to find the remote had gone missing, I thought maybe it had fallen beneath the sofa. To my surprise I find the laptop under there! It's at this point I knew she'd hidden the remote/taken it in her bag and she'd also hidden the PS4 remote. Then she messages me later on saying “Hope you're having a whale of a time with no remote or controller”

49,not the a-hole,"Just wondering if I'm the asshole for not believing my boyfriend has legitimate medical issues.  I've taken him to all his appointment and have heard his story change every single time. Also he will Google his own medical symptoms and has a different disease with his symptoms each week and of course he know more than any doctor, with his Google's Dr degree. Not to mention his mother has started coming along, and everything is worse case scenario. I feel like an asshole but also kinda don't care.",15,30,0.91
50,not the a-hole,"To start, this isn't me. This is between my sister (16 yo) and my father's girlfriend (Late 40s, unsure of exact age). I'm the brother (18yo) who is just trying to study for exams and shit's happening in the background.

My sister has always been prone to moon swings and stuff, and even moreso since our mother died a bit over 2 years ago. My dad has recently met his first woman since, he met her back around November time and she and her daughter (12 yo) moved in about 2 months ago. My sister doesn't like her, although the exact reason I can't pinpoint. Regardless, its not like she goes around picking fights, so its tolerable.

The issue normally comes when the girlfriend tries to tell my sister what to do in a 'strict motherly' way, which my sister doesn't like so she talks back, then shit kicks off. One observation I have is that my Dad's girlfriend has the maturity of a teenager it seems. Whenever anything goes down she leaves the house in a strop and drives around for a few hours before coming back, there are some cases in particular I'll refer to later.

Okay, so as a result of mood swings 'n' shit, the family as a whole have convinced my sister to go to therapy. My sister didn't want my Dad's partner (Who I'll call Anne) or her daughter to know (Especially not the daughter as they go to the same school. The daughter seems fine but she just didn't want her to know). Anne was getting pretty aggravated about being kept in the dark on everything, which is basically where the main issue lies. So my Dad told her, she in turn told her daughter despite being told specifically not to, then shit broke loose (Although my sister never found out). An example of Anne's immaturity is when my sister did something to upset her, nothing major by any means just some snide comment or something, and she spent the entire weekend giving her the silent treatment and generally acting like a bitch to everyone until my sister apologised. Like come on, you're acting immature for a teenager, let alone a fully grown woman, grow up.

So anyway, my sister went to councelling for the first time earlier today. Nothing particularly interesting happened, but she doesn't want Anne knowing, which I think is fair. So my Dad comes home from work, A asks him how it went and my Dad tells her that my sister doesn't want her knowing.  So Anne is now currently having another strop that she and her daughter feel out of place in this house and feel excluded. She's currently out on her drive now, so we've come to this position and I'm posting. I feel like my sister is refusing to tell her out of spite, but I don't think it should matter why she doesn't want A to know, its her information to give.

I'm looking for a way to resolve this issue with causing minimal harm to my Dad. He's a really great guy and A is alright most of the time, and he's just getting torn in half.

Thing is, I get annoyed and angry sometimes. Out of the blue. Like once or twice every week. I just need 20 minutes alone and I'm good. I have some mental issues, as does she. In fact, we first met on an online chat for helping with depression, anxiety, panic and other stuff like that. I actually managed to cut way down my drinking in the period we've been together, meaning I no longer drink by myself.

So we were talking on the phone, and she had this hysterical laughing fit while texting one of her friends. She wouldn't shut the fuck up, she was laughing maniacally for like 5 minutes! I was pretty anxious already, and it started to make my chest physically hurt.

I rudely interrupted her laughter, and asked her if I could call her back in an hour or so, this time with a dead serious and angry tone. Too bad, she didn't answer my calls anymore. Won't text me back. We are logged on a private chat 24/7 for just the two of us, in case we can't communicate via phone, and she logged off. It's been 2 days and no contact.

53,petty,"My mother's cousin (my... second cousin, I guess?) is pregnant with her first child. I am not close at all with her. The last time I saw her was at her wedding, and the time before that was probably when we were children. She's maybe 10 years older than me. So someone in her family, either her mother or aunt (so one of my mother's aunts, my great aunts) threw the shower I believe. An invite was sent to my mother's house addressed to my mother, my sister (who is 19 and lives with my parents), and myself. I am and have lived in my own home with my fiancé for 2 years. 

I thought it was terribly rude that I wasn't sent a separate invitation. I understand that because I am not very close to her, she likely doesn't know where I live. I don't know where she lives, I didn't even know she was having a baby, and I don't know what's going on in any of my mom's aunts personal lives so I certainly don't blame them for not knowing that I've gotten engaged and moved. Given all of that, I would not invite them to something intimate like a baby shower. If we haven't spoken in so long that we aren't aware of each other's life circumstances, I don't think that's genuinely a person you want celebrating with you. I feel like it was just an afterthought, or even a gift grab. My mother's aunts (who sent the invitations) speak to my grandmother frequently enough that they could have reached out and asked for my address, although I think an invite was unnecessary at all.

56,not the a-hole,"Title might be a tad disengenuous. You be the judge!

 I tend towards extroverted, my husband tends towards introverted. On this particular Friday evening, my husband agreed to watch a particular movie with me. This is weird, because I am notorious for not having seen a lot of movies. However, I fancy the ones I have seen and remember are pretty good.

I suggested said movie because he said he wanted to watch a movie that I would like. Also, he tends to feel like he has to spend a chunk of money on us going out, which I feel guilty about, and he's a bit of a natural homebody. I don't want to be stressful -- though a movie might not be my first choice for every Friday, it's a great compromise since I understand he has to recharge some weekends.

I also have wanted to share this movie with him for literally many years, because it's one of my all-time favorites. So, I figure, low-stress, low-cost Friday night full of snuggles. Hey, if he's asking my opinion on what movie to watch, let's watch this one he's heard me rave about.

We also had friends online, on voice chat, playing some games. Fair enough, it's good to interact with people we both like! We do that most weeknights but there's no quota for friendship!

Both of us played a few games. After 5-ish, I stopped playing and started reminding him, 'hey, we're going to watch that movie I wanted to show you. Ok, another match, but, remember that we planned to watch a movie...'

Well, husband plays a match or two past our other friends, who stop playing and start leaving voice chat. We joke and laugh on voice chat about it, I hope gently. Our movie date was asked about, since I had said, ""hey, it's great to hear everyone but after this we're probably going to watch a movie.""

Eventually husband starts yawning and says he's going to log off/go to sleep. The two of us log off and I remind him that he promised to watch this movie, and that he usually games till he's sleepy and then passes out, regardless of plans made.  That he's promised to watch movies with me in the past and hasn't followed through. 

Hey gets mad because he's​ tired right now, and what is he supposed to do about it other than sleep. It seems unfair to him that I'm bringing it up at all. He starts the movie because he feels he now has to watch it, over my protests that now he will fall asleep and miss most of it/resent me for it, and I'd really appreciate it if he'd just save the energy to watch it sometime... And falls asleep midday through. I'm pretty mad at this point and say that it's no surprise he fell asleep and that's why I wanted to take a rain check but that I'm pretty disappointed in how the evening had gone, considering. He threw his glasses on the ground and I'm sleeping on the couch.

I feel like an asshole because a movie should never be a huge commitment. A movie should be on the lowest rung of priority on a Friday night. And I get that. From my point of view, a movie *was* on the lowest rung of commitment, but I saved energy for it.

From his point of view I get that he's tired, that he will fall asleep during this movie, and that when he's already tired it's probably unfair of me to berate him for not having saved the energy. I don't want to be that person who is super vigilant/quizzes people around me about the movie I made them sit through in the first place. But he suggested it, which makes me conflicted?

Of all the things I have energy for in my life, movies are on the lowest rung/are a fallback that I hope other people would be able to let go and forgive me for.

But I'm pretty upset that he has chosen to not save enough energy to follow through on the most low-energy plan I can think of, when he agreed.

At the same time, I totally get why friends in voice chat might take precedence. Friends > movie, for sure.

Anyway. Am I the asshole? Keeping in mind of course, and as I'm sure you know, that while I'm trying not to pile on the person I'm mad at, because I definitely could be in the wrong, I have probably biased this post strongly in my own favor.

Edit: oh shit I forgot a tl;dr!

He'd told me that the session would be over around 6:30 or 7, and that we'd be able to spend the evening hanging out, which I was very much looking forward to, as he's going away for another week tomorrow.

This morning I asked him when I could expect he'd be finished, and he told me that it'd actually be sometime around 7:15, but he'd keep me posted. 7:15 rolls around, and he tells me that he and his bandmates haven't eaten all day, so they're going to go grab a quick bite, and that he'll probably be back around 8:45. Not ideal, but fine. At 8:30, he texts me and tells me that he's still eating, and I'm a bit bothered. I give him a call, and he tells me that they've actually gone to a sit down place rather than grab a slice of pizza, and that he'll probably be back at his place around 9:30. While he could have left at 7:15 when the session ended and grabbed some food with me, he said he'd prefer to save 15 bucks on an uber by getting a ride with his bandmates, who wanted to grab food.

Given that I work 9-5, this would leave very little time for us to spend with each other before he leaves for another week, I tell him that I'm pretty sad about A) having our hangs continuously pushed back to the point where we're basically just going to sleep together and B) this is the last I'm going to see of him for a while. At this point, he asks me what I want to do, and I say that I just want to spend some time together this evening before he leaves.

Okay so after high school, I cut a lot of toxic people out of my life and that includes my so called best friend. We were friends from the beginning of high school up to about 2 years out of high school. I noticed that she did things that friends shouldn't do. Things like if I liked someone and she knew, she would end up sleeping with them and she only wanted to hang out if I promised we'd be drinking. It's been 4 years now since I've last seen her but this whole time, my mother and little sister have continued to not only talk to her but actually hang out with her. And I really didn't give a shit, I honestly thought it was kind of sad that my mom would still hang out and party with someone her own daughter cut out. I started getting upset when I found out that this person was going to my family events that I couldn't make and she was invited by my mother or sister because they knew I wouldn't be there. Now, my sister is having her open house this weekend and I found out that this person will be there. So I called my sister and asked her if she was really going to be there and my sister decided to throw a fit, crying about how it's her party and she can have whoever she wants there and that I'm being a child if I'm really not going to come because someone I don't like is going to be there.

About a week later I get the chance to make a move while following her home from a bar. I am rejected as she makes it clear that she has a boyfriend and that she lives together with him. At this point I'm obviously a bit disappointed, but decided to continue the friendship as just good friends, and after a while this friendship feels pretty platonic.

Fast forward a few weeks and I become acquainted with Lucys boyfriend, a very nice guy who's also (somewhat) interested in the activity I met her through. We get along quite well, but never get to the point where I would call him a good friend of mine. We all go to the same university and meet eachother regularly.

Both me and Lucy finished our exams early this year, and because of this we had decided hanging out basically every day for the last two weeks (first for an event that lasted four days, later for drinking etc). We have a great time together, and I notice that I start having feelings towards her again, but surpress them, knowing she has a boyfriend. During this time her boyfriend seems rather absent, until one day he turns up at a party together with Lucy and gets drunk. When outside smoking he opens up to me and explains that he's been going through the death of a close family member just a month ago, that he had quit school for the time being and was having a really rough time. I try to comfort him as good as I can and I still feel really bad for him.

Here's where things get pretty shitty. Lucy is very touchy with guys in general, even with good friends of her boyfriend. Earlier when I'd been to parties with her and her boyfriend together he doesn't really seem to mind it. He's a very confident, good looking guy in general so I honestly wasn't too surprised that he hasn't felt ""threatened"" by this. Due to his absence at our parties for the last week though, and due to the situation he was in, I had decided I would not come close to Lucy physically as it felt really wrong.

One night we're at an afterparty together with some other common friends (once again without Lucys boyfriend) and we're all sitting/laying down in the hosts bed. We're all drunk, and Lucy starts laying very close to me. I started feeling uncomfortable and decided leaving the bed and started talking to some other friends in the living room instead. after the party Lucy and I walk home together, and we end up talking about the episode and she seems a bit annoyed at me. I tell her ""Sorry, I know I'm being weird and I know that you mean nothing by what you're doing, but I feel really bad about it anyway"". She tells me it's OK and that she understands, and we split up for the day.

Two days later we end up at an afterparty at my house, now with the boyfriend present. I get extremely drunk and end up passing out in my bed with Lucy and another friend sitting beside me. It turns out that Lucys boyfriend was mad after arguing with one of his friends about something unrelated. This had ruined the mood and everyone except Lucy left the party without me knowing (laying drunk in my room). I wake up next to her in my bed and she starts cuddling with me. This time I end up obliging. I knew it was wrong, but I also have a crush on her and had a weak moment. She starts looking at me and tells me that she's in love with me, and I tell her I feel the same way. We kiss for a second, but I immediately feel really shitty about it and tell her to leave. On her way out she tells me she's sorry, that I shouldn't worry about this and that it's not my fault, but I'm very unsure about the whole thing personally.

Sorry for the wall of text, but how do you guys feel about this? Am I the asshole for letting things go this far?",22,77,0.95

A few years ago my parents were planning out my family-only birthday party. One of the people attending is my cousin who's son is allergic to 95% of anything you can imagine. I wanted a chocolate cake. ""Your cousin can't have chocolate, pick white"", my dad said. ""It's my birthday and I can't have a chocolate cake? We could just get him a smaller cake or cupcake or something or at least that for me"", I said back. ""No, that's too much food, we'll just get white"", he said. What was the point of asking then if I didn't have an option to begin with? Then for food I wanted BBQ. Guess what? ""Your cousin can't have most of that, we need to have things he can eat"", my dad said. At this point, I'm irritated. ""Then why are you asking me what *I* want, if it's just about what *[cousins name]* needs"", I asked back. ""Because it's *YOUR* birthday, you pick what you want"", he said. Not caring anymore, I suggested the most blandest food you could have at a party. The day of my birthday arrives and the food spread is pretty much a thanksgiving meal and my cake, my personal favorite, at my request, was a bland white cake with no icing and a picture that goes on top that would have been the heading of the cake. My cousins show and the mother of Mr. Allergic To Everything brought him his own fucking pizza. Like, a straight up large pizza hut pizza and mcdonalds because apparently that's the only things he can eat. He ate only that and wanted nothing else, not even cake. My dad then later tells me that I probably could have gotten the food I wanted. *scene of me eating a bland cake slice with a plastic knife like a fucking neanderthal*

It made weird noises and didn't stop. The others found it hella funny, but it was extremely annoying. I couldn't really eat and it hurt, just try pinching your legs and pull the hair there. 

It was quite a task but I grabbed it and ran to the fence with it, then threw it over. It even hit my face and the damn bird made a ruckus. The waitress called me animal abuser, other guests **took the fucking bird's side** although many of them saw it being a fuck. I tried to defend myself, but she had none of it and told me to leave. I didn't have to pay, so that's okay, but hell, what am I supposed to do in such a situation? 

The people with me told me I overreacted and just should've let the bird be. Also, they kept me waiting until they finished their food, I'm not mad though. I'm mad that I was the monster when a damn goose attacked me.

(I  also know that when a woman constantly accuses you of cheating, and you know you're not, then they're probably the ones cheating.) 2 days after that, she came over and we talked so she could have closure. I guess she construed it as I want to get back together, which is far from the case. So she wants to give me a second chance that I didn't ask for. So this morning, she calls me and asks if I want to hang out with her, I say no, I have things I need to take care of. Rent's due and such.

She's super cool and kind and frankly hot. I didn't have any kind of romantic life during high school (I lost my virginity to this girl during the first semester) so this is a pretty big deal for me.

So now I'm back home and I find myself talking about her a lot, and sometimes pretty much bragging.

I've shown them I think like, two pictures and mentioned that she's a contortionist a couple times.

I tried to tone it down next time we hung out but I did end up bragging once (I do feel really shitty that I still talked about her after knowing that someone is feeling down on themselves)

Despite that I've tried my best to combat it and go out of my comfort zone from time to time. My girlfriend knows this. In fact, a lot of my ""going out of my comfort zone"" moments were for her. Namely, moving to her native country where I don't even understand the language, meeting her parents (where one of them doesn't approve of her dating a foreigner), and meeting her friends for an entire day.

Today I was going to meet up with her after she was done meeting up with her friends. While I was on the tram there I asked if she was alone or waiting with her friends for me. She kept avoiding the question and generally acting annoyed at it. I got off the tram in a panic because I was especially anxious today.

She eventually answered and then asked what I would do if she wasn't alone, all in a very condescending and annoyed tone. I admitted I would not be able to show up and I would like her to make an excuse to meet me alone in that scenario. 

She got angry with me, continually asking me why I can't ""function like a normal person"" and all that. I was hurt by that greatly. We went back and forth a bit, I told her I didn't want to see her. She kept hounding me and asking me why I can't act like a normal person.

74,not the a-hole,"I love my bf. But he sometimes has a pretty unpleasant odor.

He has stopped wearing any kind of cologne because he wants to only put natural products on and in his body. I understand this. Unfortunately, this also means that he doesn't wear deodorant.

I don't know if he can smell himself but I can and sometimes his odor is pretty potent. He had a big launch event for a company that he works for two months ago and when I arrived to this big event where he was networking, he reeked. REEKED. He is very sensitive and gets very upset when I bring up issues. I can't tell if he is simply hard on himself or if he is being purposefully or inadvertently manipulative so that I stop bringing things up. For instance, me making a simple request turns into him having a meltdown about being the him being the most terrible person ever. 

So I attempted to approach the stinky issue very delicately. He was training for a bike trip and decided to start biking to work. I suggested that he maybe start wearing deodorant so as not to offend people with his odor when he arrives to work after the workout and throughout the day. He was VERY upset by my suggestion. I clarified that I am not suggesting this out of malice but mostly out of a pursuit for professionalism and out of concern for him. He eventually took my comment as it was intended. Since that time we purchased some natural deodorant. I've experimented with it myself and it works pretty well but I'd noticed that boyfriend hadn't used it. The other day after we'd both showered I offered him some and he put it on. I even remarked at how good it smelled on him and how much I liked it.

Well, a few days later, I guess he skipped a shower for a day. His boss is a little...hipstery and takes pride in only showering once every two weeks. Somehow, that works for his boss as he doesn't seem to smell. On a day where my boyfriend was kind of stinky his boss made the comment that it was getting hotter and that maybe they'd both need to start taking more frequent showers. My boyfriend laughed about this but I was really mortified for him.

Tonight after his shower I again offered him some deodorant. He had already been kind of crabby and we'd been bickering a bit. He made the sarcastic comment that he's sorry that he's not hygienic enough for me. And I got pretty frustrated. I told him that I shouldn't have to walk on eggshells to communicate with him. And that it shouldn't take HIS BOSS telling him that he stinks to do something about it when I tried to help him out with that a few months ago.

He said that I was cruel for using something that he shared with me against him.

I didn't really think too much of her until we walked home together from work about two weeks ago, and then ended up hanging out at my house twice, her house twice and went for dinner once (all in the past two weeks). Well yesterday I was on a short local hike with my friends and we hadn't made it very far before she started texting me that her mom (we both still live with our parents) was freaking out at her and she needed to see me right away, she seemed really worried at the time. I decided to walk back the trail that we had taken so far and catch the bus to a park near her house, where I met her and she explained that her mom was angry about not rinsing off a plate before she put it in the dishwasher, and began complaining about her broken fingernail and how much it would cost to fix. In that moment in the park, I realized that I didn't actually really want a relationship (with anybody, not necessarily just her), and that I should probably end this before it got more serious between us. I ended up telling her this and that I didn't want to have a girlfriend at the current time in my life. She definitely didn't take it very well, and went silent for a minute before she started questioning me about why I didn't tell her earlier. I didn't really have a good reason (I do feel like the asshole for this) and just ended up leaving and going home. Other than a few texts back and forth we haven't talked, and it's pretty clear that she's still mad at me.

Some extra details I don't know where to fit in:
- She just got from a weekend away and I knew she bought me a T-shirt, which I never ended up recieving from her
- I saw she just posted a brand new pair of mens shoes in my size on a local facebook buy/sell group, that I can only assume were meant to be a gift for me
- She told me earlier that her last ex (from about a month ago) was crazy and angry at her for seemingly no reason, but told me yesterday that she had actually been trying to come see me at work when she was with him and talking about me towards the end of their relationship (this made me feel bad for this guy)

77,everyone sucks,"I have this ""friend"" who we'll call Shawn. Shawn used to be a decent friend and at a time when I was more socially awkward helped me to get a few of my current friends. He even pushed me to ask out my first boyfriend. Fast forward a few years to 12th grade and he's a bit of a micromanaging dick in my life, and inexplicably doesn't trust me to do anything by myself, but I still give him the benefit of the doubt despite everyone else starting to hate him. 

Fast forward again and we're both in different colleges and only see each other when we're on break. Now everytime I see Shawn all he does is talk down to me or try to micromanage the hell out of everything that I do (ex: he can't seem to let go any mistake I make. I trip on the sidewalk and I guess I need fucking crutches now cause he just doesn't let it go and makes me feel like an idiot). He also uses the time to pester me about why I never ask *him* to hang out and why *he* always calls me (spoilers: I don't call anyone ever). Now that we're both on break from college he wants to do something every second we can, and even with friends that don't talk down to me and I like being around I don't want to see very second, so I've taken to just ghosting him because I'm mortified of confrontation.

I feel bad about this but I have a cocktail of mental issues without him, so why should I subject myself to hanging out when I know I'll just be upset afterwards anyway. 

Also to clarify: I have made it obvious, and even flat out told him multiple times, that I don't like having my life micromanaged and he should get off my back a little. 

Edit: I feel like i should clarify that I didn't start ghosting out of the blue. I've been friends with him for years now and tried to cut down on contact, but not before telling him that I don't want to be micromanaged or talked down to.

Were in our mid twenties. I honestly do love her very much, and I can't imagine being with anyone else.

There is one thing, though. I am way more active than she is. I always want to go to shows, go out drinking and go to different events, and she's always tired. I can get her to come out once or twice but if it's two weekends in succession she won't come out. I'm basically going out with a cat. An adorable cat that I can't help fawning over, but is kind of a pain to convince her to be active. I do understand that in relationships you recognise the good and bad in your other half so I don't resent her for not having as much energy as me, not one bit. It's just how she is, and I'm ok with that.  

However, it has an adverse effect on me. I used to be able to get her to come out a lot more, but after a chat I knew she felt I was dragging her all over the place, so I started to go out on my own. When she was in another country for study, she got mad at me for hanging out with a bunch of girls (it's complicated. I put a message up in a group chat and only girls responded and I was in a position where I couldn't call it off.) Just for some drinks and a chat. I can understand that, and learnt my lesson about that. After a while, things settled down and she seemed to be more comfortable with me going out on my own. I became a bit more vocal about it, and she doesnt seem stressed. But all this time I've had a little voice in the back of my mind nagging me that I'm leaving her out. I find myself feeling guilty for not bringing my girlfriend along to social occasions or events, because I'd know shed have fun. 

Today, the line up for this small festival go released and I told my girlfriend I read wanted to go. Last year we went it was only two days but this year it's three. I told her that I had a lot of fun last year and I want to go for the whole thing this year, and she said that last year after two days she was exhausted, and the food was really expensive. She's also not that into music as much as I am, I do freelance work in the industry and run a community. So I suggested that I get the tickets for the whole weekend and I'll get two day tickets for her, she discovered that there arent two day tickets, only one day and the whole weekend. So she said she'll get the whole weekend ticket as well. Bringing into account the stuff she said about last year and our difference in enthusiasm levels towards music, i felt really guilty about it. But if I say ""its ok dont come then"" it night guilt trip her or come across wrong. So...I just don't know what to do now.

So I guess this isnt solely an AITA. 

It's an AITA for going to more events than her, and a kind of ""what should I do"" in the future about these feelings.

83,not the a-hole,"AITA for being pissed that my(40f) husband(45m) and teenage son (16) did not acknowledge mother's day? 

A little backstory- married 20+ years, our teenage son lives at home, and our 6yo daughter was killed in an accident a few years ago. So needless to say, mother's day is kind of hard for me. 

So, husband and I get up in the morning, no acknowledgement whatsoever of mother's day. No ""Happy Mother's Day"". Literally all I wanted to hear.  I think maybe husband is just waiting for son to get up. Cool, whatever. Son gets up. Again, nothing from his mouth either. Then, the three of us talk about going to my MIL's house to take her HER MOTHER'S DAY present. So, at this point I know that they both know it is mother's day.

On the way to MIL's, we stop by the store so I can go in and get a gift bag for her gift. So, at this point, my husband has access to a store. Just saying. Go to MIL's, and I actually said that I had not gotten a ""Happy Mother's Day"" from either one of them, IN FRONT OF MY SON. Hey said he had to get to work. Ok. Thanks dude. 

Husband was counting on sex last night. Him and I get in the car to leave MIL's, told him it wasn't going to happen because I was pissed. And told him why I was pissed, becuase neither one of them had said ""Happy Mother's Day"". Honestly, that was all I wanted. A card would be the cherry on top. 

Actually, until the last year or two, husband used to be pretty good about acknowledging MD and my birthday. 
But, last fall, on my 40th birthday, husband did nothing. (It's in my comment history.) Seriously hurt my feelings, and I made sure he knew it. So you would think he would at least try. 

But, as the final piece to this little puzzle, I honestly don't know whether I'm overreacting or not. (For the record, I haven't yelled or anything. Said my peace and haven't talked to husband since.) I ran out of my anti-deppresent last week because I forgot to get my refill in time, but I should receive it today. So my emotions are all over the place anyways, and I straight-up bawled for hours last night.

 (I couldn't even call my own mom to tell her HMD, texted her a little stretch of the truth and told her I would talk to her today.

Final note: found a MD card in my purse this morning saying he (husband) had this card, but he was waiting to give it to me, but then ""I decided to hate him"" so he couldn't. I know what kind of cards he usually buys. This was not it. This was one of the last ones on the rack (because I was there hours before and they were pretty much all gone).

I ended up being jobless for about 3 - 1/2 months. During that time my wife told me that we could maybe borrow money from her mother and that she was cool and could let me pay her back in installments. Up to this point I never really had much interaction with my in-laws, but they were pretty neutral about me. I talked to my mother-in-law and she was really nice about it and kept saying things like ""It's all good, we are family now.""

Sidenotes - my wife is currently studying full time and is about to finish up her degree which is why she couldn't help with the inflow of money. Also I have a crappy relationship with my family for other reasons which is why I never asked for money from them.

Fast forward to when I started my new job. I start off working 40/w at minimum here in Texas (7.25). I then start getting messages from wife one morning saying that if I had the money to pay her mother back. I obviously didn't because I barely got the new job, plus I was told I could pay with installments. So I tell my wife that and she texts back ""alright."" So that's that. I get home after work and I noticed that there were a good amount of groceries that were missing even tho I had some groceries the day before.

That is just crazy but she helped us when we needed it so I let it slide. But ever since that day every time that lady needs something she pretty much harasses us into doing it by ""asking for favors"". Ex. Taking her to the airport in Mexico (we live in the border), taking her younger kids to school, walk into our apartment whenever she wants, tutor the kids, etc. And now there is no schedule for payments, whenever she wants/needs the money she calls us until we answer to ask for a payment. 
But here is the kicker! not only do we do every little thing she asks, every time we see her she reminds us of that money that she let us borrow. With mothers Day approaching my wife has a whole day a festivity in mind to spend with her mother, but I don't want to hang out with her family. I always leave those family meetings upset, because of every thing that they say. even one time I was explaining that we needed a set day for the payments, because I have other payments too and my mother-in-law said ""Well, if you hadn't lost your job for being lazy, you wouldn't have needed a loan in the first place."" I have the shittiest relationship with my family, but I would rather 1000% more spend it with them that with my mother-in-law.

My wife loooooooves her family to death and wants to hang out with them as much as she can and I am now ""part of their family"" but I feel like a slave when I am around that family. ",12,52,0.99
87,not the a-hole,"The party went on from several hours from approximately 6pm until well past 10pm which is when the music is supposed to be turned at least down.  At midnight with the party seeming to only get louder I decided it was time to call the cops.

edit: Some facts I should probably include:  This is in a residential neighborhood.  We aren't talking about an apartment or a dorm.  It was the next street over which my backyard backs up to their backyard.  The house was probably a good 4 to 5 doors down and yet it sounded like it was right next door.

92,not the a-hole,"My husband has a sore back. This means that I am doing the majority of the housecleaning as well as child care. It also means that I really can't leave the house. I have given up all exercise classes as well as going out with friends, as he can't lift our child. This has been the case for a couple of months now. The question is he will be going out for several hours tomorrow night, meaning I will need to take care of bedtime. Tonight he decided to go to a movie with friends, as he will just have to sit down, so it won't hurt his back. From his point of view he left later in the night and I wouldn't need him anyway. From my point of view I am just so exhausted from doing everything with literally no break (we have limited family support for babysitting) and about 20 minutes a day to myself. It just makes me so bitter that he is going out frequently when that is not an option for me because of his back.

93,not the a-hole,"Judge me, reddit. 

There is an annual event that I usually attended with a friend.  Tickets sell out fast (typically within a few minutes.) I take care of a family member full-time, so that long weekend is my only break out of the entire year and it's super important to me. 

Last time I attended with my friend we made an agreement that they would watch for the tickets to go on sale the following year. Well, they never contacted me and the tickets sold out.  It wasn't until several weeks later that I randomly visited the event site and realized everything was sold out.  

I'm not a person who cries easily but realizing my 'treat' wasn't going to happen hit me HARD.  I mean full-out, ugly sobs. My friend didn't seem to get why I was so upset. They said they had been having personal issues and had been depressed, and as a result hadn't personally felt invested in attending the event.

Now, I would have been disappointed but sympathetic if things had ended there.  Then my friend revealed they DID buy tickets for themself and their SO.  So they somehow found the mental fortitude to check the site, get out their credit card, and secure their own trip, but picking up the phone to call me had been just too much to handle.  Even if my friend hadn't been sure if they were attending or not until the last minute, they still could have given me a head-ups so I would have known I needed to keep an eye on the site myself.  Instead they didn't even bother to let me know they had their own ticket until after I brought the subject up. So my friend not only screwed me out of going with them, they screwed me out of going by myself too. 

My friend eventually seemed to realize I was well and truly pissed and offered to buy a second hand ticket.  By then all of the hotels in the area were booked and sharing a room with them wasn't something I wanted to do.  I really just felt like they just didn't want me to attend with them, though they kept insisting that wasn't the case.  

So am I the asshole for not accepting depression as a reasonable explanation for this? ",16,50,0.98

95,not the a-hole,"   Infidelity and dishonesty are my two biggest fears in dating. They are my Achilles heal. Within half a year both of those fears were thrown at me by my girlfriend, who I still love deeply but am very angry with.

   After dating for six months my girlfriend and I had hit a rough patch. I was jealous and insecure and constantly afraid that my girlfriend wasn't being honest. She was in a depression, an alcoholic  and anorexic during this. She only became aware of the alcohol and anorexia two months before we split up. She became very distant and very hard to speak to. I was scared and anxious and acted irrationally by hovering and smothering her.

   A day or two before a big Christmas party with all of our friends she decided a break was in order. During the party she was very snarky with me and refused to open my Christmas gift. I don't bother talking to her the next couple days and on Christmas Eve I'm invited to her mom's house for dinner the next day. After that dinner, which was wonderful, she told me she loved me and that I should come over so we can exchange gifts. Everything was great. The next day she came over in a fuss and broke up with me.

   After about a week and a half she says she misses me. She goes to a residential program for eating disorders, changes drastically for the better. When she came home I had heard from someone that she slept with her roommate (we'll call him Guy) and my friend of many years. I was upset and I confronted her. She told me it was one night and nothing else. I confronted him and he said the same thing. I try to move on and it's going well. During one of my nights of tossing and turning my girlfriend, who is fast asleep, rolls over, moans and says Guy's name. I got very nervous and upset and in my sleepy mind I found it right to look through her phone. I saw that she had cheated on me Christmas night, within an hour of us exchanging gifts. She had been contacting other guys as well. I went back further and saw suspicious texts from an ex and read them. I ruined her privacy and I felt horrible. 

   The next morning I woke her up and explained everything and how sorry I was that I went through her phone but that didn't change the fact that I needed answers about everything. Over the next few days I found that she cheated, spent more than one night with Guy in his bed, was doing cocaine behind my back during the beginning of our relationship (she was aware that my father died of a cocaine overdose and that I have a very big problem with it and most hard drugs) and had lied about all of it. 

   I had the biggest gut feeling when we started dating that she wasn't being honest and that I had to be careful trusting her. This whole ordeal only reinforced my fears and made me even more inclined to trust my intuition and go with it. She's unbelievably apologetic and wishes she could take it all back. She never wants to hurt me again and doesn't want to spend another day without me.

   The angry side in me is saying, ""you ruined a friendship and created a rift, you lied and cheated and I cant trust you ever again. 
   The optimist in me is saying, ""she's remorseful, she was in a horrible place and Guy was there for comfort, and maybe I can learn to trust again.

   I'm still very angry at her. I know it wasn't HER doing it but her depression and alcoholism that lead to self destructive behaviors. I'm aware that she didn't consciously do this TO me but did it to herself. Am i the asshole for still being so angry?

97,not the a-hole,"So last Saturday I went to a party with two of my friends. I got way too drunk and had trouble walking straight, staying alert and was visibly a mess. I have social anxiety and the party was super crowded and I could feel myself beginning to have an anxiety attack. Obviously, I wanted to go home. So I told one of the friends I was with that I wanted to go and she agreed with me because she wasn't feeling great as well. The other friend was furious that I wanted to go home and tried to make me feel guilty and kept saying that I would regret not going. Finally she says it's not fair because she wants to stay downtown and I was going to ruin her night. 

I'm arguing back and forth with her on the way to the bus stop, trying my hardest to find a compromise. I told her that I would stay with her until her boyfriend got there and then I would leave but she refused and demanded that I stay the entire time. I said no, I'm having an anxiety attack I need to go home and she just was not having it. For some reason she decided to focus all of her anger on me rather than between me and the other girl who wanted to go home. 

Finally, she gets in my face and starts screaming how I'm being selfish and that I'm ruining her night. I'd had it at that point and was crying and super drunk so I yelled ""stop screaming in my fucking ear"". Then she got in my face and screamed ""HAH? Stop screaming in your ear? Stop being so selfish"". So I rolled my eyes, yelled again for her to stop screaming at me and got on the bus. A minute afterward she and the other friend got on the bus and sat as far away as possible from me. It was empty though so I could still hear her talking shit. 

Anyway, three days later and she has yet to apologize or say anything to me. AITA here?",10,33,0.91
98,asshole,"This happened about an hour ago, and I don't know if I was being an asshole in this situation-

To start this, I'm going to mention that I used to use online dating sites; mainly for a bit of banter to see who was out there (a la ""The Den""- minus the murders) and then as a form of looking for hookups like I used to do on tinder. I wasn't looking for anything serious, just a bit of fun.

I met this one person, we chatted, exchanged kik usernames (I don't disclose facebook info to people I don't know), and we started talking on skype. There was a bit of webcam stuff (as we live a fair distance apart), but I noticed he was a little bit more serious than I was about it. I was a little bit uncomfortable with that as I really wasn't looking for anything serious at the time. Eventually college, coursework, spending time with my family and issues with my friends ate up a lot of my time, and I didn't have a lot of free time. I told him this and he did message me every so often but the conversations were short lived, so I didn't think he was interested/that bothered as it wasn't serious, and left him alone/moved on (and also got into a relationship)

I got a message from him today saying ""baby"" I sent him ""?"". I also sort of forgot who was messaging me as it had been a while without contact. Had I not noticed the chat logs, i'd have asked who it was and how he got my contact information.
He tells me he misses me, I ask him why. He says that he got feelings for me. This kinda annoyed me because him taking something, that was essentially a hookup, over the internet seriously. I told him ""this may seem a little bit dickish, but you only know me over the internet"". He tells me things like ""I enjoyed the time we had even if it was just over the internet"" and I reiterated the point of that fact that it's the fucking internet (and not even a relationship either)-  that he's taking it way too seriously/got attached"". 

He tells me ""I'll leave you alone I guess I'm just being a nuisance"". This one sentence pissed me off more than anything. to me it comes off as playing the 'I'm going to blame myself more than ever to make you feel bad about what you said"". It felt like a guilt trip and I wasn't having it.Then goes on to tell me he didn't take anything seriously, despite what was said while we were chatting previously over skype/kik.... And having told me he has feelings for me 10 minutes prior. 

I'm really done with this so I tell him the cold hard truth, that is the fact that A) He barely knows me (if at all) and B) he only knows me online, on ONE website, and TWO apps. That's the extent of the ways we could communicate.

I tell him that getting attached to someone isn't a good idea in most cases. I mean online relationships working out don't really turn out well a lot of the time. He asks what the big deal is, and I tell him it's because it's the motherfucking internet. People don't even take threats online seriously for god's sake. There was some back and forth in which I talked down to him for taking what was going on seriously because in reality, he knows very little about me, if anything at all. 
I tell him to stop messaging me about it, or I'd end up blocking him, and the conversation just ends.

I guess the only thing to ask is was I being an asshole for doing this as I'm in two minds about it.

((Just bear in mind I'd never said I was serious at all, nor had I expressed an interest in having a relationship with him. I feel like if he took our conversations that way, even though I didn't say anything of the sort to him that would make him think that, that's on him and not me))

100,everyone sucks,"So i have always gotten along perfectly with my friend until i disagreed with one of his political views. I'll refrain from saying what it is just in the interest of keeping the discussion focused on whether i am the asshole or not. 

In truth i am pretty apathetic on the issue. He sent me a political meme along with a laughing emoji. I say ""really? i think (insert opinion here)?"" He replies back to me: ""Dude. you really think that? Like honestly? That's ridiculous."" He then sends me a handful of angry paragraphs with links after each one. I skim it and reply ""I guess i can see your point"" in hopes of defusing the situation.

I didn't think much of it until the next time we decided to hang out. He asks if I agree with him after what he sent me, and i say no, i do not. He says that he cant believe i would think something so absurd. I tell him i really don't care all that much about the issue, and i think it is fine if he has another opinion. He demands that i explain my reasoning, which i agree to, but am interrupted in absolute rage after a few seconds. He rants about how wrong i am and how stupid it is to hold such an opinion. Trying to be reasonable, i again say that i see where he is coming from. I then make multiple attempts to casually shift the conversation in another direction, to no avail. After the casual route doesn't work i straight up say ""dude, can we just talk about something else? I'm sorry we disagree but i came here to have a good time, not argue."" He disregards this. Hours go by before i finally make up an excuse to leave.

We decide to hang out again the next week. After greeting each other the first thing he says is ""Look, about last week dude. I just get really heated when it comes to that topic."" I reply ""no worries, we have all been there man."" I am relieved that all is well before he immediately says ""Ya i mean it's just (insert random opinion) really doesn't make any sense to me. Like how can you really believe that and still call yourself a good person?"" 

My stomach turns as i realize what this is about to snowball into. And it DOES. Once again i remain calm and nod my head as he rants (though this time i am getting really mad internally). I ignore the little jabs at my intelligence and questions of my sanity.   He yells he is not done yet when i try to change the topic (At this point i really AM questioning my sanity). When nothing changes after about 40 minutes i once again tell him that i have to leave. He looks at me in disgust and says: ""You're really gonna disregard all the points I've been making?!?! I guess I've been wasting my time here. Go run away again like a fucking COWARD! I though you were better than that!""

I....freaking....lose it. ""BETTER THAN WHAT?"" i exclaim. The next raging barrage of insults i screamed was something along the lines of ""I'm better than you in every fucking way possible! First of all, you're dumb as fucking rocks! You flunked out of class because you couldn't understand basic fucking courses. Not to mention i have had 3 different girlfriends since we have know each other and you STILL bitch and moan about how lonely you are. I had to stop bringing Sarah (not real name of ex) over because she thought you were a creepy fucking loser. Sucks not having a single ounce of social skills, doesn't it? What more can i be 'better than that' at? The fact that i wipe my ass with your salary? You had daddy's trust fund to fall back on and you still haven't amounted to SHIT! You think i had it that easy? Oh and you got a problem with me saying this? Then throw a punch man. Oh wait, YOU'RE the coward and you KNOW id kick the shit out of you! Don't ever fucking disrespect me like that again! You will always be dirt."" Absolutely livid, i then stormed out of his house.

Obviously i feel terrible about saying all that. If i could take it all back i would. I hate egotistical people, so it was really cringy writing that all out! Though part of me still feels it was justified. I tried my best to conduct myself in a reasonable manner. I gave him every opportunity to chill out, to take the hint, to agree to disagree. Hours upon hours. Eventually i completely blew up and said the worst thing i could to him because he just would...not...stop. So who is it gonna be Reddit?",88,33,0.79

102,not the a-hole,"So long story, my father passed the end of last year and because of that, I inherited about 45k that HE was intended to inherit. 

My father was not a particularly good father, he was barely ever around, never financially supported me. Just made pretty shitty decisions his entire life. Ive always had a very good and mostly normal relationship with his family, especially my long been divorced grandparents. 

Once he went away for a few years when I was in HS our relationship really just became non-existent. He had another son right before he went in with a batshit crazy nutcase who lost custody of all her kids including my ""half brother."" My aunt (his sister) and uncle adopted kindly his son and he has a WAY better life then he ever would have had. 

After my dad got out and up until his death we had an OKAY relationship but not too much contact. Meanwhile he was staying with my grandmother. She had always made some pretty bad decisions also, especially financially which is why she now lives a very modest life. 

Anyway, to get to the crux of the matter, I inherited this nice little nest egg. I have debt from when I put myself through College, just bought a house with my SO, have $0 savings, and would really like to get married and have my own family. 

Since I received that $$, I paid off some high interest debt from school, and put the rest into a savings account. 

My grandmother, whom I love dearly has been hinting at money problems ever since I got this windfall. She had also mentioned a few times that my father would have wanted BOTH of his sons to split the money. My ""brother"", or in the real sense, cousin is now 9 years old and barely even knew my dad as half his life he was in jail and the other half my aunt and uncle were always fighting about it. Also, legally because he was adopted, he isn't legally entitled to anything. 

I could put some money in an account for my ""brother"" and help my grandmother out with a couple thousand but that would virtually leave me with very little left. 

And personally the way I see it is that my grandmother is responsible for her own financial instability and I should definitely not be responsible for trying to rectify her mistakes. If I were a millionaire then I could, but Im just basically starting my life. And my ""brother"" wasn't really even my father's son. He didn't have to put up with all the bullshit. He has a good life with my aunt and uncles family. 

AITA for not giving my grandmother and brother some of my inheritance? 


EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and insight. It was good to see that the majority of you would do the same as me. Ive paid off a good chunk of debt and I can now breath month to month without the student loan police knocking down my door. The rest will stay in savings until I make a decision on bow best to invest/or save for my future. Thanks  Again!",37,37,0.93
103,not the a-hole," got my girlfriends permission to post this:

TLDR: I helped my gf initiate a sensitive conflict-esque conversation with a friend, but gf’s friend was not at all receptive and instead got very upset that we ‘handled the situation inappropriately’ 

background:
I caught on pretty early on in the relationship that my girlfriend, ""Jane"", has major eating issues. About a week into our relationship, I asked her about it. I was bulimic in college so I started by telling her my story and asking if she also had issues with food. Since then we've has a very open dialogue about her eating issues. I have learned so many recipes that she finds appetizing and have helped her find a good therapist. I have worked hard to keep her accountable without shaming her.

Important for later: One of the hardest parts is that she has an incredibly hard time talking about this stuff. The first time we talking about it, there was a lot of crying and long pauses as she tried to even get the words out. She couldn’t even tell her therapist at first. I urged her to initiate with an email.

One quick side note is that Jane was a dancer. She was a modern dance major in college and movement is how she connects to the world most strongly. Unfortunately she has had bad knees since her senior year of college and is very limited. She can't remember the last time her knee's weren't in at least a little pain. The only exercise she can do at this point is yoga, and even that can be excruciating sometimes. She feels trapped in a defective body.

SO, cut to Jane’s best friend ""Angela"", who is on this huge fitness kick. She has a whole separate instagram dedicated to fitness. She can't go a sentence without talking about how she's ""doing the whole 30"" and she greets you like ""hey sorry I'm sweaty, I just came from xyz work out class."" She is just a generally braggadocios person. Anytime someone talk about diet and exercise, it takes Jane’s mind to dark places. Many of her early friendship ended because she and the other girl got weirdly competitive about their bad eating habits. Jane has worked really hard on trying to rewire her brain and grow and not let conversations like that affect her, but its still hard. It has all been exacerbated by the fact that Jane can’t so much as go for a jog without being in pain. 

 Story
Every time that Jane hangs out with Angela, she rants to me about how Angela dominates the conversation with stories of how sore she is, and how healthy she’s been eating. I always tell her to confront Angela, but again Jane has a really hard time bringing this stuff up. This last time I offered to talk to Angela to get the ball rolling. Jane agreed and gave me permission to reach out.

So I called Angela and did my best to handle the situation as delicately  as possible. I started by saying ""hey theres something sensitive Jane deals with and the only reason I know about it is because I confronted her about it"" and I brought up the eating stuff and Angela very matter-of-factly replied ""oh I know"" (which, if you've known, then why never bring it up as a point of concern!?!? but whatever). I proceed to let her know that the fitness and diet stuff is a sensitive area for Jane and that while I do not believe Angela was doing anything wrong by talking about something she's proud of (<- and I really emphasized this point), I thought she might want to know that this was hard for Jane, and I wanted to put it on her radar. At this point she becomes incredibly defensive. Talking about how fitness makes up a huge portion of her life and she can’t just not talk about it. She then goes “I’m not really sure what you’re asking me to do?”. Its a weird conversation where my ultimate message is, “hey, I just wanted to put this on your radar so that you guys can have a conversation about this” I really truly did my best to make sure it didn’t sound like I was accusing Angela of anything. I love Jane and often do things like this that involve standing up for Jane, but the truth is I’m almost as non-confrontational as she is and do my best to be diplomatic.

The worst part is what she does after. She texts Jane that she’s very upset and wants to talk. Jane stalls for a while and as Jane is writing out a long text, Angela called and Jane reluctantly answers. As Jane predicted, the conversation starts off with Jane having to apologize. They spend an hour on the phone talking about how Jane handled the situation poorly and how its not my place (as someone who has only been in Jane’s life for 1/6 the amount of time that Angela has) to get in the way of their friendship. She says “I understand that this is hard to bring up, but there must have been a better way”. She keeps saying stuff like ‘understand what you’re going through and how hard this is (which, no she f*cking doesn’t), but think about me and my feelings and how this all makes me feel’. She talks about how Jane didn’t consider her feelings at all. She goes on to say that this situation just demonstrates the weakness of my character as a bf in thinking that what I did was appropriate. At one point Angela (with not context or background knowledge) accuses me of enabling K’s eating habits. Jane has to defend aspects of her mental health issues to Angela in an attempt to have some sort of leg to stand on. Angela isn’t hearing any of it, she’s only out to prove how much she’s been wronged. Angela basically sidesteps the whole original problem and made herself the victim in all of this. The whole conversation was made out so that Jane was the bad guy and when they hung up all Jane could do was cry.

Am I the Asshole? 

AITA for reaching out to someone who supposedly cares about Jane and talking to them about something that is hard for her to put into words? We have spent a long time trying to see it from Angela’s perspective, but we’ve both come to the conclusion that if one of our friend’s S.O.’s reached out to us in this way, we would appreciate that this was a sensitive topic and understand that the comment was coming out of a place of “hey we’re all on the same team in caring about this person”.


My personal perspective:

It feels like she doesn’t want to feel guilty so she’s doing all of these were emotional/logical gymnastics to make herself the victim.
I have never thought of Angela as a good friend. I think she is a narcissist and doesn’t care about other people’s feelings if it conflicts her ego. A few months Jane texted me this long essay about how she feels alone and how me and her mom are the only ones who ask her how she’s doing and how her day is going and how even though she is consistently checking up on Angela. Angela only ever talks about herself. 
When Jane went to her Grandmothers funeral she came home and was super exhausted from her flight. Angela asked if Jane was coming to her Super Bowl party (which started only a few hours after Jane landed). Jane let her know that she was super tired and just wanted to sleep. Angela, who KNEW that Jane had been at her grandmother’s funeral and spent the weekend with her emotionally abusive father, replied with a passive-aggressive “ok, whatever” and didn’t ever ask how Jane was feeling, not during the weekend, not before or after.

I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even want to be in the same room as her. I’m not going to tell Jane which friends to cut of or which to keep, because I feel like that crosses the line between protective and controlling. I just feel like Angela is a toxic friend and Jane deserves better.

I’m sorry that this became more of a rant than an AITA, but I would still love your feedback. While I obliviously think I’m in the right, I’m very open to different perspectives.
