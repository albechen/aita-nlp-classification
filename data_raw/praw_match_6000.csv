0,Not the A-hole,"Am I the Asshole for completely ghosting my job?

I just transferred to a new location after working at another store for 14 months, and it was good at first. But then I started having a lot of stress at my new store. They constantly scheduled me during my classes for college and had me working nearly 40 hours a week while I'm a full time student. 

I had made it clear that school was my priority, as it should be, but it didnt matter to them in the slightest. They started treating me poorly after my first week there an reprimanding me for almost everything they felt I may have done wrong, they wont even trying to make it constructive criticism, which would have been fine with me. I love to work hard and learn how to do things better, but not if you make me feel stupid.

It had gotten so bad that the last time I showed up to my shift I had a breakdown at the end of it, say how it was all getting to be too much for me. How I felt undervalued, belittled, used and burnout. And I havent gone back since.

Now I have blocked my works number and all repeat callers whose number I dont have saved. Should I have told them I quit because I couldnt handle it anymore, or is it okay that I just disappeared into the night?

 (This is not a professional business job btw, I worked at a grocery store)",78,80,0.93

5,Not the A-hole,"So, I just got 23andMe done. It confirmed that I, a big, tall, African American, am infact black. It also showed that I have some white in me as well (a percentage in the teens, this is normal for African Americans).

One of the features the site has is allowing people to see genetic relatives who also took the test. I messed around, clicked on people and found an interesting fourth cousin: an older white man in southern Texas.

A chunk of me wants to say hi, but I also realize that having a confirmed black relative could be an issue. I imagine getting hard confirmation of one's family's participation in slavery wouldn't be easy.

7,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, mobile, the usual.
I live in a trad country with multigenerational homes and adults live with parents until old age. The traditional, unspoken arrangement is that children take care of parents once they start working by taking over the bills and expenses for the parents, and whoever takes care of the parents or doesn‚Äôt move out inherits the house.

Spouse‚Äôs parents had us live in their house when we got married because they lived in another country. They helped a bit with bills when we started but we were paying rent, and now have taken over all bills.

The house was transferred to our name and we agreed on a monthly payment. But now spouse‚Äôs parents retired and moved back in with us, all expenses paid, including hospitalization, leisure, even mobile and cable plans (we don‚Äôt watch tv) etc... and we still pay them monthly. Adding also, spouse‚Äôs one parent has tried to get us to pay more like foot credit card bills or their loans to other siblings.

AITA for resenting this? Also, anyone out there have this kind of arrangement or any other subs you guys can recommend?",37,130,0.96

10,No A-holes here,"One of the girls in my chemistry study group expressed to us in the past that she didn't take advanced functions (aka algebra II for American high school students) in high school, and had a poor relationship with math, only taking data/stats in her senior year, failed functions (algebra I), and never took calculus either.

ANYWAYS, we get to a particular step in this molarity problem where we had our value in litres and had to change it to millilitres. Because my group knew that L to mL's can be expressed as 1L/1000mL, we decided to shorten it and express it as 1/10\^3. But she got angry that we kept on using exponents to shorten our values, like when we converted the previous givens with 10\^6, or expressing 100 as 10\^2, so we changed it and returned it to its expanded form.

Although we changed our notation and continued with the problem, she kept on questioning why we kept on changing it, and IN PARTICULAR, how expressing 100 is equivalent to (10\^3/10\^1). We told her not to worry to much about it, but she persisted with her misunderstanding, so I went up to the board and began to step-by-step explain the basics of exponential laws. Now I wanted to make sure she got what she came for, so I went very slowly to make sure she understood, and even when I checked up to see if she was following, she would always nod and say ""yep!"".

However, as I continued with my explanation, I noticed that she started to tear up, and her voice became shakier and shakier, so I stopped explaining right away to ask her if she was okay. She still said that she was fine, and told me to keep explaining, but once I turned my back to the board I immediately heard sniffling. Suddenly, tears were brimming her eyes and she was on the verge of tears.

No one in the group was expecting this at all, so we all awkwardly stared and asked if she wanted us to stop. She didn't say anything at first, but then she just said that she needed to go and packed up her bags.

With everyone watching. Quietly.

Once she left the room I felt terrible. But when I texted her to ask if it was how I explained it, she didn't respond. My group members tell me that I shouldn't feel bad, because it may have been a wakeup call to her in terms of her low proficiency in the course, but something deep down in me believes that I was the way I spoke to her. I felt like going through exponential laws with her shouldn't have been done in the first place, and that I could've made it very overwhelming for her to process. She's really sweet too, she wants to be a paediatric surgeon and the whole ""save lives"" shebang, and I worry that I my approaches to further her understanding might have crushed her dreams.",49,51,0.87

14,Not the A-hole,"#UPDATE
I emailed my teacher and explained everything. I warned her of a possible incoming email from dad and apologized for procrastinating, specifically saying that I wasn't going to ask for a second chance because I screwed up. She said that she appreciated my honesty and, since she values honesty, she's giving me until tomorrow night to turn in the work. Thank you everybody for your kind words and advice. 

====================

Okay so, I [15M] fucked up. I currently have a D in my history class because I have two missing assignments (from when I was in the hospital) that I still haven't turned in. The teacher gave me one last chance- Get them in tonight by 11:59 and she'll give me the credit. I procrastinated until the last minute (knew since Tuesday) and guess what fucking happened? My internet went out, and still hasn't gone back up. It's 11:07 as I type this, for reference. This is my fault, and I know this. This isn't what I'm asking for judgement on.

I told my dad that I'm just going to have to take the D for this quarter, but it's not the end of the world. If I get an A next quarter and an A on the midterm, my semester grade will be a B. I'm usually a straight-A student, so this wouldn't be too hard. Dad flipped his shit. He threatened to ground me if I didn't get the work turned in tomorrow, and I told him that I *can't*, the assignments close out after 11:59 and I can't turn them in unless the teacher opened them up. I specifically asked her if I could turn them in Monday and she said no, she needs them by Friday so she has time to grade them. Understandable. My dad started making a big fuss about it and saying that he was going to email the teacher to tell her to open the assignment. I started telling him repeatedly to not do it because, not only will it not accomplish anything, it'll make the teacher's day hell and she'll probably know me as the kid with an entitled dad. He called me a motherfucker and started repeatedly telling me to ""shut up, just shut up"" so I went to my room and locked the door. That was that. He's probably gonna fucking email her anyway. She's such a nice lady, too. She literally just won't have time to grade my work now.",81,213,0.93
15,Asshole,"One month ago, I moved from FL to TN to start a 1 yr internship. I am 18 yrs old, just graduated, and have never moved away from home before. I have weekly phone calls with my boyfriend and parents to keep us informed about what‚Äôs happening in each other‚Äôs lives.
This week on Wednesday, I call my parents because we scheduled a phone call for this night. I tell them I had a pretty bad day and they say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we can‚Äôt really talk right now, but we‚Äôre on for Friday night and this weekend, right?‚Äù And I say sure. Come Thursday night to find out, that they have traveled to TN, but hadn‚Äôt told me. (I found out through my sister hinting at it, a post on Facebook, and then confirmed it on Life 360.) Surprised, excited, and relieved, I text them, ‚Äúare you in TN??‚Äù And they respond with ‚ÄúüòÅ We‚Äôre celebrating our 20th Anniversary in Nashville. We‚Äôre at a concert.‚Äù Still excited, I ask ‚ÄúWhen are you coming to see me?‚Äù They don‚Äôt respond for the rest of the night. 
I wake up the next day to a text from my dad that says ‚ÄúLove you bud, we‚Äôre talking tonight right?‚Äù And I ask ‚ÄúAre you not coming to visit?‚Äù He finally tells me ‚ÄúNo, this trip is for our 20th anniversary, should‚Äôve communicated better. We‚Äôll try to visit around Thanksgiving though.‚Äù Heartbroken, and extremely disappointed, HOPING IT WAS A JOKE, I sobbed throughout the whole day (Friday). However, their anniversary isn‚Äôt actually this month, it was during the summer. I text them ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to have our phone call tonight‚Äù because I‚Äôm really hurt, and they don‚Äôt say anything else for the entire day. 
By nighttime, I‚Äôm a basket case, so I call them and confront them. My mom plays dumb and acts like nothing had happened. I get really frustrated and say how badly they‚Äôve hurt me by getting my hopes up and that they know how homesick I‚Äôve been this week, for them to be less than three hours away from me and not planning on making even a short trip to say hi. My dad apologizes again, but says this weekend is really special and needed for them. They had to go to TN because the concert tickets they purchased in January were for there. My mom however says, ‚ÄúYou should really try to look at it from our perspective. You‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs bitter about it, we‚Äôve moved on. I suggest you forgive us and be happy for us since it‚Äôs our 20 year anniversary.‚Äù Then, she says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to our dinner reservation. I‚Äôm gonna hang up now.‚Äù And she does. They are supposed to travel home tomorrow, and there‚Äôs time for them to stop by my city and visit even for an hour, but I doubt that will happen. Even my boyfriend has driven 12 hours to visit me, and my grandparents have reservations for next week. AITA for being mad at them for keeping it a secret from me, my mom expecting me to get over it and be happy for them, and them still not coming to visit?

INFO EDIT: If they were to come visit me on their way home (today) it would be an extra three hour drive, not six.

UPDATE: I called them this morning and we talked it through! I explained how I felt and also validated that they do deserve a vacation. We forgive each other and are moving on! I am glad I took a few days to cool off before responding with my emotions being so fresh. Thanks for your help!",108,141,0.89

17,Not the A-hole,"So I am in high school and was friends with this girl. She was in the same friend group as me and some stuff happened which caused her to be kicked out of it. I decided to stay neutral and be friends with her still because I didn‚Äôt want any part of it.

So it‚Äôs now our senior year and her and I were talking and she talking about her ass. She does this a lot. Talking about ass and farting and all sorts of nasty stuff. But I tolerated it because I thought she was a good friend. One day as a joke she sticks her ass up in the air and says 

‚ÄúKiss my ass‚Äù  as a joke 
I responded ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt kiss that flat thing it looks like raw pancake batter‚Äù 

I laughed she laughed we moved on.  I told the story to some of our mutual friends because I didn‚Äôt think it meant anything. 

A week later I get called down to the guidance office and am told that said friend made a harassment claim against me over what I said. I and our mutual friends explained she never indicated to me it wasn‚Äôt a joke. Eventually the girl admitted I didn‚Äôt actually harass she and she only said it was harassment because one of our mutual friend kept saying her ass was flat to her after I told her the joke. So the claim was dropped.

After this I confronted her and told her if you have the nerve to claim something as serious as harassment against me when you know it isn‚Äôt true have the nerve to tell me the problem to my face. She said she did it  because she didn‚Äôt want to make the claim against our mutual friend. (I know it doesn‚Äôt make much sense but that was the reasoning). So I told her I don‚Äôt want to be friends with someone who would slander me like that. 

It has been two weeks and we are not on speaking terms. I feel bad it ended like this all because of a one off joke but at the same time I won‚Äôt be friend with a someone who is willing to lie over something that serious.

20,No A-holes here,"Long-time lurker and first-time poster. I had to make an account.  


This happened earlier today. I (m25) was hanging out with a friend (f24). We were in her dorm room and just taking and scrolling through our phones when the topic of weddings came up. I have no interest in weddings, but she was really excited. She then goes on to the topic of what she'd want her cake to look like. The conversation is as followed.  


F: I already know what I'd want my cake to look like. Maybe I'll have you make it.  
Me: Oh? Care to show me? (I'm actually a baker and am in school for it and she has seen some of the cakes I've made in classes.)  
F: This! \*shows me a picture on her phone\*  
Me: Ah.

She had noticed a bit of disinterest in my voice when I saw the cake and asked what wrong. I proceed to tell her that I'm nothing really into naked cakes. For those that don't know naked cakes are cakes with little to no icing on the outside of them with little garnish. They begun a popular wedding trend. Example: [https://www.brides.com/gallery/naked-wedding-cakes-no-icing](https://www.brides.com/gallery/naked-wedding-cakes-no-icing)  She asked me why and in response I asked could I be completely honest with her. She nodds and says sure. I say word for word ""They just look bad to me. The cakes look unfinished as if someone stopped at the crump coat with no border and just fruits or live flowers just placed on it. I honestly can see myself making something like that because I personally would feel proud of it.

At this point she's visibly upset, not raging mad, but you can tell she's hurt. We talk for a bit more before I left and that's it for now. But I started thinking was I an asshole for expressing my opinion. She's not planning over getting married anytime soon, but I felt I killed her joy about her cake idea.",97,175,0.92
21,No A-holes here,"My dad was in the military for a very long time. He is super patriotic... as in he only eats at Mission BBQ and his Facebook profile pic right now is a bald eagle with an American flag photo-shopped over it's face.

My childhood home had an open concept downstairs and right next to the living room was the den that my father used as his office. It was covered with bald eagles (admittedly a lot of them were on awards he received while serving). The biggest one sat on the top of his desk with it's wings outstretched and one talon reaching forward.

I have always had a difficult relationship with my dad. We're not estranged but I feel like it would be easier if we were. It's bad enough that my therapist thought that I should limit my contact with him and, when I do see him a few token times a year, that I should try to get him to come see me in my house instead of returning to my childhood home.

I live in a nice home with my wonderful boyfriend. He is in to ultra-marathons that are on trails through the mountains and, although I can barely run a mile, I'm super supportive. I drive for hours, hike out to the aide stations, make sure he has everything he needs,  hike to the next aide station, take care of him while he recovers, etc.

A few years ago, he won a 32 mile race with a crazy amount of elevation gain, which is fucking insane. Not just the top of his age group but the overall winner. He received a really big plaque to hang on our bedroom wall.  It was a really big deal.

Take a second to guess what's on the plaque.

...

Yup.  A huge bald eagle; wings outstretched and one talon reaching forward.

I have been looking at that plaque for years now. I kept hoping that, given enough time, I wouldn't think of my dad every single time I saw it. However, to this day, I get this dropping feeling in my stomach every time I lock eyes with that damned eagle. I've trained myself to avoid looking at that corner of the room as much as possible.

I finally asked my boyfriend if we could put the plaque away or at least hang it somewhere less visible (where I don't have to wake up to it). He was extremely offended. He understands the connection between bald eagles and my father but he thinks that I should put that aside in light of the achievement that he worked very hard for. I tried to explain that I'm not offended by it based on principle, it's more of a visceral reaction that I can't prevent.

The conversation ended with him leaving (he had plans) and hasn't been brought up again since. However, I can tell that it's still stewing in his brain.  I feel like he's going to take it down soon but then resent me for it.

Am I the asshole?

23,Asshole," I got some 1oz silver coins and thought it‚Äôd be cool to leave one as a tip at a really nice restaurant sometime.

24,Everyone Sucks,"Using a throwaway.

So I had a gig in a town near my hometown (like 40mi away). After the gig a bandmate of mine started flirting with this local girl, and after a while they decided they want to spend the night together at the girls place. Ok sure. However there was a small problem. The girl had promised one of her girlfriends that she could stay the night at her place, but obviously since my bandmate and the girl were getting pretty fond of each other, they wanted to have the whole apartment to them and them alone. This girlfriend of hers came to see the show from another city and now she didn't have a place to crash. Most of her stuff, including her phone charger and most of her money were already at the other girls' place, so she felt pretty lost and was almost in tears. I then offered to give her a ride to her cabin which was like 30mi away. However due to playing the gig just a short while earlier, I was pretty exhausted and just wanted to go home so I offered her to sleep on my couch. She happily agreed. 

We start driving and I tell her almost immediately that I have a girlfriend and I only want to offer her a safe place to spend the night in. She fully understood. Great. We eventually get to my place and I then text my girlfriend telling about the situation. She immediately flips and thinks I took her to my place to have sex with her. I tried to convince her that that's not the case but she didn't believe me at all. To make things worse, my girlfriend was seeing a gig with a male friend of hers, and she started to threaten me with having sex with the guy. Since my intentions were pure, I felt pretty horrible. We both have been cheated on in the past by previous partners, so at the start of our relationship we made it very clear to each other that we both despised people who cheat and that we would never cheat on each other.

So then I tell the girl that my girlfriend was not happy about the whole thing. She understood and apologized. My mother doesn't really spend time at her apartment since she spends so much time with her boyfriend, so I decided to drop the girl off at my mothers empty apartment. I also borrowed her one of my phone chargers. She thanked me a thousand times and seemed really happy. I texted my girlfriend telling her that the girl is no longer with me and that she's at my mom's place but my girlfriend still hasn't answered me. During this last two hours I've sent her messages telling her basically that she's the only one who matters to me and that it was never my intention to have sex with the other girl. I've also apologized to her a few times. She has read all my messages but hasn't responded anything.

I'm at a loss. I thought she'd perceive the whole thing as a nice gesture towards the other girl but I was terribly mistaken.

A little background information: my girlfriend was not comfortable with kissing me in front of her immediate family in the first year of us dating. I bit the bullet and just accepted that because she is introverted, has mild social anxiety and comes from a fairly conservative background. No problem. But we‚Äôve been dating pretty much 3 years at this point. Her whole extended family knows me and gets along with me pretty well.

3. we offered to help her study for the test when she was in hs, she shooed us away because she said she‚Äôd rather learn on her own.
4. Driving without a permit is illegal in our state, and the driving school requires the blue card because they take you out driving.
5. we bought her a used car from a friend of ours, she is just pissed she‚Äôs not getting the original car we promised.

Of course, college changed all that and I've been mostly doing whatever I want, with regards to personal hygiene. That involves taking a bath in the afternoon rather than right after brushing my teeth in the morning (that was the routine growing up).

I returned 3 days back and it has been mayhem in the house every morning. We keep on having arguments as to how I'm never listening to her and she refuses to let me have any food unless I take a bath: For breakfast the deadline is 10 am and for lunch it's 2:30 pm. I had been cooperating until yesterday when I lost it and said ""No. I don't care about these stupid rules anymore that you unnecessarily imposed on me for almost 2 decades"" and then she goes ""Well it's MY house and you're gonna do what I say!"".

I've been denied breakfast and lunch for two days now because I didn't take a bath until 3 in the afternoon and it's frankly getting on my nerves. I just order Chinese takeaway instead. This makes the issue worse and she goes into maudlin-mode sniffling, ""You'd have cheap-a** takeaway rather than just taking a bath"" 

Honestly, it does sound frivolous on paper, but it really raises the roof of the house every morning(figuratively).

So Reddit, AITA for not taking a bath early in the morning?",223,415,0.95
37,No A-holes here,"I(33F) have 17 year old son. I also have a boyfriend(36M). I started dating him about 10 months ago. He‚Äôs a great guy and we have wonderful relationship. 

I introduced my son and boyfriend to each other 5 months ago. My son had no problem whatsoever about me having a boyfriend. He said he was happy for me, my boyfriend was excited to meet my son as well.. but as soon as they met I could tell that they didn‚Äôt like each other? I don‚Äôt know how to describe it exactly but there was definitely some tension. My son didn‚Äôt speak at all, neither did my boyfriend. I was mainly the one having conversation with them. My son left early because ‚Äúhe had homework to do‚Äù(that was 100% an excuse). 

It‚Äôs been months since that and they‚Äôre still acting the same. When I try to make plans for us one if them comes up with an excuse. I talked to my son few times and asked him why he doesn‚Äôt like my boyfriend but he‚Äôs not answering me. I thought they both needed some time at first but I think 5 months is plenty of time. 

I invited my boyfriend to come over for dinner. My son was coming downstairs and as soon as he saw my boyfriend he went back to his room. I went to talk to him and just asked him to come spend time with us for me this one time. He got upset and yelled at me to leave him alone and that I couldn‚Äôt force him to do anything. 

My boyfriend told me to just leave him(my son) alone too.",38,35,0.82

I do not date exclusively fat women and it's not really important to me in a relationship. It's just simply my preferred body type. I've been with my girlfriend ""Amanda"" for about 6 months now. Amanda's weight has yo-yo'd since she was in high school. At her smallest she was roughly 180 pounds, heaviest roughly 280 and currently somewhere very close to the middle of that, with an upwards trend in the last couple of months due to us falling in love with a local pizzeria. So about 2 weeks ago she started a gym routine again. But she has trouble staying motivated so recruited a friend to help her. The friend is what I would describe as a ""health nut."" Well 2 days ago Amanda skipped the gym and was complaining to me about her lack of motivation. She specifically asked me ""Would you be mad at me if I stopped going again and got fat?"" I just answered honestly. I told her about my preference and that I would not be mad in the slightest, maybe even excited. But that ultimately it was her own decision to make and I would be happy as long she's happy, no matter what. I like her for her, not her body. I thought I handled it well. She was happy with that answer too and must have taken that as reason enough to stop going because she didn't go the day after or today. Today, her friend texted me and went off on me for ""filling Amanda's head with lies"" and told me I'm a terrible boyfriend for not wanting her to be as healthy as possible. Then sent me a link to the health risks of obesity. Now I'm wondering if I should have just lied and skipped telling her about my own preferences. So Reddit, AITA?",166,360,0.91

43,Not the A-hole,"Getting married in a few weeks. I'm not close at all with my sister, who always tries to be the center of attention. My parents suggested giving her a plus one so she's not a monster at the wedding (she said something to the affect of ""I bet NotMittRomney won't even give me a plus one"" which led to that conversation), despite her not dating anyone and having not talked to me basically ever except when we're all together on Christmas.

We \*all\* agreed to not give her a plus one unless she reached out to us and actually asked for one, which we didn't think would happen regardless because she wasn't even dating anyone!

More background: the last time we \*did\* see her was on Christmas, when all she did was complain about our new shelter puppy (who is the sweetest dog ever), saying it was poorly behaved and that the very specific dog that she's going to get from a breeder one day is going to be way better.  She also basically forced the entire family to do whatever she wanted us to do, which led my fiancee and I to cut our trip short by a couple of days and head back home. Even my parents were sick of her and said that they didn't blame us for leaving early.

We're having a very small wedding (and even smaller rehearsal dinner -- really just immediate family and wedding party) and told many of our friends that we weren't giving plus ones to people who weren't ~~engaged or married already~~ \[EDIT: I phrased this poorly, we were fine with people bringing a plus-one if they'd been together for a while/were serious -- and for 90% of those couples we know both people well enough to invite them individually regardless\].

Turns out we had a few extra spots so we told our parents we could invite more of our extended family than originally anticipated. My parents reached out to a few cousins to invite them and sent us updates. Then all of the sudden one of those updates was ""your sister might bring her boyfriend.""

We only found out she even had a boyfriend (again, she doesn't talk to us) from my parents a couple of weeks ago, and again she never talks to us so obviously she hasn't even told us she was dating anyone / wanted a plus one. AFAIK they've only been dating for a couple of months. She even told my parents that she's not planning to take him to ANY weddings, even one we're all going to next year.

So yeah, I guess my parents gave her a courtesy plus-one (that we didn't approve) and she ran with it, because my dad told us today that my sister's boyfriend booked his flight. She couldn't even text us to tell us herself! We never said that she could bring a plus one, and we don't know the guy at all!

Nobody in my family has met the guy yet. I know it sucks to pull the whole ""it's OUR day"" card, but knowing her, she's going to try pulling the focus to her and her new relationship, since nobody really knows anything about this guy. Now he's coming to the rehearsal dinner (which we're keeping VERY small) too.

I know we'd be TAs if we told our parents that he's not invited (especially since he bought a plane ticket) \[EDIT: thought this was clear but obviously we were never considering un-inviting him\], but AITA / am I overreacting to this whole situation?

One of the things that we don‚Äôt always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. 

I recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there‚Äôs going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. 

I asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He said he was on board. 

On the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated because I wouldn‚Äôt have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I had a feeling he‚Äôd enjoy it.

I said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak. I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited to prepare this for him.

45,Not the A-hole,"I strongly dislike my neighbors and that is making it hard for me to determine whether ITA here. From the time they moved in, they have parked in their driveway but over the sidewalk that crosses it, blocking use of the sidewalk (illegal here). My daughter uses a wheel chair for all of her outdoor mobility, so their car over the sidewalk causes her to have to travel in the street. I asked them several times to stop blocking the sidewalk and they wouldn‚Äôt, so I called and got them a warning from parking enforcement. This was several weeks ago. 

Yesterday the wife knocked on my door and when I answered she told me to stop parking in front of her house because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a safety hazard‚Äù.  I was confused and I told her my husband‚Äôs car was parked legally, and that there‚Äôs no where else to park his car. In front of my house is a fire hydrant and my accessible van needs my entire driveway to load/unload my daughter. She began to yell at me that I was being inconsiderate. She kept raising her voice and yelling ‚ÄúLook around the neighborhood! No one else parks in front of their neighbors!‚Äù I was trying to be polite at first and tell her I will park there less often when I can, but she couldn‚Äôt explain to me how it was a ‚Äúsafety hazard‚Äù and kept yelling that I was ‚Äúinconsiderate‚Äù. Then she threw in that I was inconsiderate because I called parking enforcement the day she brought her baby home from the hospital. I knew she‚Äôd been pregnant but not that they‚Äôd come home from the hospital that day. TBH I would have called anyway, since the car was there for several hours and not just to unload the baby. 

So it seems to me that her animosity toward me stems from me calling parking enforcement, and not my husband‚Äôs car parked legally on the street. I have no plans to park any differently and I‚Äôm honestly shocked that she felt it was appropriate to tell me to do so. Just FYI, his car is not an eyesore, it‚Äôs a newer, dark-colored sedan with no damage or anything. That said, I know some people feel quite territorial about the road in front of their house, even when parking is legal. So AITA if I keep parking there?

Edit: My husband has been parking there for all 4 years they have lived there. We have not done this to spite them. There is no legal parking on the other side of the street. Also, no permit is required to park anywhere that parking is allowed in my town.",114,328,0.94

47,Not the A-hole,"AITA?

So my mom and I (19F) had a fight recently over my sister, among other things. My sister is divorced and has a kid, and she lives with us now. She was in an abusive marriage for about 4 years. 

My parents have been trying to set my sister up with new guys and get her married or at least engaged again soon (kinda like matchmaking? It‚Äôs a desi people thing). 

Recently they found some guy, let‚Äôs call him Kevin, who they REALLY like and want my sister to get with. I met Kevin, as did my brother, and we both agree that Kevin is, to put it nicely, not my sister‚Äôs type. He‚Äôs an idiot, and there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd ever get along. This is all information I told my sister soon after meeting Kevin because she asked me what I thought of him.

So my mom calls me into the living room while my sister is at work one day to ask me why I didn‚Äôt like Kevin and what my problem with him was. I‚Äôll admit I was being short with her because this was about the seventh time we‚Äôd had this conversation, and I knew she was being passive aggressive with me about my role in ‚Äúruining‚Äù my sister‚Äôs potential marriage to Kevin. 

She then said that it was my fault that my sister isn‚Äôt interested in Kevin because I told her that Kevin was stupid and not her type (even though my sister has spoken to Kevin herself and she herself decided she‚Äôs not interested). She continued to say I ruined everything because in her opinion my sister is too stupid to have actually decided for herself she didn‚Äôt like Kevin. 

This started to piss me off, as I knew she was going down the track she always does where she starts blaming my sister for being abused by saying that she was dumb and should‚Äôve left her husband sooner.

I then told her that my sister is a grown woman (she‚Äôs 29) and I don‚Äôt control her decisions or her life, and that she should work on her relationship with her daughter herself, because they have a lot of their own issues.

At this point my mom lost her shit because I implied that she hates my sister (she has literally said in the past she‚Äôs pissed at my sister for ‚Äúletting herself be abused‚Äù), and she starts telling me how I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt get too excited‚Äù because she‚Äôs always preferred my sister over me. She said she‚Äôs always liked my sister better, and that my sister has a ‚Äúpurer heart‚Äù than me. 

She then went on to say that I was selfish, and she made some comments about my depression and how it bothers everyone in the family that I act depressed (I have depression and recently started taking meds for it). 

At this point I told her to fuck off, and I left the room.

I know in principle that it is not okay to curse at your mom.

I just need to know if it was actually okay for me to say fuck off, or if my mom is in the right and I am being selfish and awful and horribly, horribly disrespectful.

They would offer to pay for me and whenever I would say I‚Äôll pay them back, they always said don‚Äôt worry about it. I thought it was kinda weird  but I didn‚Äôt really think much of it.

A few months ago, my gf told me that I wasn't invited to her aunts wedding even though I've always had a good relationship with her aunt. Dont get me wrong we weren't close or anything but there were never issues between. I had even spent dozens of days at her apartment with her 4 sons and my gf all having a good time.

I'm always overly aware of my surroundings, especially when I am in the city. I've had enough dealings with dudes accosting me to be especially on edge when guys act sleazy in my immediate vicinity. Not trying to justify coming across like a bitch...I totally did. But I'm not really convinced that IATA here. 


This dude kept creeping up from the rear of the queue for the parking garage. He was kinda meandering and a bit drunk. He seemed like a ""good ol boy"" type and was trying to engage a younger woman when I first noticed him in my peripheral vision about 4-5 feet to the rear right of me.


He started to get closer to me, like shoulder to shoulder. He was just standing there and looking at a few of the women in line and then just jumped up between me & the lady in front of me, who kinda had her head down. I thought she was trying to just ignore him rather than tell him to fuck off. 
He put his hand on her lower back and leaned into her ear to say something and she moved away and didn't really engage. So I'm thinking that this dude is just trying to schmooze his way up the line. 


Then he moved onto the next woman in front of him. Put his hand on her back and she kinda glanced at him but didn't say anything to him. Then he started to fucking slap her ass and makes each cheek jiggle. She's looking back at him and doesn't seem especially thrilled. I assume it wasn't something that she was delighted about as her young son was watching this dude do all this.

Showed up to the induction/laboring doctor yesterday to get my induction scheduled.  Instead of setting up my induction, he lectured me on ""how you can get pregnant"".  He tried to say ""it was most likely a condom break"", I tried to explain what happened.

This continued for about 15 min, before I turned to my husband and told him we should just leave.  While lecturing, he threw down the ""you didn't get pregnant that way, because your IUD removal appointment is not in our system"". So, he was in/directly calling me a liar.

Finally, I'd had enough and got up to leave.  The doctor loudly said ""calm down"".  This made me angry.  I said I didn't see a point to remaining as we were getting nothing done.  He told me ""Your tone is inappropriate for this setting"".  I yelled something along the lines of what I posted above.

61,Not the A-hole,"I have lived in an apartment for 5 years. I absolutely love it; I have a great deal on rent, it's very close to my job, near my friends apartments, near loads of fun music and cultural events. 

I've always had good relationships with my neighbors, I'm understanding if they're loud sometimes, and they are understanding in return. 

My building is full of students and young professionals, Ive had neighbors share food, invite me to parties, put free stuff out in the hallways when they were getting rid of stuff. It's just a good vibe all around. I overlook stuff like underage drinking, weed which isn't legal in my state, etc. 

Just a few months ago, my roommate had to move out unexpectedly. We were looking for someone to take over the lease fast. 

At the same time, my sister was breaking up with her boyfriend who is also the father of her child. And she needed a place to live fast. I offered the room in my apartment to her and her daughter. It seemed like lucky timing.

But ever since they moved in, it's actually been my sister who's caused drama. She doesn't get how you need to be a little accommodating in an apartment. In just a few months, she's:

- Told some neighbors to shut down a party or she'd call the cops on them for underage drinking

- Told some neighbors off for smoking weed so it could be smelt in the stairwell, again saying she'd tell the cops

- Knocked on neighbors doors to quiet down at night after 8 pm

- Snapped at a neighbor to not swear in the hallway in front of her daughter

- Yelled at neighbors who shut the front door too loud 

- Told off neighbors who prop the front door open so friends can come in, because it decreases the building's security

- Complained to me about how people in the building have a rotating cast of guests, all strangers to her

- Told off a neighbor for playing music with cusses

Basically, she's been crazy controlling of stuff that I don't think is her business to control. And some of my neighbors have been annoyed, whenever her daughter makes noise running around, playing too loud, crying, etc... A couple of our neighbors come over and are like ""respect my quiet home"" or ""my roommate is sleeping"" or ""We are trying to study here"" ... Obviously mocking what my sister says to them by basically parroting it back at her.

I know everyone would be more chill and understanding if she had also been more chill and understanding at the start. Also, she's been crazy irritable about people disrupting her daughter's sleep, but I figure that with time, she'll learn to sleep through things. I did.

I kind of want to tell my sister that if she wants to live with me, she has got to put up with my neighbors and not threaten them with the cops, not go knock on their doors to tell them off, etc. Just put up with living near people.

They both always put me down because although I am with my daughter all day because she comes to work with me they say I only have one child so I don't understand their struggle. They do the same thing to Bri because she doesn't have children.


Right after getting engaged Emily let us know they would just be having a small wedding ceremony for immediate family and then a large reception afterwards. Then she decided she wanted a wedding party and asked Bri and Amanda to be her bridesmaids and be the only friends invited to the ceremony. A few months later she texted me and asked if I would be willing to do her makeup for the wedding as a gift since I used to be a makeup artist and did wedding makeup. I agreed, although I was kind of annoyed that I would have to drive 45 minutes each way to the wedding ceremony which is at their new barn/house and not be invited to the ceremony when the reception is 5 minutes from my house.  Then when we all met up to plan her wedding shower she let everyone there know that although friends aren't invited to the ceremony, I would be there but only because I am doing her makeup- no other reason. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way since I have been friends with her for so long. I felt I was being used.


About a month ago Emily texted me and asked if I would also do her bridesmaids and all her sisters' makeup. I let her know that because I no longer do wedding makeup I do not have all the supplies I would need to do everyone's. I let her know that since I would be there doing hers I would be happy to help anyone with lashes/eye shadow and anything else I could help with. She texted back ""awesome, thanks!"" and that was the last I heard of it.


A few weeks later I'm talking to Bri and she tells me that Emily told her that I bailed on doing her makeup and now she is frantically searching for someone else and that I am to longer invited to the ceremony because I am not doing her makeup. I decided to not even text Emily to clarify because at this point I don't even want to go to the ceremony.

After talking things over with Bri we've both decided that we are done making an effort to be friends with Emily after this wedding. There are many other issues that have led up to this, but between the way she has treated me and the way her and Amanda have acted towards Bri during wedding planning, this is the final straw.

I understand it's her wedding so she can invite who she wants, so AITA for being upset by all this?",52,298,0.92
63,Asshole,"Title can be misleading, so let me make this clear from the start: **I did not steal anyone.**

I'm in a discord/reddit group where people can trade/sell accounts for this game I'm fond of. It's really convenient because the game has hundreds of unique characters; some of which are limited edition and therefore really hard to obtain. Trading/selling provides an easy way to obtain characters that may no longer be acessible. Keep in mind that this is a gacha game (basically a virtual casino), which means summoning these characters in the first place is no easy task since it requires either a lot of money or luck.

A few weeks ago, I received a trade offer on one of my game accounts. I was more interested in selling, but I concluded that doing the trade would be profitable for me since their account was higher in value. I accepted and we traded.

The drama starts when I put the account up for sale. Someone approaches me and claims the account belongs to them and that it had been stolen from them by the person I traded with. They demanded the account back and I was at a loss about what to do, since selling/trading stolen accounts was against the group's rules and I was concerned about being banned/blacklisted.

I called one of the group's moderators to help us. The account's owner was able to prove that it originally belonged to them and that it was stolen. I proved that I had no knowledge that the account was stolen and that I acquired it without breaking any rules. The moderator declared that I had no obligation to return the account, but we were free to reach some sort of agreement. The owner made some offers that didn't really interest me, but I was reasonable enough to remove the account from my ads until we solved the mess. I felt bad for them and wanted to do the right thing, so I told them I wouldn't mind returning their account **for free** in one month, once I had enough money to buy an account for myself.

They accepted, but the very next day they started begging for the account ahead of time. They were excessively dramatic in saying how much they cared about their account and wanted it back. I insisted that they'd have to either wait or offer something of equal value. This went on for days. I tried being polite and understanding this whole time since they WERE scammed, but they kept begging and being obnoxious. I ran out of patience one day and decided not to return it anymore. They lost their mind, called me names and threatened to spread the word that I was a scammer and a liar. I responded with equal animosity and cut all contact with them.

I hate entitled people, but I honestly don't know how I would act if I were in their shoes. It must be terrible to see it within your reach and not be able to do anything. AITA for not returning it?

EDIT: Some additional info:

\-The group has a free middleman service, where a third person joins the trade to make sure what is being offered is what is being delivered. It is a safe way to guarantee that nothing will go wrong and that there will be no scams. The person who had their account stolen willingly dismissed this service since they were in a hurry to trade and the service relies on the middlemen's availability. They literally handed their account to a complete stranger with no trading references or reputation in the group.

\-The actual scammer was banned from the group and blacklisted.

\-The reason why I wanted to hold onto the account for a month was because I felt it was unfair for me to take the fall for someone else's mistake. If I were to simply return it without expecting anything in return, I would be the one suffering a financial loss for something that wasn't really my fault. I only offered to return the account for free in a month because I intend to buy an account for myself soon, and with it, I would have no more use for their account.

\-Not sure if it was really a kid.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the comments and for the insight, everyone. You guys are right. A man is only as good as his word. I returned the account.",89,51,0.88

Some backstory: I injured my leg about a week ago. It is so bad i have to walk on crutches. My mum who usually cooks is not home tonight. I am pretty decent at cooking so I normally take over if she is not there. Now however i cant.

Now onto the story.
About an hour ago we started getting hungry and wanted to eat dinner. I asked my sister if she would cook since my dad is a terrible cook and he just came home from work. (This is not ment to be rude he knows he is a terrible cook and doesnt really care). At first she was okay with cooking. 

When she asked what was for dinner I told her what we had. Part of the dish had meat in it. (My sister is a vegetarian). She instantly said that she wouldnt cook food if she also had to cook meat. I told her she was being rediculous since she would have any so it shouldnt be a problem. 

My sister got really upset and went to her room. 

My dad is cooking now and i think my sister was being petty AITA?

Edit: A point i see people making is that the cook decides the meal. This would normally be a valid point. In this case however our fridge had one meal in it for today. That is a meal that has meat.",27,47,0.83

The rest of the family immediately agrees that it‚Äôs only fair as I have the lightest pack, and this just stirs me up as I haven‚Äôt brought extra weight of luxuries like the rest of them and flat out refuse saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt bring any extra luxuries like the rest of you, just the bare bone stuff‚Äù

70,Not the A-hole,"

I grew up in a town I didn't much like. It was suburban bordering on rural;  there's not much to do there.  The schools sucked; I was way less prepared in college than most of my peers. There was a big drug problem and a big drunk driving problem.

So when I was at a dinner with my friend Jen and her parents, and her parents asked how I liked (town) because they were thinking of buying a house there, I told them ""it's a weird place"" 

Her mom asked why, and I was like ""All you're gonna find is cows, crack, and a cult"" and Jen was like ""What, a cult?"" 

I said I'd tell them the story because it was pretty wild. A group had moved into a house, and rumors went around town saying they were pretty ... Weird. They were into historical reenacting, which wasn't too weird as a hobby, but they seemed very very into it.

My friends and I got a hold of one of their recruiting pamphlets, they had a name in old English, and they seemed to be some sort of organization. With initiation rites, talk of ritual magic, a number of laws about bringing back the old ways (more strict gender roles, lots of talk about honor and chivalry, and a kind of unsettling bit about ""freely given love""). The leader calling himself ""Sir"" and ""Knight"" though we figure nobody ever knighted him.

So what do my dumbass best friend and I decide to do? Go try and join for shits and giggles, because there was fuck-all else to do. We swore to each other we'd not get drawn into the cult, we'd just go there and bullshit our way in, and try not to laugh. Like we were anthropologists exploring a secret civilization. See how far we could get.

We were just about to go, when my mom found out about our plan and forbade is from going. She said the ""Knight"" was a convicted sex ofender, she'd met him once in a Dollar General and she said he also had a hell of a hot temper. And there was no way we were stepping foot in that house.

After I told that story, Jen and her family were like ""Are you serious"" and I said that I was 100% serious. And that story was so characteristic of my old town.

I guess after that night, Jen's parents went to talk to my parents about whether what I said about the town was for real. And my parents were very embarrassed to be asked, since despite everything, they love the town. 

My parents were mad at me for having told the story of the cult, and talked poorly of the town in general.

We decided to give my in-laws a key to our place so that they can leave without having to disturb anyone.  This is because sometimes my wife will be feeding, resting, or caring for the baby which would not allow her to close the door and lock up. We have an alarm system that will chime when the door opens and closes. We distinctly asked them to not used the key to come into the house and that they should ring the door bell and wait for answer.

&#x200B;

They've skipped the whole door bell ringing part, and just enter the house using the key. They say they don't want to ring the door bell to disturb anyone. I'm not comfortable with people entering and leaving my house with the key in general without people knowing that they are coming and going.

&#x200B;

Despite my explaining that they should wait outside for someone to answer the door, due to the alarm potentially being armed, they don't seem to be listening. Would I be an asshole if I left my alarm system armed so that I can teach them a lesson?

Bride is getting married sometime in 2020, not sure of the exact date. We're in the US. If her wedding was local I absolutely would be attending, however, she and Groom have opted for a destination wedding. She's told me the destination and I looked into it briefly. It isn't in a place I have any interest in visiting nor something I can afford without some serious scrimping. Rooms per night at the hotel she selected cost more than I have spent on whole vacations. The PTO policy at my job isn't very generous and I'd be losing two days just on traveling alone. That would really interfere with my ability to take the vacations I have been planning to destinations I would actually like to visit, which might automatically make me TA but it is what it is. 

I've been venting to my SO about it because I do feel some type of way that Bride opted for a destination wedding since I learned the news. Bride asked me for my address in order to mail me an invitation so I gave it to her without hesitation. I told SO that we should be receiving the invite soon with all the details and he asked why I allowed her to mail one to me. He said it's rude of me to get her hopes up that I will attend and wedding invitations are not cheap.

But she also said that we would be keeping this puppy for up to a month.

I (25M) have a congenital immune system problem, due to which I needed to skip a few vaccines that use the live virus/bacteria, most notably the MMR vaccine.

I have a group of friends that's really into board games (five people including me). We try to meet up every weekend (although this is not always possible) for about 3-4 hours to play and catch up with each other.

About 10 months ago, one of our group (26F) told us she was pregnant. We were really happy for her and her husband, we hadn't known that they were trying but we were all excited once we found out. After the session that day, I took her aside and reminded her about my vaccination status and apologized because I wouldn't be able to meet her child or help babysit or anything for atleast a year until they had got their MMR vaccine. It sucks and I knew that I was going to miss out on a lot, but what other option do I have?

She missed a fair few of our meets during her pregnancy, and then the five consecutive meets right after she gave birth (to a perfectly healthy baby boy!) because they were obviously getting settled with the new kiddo at home.

Four weeks ago, she asked us if we could meet at her house that week because her husband has Sundays off and could look after the baby, but she didn't feel comfortable leaving home for an extended period of time. Obviously, I couldn't join in but I had no issues because I know being a new parent is fucking exhausting, and she deserved a break especially given all the meets she had missed in the process. I wished them a great time and assured them that there was no reason to feel guilty about leaving me out.

However, this has become their new routine. The last four meets have been at her house and I have had to skip every single one of them. We all have hectic work schedules so meeting midweek isn't an option, and I miss my friends. I messaged her asking if it was possible for us to meet elsewhere, but none of us live close enough to her place to for her to feel comfortable about this option (upto 30 mins away depending on traffic).

I  messaged another friend asking if we could alternate meets between me and her, but he pretty much told me that since she's missed so many meets during her pregnancy they don't feel it's fair to ask her to skip anymore. It looks like I'm stuck being left out of everything for the next couple of months atleast. I see their point of view too, but I still feel unfairly left out here.

WIBTA if I insist on alternating weeks until the kiddo is vaccinated/she feels comfortable leaving him at home with her husband?

Update: One commenter suggested Skyping and I thought this was a workable idea, so we're implementing it! We're going to alternate meets at my house and hers, and whichever one of the two of us is absent will play over Skype. We figured this way we're splitting the Internet usage costs and actual face-to-face time with our friends evenly.

But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.

I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.

86,Not the A-hole,"I broke up with my boyfriend 3 days ago.

Everytime I try to leave him or I do something bad he always gets sick. Like his heart problems always start acting up, he becomes s depressed, he somehow manages to burn himself badly when cooking etc. Once I am back or have given him attention for an hour he is always 100% better

I usually offer to call him an ambulence/ his best friend/ his mother that he lives with to help which he adamantly refuses and gets angry about it. I am in a different country to him so there is nothing I can do.

Last night he messaged me completely drunk that he was vomiting blood and he has had stomach ulcers for his whole life. I instantly didnt believe him, told him so and blocked him.

Turns out this time it was true. He is currently in hospital and our mutual friends are pissed at me for blocking him. I genuinely thought he was lying.

88,Asshole,"I've known Jess for about 8 years now. We talk often and are pretty good friends, but go through stretches where we don't talk much. We don't have very much in common, but that's never bothered me. When I got married, she and her boyfriend came. I didn't do the bridesmaid thing (I think it's stupid), but it was understood she would have been on the roster if I'd done all that. 

It's her turn to get married, and I'm very excited for her. I knew the engagement was likely to happen, it was just a matter of time. They immediately started planning the wedding, and she would talk to me a lot about it. Early on, they decided to have a destination wedding to another country.

I was disappointed, as this meant I would not be able to go, but I let her talk all about her wedding and never said a thing. Well it's getting closer and I had to finally tell her that I am so happy for her to have the wedding of her dreams, and I'll hope to see pictures later, but I simply cannot afford to attend. 

This didn't go over well. The wedding is technically mostly a year away, why couldn't I come, it's not that expensive, it's important for me to be there. That really stood out to me. It's important for me to be there.

I told her ""Again, I'm sorry I can't come. I'd have loved to be there for you. But if certain people being there was really that important, you wouldn't have chosen a destination wedding. I can't afford to travel like you can. By choosing the destination wedding, you are letting your guests know that they are \*not\* important to you and that their attendance is \*not\* a priority. And it's your wedding. You should do what makes you happy. But understand that destination weddings are a good way of cutting our your friends and family from being there for you.""

She got really upset about this. I understand why, it's harsh! Some of our mutual friends have been taking sides in the whole thing, telling me i was out of line, I'm an asshole because it's her special day and we should do anything we can to be there, etc. But I really cannot afford it.

91,Asshole,"The title basically covers the entire situation, but for additional context I was recently shopping and had some electronics and clothing items in one huge shopping bag. I had to stop by work, so I did that, and while I was there a coworker offered to give me and another coworker a ride home since we were both on the way and she had her daughter with her. I'm friends with the coworker who offered, and loosely know the other lady.

Well her daughter was either already sick, or got car sick, but either way, about midway through the trip she looked sick (she was sitting in the middle), leaned over my bag, and just horked.

I was sympathetic while it was happening, but after I asked her mom to exchange information with me so we could talk about payment. At first she seemed receptive, but when I told her how much I'd be expecting (in the thousands) She acted like I spit in her cheerios, and said she had no money for that, it was an accident, and that she really couldn't help me. I told her that it didn't matter, her kid damaged my property, and it's not like I could take all the stuff back now that it had been puked on. She didn't get angry, exactly, but got more and more agitated saying that she truly couldn't afford to pay thousands of dollars for my stuff, and that the best she could do was pay for the dry cleaning.

This didn't fly with me, because it was brand new stuff, literally, and I didn't think dry cleaning was going to get out the unholy combination of purple grape drink and whatever else the kid was eating. Also these were items that would costs hundreds of dollars even to dry clean.

So I told her to either work with me on a payment plan for my stuff, or I'd be taking her to small claims court. Suffice to say, things in the office are now weird.

So AITA? I know it was an accident but my stuff still got ruined and I still want to replace everything. The coworker who was driving thinks I'm being a bit harsh, and probably so do my other coworkers, and maybe I am, but at the end of the day, it's not anyone's fault that the kid was sick, and them's the breaks.",248,220,0.83

97,Not the A-hole,"I am the youngest of 3 children. I'm 27f and I'm engaged, planning on getting married next summer and then trying for a baby. We don't want to start trying for kids until we have at least a bit of money in the bank because babies are expensive.

My brother is 36. He is married with 3 kids. I'm not sure exactly how much he and his wife earn, but they own a house big enough for everyone to have their own room plus a car each, so estimating a lot. The kids are all under 10. They have some remaining debt from when they both went to college, and my brother is also trying to start his own business, but from what they've said this is all financially manageable for them.

My sister is 31 (the middle child) and a single mother. When she was 16 she got pregnant. She wanted to put the baby up for adoption but our father, who was very conservative, told her that if she did anything but raise her child he would cut her off, from both the family and the will. My sister had always planned on being a mother, but never thought it would be so soon. She finished high school and worked part time jobs until she could afford to move out. When her son was around 8 she went back to school and earned a teaching qualification, and is currently in her third year of teaching full time. Her son is now 14, nearly 15.

Both our parents passed within the last 5 years.

In the will dad left me the deed to the house, in the hopes I'd make it my family home. I was the sole owner. The house was in poor condition and a poor location, so, with my siblings permission, I put some of my own money into the house, fixed it up, and sold it for just under 230k. My siblings did not put money towards the house, only gave me permission to sell, which I felt I should ask for as we all grew up there, and we all had belongings still in the house that we were able to split appropriately.

My dad left my brother about 50k to start his business.

Dad left my sister 1k and a letter saying she should have made better life choices.

When I found out what he'd done I immediately said to my sister that I'd split the amount I'd earned from the house between us. She tried to refuse but I insisted. My initial plan was to split it clean down the middle between me and my sister. My reasoning was that my brother has his own money and is, by his own admission, doing well financially, and dad gave him 50k. My sister and me are both still deep in debt from paying for college and soon her son will be going to college while I'm planning on a wedding and a baby pretty soon.

When our brother found out he was really upset, and said that it wasn't fair that I got the house, and made money off it, and he felt it was more unfair that I shared with our sister but not with him. I think both my brother and father are being dicks for no reason.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Info: my brother was dad's favourite, and dad left him money because he believed my brother's business idea would succeed and felt he didn't need any more help, as my brother had previously asked him for 10k for the business. My dad didn't approve of my sister being a teacher as he subscribes to the ""those who can't do teach"" mentality and it's a humanities subject which he doesn't hold at the same level as STEM subjects. He was the one who pushed my sister to keep her son, and while she doesn't regret it in the slightest, she would not have done it if not for dad, who then spent the rest of his life throwing in her face that she was a mother at 16. I am in finance, which dad fully supported, and he approved of my fiance and the plan to wait to try for kids, so he left me the house genuinely hoping I'd want to start a family there.

Also when I first decided to do up and sell off the house, when I asked permission I also asked if they wanted to go in on it with me. My brother didn't want to (he said it would be a ""hassle"") and my sister couldn't afford it. I also asked if my brother wanted to buy the house for his family, for a lot less than I eventually sold it for, but he said his family were happy where they were.

I've said to my brother that I'd be willing to do 100k each for me and my sister and give him the remainder (somewhere between 25 and 30k, IDK the exact number) because he says he has ""plans"" for the 50k dad gave him and wasn't willing to share that.",691,2430,0.96

99,Asshole,"So I already have the understanding that I probably am TA, but I wanted to hear unbiased opinions on this regardless.

So me and my bf have been together for almost 2 years and going strong. We don't keep secrets from each others and can talk with friends and sit on or phones while cuddling and the other one can openly see what the other one is doing because there is never anything important. Just Instagram, reading on reddit or browsing the news.

Yesterday he got a message from a friend and just put the phone away while we were watching a movie, and I said ""you can answer him, I'll just pause the movie"" thinking that he was being polite not making me wait while he took the time to reply. He said that he would wit replying because they were talking about a few things his friend were going through and I asked what things? He said he wasn't comfortable sharing things other people had trusted him to confide in him with and I got a little weirded out.

You see, I always share if he asks, if he reads something off on my phone and he one time also said that I could share things like this with him. He is my boyfriend after all and that's different than gossiping with a friend, and I agree.

I told him this but he just said no, and I just told him that I thought it was weird. I don't even know him or anything, but that I thought it was weird that he wouldn't share things like this with his girlfriend. It is after all like writing in a diary. I would understand if it was a friend or someone else, but with me?

We never fought, but it still ended with me just laying it to rest knowing he wouldn't budge and knowing this could ruing an otherwise perfect night.

I also told him I just found it strange because I have never been in a relationship where this was a thing, because in the past I've always told and been told these things. He also told me not to make it about me, because this is totally unrelated and if it were about me, he would of course tell me, but I don't have a right to knowing everything. Although I agree, I fing it kind of double moralistic and just strange that he doesn't wanna share things with me, because I am his girlfriend and like I said, it's different than spreading gossip amongst friends. 

So reddit, am I the entitled asshole, or is this weird?

EDIT: OK, so I've heard the verdict and understand that I am TA which is totally reasonable. However, I feel the need to clarify a few things.
First of all, NO, I have never spilled the beans on a friends confidential matter. The only time I've come close is that time I got a lot of messages from a friend and my boyfriend asked what's up and I told him it's just a friend struggling with some mental issues and I'm trying to talk him down. That's how far as I've come to tell about such matters. The only reason I reacted in the first place is because he has opened and replied to messages in the past, never being worried about me purposely or not seeing the content. And no, I do not hover trying to read every letter. I jus found it weird that he couldn't even tell me what's the circumstantial matter on the case. I do however realise now that I don't even need to know that, and that there is a difference between privacy and secrets.

Second of all, I want to say that I never pestered or bothered him. It was a five minute ordeal and it was solved without yelling, bickering or fighting. I said OK, we kissed and we continued to watch the movie, going to bed happy. There was never any toxic behaviour as some of you so nicely told me that I had.

And last of all. I appreciate everyone who took the time to tell me in a polite and respectful way that I was wrong and showing me how one should react. Some of you need to mind your language and understand that not everyone has the same views and/or grew up with the same set of rules. This has always been expected of me and I also grew up with it. Therefore I found it very strange when he couldn't even tell me the circumstances.

I want to end this on a positive note, saying that I've learned something and grew up a little today. There hasn't been any more issues about this and neither of us even mentioned it after it came up. Our relationship is not toxic, I haven't ran and told my boyfriend or exes about my friends problems, I am not a shitty friend. Please do not read more into this than what it actually was. I simply just did not know that this was not the norm. Now i know, and I will stick to it.

Thank you all.",192,550,0.87

I'm in an advanced stage for going on an exchange to a top tier university in the United States (I'm from Europe). But I didn't tell my girlfriend about it, and I feel bad. But I understand why I did it, but I want to know If I'm being an asshole.

Me and my girlfriend are together for 1,5 years now and we know each other for 2 years. We've had a lot of ups and downs, but things are going pretty awesome until now.

My girlfriend went on an exchange for 5 months when we were in a 6 months relationship. And things went bad. She couldn't take it that she was so far away from home and missed me too much. She controlled my life for the 5 months she was there. I flew over every 2/3 weeks, and that broke me down.

So when she was back, she told me that she never wanted to do something like that again and that she never wanted to be so far away from me for that long. I understand because it was one of the worst experiences for me too. Not because she was so far away for so long, but due to the simple fact, that I didn't have a life for 5 months because of it.

Fast forward 8 months later: I had a conversation with one of my study advisors and she told me that because of my GPA and my background (I'm from a poor family), I was eligible for a scholarship and funding to go on an exchange to the University I mentioned above. I was so freaking happy because it was always a dream of mine to go on an exchange to the United States, but I never thought it would be possible because I had no money.

So I'm going to my girlfriends' place and told her that I""m eligible for an exchange to the US and that I was so happy that a dream of mine is going to be reality. She totally freaked out, she cried and literally had some type of panic attack. She told me that if I'm going to the United States, our relationship is over. And that I am a selfish jerk who thinks just about his own happiness, and that I am ruining the relationship because of that. She begged me not to go, and I told her that I won't.

A week later, a friend of mine told me that there was a meeting for the exchange and told me that I had go. I went to the meeting, and my reaction was that I have to do it. If I won't, I will regret it for the rest of my life.

So I wrote a letter, made an appointment with the advisor, and he told me that the funding shouldn't be an issue. I had an appointment two days ago and the advisor told me, that I won't have to worry and that my application will go through.

But I want to know if I'm the Asshole in this situation? She is telling me that I'm selfish and going to ruin the relationship and that it is my fault. I don't think that I am, because I don't think that any SO, should stand in the way of the partner's dream or personal growth.

When we do lab work, there is someone called a technical assistant, who manages the materials and helps out when necessary. 

So my students had to take a sample from their cheek to look at through a microscope. Because I‚Äôm not that familiar with biology, I didn‚Äôt really know what to look for. After helping a few kids find a cell, it turned out I had it wrong. What I thought were cells, were just air bubbles. The assistant caught on to this, and explained what the cells were. 

When I heard I stopped the entire class, explained I made a mistake and told them what to look for. 

After this I was standing at my desk, with about eight students surrounding me to ask questions. This is when the assistant started to tell me I should have looked through the microscope before the lesson, so I would know what to look for.

109,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I'm 16 years old and in school. My brother is 13.

Before today, we used to be allowed to use the internet for homework, study, or quiet reading, but not for YouTube or video games on weekdays (we're only allowed to use them on weekends). A few months prior, this used to be more relaxed, we were allowed on our phones and to use the TV's YouTube up until a certain time. We are told to go to bed at 9pm or 8:30 every night. Both my brother and myself are achieving a reasonable grade in school, we don't go out and cause trouble, and we generally do our chores (sometimes we forget/lose focus, however). The most we have ever gotten in trouble for is staying up too late or by being angry/upset over internet curfews (a thing that's been going on and off for the past two years).

Our dad is setting up the internet so that its going to shut off at 6pm every night, but only for us (dad and mom can use the internet at any time for whatever they want, whether that be finances or work, or for video games). He said he may allow some lenience if there is work that is due the very next day (which is unlikely unless I deliberately slack off at school). I do use the internet to talk over discord with my friends and my girlfriend (which my parents don't know because they are staunchly against our regular use of discord \[""they're not real friends!!""\]). I'm primarily upset because this leaves me very little time to talk to my girlfriend, and secondly upset because I do not feel that I have done anything outstandingly bad to deserve these curfews.

The 6pm curfew was triggered again because my brother was using discord to group voice chat between four of his school friends. My brother was under the impression that calling his friends is okay, but my dad thinks that using discord to phone someone is completely different to using a mobile SIM to phone his friends.

About 6 months later we go back to school shopping and after about 2 hours in the store we go to checkout and he finds he forgot his wallet.

So, I was invited to this party of a friend of mine, it was a casual party in their living room and backyard with not many people. After a few minutes of me being there my friend (the host of the party) pulls me aside and says:

""Hey, I know this sounds mean, but can you like... change? Most people here are wearing sweatpants and some girls told me you were making them uncomfortable because they all look so casual and you look so..."" ... ""you know""

I'll said that I would gladly change, but that I dont even own anything that isn't vintage, and that even my most ""casual"" stuff has that.. look to it (I dont know how to describe it)

My boyfriend said we can drive home and i can put some of his stuff, and that it's not big deal, I agreed.

In the car he told me that he feels uncomfortable too sometimes because I'm always overdressed and when he is with me he feels bad sometimes because he isnt dressed ""that way"", but then also said that he didnt want to dress ""that way"" (i dont know what he meant by that)

This is where i might be TA, even tho i said that we will go home and I'll change and then come back to the party, after sitting in a silent car for a while i thought about everything, how I dress and how it makes people feel and then decided to not go back to the party and just stay home.

AITA for not going back after I said I will?
Are they TA for not accepting how I dress?
AITA for being overdressed?

I dont understand the situation tbh

Edit: After reading all of your replies and talking with my boyfriend I'm just generally thinking about how it affects people and what I'm going to do about that, I'm starting to see how it could make people really really uncomfortable, and reconsidering dressing vintage, thank you for commenting, some were really eye opening",749,1866,0.95

117,Asshole,"Years ago I was working in an office, and the two women sitting in front of me were pregnant. These were the first three desks next to the entrance. The first and me were in the same department, as were the other twenty or so people around us. The pregnant coworker in front of me wasn't, but refused to change when they moved her department to our back. Lets call her PC for Pregnant Coworker.

One morning I receive a message from PC asking if I'm wearing cologne. This was the first time I ever interacted with her because she didn't even replied to my ""good morning"" and I was puzzled by her typing instead of talking. It went like this:

Me: Em...Yes. Why?

PC: I don't like the smell. 

Me: Oh, I'm sorry.

PC: Can you stop using it? You can use it on the weekends.

Me: Mm, I have another cologne, maybe I can use that one.

PC: I don't like that one either.  

Me: Sorry, I'm not going to stop using cologne. 

PC: Then you can change desks with someone. 
 
I asked everyone in the department and no one accepted. She also refused to move to her department with my help moving her things. 

I didn't stop using cologne.

I understand she was pregnant and sensitive to smells, and even with her attitude I tried to help, but I worked on sales, and in a subtropical climate, cologne was basic. Not to most of my coworkers, though. 

To be honest if the other pregnant woman had asked me, I would have stopped, or at least carried it with me so when clients came I could use it, but this woman was rude and ate smelly breakfasts at her desk.

118,Not the A-hole,"I (**M21**) have been wanting to get a *certified pre-owned* car since I started commuting to college a year and a half ago. I've been driving my grandma's '07 sedan (no major mechanical issues, 89k on odometer) for 5 years from junior year of high school to senior year of college. I want something new to fit my changing lifestyle, however I don't think that's possible since I'll be paying loans for my undergrad degree in a year or so.

In contrast, my sister (**F25**) got a *brand new* car, a '14 Sedan after commuting to college for two years. Along with that my parents paid for her whole undergrad degree. Today came and turns out my sister totaled her car in an accident. She's fine, but her car is totaled completely. So I had the idea that my sister takes my car, and I get a new one.

I asked my parents, ""may \[sister\] take my car, and I get a new one. After all i've been commuting for two years to college and insurance on a new car is high""? My mom replied, ""no u/robsteoperosis, stop being so ungrateful! It's not going to happen when your sister needs one right now""!

UPDATE: After a lengthy discussion me and my mom came to terms on me purchasing a new car. It's nothing crazy but we set a goal that I have to meet to get my car. Thanks y'all.",25,49,0.95

122,Asshole,"I'm standing outside of a store waiting for it to open with about 5 other customers.  While waiting by the door, I notice another person waiting in her 20's wearing a shirt that says ""coup d'√©tat"" written on it.  I'm aware of what the phrase means, but my brain went into High School French mode to see if I could come up with a literal translation for the individual words.  √©tat is obvious, but I thought I remembered ""coup"" meaning ""to blow"" so I'm like ""blow the state?  that cant be right.""  Then I ruminated over what else ""blow"" could mean in the context.  I decided on imagining if the state were a lit candle, and someone were to blow it out.  That would be an acceptable analogy for overthrowing a government.  Happy with my conclusion, I gave a quick nod of approval to myself like, ""got it.  makes sense"" and looked back down at my phone.  This entire process happened in my brain, so from the moment I looked up at her shirt to the moment I looked down back at my phone, including the head nod, took less than 3 seconds.  

&#x200B;

The girl snapped at me and said, ""OH SO YOU APPROVE?!""  I'm a little confused by the statement and the hostility.  Given the current political climate in the US I'm thinking she's asking of my political stance.  Well, I approve of the impeachment inquiry but shit would really have to hit the fan before I approve of a fucking coup, but either way, I'm not having that conversation with a stranger on the sidewalk on a Thursday morning before work.  So I just shrug my shoulders to brush off the question.  

&#x200B;

She responds, ""Great.  How about you stop staring at my tits you fuckin perv?""  Again, I'm a bit taken aback cause I don't immediately realize what she's talking about.  Then it clicks.  She thought I was staring at her tits during the 3 seconds it took me to read and translate the text on her shirt (which wasn't even across her tits, more like her stomach).  

&#x200B;

I try to clear up the confusion.  I say, ""I'm sorry, I wasn't doing that.  I was just reading your shirt and trying to translate it.""  She says, ""OOOK.  Yeah, whatever.""  Very sarcastically.  Now I'm pissed.  I can see the misunderstanding, but my reasonable explanation should have cleared that up.  I don't appreciate being cussed out and insulted.  So I said, ""Don't nobody wanna stare at those wack-ass tits.""  

&#x200B;

A couple of people laughed, but an older woman told me that was completely disgusting and uncalled for.  I should never insult a womans body because of insecurities caused by society, etc.  I thought my response was proportional to her insults.  I think unfairly being called a ""fucking perv"" is worse that being told one has ""wack titties"" but now I'm not sure.  The woman said that since the girl does have a small chest, I made fun of a real possible insecurity.  If I wasn't actually staring at her chest, then I'm not a pervert and it shouldn't bother me.",44,35,0.7
123,Not the A-hole,"So as alittle back story here my dad wasn't in my life since I was about 4 years old until I was 17. Didn't pay child support. Didn't send birthday cards or acknowledge my existence in any way. I am now 21. 

My boyfriend and I just got engaged we've been together 3 years and plan on a very long engagement. No rush at all probably won't be for another 5-7 years until we feel the need to tie the knot. But my step mom made a comment on how she's so excited to see my dad walk his daughter down the aisle.. I said I will be walking myself  or if my elderly great grandfather is still with us I'll ask him and chaos ensues. Apparently I'm robbing him of more fatherly memories. But I mean he has literally another family he's gotten himself while me and my siblings where ignored why doesn't he walk his other daughter down the aisle it's not like I'm an only child there are four of us and three of us are girls. He's known me for three-four years.. I raised myself and my younger sibling while he was off doing his own thing. Which is fine! I'm not even mad about it. It just rubs me the wrong way. I just don't feel like you can take no part in raising someone and then get mad when they don't want you to ""give them away""? 

I've been getting alot of messages from family along the lines of how dare you. Why can't you give them this small thing. It doesn't even really affect you so don't make a big deal over it. I just don't know why everyone's attacking me about something that won't even be for years to come!

125,Not the A-hole,"Yes, your first thought it ""you are TA"". But hear me out first.

I am currently a senior in high school, this period of time is when everyone's figuring out their life paths and which college they want to go or whatnot. 
So back then in junior year, my dad and I had a college talk. We both agreed that as long as the college I apply to is anywhere in the state of new york, he would fully support me and pay for my full tuition (tuition is cheaper in-state which is why I thought it was reasonable). 
However, he all of the sudden changed his mind after visiting one of the college tours just about 2 hours away. He claimed it was way too far and refused to pay for my tuition unless I attend a college within 1 hour drive radius. 

I got extremely angry because 
1) He broke his side of agreement made in junior year, waited until now when I already had a full list of where to apply to which all of them are above 1 hour drive.
2) I thought his reason for a change of mind was unreasonable.

For those that will suggest that I should pay for my own tuition, I am on the path to that with applying for tons of scholarship to help lighten the hefty pricetag but even then, the costs of tuition will put a financial stress on me throughout the semester and I want to prevent that so I can focus on my studies.

So Reddit, AITA?

Edit 1: The colleges I selected were solid, gave me tons of benefits and opportunities but none within the 1 hour radius were that great. Mostly community colleges (nothing against them).

Also I am well aware that I was put in a priviledged position, always grateful to my dad for the offer althought I built my path based on that agreement

Edit 2: Of course I've asked him countless times about what was the reason for his sudden change in decision in a calmly collective manner. I tried to pinpoint every reason from him wanting me to commute to financial stability (we're very stable so that wasn't it, I would be definitely understanding if otherwise). Can't get an answer, that bothers me the most. I wish he could give me a reason so I could use that to compromise with him. So yeah, that's my rant I guess.",48,85,0.95

My building has multiple machines on every floor, they could have used an empty drier. Was the sheet even washed/clean before being added to my clothes (the washer wasn't running)?
When I told my husband, he insisted I rewash everything. Then he said ""throw that s**t out"". I paused, for a moment, then ran back to the laundry room and threw it down the garage shoot.  I live in an rather expensive building so I don't feel like I threw a poor person's belongings away (who can't afford $1.50). Financial strain would actually be understandable.

The first time he walked me down the hallway after school and asked me the basic things like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat grade are you?‚Äù etc etc. Most days I have stuff after school and I have to rush, so I answer quickly and awkwardly part ways.

129,Not the A-hole,"I'm (21F) on my last year of college and currently living in student housing. For some loophole in the system I managed to match with a 55 year old roommate. Things are mostly fine at the beginning, until she started binge drinking my alcohol. My aunt bought me a 12 pack of White Claws that she drank all over night. She also drank a bottle of wine my best friend had bought for me as a move-in present. I let her replace them even though she never asked if she could drink them and she did promptly. Only to drink them all again the next day. This went on three different times, where if I saw the claws in the fridge I wouldn't even touch them because I knew I'd never see them again. 

I ended up getting my own fridge in my room because trying to reason with a woman with the self control of a 10 year old was exhausting. 

She then ended up putting notes all over the apartment over things she'd like us to do (It's a 4x2 split, I share a bathroom with a different girl, she shares a bathroom with someone else). Which I ended up taking down because I got tired of feeling like my apartment was mad at me. We got into a thermostat altercation, where she left a note saying (""Before you turn it down, remember that it's making me sick and making me miss work"") The A/C was making her sick, not her chain-smoking, apparently. 

One morning she asked me for a ride to work, which I happily give because I try to be polite. I then learned that she had a breathalyzer in her car and that she couldn't drive it when she was taking cough syrup medicine that contained alcohol in it. 

That was when realized she's not even supposed to be drinking at all! She's likely on a DWI probation and she has the nerve to steal my alcohol?

Even though I was able to stop the stealing by getting my own fridge, she's just annoying to live with. She doesn't understand boundaries or the fact that we're not friends.

He included a lot of personal details that I won‚Äôt mention. I understood he was going through a separation and he probably didn‚Äôt have anyone to vent to.

I continue to babysit for him for the next month, and the more I do, the more casual he gets with me, talking to me every time I come over and mentioning that I‚Äôm like a friend to him. He also talked about taking me out to dinner as ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù I laughed it off but I didn‚Äôt really confirm as I felt it was a little inappropriate. He also complimented me excessively. At some point he even asked me how the single life was, since he was single now. Well again I passed it off as him going through a lot.

He would also start texting conversations that would turn self-deprecating or difficult to respond to (ex. buying 1 thing at store ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda sad that‚Äôs all I had to do on a Saturday night.‚Äù) He would also use terms of endearment for me. He has called me are Angel, sweetheart, his ‚Äúsaving grace,‚Äù etc. It made me uncomfortable but he never attempted to do anything so I brushed it off as me being paranoid. 

Well at the end of July my grandma passed away. This was obviously very emotional for me and I informed him that I would be unable to babysit that week due to this. He sent me a very long, thoughtful message that did mean a lot to me as it was extremely heartfelt. He would pop in with a message every few days that was kind. One of these messages included the line: ‚Äúyou are not only beautiful but you have a beautiful soul as well.‚Äù

I was raised a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. My whole family are witnesses. At 25 I decided that it was not the religion for me. Unfortunately, if you are baptized in the faith there is a strict shunning policy that is enforced if you decide to leave. It sucks. 

When I left, my father decided that, even though it means he can‚Äôt hold any positions of privilege in the congregation, he was not going to shun his  oldest child. My mother followed his lead. My siblings (I‚Äôm the oldest of 5) are a mixed bag. 

At the point when I left I was still on my family‚Äôs phone and gym plan (charged automatically to my dads account). My dad also supplied me with a car that is in his name and he pays the insurance. In order to pay my father, I would stop by the house once a month and drop off cash. It was a nice ‚Äúofficial‚Äù way for me to visit briefly with the family that everyone was okay with. My family does not reach out to me otherwise. The 2-4xs a year I talk to my family is by me reaching out to them over texts. 

Then my grandma moved in with my parents. My grandma follows the shunning policy very strictly and will not say a word to me/is uncomfortable by my presence. Out of respect for my grandma (I‚Äôm really trying to take the high road) I stopped my visits to the house. For months I‚Äôve been reaching out to my dad asking him how we can get together so I can pay him. But I want to pay him in person because this is the only communication we have. He dodges and doesn‚Äôt answer. 

So I decided I‚Äôm not tracking him down anymore. If he wants me to pay then he can reach out to me. This week I ran into him at the gym because I randomly didn‚Äôt go at my normal time. He mentioned the bills he‚Äôs paying (in a sarcastic but serious kind of way). I told him we should get a drink sometime and talk about it. He mentioned it again in the conversation and I told him that I miss him and want to catch him up on my life. He switched tones and acted like it would be something he‚Äôs interested in. 

My plan is to ride this out and let him reach out to me first to make plans. The thing is my dad is 70 now and still working full time. My family lives a comfortable life but is by no means rich. Also this means I‚Äôm manipulating him the same way my family is trying to manipulate me (by with-holding communication so I turn back to the faith vs. me with holding money so that he reaches out to me).

142,Asshole,"Been married for 4 years. We have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. We also have three dogs: 13yr, 6yr, and 7mo. I'm a dog trainer and love dogs, when I met my wife I had two more dogs but once we had kids I had to downsize unfortunately. Our marriage is great but sometimes the dogs become a point of contention.

Tonight, my wife told me she's no longer comfortable with the dogs as our kids are getting older (the eldest) and while my dogs are acclimated to people, children is uncharted territory. The youngest pup butts heads with the oldest pup which I'm trying to train out. Eventually my wife doesn't want to use baby gates and is worried that we have three dogs roaming around.

She gave me an ultimatum that all three dogs need to be gone within six months. I told her I don't like this kind of tactic of ultimatums and she said this is how it has to be done, our children come first.

I want to keep the dogs. So much so I'm willing to move out if I can keep them. Our marriage is great but that doesn't mean we need to live together. If I can move to a house down the street and keep my dogs, I can still visit my kids every day, take them whenever needed or requested, basically nothing changes in being a dad. I can be over in a moment's notice. The difference is I can keep my dogs. It won't hurt me financially because I can afford a second house and our neighborhood is a relatively new development so there's always homes for sale nearby.

I haven't broached this with anyone except this sub I guess. Would I be the asshole here?

144,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds bad but here's the story behind it. We have a man who is in his right mind but he's bitter about being in a nursing home. His family won't take him home because he isn't and hasn't been a nice guy. 

Yesterday I brought him his supper tray. He picked it up, threw it across the room, laughed and said I had to clean it up, then went to sleep. 

Around 10:15 he woke up hollering about being hungry. The nurse said she didn't want him to go hungry and that she'd buy him the food if I drove to get it. I said no. He had food and he threw it across the room. On top of that, I had started my last round at 10 and leaving would put me far behind. 

The nurse could have gotten him the food. She just didn't want to. She's the kind of nurse who feels like CNAs are beneath her and she ""doesn't do that kind of work."" I told her if she wants to buy him food she can go get it for him. 

She got mad and said I had an attitude problem and I wasn't doing anything anyway. I WAS CHANGING PEOPLE! I told her that all she's doing is sitting with her feet up in a chair and eating a snickers so get your lazy ass up and do something! 

I've been fighting with this nurse for a long time. She won't do a lot of her job because she feels like it's beneath her to answer call lights. When I work the hall alone, she will sit there with her feet up whole I work my ass off. Then she'll try to add stuff for me to do that she's supposed to do. Other aides just do it but I make her do it herself. 

I didn't refuse because I was mad or anything. I refused because I was alone, I couldn't leave the hall unattended, and she hadn't done anything all day so she could do it. By the way she didn't go get him the food. Anyway AITA?",47,42,0.92

147,Everyone Sucks,"My wife and I (late 20s) have been married four years and counting. We are an international family. I come from Britain; she is from Eastern Europe. At the start of 2016, after dating for just over a year, we found out we were pregnant. At the time both of us were unemployed and trying to figure out where to live together, so I flew over to Cyprus, where we got married mid-2016. We had our son in September, and lived there until September 2017, when various reasons caused us to leave. During this time, I worked while my wife stayed at home with our son.

We returned to our ‚Äòbase‚Äô, my wife‚Äôs home city. Visa rules state that I can stay there for three months without a visa. It was during this time that my wife claims I made the mistake which caused her mental breakdown.

My wife insisted that I go back to UK to find work, but visa rules there make it difficult for my family to visit, and even more to stay permanently, so I was afraid of being away from my son for long periods. I already had a work offer in Germany - we both speak German, but not fluently. The money was okay but with room for improvement. Crucially from my point of view, my family didn‚Äôt require a visa to visit me there, and getting residency was fairly simple.

My wife told me on several occasions that she didn‚Äôt want to live in Germany. She didn‚Äôt want to bring up our son there, speak the language, spend time there, etc. However, given that I am the main breadwinner and I felt nervous about waiting to see if anything better would come up in her home country, I took the job anyway in order to ensure my family was provided for. Eventually my wife and son joined me, but my wife doesn't try to integrate into society here, or send our son to a local nursery, and she is unemployed. She wants to find a job in her home country but believes the fact that she hasn‚Äôt worked for four years means that no-one will give her a chance, and that I have stolen her career from her. Tonight we had a big fight and I was blamed for everything.

I understand that my wife wants to go home. I'm okay with that. I‚Äôll go anywhere as long as I know I can provide for my son and ensure he gets the education and opportunities that he deserves. I‚Äôve been looking for remote work which would let us to go and live in her country.

But she is claiming the damage has already been done. That I betrayed her wishes when I came here. She now regularly raises her voice at me with our son around, or slams her fists on tables during fights. She loses control of her emotions. I always try to remain as calm as possible in these situations; now she is saying that because she shouts and I stay calm that our son thinks she is angry and I‚Äôm an ‚Äòangel‚Äô.

So am I the asshole for going against my wife's wishes because I did what I thought was the best and quickest way to ensure my family was provided for? Or should I have listened to her, and should I fully take the blame for everything that has happened?",85,195,0.95

149,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account but honestly if my family ends up finding this post I'll cope. 

Backstory: When my Mom was 5 months pregnant with me my Dad was seriously injured in a car accident and later died in hospital. So when my Mom gave birth, she named me after my deceased father. 

I am 22 now,  and I've always hated my firstname. For the sake of this post let's just say my first name is Humphrey (believe me,  it's really much worse than Humphrey). 

My friends don't even call me by Humphrey anymore because they know I hate it. I was the subject of bullying when I was younger because of my weight issues and also because  my firstname was the same name as a stupid character from a TV show.

I have a much better nickname, let's just say Harry,  that has always stuck. In my mind,  Harry feels more like my true name than my legal firstname. 

So I want to legally change my firstname to Harry and get rid of the name Humphrey for good ... but I know it will really upset my family,  especially my Dads side of the family. I don't mean any ill will to the memory of my Dad,  but I just really hate the name itself with a passion. 

In the past when I've expressed hatred of my name or joked that I wanted it legally changed,  my Mom would really guilt trip me about it. She doesn't even like it when other people refer to me as Harry because she sees me carrying my Dads firstname Humphrey like a legacy to him.

And no,  I don't want Humphrey as my middle name either. The name is just associated in my mind with bullying and bad memories and I don't want to be identified with that name at all. 

Taking all this into consideration,  would I be an asshole if I pursued changing my firstname legally or not?",91,126,0.95

Generally, they'd all be ok with this but this time they seriously wanted to go to the one I didn't wanna go to. This seriously made me upset since there is such a simple compromise we could do but I feel they're just being stubborn. Their argument is that when they get takeout from where they want food it generally tastes bad which is fair, however, I told them I would wait with them to get their food fresh and then we could go to the place where we could meet (since where they wanna go it takes longer) They still didn't go for it and so I just didn't go since I knew the whole time we'd either be arguing about it or they would be super annoying and bring it up all the time.

161,Not the A-hole,"A long bit of background, I‚Äôve been with my bf since our freshman year of college, I graduated a year late but we‚Äôre both full working adults. The two of us have always been very bad with money (nothing extravagant but whenever we get refund from school, we would put an amount aside for rent, then go and blow the rest).

Neither of our parents have college funds for us, so we supported each other‚Äôs. 

When bf graduated, he lands a great gig making as an electrical engineer, he got a used car and we spent his first year out of school going out a lot (keep in mind I pay for myself unless it‚Äôs food). Even though he makes money, he was still going paycheck to paycheck, and struggling with monthly bills. I was confused but didn‚Äôt question it, because it wasn‚Äôt my money to question, I also felt bad because I knew he must be spending a lot of money taking me out. Problem arises when I started working.

We have been in a serious relationship and we love each other‚Äôs very much. I have always been very transparent with my finances. We had the same spending habits, but now we don‚Äôt anymore. When I started working, I decide to shift my focus to finances, I went the whole nine yards, aka Dave Ramsay, reduced spending, saved, and making a budget. Since it‚Äôs been working for me, I share with my bf and suggested I help him too.

Bf was very uncomfortable of me taking over finances, I was confused to why he hates it so much. When breaking the budget down, I saw that he has only been paying the minimum for every bill (car, loans, credit card debt), has no savings, and has increased his cc debt. I didn‚Äôt know where his money was going and so I kept pushing him until he shows me his banks statements. I found out a month in after I started helping him that he has 5k in credit card debt (I thought he only has 2k), and I found out that over 2.5k of it was spent in the span of 6 months on literally fifa points. I was so shocked...we had a rough couple of weeks after that. We talked it out and he told me he feels relieved now that I know, he quit fifa since and we also cut up all of his credit cards.

It‚Äôs been a few months since we started this, he only has $500 left in his cc debt. Overall, we've mostly gotten better but there are still a few hiccups here and there, he started using his Samsung Pay, I later found out that it was linked to his cc, we had a fight about it.

It has gotten better so I backed off. I got a new cc recently and wanted to earn points and improve my credit score, so whenever we go out, we would use my card and he‚Äôd pay me at the end of the cycle. A few days ago, I asked him if he could give me his half, he asked if he can do it when he gets paid this week since he only has $30 left so I asked him where did his money go since I‚Äôve been paying for everything on my card.

162,Not the A-hole,"This happened over the weekend, and at first I didn't think I was TA but it's been on my mind since then so I figured why not see what reddit thinks. 

So I'm travelling back home from an out-of-town wedding and I bought tickets with one of those airlines that don't have assigned seats. I was in the last boarding group so I was amazed when I saw an open window seat near the front of the plane and nabbed it. There were two older women sitting in the middle seat and the aisle seat in the same row. When I asked them to let me in to the row they both gave a big sigh and were obviously not happy to let me in, but hey it's a plane right? No one's really happy on a plane. I didn't think much of it.

The flight was about 4.5 hours long so I settled in, no issues yet. As we are about 45-50min away we can see some of the city we're landing in, but we're still on top of the clouds and it's super bright in my eyes. I stick it out for a bit but eventually have to lower the shade because the sun in bouncing off the clouds and is just uncomfortable for me. A minute or so after I close the shade the lady next to me taps me on the shoulder (I had headphones on) and asks that I re-open the shade. I politely tell her sorry, the sun is really bright in my eyes so I won't open it back up, put my headphones back on and think that's it. The lady taps me again on the shoulder and angrily informs me that they paid money for the flight and to open my window. I again say sorry, not going to do it, and next thing I know she's leaning over me trying to open the shade. By instinct I block her arm I turned to her and say ""sorry, if you wanted to see out the window you should have sat in this seat"" She looks shocked that I had blocked her arm and starts to protest again and I say again, ""if you wanted the window you should have sat in this seat"", and put my headphones back on. 

Here's the part where I'm not sure if I am TA - I had been planning on putting the shade back up once we were out of the cloud bank, but being petty I decided not to. If she hadn't have gotten angry or literally thrust her arm across my body I probably would have re-opened it for them. I feel like she had the opportunity to guarantee an open window and she chose not to take it. But I can kinda see her point of paying for the flight just the same as I, but idk if that justifies her actions.

I shop for almost all of my clothes at Goodwill and other thrift stores. I consider myself good at thrifting; I've gotten a lot of compliments on my style. Plus I save a lot of money.

Last week, I went to Goodwill with my boyfriend, we were mainly looking for fall clothes for him. There's a store in the rich part of town that always has some really nice quality stuff. I found a really nice black sweater with the original tags on it, and we googled it and found that it was $190 originally! And never worn. It looked great on him. That's the kind of store this place is; it's in such a rich area that you can find really great quality items for just a few dollars.

I took a quick look at the children's section because my niece's 2nd birthday was coming up, and I found some adorable toddler rompers there. They didn't have the tags but they looked like new, in perfect condition, and obviously high quality material. They didn't look or feel cheap at all; but I got three for about ten dollars. I looked up the brand later, out of curiosity and their items usually go for more than 30 dollars each.

I visited my brother and his wife the weekend before my niece's birthday, and gave them the clothes in a gift bag. They loved them at first, then my brother's wife asked where the tags were. I said there were none because I'd gotten them from Goodwill. 

And she said ""oh, so these are worn"" in a kind of judgemental way, and I said I wasn't sure. She gave them back saying that they only dress their daughter in ""clean new"" clothes.

I thought that was kind of rude, but I held my tongue and left soon after. Later, I was texting my brother and asked for his thoughts, and he said it was a little thoughtless of me to gift second hand clothes.

I met my husband two years ago. We were both divorced single parents. He has 5 sons and I have one daughter. While we were dating he was very adamant about NOT having any more children. At that time I was 38 and really hoping to have one more child. My daughter always wanted a little brother or sister. My husband convinced me that our union was perfect because he has always wanted a daughter and I have always wanted a son. So our bonus children happen to be exactly what we have desired. His boys are 19, 16, 13, 11 and 6. My daughter is 12.  Right before we got married he had a change of heart and told me he would like for us to try for a baby. He says he loves my daughter as his own but he wants us to have one or two children together. 

We were using condoms as birth control. Now that we are married he refuses to wear condoms.  So I decided to get on the pill without his knowledge.  He has been trying to get me pregnant every month and has even made a doctors appointment (I told him to cancel the appointment) to see if there is something wrong with his sperm. We have only been married 5 months and I think we need to enjoy the new dynamic of our blended family before adding a new baby into the world. I‚Äôm feeling guilty about keeping this secret. 

****To be clear I DO want to have a child with my husband but I would like for us to enjoy our marriage and have the kids all get used to being under the same household before we add another child to the family.*****

One of my advertising reps reached out to me a few weeks ago and asked if I'd consider doing a story on this particular nail salon owner, because *yada yada yada*. Some of her reasons were legit, some not so much, but I told her I'd consider it. 

*So, on to the story:*

This past weekend, I remembered I had a gift certificate for the salon ‚Äî although it was almost a year from the date of issue. Please note that there was **NO** expiration date or any language indicating some type of expiration whatsoever on the certificate.

I decided I would head up the salon, ask if the certificate was still valid, and if so, get a pedicure.

I got there, I showed the guy at reception the certificate, he said it was valid and off I went to get my pedicure. Which, by the way, was probably the best pedicure of my *entire* life. The whole experience was amazing, from reception to the nail polish. I was served a complimentary margarita, the chairs were not only massage-ready but heated. The tech who did my pedicure did an excellent job. Two massages, a foot scrub, nice lotion. I really can't rave enough about it.

I did pick a pricier package than I normally would because I had the certificate, but I figured I'd spend about the same as I normally would if I planned to tip nicely, which I did.

**BUT**, I went to pay using the certificate and it kept coming up invalid. The receptionist went to the owner, who looked at it and immediately told me it expired six months ago and wasn't valid anymore. 

Ugh.

I explained to her that I had shown it to the receptionist and he said it was valid. She said ""He's new, he didn't know."" She kept looking at me and clearly expected me to pay for it in full. I just kept looking back at her, not saying a word, until she agreed to let me use it.

This whole exchange really soured my experience and I left feeling pretty ticked off. I'm now reconsidering assigning a story about her salon to one of my writers, despite the fact that up until she came in to the picture, I'd had a delightful experience.

Does this make me the asshole?

My parents were extremely non-supportive, telling me that I should stick to my chosen career path and that art school would be a poor choice. I talked to my sister about it, as well. She said that it was unrealistic, like my parents did. (Though, admittedly, she did tell me that I should do it if I really wanted to.) She suggested that I give my chosen career a choice for a little while longer, see how it felt, and then maybe try art school. I kept on trucking with my career and now I can say I‚Äôm very, very happy with my decision.

Fast forward to now. My sister has been doing her chosen career path, non-health field-related, for a few years. Recently, she came up to me and told me that she‚Äôs been feeling dissatisfied with her current position and wants to pursue her ‚Äúdream‚Äù of going to medical school. She was talking about all her plans for getting ready for medical school, etc etc. I told her, just like the advice she gave me, that she should stick out her current position and that going to medical school was unrealistic with her age and her chosen field. I mean, after all, if I could stick out my current career, so can she. She got MAD, saying that she‚Äôs always been supportive of what I wanted and dreamed of. Clearly not the case, even if the advice she gave was a good!

Our parents are supportive of her plan, obviously because they think that medicine is more ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù and ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù than art. My mother chastises me, saying that I should be more supportive of her, and I told her that I was being supportive, just as my sister has been supportive of me. Now I‚Äôm mad at them, they‚Äôre mad at me, my sister is mad at me, when really I was giving my sister the same exact advice she gave me. AITA?",47,27,0.81

182,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôm 15 years old and live with my mom and dad. My older sister moved out for college, got pregnant, and then had my nephew 3 years ago. She lives really close by my parents place and is aaaalllwaaaays here because she‚Äôs a single mom so after work she‚Äôll drop by and eat dinner/ etc. She has her own apartment but she gets lonely so she‚Äôll come here and she even has her old room so if she and my nephew want to sleep over they can. She has a spare key and literally comes and goes when she likes. 

Now basically my mom and dad are both always cold so they have their temp super high in the house. Plus my dad insulated everything recently and there‚Äôs underfloor heating everywhere (also new) so the place is *really* warm. As a result I walk around in a pair of gym shorts if not just my boxers because fuck it it‚Äôs so hot.

My mom and dad literally do not care what I do but my sister has been SCREAMING at me everytime she‚Äôs hear to put on clothes or dress appropriately, now if it‚Äôs dinner time I‚Äôll throw on gym shorts but I won‚Äôt wear a t shit because yes it‚Äôs that warm (I don‚Äôt want to ask my parents to turn down the heat because they genuinely are ice cold to the touch)  but if I‚Äôm just walking to the fridge to get a snack I‚Äôll just go in my boxers. It‚Äôs not like my parents dress up for dinner either, my dad sometimes wears pj‚Äôs to dinner and my mom will wear a big fluffy robe so it‚Äôs not like everyone is dressed up except for me. 

Anyway my sister has been nagging and nagging me to get dressed every time she sees me and I told her to leave me alone and it‚Äôs hot, I literally sweat like a pig, but she said I‚Äôm teaching my nephew inappropriate manners and that I should be fully dressed if I‚Äôm appearing outside my room at any moment. 

I told her to shut up , it‚Äôs not her house and mom and dad don‚Äôt care. AITA?",330,1208,0.95
183,Not the A-hole,"My husband (41M) and I (35F) just had our first baby 8 weeks ago. I am still on maternity leave so my days consist of caring for our little one. Since our baby is still so young we obviously don‚Äôt do date nights or adult nights anymore, which we did frequently prior to becoming parents. We did however go out one night because we had tickets to Jerry Seinfeld. That night my mother babysat for us.

So this is the situation. Both of our mothers live near us and are both widows and live alone. I feel comfortable having my mom babysit because my mom nanny‚Äôs for my sister, so she‚Äôs around babies all the time and is great with children. Our baby is her 10th grandchild.

As far as my mother-in-law (MIL) goes, I love her dearly but simply do not feel comfortable ever having her babysit alone, and there are several reasons why. First, she has health problems that need to be addressed but instead of caring for herself she just takes pain killers. She desperately needs her knee replaced so she has a horrible limp and falls frequently (she just fell last week taking her garbage can to her curb which gave her a black eye and busted lip). She doesn‚Äôt have quick enough reflexes to catch herself when she falls, I‚Äôm assuming from pain killers. We‚Äôve tried many times to tell her to schedule a Dr appt, but she puts it off. She is also on anti-depressants and usually sleeps during the day and stays awake at night. Due to her depression her house is absolutely filthy and we‚Äôre starting to look at a hoarder situation.  She is also medicated for Bipolar Disorder.

MIL has come to our house several times while we‚Äôre home to spend time with our daughter, during which we have to monitor them closely. It‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs never held a baby before. My husband had to ‚Äòrescue‚Äô our daughter one time while MIL was holding her because she didn‚Äôt know how to support her neck.

Cue this weekend. My husband and I are invited to a surprise bday party for a close friend who only lives 10 minutes away. We‚Äôd like to go but don‚Äôt want to ask my mom because we don‚Äôt want to exhaust her as a resource by only asking her. My husband then brought up asking his sister (43) and having MIL ‚Äúhelp‚Äù her so she can at least be around the baby, but have his sister be in charge.

My husband feels the same way about his mother not babysitting alone. I guess now the issue is do we let his sister AND his mom? I‚Äôm still nervous because his sister is never around babies (she does not have kids) and our baby is so young she can‚Äôt communicate if she‚Äôs hungry, tired, etc and I‚Äôm afraid it will stress his sister and MIL out.

I told my husband we just shouldn‚Äôt go. I‚Äôm too nervous about it all. Husband is still pushing to go because we ‚Äúneed a night out‚Äù. Am I being too paranoid?

185,Not the A-hole,"We've been at our rental for 3 years. We have a newish neighbor of about 6 months. We share a dividing wooden fence to separate our porches/yards. From fence to fence our back patio is about 30 feet long and we have a table and chairs set up right in the middle. I've recently quit but my husband still smokes. We KNOW it is a disgusting habit. OK? That's not at debate. Whenever our neighbor is out with her 2 small children and my husband comes out to smoke (or anyone that is over that might smoke), she angrily says to her kids something like ""Get inside, it's smoky"". I'm totally cool that she wants her kids to know that smoking is terrible and not to do it but the way she says it is done in an obvious manner that we are disgusting and wrong for smoking. We pay our HIGH rent and are by all accounts, allowed to smoke outside if we want to. We aren't even that close to them. A small percentage of the smoke will waft over the fence. It's not as if we are smoking crack or blowing anything right in these kids faces! She might say something like ""Ugh! So disgusting!"" when we come out there and someone smokes. We've not yet said anything but it causes a lot of anxiety and annoyance that I feel like guests aren't able to go out and smoke if they want to. I think it's wrong for her to shame us as we are not doing anything outside our rights as renters. If she wants to take her kids inside to protect them from the small amount smoke that goes over there, she can do it without being so passive aggressive. What do I do? Who is the asshole?

&#x200B;

Additional info: My husband is not a heavy smoker. She seems to be a stay at home mom, which is totally cool. So she is out with the 2 that aren't school age a lot. Paths cross. I don't want to go tit for tat with her but there is also some hypocrisy involved here. She has 2 small dogs that are ALWAYS outside. Even in extreme heat. We live in Phoenix so it gets pretty nasty. They bark. ALL.THE.TIME. They barbecue maybe 4 times a week and don't know how to work it properly so heavy, putrid smoke spreads out to maybe 4 of our neighboring porches. They have loud gatherings on their porch maybe 3 times a month but dare to make a comment about ""Do they know what time it is?"" in the rare instance we stay up late and chat quietly outside. I haven't criticized them on this, directly or passive aggressively. I expect neighbors to keep to themselves as long as no one is being hurt. But I certainly would call someone if I ever felt the dogs were in danger from the heat.",109,109,0.86

As I was getting into my car this morning a girl that lives nearby ran up to me explaining she missed her bus and asked for a ride to her middle school.  I've seen her around our street but do not know her and I do not know her parents.  The school is about 1.5 miles away and I was not in a rush so it would not have been a problem for me at all.  She offered to mow the lawn or walk our dog as a way to repay the favor but it wasn't about that.  As a grown man I didn't feel like it was appropriate for me to do this.  I was caught very much off guard so I asked her to give me a minute for me to run inside the house.  

I used this time to tell my wife what was happening and asked for her advice.  She agreed it felt weird and would probably not be a good idea.  I asked if she might be able to take her but she was unable to either.  I ended up going back outside and explaining we couldn't help and that I was very sorry.  The girl looked crushed and confused as to what she should do next, I spent my entire commute feeling bad about saying no and questioning my decision.

I asked her whether she meant anything really? And she said yes.

189,Not the A-hole,"So my daughter is in 2nd grade. We went to parent teacher conference on Tuesday and have been debating saying something ever since.

For context I live in a small rural community. When at the parent teacher conference my DD teacher brought up that they will be doing Old Timey Day at school next month and that they are encouraging the kids to dress as pilgrims cowboys or Indians. 

I don't think its appropriate for the kids to be dressing up as native Americans. I feel as though thats incredibly disrespectful to their culture and the hardships they faced at the hands of the early settlers and throughout our history.

So I've been debating if i should send a letter to the principal to suggest an alternative to dressing up as native American. Maybe have the kids write short stories about what life was like for natives back then. Let them dress as cowboys and pilgrims but I honestly am uncomfortable with the kids dressing as native Americans. 

So reddit would i be the asshole if i say something?

I just wanted to edit this to say that I actually am not originally from this community. I moved here about 10 years ago and that I'm not 100% non native but i did grow up with my 100%  Native American great grandmother. She raised me my entire life so it makes me uncomfortable. I am in no way going to be aggressive in my approach to the school bc they are a good school and I dont think they're being insensitive on purpose. Just thinking of sending a nicely worded email as to why i think maybe having the kids wrote short essays about native culture would be a better avenue than allowing them to dress as natives.

I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that.

199,Asshole,"Vague title, but it requires some back story. 

Last night, met up with best friend and his fianc√©. We‚Äôre a tight knit group and always go see movies together, the four of us. A few of his friends are in town visiting from the other end of the country, one of these friends we had met *the other three we had not met before*. So we meet up for a couple drinks before the movie. 

When best friend and fianc√© arrive, they greet us and sit down. His four friends introduce themselves to me, and sit down. Completely ignoring my girlfriend. She immediately starts talking to fianc√©, everyone orders drinks and proceeds to have good conversation. We see the movie, all is good, discuss it afterward for a few minutes and say our goodbyes. 

As we depart, there we are again, four friends shake my hand say it was nice to meet you and depart, no acknowledgment of her. 

At first she mentions it when we get home, she equates it to a similar experience where she tried to extend a greeting and was met ‚Äúoh you want to shake hands too?‚Äù Neither of us remember the context but remember that instance. She says it can happen to women and it doesn‚Äôt feel good at all. 
I acknowledge this.
After a bit of time she mentions that I should‚Äôve noticed it, said something or at the least introduced her as everyone sat down. 

So reddit, tell me AITA for not being aware of this as it happened?

EDIT: Some clarification for people that are curious. 
1) we were seated side by side, GF to my right towards the head of a long bench table. When everyone else approached it was almost directly at her. Fianc√©e sat at the head of the table and best friend sat opposite of my GF immediately. The other four started to file to the open seats when I stopped to engage and introduce myself. LIKELY if I had not, they wouldn‚Äôt have until they sat down. 
2) She was not ignored by anyone once in terms of conversation while we were at the table. Conversation was flowing and all was well. 
3) She is a little shy, we both are around people we‚Äôve not met before but I tried to engage and when I was shaking hands she was already talking to fianc√©e about their day. 
4) Thank you for the responses, it‚Äôs good to see people‚Äôs point of view. I‚Äôll be sure to be mindful in the future of this, and for those vilifying me I hope some clarification here will show you it wasn‚Äôt as blatant as you‚Äôre imagining.",658,2428,0.94

201,Asshole,"I teach at a medium-large high school, meaning I'm not super familiar with all of my students and their backgrounds. 

At parent-teacher conferences last night I met a junior's parents who let me know that he was looking to get into some really top brand-name type schools. That is an anomaly here because it is an urban district with most kids going to state schools.

They weren't (just) bragging about this, they actually had a point about something unrelated.

So I had no clue that this kid was aiming so high, although he is the best student in my class and obviously a critical thinker and intelligent.

I pulled up his grades and it turns out he has an absolutely perfect GPA and even above perfect with weighted classes all the way back to sixth grade. *That is, until my class.*

For some reason this kid forgot something near the beginning of the year or Etc where he's like a couple points off ""perfect 4.0"" for my class. Basically he has an A minus, well a 3.5 

I'm thinking of bumping him up to an A/4.0 because:

My reasons are 
1) I don't offer extra credit.
2) If my question is ""has the student completely mastered the material up to now"", the answer is a resounding yes. The kid has been perfect on tests et cetera, he obviously knows the stuff and he's obviously the most versed kid in the room on my subject.
3) I'm an idiot and didn't build in a lot of wiggle room for me in my grading structure.
4) it's too late to give extra credit now because the quarter ended yesterday before conferences.

I guess I would not do this because I have no reason to do it for any other students. I gave the kids the grading scale and if I go hardcore by the grading scale he won't get a 4.0. He'll know I bumped him up because he is one of those kids that keeps track of his own grades. It's unfair? Idk. Feels slimy?

TLDR: after finding out a kid is going to try for big-name colleges, I realized I would be the only person who gave him less than a four-point in his last seven years of life. And I kind of feel like he did earn a 4.0, but according to my grading structure, he did NOT.",310,937,0.97

He might have been thinking this would be a dish set we would use once we moved in together (we had plans to do so when my lease is up in August 2020). Everything else I can think of (a salt lamp, the headphones, maybe some books or clothes) was all bought for me under the pretense of being a gift, or was his that he freely gave to me.

I‚Äôm staying in an airbnb with my friend and another roommate who has been here one week longer than we have. We all share the same bathroom, which is cleaned once a week by a cleaning person. 

The other roommate is nice but has very different cleaning standards than I do. I believe this is her first time staying with roommates and before that she was an only child. I grew up with a big family and I‚Äôve had many roommates before. 

The other roommate has asked us to make sure we clean all of the hair out of the shower when my roommate/friend forgot a few strands once. We apologized and did. Today she asked us again and said there was still hair in the shower from yesterday. I apologized profusely and went straight to the bathroom to clean it out.

Obviously since neither of us actually know these girls, none of them are invited, however Dan asked for a plus one. Fine. Here's what comes with that.

2. If he brings only one of these girls, the people the other two are friends with will notice, some of them are the type of people to say something.

I don't think Dan realises the size of the party or knows exactly who we are inviting. I also don't think my fiance has noticed this situation.

Despite all of this, it almost makes me happy to think about how this could finally put Dan in his place. The party would be large enough that any drama of this type honestly couldnt really ruin the mood.

Please ask for info, I've tried to keep this short, the more I typed the more confusing it sounded.

So, WIBTA if I allowed Dan a plus one?

INFO: Dan is cheating, not polyamorous. His girlfriends don't know about each other.

INFO: Some of you asked why I'm friends with such a dick. You're right, Dan is a pos and I don't *like* him, he's hard to be friends with but he has done things for my fiance and I which have changed our lives (which I'm not going to mention here for the purpose of anonymity) and pulled my fiance out of some bad places. To be honest his behaviour did lose him the position of best man. While I do not at all respect his choices, our wedding would not be right without him there as, ultimately, I'm not sure we would be together without Dan.

EDIT: Just wanted to address some things that have been asked/mentioned a few times in the comments:


1. I mentioned at the beginning of my post that I don't know these girls and have never met them. A lot of people have said anyway that I should tell them. I didn't believe that I should since I really did not believe it's my place, now I'm feeling more conflicted. Perhaps I'll end up making another post about this one.


2. +1 was an option on all the invites of the ""single"" people we invited (i.e. Invites where there was only one named person invited) honestly the situation didn't even occur to me until I saw Dan's reply a couple of days ago.


3. We have a website where people give us their choices for their meals and the names of their dates and their meal choices also. Dan hasn't done this yet, so I don't know who he plans to bring, but like a couple of people have said, he may bring someone else.


4. We did in fact already deny a friend a plus one after they named them for reasons that are irrelevant to this post, so it's not something we'd feel uncomfortable doing if the judgement was that I am the asshole.


5. I absolutely plan to tell my fianc√© before any further action, all I meant when I said that I don't think that my fiance has realised this situation is that I don't think he's noticed, I definitely did *not* mean that I won't tell him. 


5. I am female (idk if this is the same everywhere but in the UK fianc√©e = female, fianc√© = male)


6. Dan is a morally ambiguous man, he does incredibly pure, good and kind things, at the same time as doing multiple other disrespectful, mean and hurtful things. He has never hurt me in any way, however his behavior towards some others (like the girls) really gets to me, hence why I don't like him, but he has to be there.",302,1681,0.97

221,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys! I meant to post this a couple days ago but I got distracted by some other things on this sub...
Then I meant to post yesterday but I talked myself out of it because I thought I was just being silly. 
However the argument came up AGAIN today so I‚Äôm finally here to ask for judgement. 

I (f22) have been with my boyfriend (22) for a year and a half and we have lived together since April. We‚Äôre both still sort of getting our lives set up so we‚Äôre working low-paying jobs for now until we finish up our education and can finally get proper work.

I‚Äôll try not to get too into the details of our financial situation, but it‚Äôs important to note that I make slightly more than bf does (I‚Äôm talking like $1-2 more an hour). I was also out of a job from May to August and in that time I accumulated a small-but-big amount of credit card debt from buying stuff like groceries and food for the both of us, and paying my parts of bills. Now that I have a paycheck again, I set aside a bit of money for my bills then the rest goes immediately to my cc balance. My eating money comes from twice-weekly blood plasma ‚Äúdonations,‚Äù which gets me maybe an extra $80 each week.

The past couple weeks I‚Äôve kind of developed a habit of buying food and eating it while away from my bf. I do this because if he sees me with food, he gets upset that I didn‚Äôt get him anything too. If he knows I‚Äôm going to go buy food, he wants me to bring him some too. After my most recent donation, he asked me if I was hungry. I said yes. He then asked if I would go out and get us both food since I had just gotten some money.

Part of me feels somewhat possessive over this plasma money because I had to let someone stick me with a needle and drain fluid from my body to earn it. Another part of me feels bad because I know how stressful it was for bf when I was out of work and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve paid him back enough yet.

He‚Äôs pretty good at making me feel like an asshole sometimes, but I don‚Äôt know how *I* feel about what I‚Äôm doing so here I am. AITA for hiding food from my bf?",125,160,0.92
222,Not the A-hole,"So first of all, I did NOT mean to make this kid cry, nor did I think that he would as I did nothing severe.

&#x200B;

This is pretty much my first post so I don't really know how to do this but I'll try.

So I was riding the bus and I was working on a essay, so the bus stopped and a kid and his mom sits down right next to me, the kid looked 12-13 and the mom maybe in her mid 40s. I didn't really mind them being there until the kid starts watching some Netflix show on his iPad (not really sure what it was). And the bus was already kind of loud but he was right next to me and really distracting me from working so I politely asked him to lower the volume down, this is how it kind of went.

Me: Can you please lower the volume down a little, I'm trying to work here.

Kid: No, I don't want to.

Mom: This is a public space, he can play it as loud as he wants.

I forgot my headphones that day but I didn't want this argument to continue so I tried my best to ignore them. Then I got an idea. So I was going home after going to buy some gifts for some old friends that I was going to meet and I stumbled upon a speaker, a really nice usb one so I decided to buy it for myself. So I brought that out and started playing some music loudly(from my laptop), much louder than his iPad but I put the settings not loud enough to actually annoy anyone else in the bus, probably. After awhile the mom complains to me to put the music lower as her son couldn't hear what he's watching. I just replied ""This is a public space, I can play it as loud as I want"". And after a minute, the Kid starts crying about how he can't hear what he's watching. I'm not sure if there was something wrong with the kid or if he's just emotional but his mom kept telling me to stop as her baby can't hear what he's watching. I stopped the music as I actually kinda felt bad and asked him again to lower the volume, at least he listened this time.

&#x200B;

So AITA?

&#x200B;

edit: Many of you have been saying that I shouldn't get annoyed that easily, or why am I even writing it in a bus, so basically I had to finish the essay and send it to prof(as I got sick and I asked for an extension) and I only had around 2 hours left before I had to send it(my fault for forgetting to do it this morning) and annoyed because public transport, random things you probably don't understand are said, This person was right next to me and it was distracting me as I could hear every single thing going on, kinda like trying to do work while the TV is playing 10 feet away and I'm naturally a quieter person. Why I didn't move, the bus was nearly full(and I didn't want to annoy anyone by moving), This was a lot of moving.

224,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

Need some opinions, here‚Äôs the break down.

I have been dating this girl for 3 years and we decided in December that we would go to a new country and stay there for 12 months, as a long holiday. Now I own my own online business, so I can work from anywhere and I told her that she can quit her job and further her studies whilst over Seas, which I think is a really good deal.

So she has always been hesitant about going because she will miss her family ect, but she did agree to go, so I have gone and done all the work required (Get visas, book tickets, find accommodation, organize everything to take our cat with us) all of this has cost me around $12k. Now, 4 weeks before we leave she has told me that she doesn‚Äôt want to go and that I must cancel the trip otherwise we are going to break up.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that we live in a POS 3rd world country in Africa and we are going to a really nice 1st world country. And I am paying for Everything.

Her reasons for not wanting to go are, She will miss her family, has no security in relationship(engagement), doesn‚Äôt want to be away for Christmas, does t like my friend that lives in the country.

She also said that if she did go I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything with out her, cause she doesn‚Äôt want to be alone in a strange country. So I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to go have a beer with a friend.. she also said she only agreed to go initially because she felt backed into a corner at the time.

So AITA for saying that I am going with or with out her?",37,29,0.89

227,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (25F) have been together 9 months. We don't live together, but we spend a lot of time at my house and I cook for us while we're here. 

My boyfriend sucks at doing dishes. He somehow makes the dishes dirtier and grosser when he tries to wash them. He uses cold water and too much soap and the dishes always come out greasy and slimy, and often still have bits of food on them. He also soaks my kitchen rug and floor every time somehow. I started out trying to be nice by saying, ""Oh, you don't have to do the dishes, I'll take care of them"" to finally explaining several times that you need to use hot water, and that dish soap is concentrated so you don't need to use a cup of it per sinkload. When I'd explain he'd say, ""Oh I know"" and make an excuse or say that this is how his family does dishes. Finally, in August, I told him explicitly that I appreciated him wanting to help, but please don't wash my dishes anymore.

So last night I made us dinner (pasta e fagioli and garlic bread), we watched a movie, and I passed out around 10pm because I had a long day. I usually wash dishes right after dinner (partly because I can be neat, and partly out of habit because I used to rush to wash them before he'd try) but I was too tired and just decided to leave them.

I woke up at 1am to the sounds of splashing and clanging and a loud podcast, and I walked out to find my boyfriend washing dishes! I was cranky because he had woken me up (I get up for work at 6) being so loud, but also because we've talked about this so many times. I blew up and told him to stop, that I know he's trying to be helpful but he makes my dishes disgustingly greasy and creates more work for me, and to just stop making so much noise. I didn't curse at him but I was really fucking mad!

He immediately got defensive and called me ungrateful and rude, said that he was just trying to help since I was so busy, that anyone else would be grateful if their boyfriend or girlfriend cleaned up, that I never do dishes at HIS house (he has 3 roommates and his kitchen is a warzone, so we always get takeout! No dishes!), that my cleaning standards are unreasonable, and ended up storming out of my apartment at 2am to go home.

Now I'm wide awake and wonder if I was being too harsh. He seemed really upset, and I know he's just trying to help, but we've talked about this so many times.",351,1059,0.96
228,Not the A-hole,"Ok so heres the background. I work in an office with a team of people who generally share the same interests. Its not unusual in the course of a day to have a few discussions or debates about history or films or whatever subject come up.

One day I came into work and one of my colleagues told me he had been watching a documentary on netflix called ""Roman Empire"" and that the current subject was Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. He said that he didnt think it was very good but that he was educating himself abour the roman empire.

This prompted a conversation about the subject which myself and a few other colleagues were also involved in where I revealed that contrary to the events in the movie ""Gladiator"" (which all present including the documentary watcher had seen) Commodus was not killed in the arena but was actually stangles to death in his bath.

This caused my colleague to jump up and exclaim that I have now ruined the documentary for him and he wont bother watching it now. I've argued that you cant ""ruin"" history as the event in question happened over a thousand years ago and while it might not be common knowledge it is kind of out there now, does revealing that Julius Ceasar was betrayed and stabbed to death ruin that? He said it does because he was actually going to watch a documentary on Ceasar next.

So reddit AITA for talking about something that happened in the distant past even though my colleague said he was currently watching a documentary about it?

(My colleague also wants to share that he didnt actually know that Commodus became Emperor and so that was ruined as well.)

EDIT: my colleague would like to clarify that it was actually a docu-drama so he feels there was also an element of suspense to it.

FURTHER EDIT: ok so this has ended up a lot more popular than I thought. A lot of good points being made and a lot of people commenting that you cant spoil history with plenty of other people saying that ma√Ω be true but you can spoil a tv show. I think thats a very fair thing to say however I think the point here should be kept to wherher it was assholish of me to say what I said.

I would like to add a thing or two myself. 1. He did say the documentary was shit so I maybe assumed that he probably wasnt going to continue it. 2. I did establish before stating anything that we had all at least seen Gladiator and my statement was more in reference to that as I havent seen the documentary. 3. I didnt just suddenly blurt out what I said. We had been in a conversation about Commodus for at least a couple of minutes before the statement was made.",505,1898,0.96

231,Asshole,"Hi, obligatory note that I‚Äôm a long time lurker, first time poster, and on mobile so formatting, blah blah blah.

Okay! So I (20F) am a junior in college at a school in the United States, but studying abroad in Italy for four months. Some background, I was supposed to come with my three best friends, but they all backed out for various, although completely understandable reasons. Due to this I was placed in housing with people that I didn‚Äôt know who also had a girl from their group back out last minute. There are now four of us in the house, and I guess we get along well, but it‚Äôs slightly awkward seeing as they know each other and are really close, and I don‚Äôt know them at all. The house is set up so it‚Äôs two rooms of two people. So me and my roommate, ‚ÄúRachel‚Äù (20F) are in one room, and our other two housemates ‚ÄúJane‚Äù and ‚ÄúTessa‚Äù (19F/20F) are in the other room. 

Here‚Äôs where the problem is: every night, since day one, Rachel falls asleep with her phone on ringer so that her alarm goes off in the morning, fine. But every night, Rachel‚Äôs phone goes rings anywhere in between 5-20 times in the middle of the night (because we‚Äôre six hours ahead of our friends/family/SOs so when we‚Äôre asleep, they‚Äôre usually still up as it‚Äôs only the evening there). I should also note that Rachel is a pretty heavy sleeper, where I am not and once I‚Äôve been woken up, it‚Äôs really hard for me to fall back asleep. 

I put up with this for a couple of weeks, considering that I really don‚Äôt like confrontation and I want to be friendly with the girls I live with and keep it low drama for the short time we‚Äôre here. But after a while, it just became plain annoying. I already don‚Äôt get a good night of sleep because we sleep with the windows open and we live in the middle of a pretty loud city center. So I asked Rachel if she would mind turning her ringer off because I can‚Äôt sleep with her phone going off constantly at night. She said she couldn‚Äôt because she needed the ringer to go off to wake her up for class. (side note: she doesn‚Äôt actually use an alarm, she has her boyfriend [from home] call her in the morning to wake her up) and she would sleep through it if it was just on vibrate. She wasn‚Äôt rude about it but the whole situation is frustrating. 

I‚Äôm writing this post because this morning, starting at 5:30am, her phone rang 12 times on full volume, not only waking me up but preventing me from falling back to sleep, and I could have slept for an extra 3 hours considering I don‚Äôt need to wake up until 8:30 to start getting ready for my 9:30 class. 

So WIBTA if I turned off her ringer, possibly making her late to her class, so that I can manage to get a decent night‚Äôs sleep?",57,92,0.91
232,Not the A-hole,"Around the beginning of July, my best friend of 6 years ended up in the hospital due to Transverse Myelitis. It essentially causes paralysis, and she has one of the worst cases; paralyzed from the neck down.

Recently, she's been getting better. She can sit up on her own with minimal assistance, has better motor control in her arms, and is recently starting to feel a tingling sensation in her thighs. But her dad has been giving her ""supplements"" to help her healing. He won't share what the name is publicly, and is going into a meeting tomorrow to discuss these supplements. The doctors obviously dont want her on them, in case they clash with her medicines. It could permanently limit her recovery, and could possibly cause her to never be able to walk again.

He plans on giving them to her in secret if the meeting goes wrong. Now I want to note that when I visited her in the hospital, her primary doctor for the day came in to talk to us. He blatantly ignored him, and was on his phone organizing a bbq. (It was for a passed away child of a friend of his.

233,Not the A-hole,"So over the summer, my boyfriend and I did a road trip and rented cars. We usually did legit rentals and I would rent the car in my name and drive as the sole driver. He would over to drive but it was rented in my name and I was nervous- I may have let him drive a few times but was quite paranoid the whole time as the cars in my name etc etc. 

So one day he decides to rent w Turo instead of the actual agency. I‚Äôve done this before- you take pictures before/ after renting the car for proof of damage etc. So he goes and gets the car without me, we drive around, he asks me to drive for a bit so he can look at the sights- I hesitate but say ok who cares I can drive for a little. We return the car- I ask if he needs to take any pictures and he says no the guy didn‚Äôt ask. I think it‚Äôs weird but whatever it‚Äôs his life. 

 A week or so later he gets a charge attempt from turo for $700 for damage and a pic of the underside of the front bumper that‚Äôs scratched. He disputes it but basically has no wiggle room and has to pay unless he has pictures of the scratch being on the car before he got in. He has no pictures- and honestly even if he took pictures I doubt he‚Äôd lay on his back to take the picture of under the bumper. I ask if he wants to consult a lawyer, tell turo they need proof there was no scratch before we rented the car, any kind of fight but he has given up and just says there‚Äôs nothing to do and just to pay it. 
We both think there‚Äôs no way it was either of us driving- and this dude is just trying to get money to pay for existing damage on the car.

I never wanted her to go to bed thinking we were not on good terms.

I was SHOCKED when she said that, because I thought we both moved on from that and thought we had a loving/caring (yet distant) relationship.  I didn't even know what to say, I was/am heart broken because I do love her and always wanted us to at least be caring towards each other but she basically said she has no desire to do much with me kinda hurt.  I finally got it out and said ""what we did as kids was YEARS ago and if your still on about that then you just need to grow up, I'm sorry how I treated you but it shouldn't be the basis of why you hate me now.""

239,Not the A-hole,"I (18F) had my 18th birthday a few months ago. My parents aren't vehemently anti-drinking but they're very pro-21+ and have never been the type of parents to let their underaged kids have a small sip of something alcoholic. I've drank before, usually in friends' basements or at parties but I've never been dangerous about it. I graduated from HS in June and am taking a gap year to work and save up some money before starting college next fall. My parents graduation gift to me was a trip to Europe, because I've always wanted to go and I've been learning French, Italian, and German for several years. We did a tour of those three countries and Great Britain. The legal drinking age in France is 18, I checked. Even Americans can purchase and consume alcohol at 18 though the law in America is 21.

On our first night we went to dinner at a nice little place in the 17th arrondissement. Everyone ordered their drinks, I ordered a glass of water and a glass of Bordeaux. My parents had brought my grandparents and my aunt and uncle with their younger kids. Everyone was acting like it was the biggest deal. 

I would like to note, I paid my own way to Europe. I had some graduation money saved up and I've had a part-time job with very little by way of bills and expenses so I had a nice little nest egg saved up. I paid for my ticket and my Euro-Star tickets, all souvenirs. My parents paid for hotel rooms and meals. To compromise with my parents I offered to pay for my one glass of wine on a separate tab. My mother in particular was absolutely pissed off at me for the wine, she kept insisting that ""she was going to have to drag my drunk ass around Europe and I'd ruin the trip for everyone."" 

My aunt and uncle are mildly Fundie christian and teetotal so they were convinced I'm going to corrupt their children. They ended up ruining my first night in Paris because they wouldn't stop harassing me. I literally had one glass. I never go over one glass when I'm in public. Their dramatics over the wine ended up making me leave them. I went back to our hotel, grabbed my backpack of clothing and sundry items and found a hostel. I ended up bee-bopping around Europe by myself for several weeks.

My family does not speak any foreign languages. They brought a language guide and their phones to translate everything. I have a pretty decent grasp on a few languages so I was fine. I plan on studying language and customs at school next fall. From what I understand my family ended up returning to America after four days instead of staying for the full two weeks that were previously planned.

I have a very successful long running street event that draws 10k-20k people to our small town. A new business opened up who‚Äôs within the event footprint and has pushed back on my event claiming they were concerned about my guests using their bathroom among other things. 

They contacted the city event person to complain and the 3 of us had a meeting. I addressed their concern by saying I would put up signs for them and let my guests know. Not to use their facilities. The method I used to inform my guests was posting in my Facebook event to not use their bathrooms.

They got upset saying I singled them out. I mean I did do that but none of the other business in the area have an issue with the event, it brings them lots of business.

242,Not the A-hole,"By the time I get any replies, this will probably be a moot point, but I'm still curious. Me: works 8-5 Tues-fri, has kid from prior relationship, takes care of most day to day bullshit. Him: works 12s on rotating shift, so 2 on, 2 off, 2 on, 3 off, etc. Rarely does anything other than work or video games, especially without prompting.

We make about the same money, contribute the same to the static bills (rent, wsg, electric, etc).

I've been trying to implement a system where basically whoever is home first deals with dinner. If he and I both work on a given day, I'm home first, I deal with dinner. So on and so forth. This was lightly discussed...I told him what I'd been aiming for, he said that that sounded fair. 

Today: he did not work, I did. He bought dinner, which in itself is kind of a 50/50 chance. I expressed appreciation. I get home, neither one of us is hungry yet, whatever. An hour goes by...kid is getting hungry, has a history of migraines exacerbated by dehydration and hunger. I mention this. He wants me to finish watching a half hour video with him, after I tell him that this is happening. I say no, kid migraine is slightly more important, I'll cook dinner myself. He shrugs and puts his headphones back on.

I've been writing this in chunks, so at this point all steaks are cooked...but I was so very, very fucking tempted to cook mine and child's and leave his raw in the fridge. Would I have been an asshole to do that?

Edit/update/info: so I don't hafta repeat myself lol...

1) My son is not being starved. There is food in the house, and there was an adult to ask about snacks/dinner/whatever - it just wasn't me, up until about an hour before this happened. I'm not sure if he didn't ask, or literally just didn't realize he was hungry until right around our normal dinner time. Hunger does not always lead to migraine, either, but over the years I've learned to tell the difference when he asks. SO has not had nearly as much practice at it, so I don't expect him to interpret kiddo's tone/expression the same way I do...but when I talked to him about getting dinner started, I did specifically tell him that kiddo, this time, seemed to be gearing up for one if we didn't get him fed soon. 

2) I have consulted a doc about the migraines. We've been managing them fairly well usually, but his medication only works if we catch one in time, and I prefer to solve the issue with nutritional intake if it's still possible to do so. His migraines, when they get to full-blown, cause him to throw up everything, until he can keep down his meds long enough for them to work, and he usually needs to sleep for a bit after as well...so if one gets bad right before dinner, the poor guy isn't likely to be able to keep anything down until morning, which can cause a cycle. If anyone has migraines themselves and has helpful suggestions, I welcome them! Thanks in advance :-)

3) We all have ADHD/ADD, only kiddo and I are medicated though. It leads to some hectic situations, and we all need to improve how we communicate/plan/deal with things.

4) I did bring it up with SO after dinner. In my usual fashion, I made a mess of it, and we did end up going to bed angry. But this morning after things had processed, we discussed what went badly and what we can both improve on...this isn't a relationship-ender lol. I posted mostly because I'm not always self-aware enough to know whether or not (or how badly) I'm over-reacting to something.

243,Not enough info,"I just saw a post about a couple getting married and asking if they would be the asshole to have a cashbar at their wedding. A lot of people said yes, and it is a dick move. Granted, she was talking of making money off her guest, but it has made me question our BYOB choice. 

Long story short, my fiance and I do not have a lot of money. We are trying to keep things as cheap as possible for a wedding. Anyway, soon to be husband does not drink and I am currently pregnant. Honestly, we don't have the money to supply everyone with booze that we won't even drink, a bartender, and police officer (the venue requires an extra fee for serving alcohol and requires us to pay for an officer on site).

I know a lot of our friends drink and would want to drink to celebrate. I am totally okay with this, but WIBTA if I mention we won't be suppyling alcohol and it's a BYOB event? 

*If it matters, we are supplying food and non-alcoholic drinks.

Edit for those who care: 
For the ones mentioning it, it is indeed a very casual, ""backyard"" wedding. It's at a home owners house who lives on a lake. They rent their property out pretty cheap for events for a little extra cash on the side. I have checked with the owners to be sure I understood the rules. We are indeed allowed to bring our own alcohol as long as we pay the refundable damage fee (which we have already paid). The only time they charge extra fees is if they are supplying the alcohol. We decided on providing a ""starter"" supply of alcohol. A few bottles of wine and a few packs of beer (doesn't seem like much, but it is a pretty small wedding). We plan on telling guest if they want more or something specific to bring it themselves. Thanks so much for the ideas and helping ease my mind!",71,136,0.9

So, a little backstory..
Me: Me.   Classmate with ADHD: Jake.  Teacher: 

Teacher
I‚Äôm in high school, a freshman in America . I take freshman French class, and I have a friend in there who has ADHD, we‚Äôll call him Jake (not his real name). He rarely disrupts the class but is a little hyper. My teacher always chooses him to answer questions because he knows that French is not his strongest subject, and he intentionally puts him on the spot. Teacher always picked on Jake when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention. 
The last straw for me was when Teacher was telling a scary story about a haunted school and a special needs kid. Somebody asked what the name was of the special needs kid was in the story. Teacher then referred to Jake as the special needs kid, and the class started laughing. Jakes immediate reaction was to try laughing it off, but I could tell Jake was extremely uncomfortable.

247,Not the A-hole," I (23F) don‚Äôt like children. About 80% of the reason is that I just don‚Äôt have maternal feelings and 20% of it is that I biologically can‚Äôt ever have kids myself so I don‚Äôt particularly want to surround myself with something I can‚Äôt have. During my engagement to my husband, I found out that his brother and sister-in-law were expecting their first baby. 

On the day of their babyshower I ended up having a total panic attack and was completely skeeved out, so I was unable to attend. In the interest of full disclosure, I sent them a babyshower card in which I expressed my happiness and support for their growing family and told them the fact that I can‚Äôt have kids and am not really a kid person. The idea was that I could tell them about this so that they know that I mean them no ill-will with my absence.

My husband and I are now married and the brother and sister-in-law have their toddler. Every few weeks for the past year, my brother-in-law will text my husband to ask whether I will come by and babysit for them. So far I have turned them down each time and my husband has done it instead. What I‚Äôm particularly frustrated about is that if my brother and sister-in-law need a babysitter, they text my husband to ask specifically whether I‚Äôd do it. However, if they are hosting a ‚Äúfun event‚Äù at their house, such as a game or movie night with their other twentysomething friends, only my husband gets invited. I think my husband‚Äôs brother and sister-in-law are really nice people who I‚Äôd love to get to know better. I brought up the fact that I seem to only be invited to babysitting and not fun events with my husband, who then addressed it with his brother. Since then, the only thing that has changed is that now *both* my husband and I get invited to babysit, yet he is still the only one who is invited to fun nights. The only non-babysitting thing that I have been invited to was my niece‚Äôs upcoming birthday party. 

I find it absolutely bewildering that they have repeatedly asked me to babysit because they barely know me, know that I have no experience with kids, and are aware that I don‚Äôt particularly like being around kids. Am I the asshole for being peeved when being asked to babysit my niece?

TL;DR I don‚Äôt like kids, but my husband‚Äôs brother keeps asking him whether I can babysit their kid.

EDIT: 
- These aren't ""boys nights"" or ""brothers only nights"". I totally respect that and totally wouldn't want to intrude.
- I didn't make this clear in the original post, but I've had in-person heart-to-heart talks with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law about my awkwardness with kids before (totally independent of the baby shower). The sister-in-law said she could relate to feeling like I did when she was my she too. I have told them that I'm not really into babysitting, but would do it if my husband isn't available.
- Also for context: My husband totally doesn't mind babysitting (he enjoys it in fact). Also, I definitely wouldn't mind babysitting in an emergency or something.",66,89,0.88

A little back story:

She's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

I'm 24 and work a minimum wage + commission job, I have barely any money saved so she doesn't understand why I spend so much money/time with family 

We've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, we love each other and live independent lives but she worries that I'm too focused on helping my family and making them happy instead of building a future for us. She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.

She doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

She is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.

She expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. 

We had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. 

Shes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family.

252,Asshole,"So I just moved to a very nice place in SF. I‚Äôm paying top dollar for this place.

The landlord/owner lives here too, and has only just started the eviction process at the end of September (was too naive in believing the squatter when he said he would come up with the money). However, I‚Äôve been told the eviction process can take up to 60 days. 

So now my situation is I‚Äôm sleeping in the landlord‚Äôs master bedroom with my entire life in storage and in boxes, while the landlord has been sleeping on the couch. It‚Äôs been very stressful for the both of us.

The landlord checks in on this guy every other day or so regarding what places he‚Äôs got lined up to view, and I kid you not, has also OFFERED TO PAY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AND FIRST MONTHS RENT of whatever place the squatter finds, just to get him out of here.

I'm 22. I've been dating this girl for a year. She is Ghanian (this is kinda relevant/ not really) . My parents have met her a couple times and like her but my sister has only met her once. My older sister got marred a week ago to her long time boyfriend and was having a big wedding. She initially wasn't going to give me a plus one since  I was ""just a kid"" and she didn't really know my gf but my parents thought it was unfair because our 2 other brothers got one so I decided to bring my girlfriend. My sister wanted everybody at the wedding to wear blue, red or gold. I thought this was ridiculous by my sister was very insistent on it. It was part of the ""aesthetic"" she had planned. I told my girlfriend the color theme and she was like ""I have a dress that's literally all 3 colors butt I don't think I should wear it lol."" She sent me a picture of the dress and it was kinda like an african inspired dress but I thought it looked cool and told her it looked great and fit the theme and she should wear it.

Flash forward to the wedding, my girlfriend wears the african dress to the wedding. We enjoyed the wedding and she said she got a lot of compliments on her dress. My girlfriend left a little early at around 10:00 (but the wedding was still going on). Suddenly I get confronted by my mom and and different female family members demanding to know why she wore such an extravagant, unconventional dress to the wedding and how my sister was furious and how my girlfriend was attention seeking. I thought this was a bit ridiculous and I thought they were exaggerating but I later find out that my sister actually was really angry and she felt my girlfriend was trying to overshadow her and that so many people were staring at my girlfriend and asking about her dress when they should have been focusing on her and how I'm always trying to be rebellious. Now she like literally hates my girlfriend. It's been almost  2 weeks and she's still angry about this. My mom thinks I should get my GF to apologize to the my sister which I kinda think i dumb. I don't feel she did anything wrong.  But I can't help but feel guilty because she did run the dress by me and I didn't bother to ask my sister if it was okay knowing how particular and obsessive she can be and now it's causing all this family drama.  I honestly didn't really think the dress was that extravagant. Maybe a little unusual but I honestly don't get the big deal.

254,Not the A-hole,"I'm 26M, my sister is 28F. We're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.

To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

I'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.

Was I the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

I didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

And I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return.",4692,21222,0.88

I took a bite into the burrito and all I tasted was rice. Okay, I did ask for extra rice so that could be on me right? Took another bite, still rice. I thought maybe I was just biting the wrong places. So I went to a little bit to the side and took a bite but this time it was just lettuce! 

At this point I just figured it was because it was the beginning of the burrito but nope, I took a few 
more bites and each time only tasted one ingredient at a time. 

I opened it up and I saw that all of the ingredients were just in individual piles in the tortilla. So imagine one part is all lettuce, next to it is a big ass chunk of rice, then a huge dollop of sour cream, all the meat in one part, etc. 

Nothing was mixed together. It‚Äôs like they took the tortilla and put a scoop of each ingredient side by side instead of on top of each other. 

There was nothing wrong with my bfs bowl or his brothers tacos. I was visibly upset at how poorly they put it together. I mean there are tons of places like this where I live and I‚Äôve never had a burrito so weirdly made. Even at chain restaurants like Chipotle or Qdoba. 

I don‚Äôt think I was rude about it but I just told the first employee I reached in line that I‚Äôd like my burrito to be remade. I showed him how it looked and he apologized and got his manager. His manager was annoyed and said I should probably wait in line next time so I can see how my food is being made. Like what? I have to watch to make sure I‚Äôm getting the quality that should already be there? 

I told him it‚Äôs not my job to make sure a mobile order is made correctly, it‚Äôs theirs. I either want a refund or my burrito remade correctly. I‚Äôll watch this time. 

So they remade it the same way I ordered it except this time they did it right (ingredients stacked on top of each other). It was way better ofc, and that was the end of it. 

I don‚Äôt blame the employees necessarily because they were all mostly teens or college students like me. And the place just opened a few days ago. I understand mistakes can be made but the manager was an asshole IMO. Plus the restaurant I‚Äôm working it is about to have its grand opening in a few days so I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll make mistakes too. But the way my burrito was made just seemed very careless and it irritated me. 

My bfs brother said I didn‚Äôt have to snap back at the manager and could‚Äôve just asked again nicely. Do you guys agree?  Btw we payed for our own food.",33,87,0.9
267,Not the A-hole,"I feel like I am in crazy town. I went to the store with my BIL Jose and my sister Gretchen.

I have warned Jose about the cashiers at this gas station several times, but he insists on doing things his way. The female cashier Monika works every evening and *always asks for ID* even if you come in all the time. It doesn't matter if you know her, talk to her daily, she will ask for an ID every time, scan it. I don't mind, but it's annoying because the other cashier \[male\] remembers everyone and you just buy your shit and leave. But I get why she does it.

She is also the kind of person to just tell you bluntly what is wrong. Last time I went in with Jose, he did not have his ID. I told him without the ID the cashier \[Monika\] is not going to let us buy it. I told him to wait outside if he didn't have his ID, but he said he had ""been here a few times before, so she will know me."" Monika did not remember him, even when he mentioned something they ""chatted about"" last time.

He kept getting upset and saying, ""How do you not remember me?""

Monika said: ""Because I don't. I see 150 people a day.""

Jose: ""That's not how you should be doing your job.""

Monika: ""We are hiring if you need hours. The door *says ID if you are under 30.* If you come in all the time, then you would know to bring your ID. I ask every time.""

Jose: ""I am 27!""

Monika: *The door says if you are under 30, you will be asked for an ID. You are under thirty, why don't you have your ID?*

Jose thinks he needs to call about Monika. I don't think he does. I think he is being an asshole about a store policy that is listed on the door.

Edit: He has complained about her for a few days and wants to call, because she has ""an attitude."" I don't think she has an attitude, I just think she is sick of idiots. And I always have my ID, so I am not sure why he specifically leaves it in the car or at home when he knows we are getting gas.",184,851,0.96

I co signed for my son to get a car last year before the baby was born. For the first 3 months he made the payments including the insurance payment (which was out agreement) until he injured himself and was off work for 3 months during the 3 months he was off I made the insurance payments and 1 car payment and I worked out a deferral for the other 2 months so when he went back to work he could start paying again, he made a few more payments late and partial payments with a couple in full. He then lost his job (because he constantly called off work) I got him another deferral for 2 months and he still did not have a job or attempt to make a payment. I also found out that he was driving while high and while drinking. He also never paid his tags so they are also expired. I decided enough was enough and I got someone to take over the payments. The day I was leaving with the car to turn over to the other person (who happens to be my ex/his father) he came out and tried to give me a payment. I refused it and turned the car over. Now he and his girlfriend will not speak to me other than the texts she sent to me telling me how horrible I am and how they are moving out and they want nothing to do with me or our family.

270,No A-holes here,"My brother in law is in his mid-50‚Äôs, and is getting married for the third time to someone who is also on marriage #3 (?). Definitely not her first marriage, either. 

BIL has invited us to a destination wedding, 3000 miles away for us (and a good 1500 miles away for all guests except the bride‚Äôs parents). There are multiple events across four days (social gathering, bachelor/ette party, day-after-party, etc). 

My husband is his only (younger) brother, and his family is not super involved in anyone. Likewise, BIL has never been really involved or close with us‚Äî he rarely talks to my kids, has only come to visit once in a decade, etc. Everyone sorta keeps to themselves, it‚Äôs not that everyone is close. My husband and BIL were very close as kids, though. We live very far away from his brother.

We didn‚Äôt attend Destination Wedding #2 a few years back because of finances and we had three babies. Now our kids are school age, easier to travel with them, but it‚Äôs still a financial load that I would rather not spend. I am a freelancer and do not have any paid time off of work. No work, no pay.

I really don‚Äôt want to go. Between the flight, pet sitter, and loss of wages, it‚Äôs adding up a LOT. I would have to miss at least 2 days of work. I also don‚Äôt think we should drain our vacation savings for this event. The location isn‚Äôt that special. It‚Äôs not a place you would necessarily want to visit in winter, so I am less than excited by the location. They chose the destination because that‚Äôs where her family lives, and her parents are elderly and don‚Äôt travel (?). Not sure. But I think it‚Äôs a big waste of money and a stupid show for this BIL. It‚Äôs not his first rodeo, he‚Äôs not young. BIL has already announced that ‚Äúyour presence is our gift,‚Äù but shit, my presence comes with a cost!

I suggested my husband and kids go without me, if it‚Äôs important for my husband to be there. He sorta thinks my absence would be an obvious snub and would cause an ‚Äúunspoken tension.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs a big fucking waste of money, and I feel resentful that we are spending thousands on this, when we (1) don‚Äôt have extra money to throwaway, (2) our savings could be allocated in more important ways, and (3) this purchase will guarantee we will not have a family vacation in the next few years. My husband feels like BIL is expecting us, and so we have to go. And if I stay home, I Am the Asshole. And a meta layer, if I don‚Äôt go, I think my spouse will be mad at me. He‚Äôs already a little mad at me that I have these feelings about it, and not just thrilled to witness this union.

272,Asshole,"Ok so me (f25) and my fiance (m24) are getting married next year and like many people our age we are pretty grossed out by the wedding industry and are trying to keep our wedding as cheap as possible.
So for example we are having the ceremony and reception at my uncle‚Äôs farm (free of charge) out in the country, my good friend from college who owns a catering business agreed to do our catering for free as a wedding gift, and my fianc√©‚Äôs good friends with a band that will play at our wedding for free also as a wedding gift. We got my dress and his suit from Goodwill and got them altered. Everything said and done we will be paying less than $2k for our wedding. 

Now we get to the alcohol. We‚Äôre having a semi-big wedding (150 people - we have a ton of friends and family coming from all over) and the idea of paying for all of that booze is making us stressed out. It‚Äôd be at least $1k. We thought about it and decided to do a cash bar. We figured we could buy the booze and pay one of my cousins to be bartender for the night, and we realized we could probably recoup some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for drinks - win-win! We were set on this idea until I brought it up with one of my bridesmaids and she flipped out and said that would be incredibly tacky.

I was sort of taken aback by this. I‚Äôve looked online and cash bars at weddings are pretty common. it seems ridiculous to pay to get everyone drunk. My other friends and family seem pretty split and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is actually a faux pas. Am I the asshole?",2102,5546,0.89
273,Not the A-hole,"I met a girl in a class and we very quickly became best friends. She didn't have much of a friend group of her own since she just got back from studying abroad, so she joined in on mine pretty quickly. She was the type of person to want to be close with everyone and have as many friends as she could, she would ask my friends to hang out one on one without me pretty quickly into the friendship, which felt a little weird but honestly didn't really bother me much, as she would always tell me about it after and just seemed excited to be connecting with people again. I have a boyfriend who lives about an hour and a half away from me and due to different schedules we see each-other every or every other weekend, sometimes longer between. 

She asked me for his number so that she could text him to try to make coffee plans with him next time he was in town so she could get to know him more one on one. My issue was that since he lived far away this would take away from the time that i got to spend with him. I felt this was a little weird and so i explained to her that since i don't get to see him everyday (or even once a week most times) that i didn't feel like she needed to have his number or be hanging out with him one on one and that she could get lunch or something with us next weekend when he came to visit me. All was fine, she said she totally understood why i felt that way and we moved on.

Didn't think about this again until a month or so later- i was hanging out with my boyfriend and he casually said that my friend had texted him. I asked him how he had her number and he said that about a month ago she had DMed him on insta because she had a good idea for a birthday gift he could get me. Okay, totally fine. What i had an issue with is that she DMed him asking for his number so that she could text him the gift idea, and then proceeded to randomly text him here and there (nothing too often or suspicious) about other things as well.

So i texted her about it. I wasn't at all trying to start anything i just stated something along the lines of ""hey, I just found out that you asked my boyfriend for his number and am just a little hurt that you would go behind my back when i had explain earlier why i don't feel like you need it. I'm not mad and no hard feelings at all, just wanted to explain how it made me feel!'. She got super defensive and kept saying that i was being dramatic and that she did it for me because she wanted me to get a good birthday present, and that she was just trying to be a good friend. At that point it did escalate a bit and we argue texted back and forth, i didn't reply after a while and we never talked again after that. She was a pretty selfish friend (was always late or would cancel plans after they were suppose to start, or just forget about them) so i didn't make a point to reach out and mend things after that, which part of me feels like i should have.

278,Asshole,"Please bear with me while I try to gather my thoughts and explain just what‚Äôs going on. I (M40)was married to my wife (F38) for 18 years. We had what I thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great, and she was my best friend. We had two sons together, J who is 14 and M who is 16. 

My wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. I feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

Here is the hard part. Two nights ago I decided to go through my wife‚Äôs cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken I never got sent. That‚Äôs when I found the messages after I decided to look through her browser history. 

Messages to men in their 60‚Äôs sending dirty photos she had sent me. Nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. I don‚Äôt want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but I cannot believe she could have done this to me. I suspected nothing. Ever. 

My sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. How much they miss her love and honesty. I cannot see her as the woman I thought I knew and I am torn on what to do. On one hand, I don‚Äôt want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand I feel they are old enough to know the truth. 

WIBTA if I exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing to our family? Please help me.

This post didn‚Äôt come from malicious intent to hurt my children, and I apologize if it came out that way. I asked because I truly don‚Äôt know. I feel that I would have wanted to know who my mother was fully but I can see why so many disagree. 
This is something that I will keep to myself for now- and if my children ever inquire further that‚Äôs something I will deal with along the way.

280,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because reasons.

I‚Äôve started doing a new commute for a new job. I prefer to spend my commute listening to music or podcasts and drinking my coffee. It‚Äôs also the rare 30 minutes in a day that I am generally guaranteed uninterrupted time by myself. I look forward to it! I‚Äôm kind of introverted and my job involves dealing with people all day.

Over the past week I‚Äôve been running into an acquaintance of my partner at the terminal. They‚Äôre a nice enough guy and I don‚Äôt dislike them, but conversation with them has always been awkward, and I‚Äôm just not down for that with someone I barely know first thing in the morning. I‚Äôve done my best to be friendly, but I always feel like I‚Äôm the one carrying the conversation with them and trying to steer it in different directions.

They‚Äôre quite negative about most things too. They're forever complaining about things going on in our community, or the price of a cup of coffee for example. They also never really ask about what‚Äôs going on in my life, instead just continuing to talk about theirs. We don‚Äôt have much in common outside of knowing my partner, so this isn‚Äôt someone that I would be friends with.

A few days ago they found me in the terminal and tapped me on the shoulder. It had been a few days in a row of this and I was just really not in the mood. I fibbed and told them that I was listening to something for work and wasn‚Äôt really down to chat. They seemed cool with that and said that they couldn‚Äôt see me and not say hi. I felt bad about lying, but I just really wanted my time that morning, and most mornings if I‚Äôm being honest. I find the days that we have ended up talking I arrive at work flustered and not at all mentally prepared to tackle my tasks and training for the day.

I‚Äôm kind of bothered by the fact that he‚Äôs always approaching me to talk but seems to have nothing to say. Not to be all I have my headphones on, I want to be left alone ‚Ä¶ but I have my headphones on, I want to be left alone. If he were a good friend that would be one thing, but this isn‚Äôt someone that I really know outside the few times my partner and I have run into him.

I mentioned it to my partner who basically said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you,‚Äù for not wanting to talk to this dude in the morning.

I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is, WIBTA if talked to this dude and let him know that I‚Äôm not really interested in chatting in the morning if we see one another? (Although figuring out how to do that tactfully without hurting his feelings is another matter entirely.) There are a myriad of reasons why, but I think the big thing is that I really just want that time in the morning to myself. When I type it out it seems like such a jerk thing to say to someone, but I‚Äôve been finding I‚Äôm dreading my commute in the morning lately. I even considered taking a method that takes me longer to get to work, but I don‚Äôt feel like I should have to do that.

One I will never reunite with is my biological brother (26M). We never got on, far past average sibling rivalry. I have no qualms with my decision to block him from my life. 

My job means I am on my phone a lot for business and my business email and number are on LinkedIn. My brother went into this and then spammed both my work email and number with abusive threatening messages. 

This at its base is hurtful, but the emails came from his work address which is, at best, unprofessional. One of my colleagues is an ex colleague of his and knows his bosses and HR emails for the company. They are encouraging me to let them know about this behaviour. 

I want this all to stop but I don‚Äôt know if this will write off any reunion chance with members I would still talk to in the future (my family have a history of taking sides). 

If I report it AITA in the situation or is he still in the wrong.

EDIT: I‚Äôve realised I‚Äôve missed an important factor. The company he works for is a subsidiary of my own. It‚Äôs not massively well known as my company owns about 40% of our industry. 

I know the obvious answer is to block his email, but as it is technically internal this would red flag to my manager (this was confirmed by him when discussing blocking ex colleagues emails so we don‚Äôt get failed to deliver emails when sending mass emails). 

If I block him my boss will lose it when he finds out and definitely report this (he was present when I received a threatening text on my personal number and proceeded to order a taxi for my ten minutes walk home because I was frightened) and the police were made aware at this point but won‚Äôt do anything unless he explicitly threatens violence. 

This means my choices are; take the abuse and just deal with it or report it (either directly or through my manager).

283,Not the A-hole,"Our sitter keeps letting our puppy out of his crate and doesn‚Äôt supervise him. He has accidents and then she doesn‚Äôt clean them up. 

Three years ago when I (36f) went back to work after having kids we were looking for a sitter to come to our house to watch our kids. We had recently had to put our dog down and mentioned to everyone we interviewed that we would eventually be getting a dog again, but not for a few years because our hands were already full with two young kids. 

When we mentioned this to the woman (she‚Äôs 58 now) we eventually hired she went on about how much she loved dogs, had one herself and didn‚Äôt think a home was complete without one. Great!

We‚Äôd been open about our timeline in getting a dog because our kids had been begging for one, and we were open with our kids that we would be getting one this last summer, but not before. Our sitter would take the kids to her house sometimes to visit with her dog and she would talk to the kids about her dog too. 

Fast forward to this spring when we started looking for a dog. We told her and she responded very strongly that she would not be looking after a dog. Her job was to look after the kids alone. 

We agreed that she wouldn‚Äôt look after the dog, that the dog would be crated while she was at the house and we would hire a dog walker. She agrees to this, especially as both kids would be at school all day and she would only be helping with care after school. 

But quickly after the dog arrives she starts letting him out of his crate unsupervised. He‚Äôs still a puppy and has accidents. She does not clean up these accidents and leaves them for us. 

The breaking point came two days ago when the dog pooped in the living room and then she stepped in it and tracked poop everywhere. She told us about the accident but not the extent of it. It was a literal bleep show in our living room and took forever to clean up. 

We sent her an email that night saying that we didn‚Äôt expect her to walk, train or house break the dog but if the dog has an accident while she‚Äôs there and is out of the crate, could she please do a quick minimal clean (eg: sop up the pee or remove the ‚Äúbulk‚Äù of the poop) of the mess and let us know so we can scrub/mop later. 

Her response was that she didn‚Äôt agree to us getting the dog in the first place and her job was to look after THE KIDS ALONE (emphasis her‚Äôs). She was very short and snippy with my husband and I in person. We sent her an email saying that to accommodate her the puppy can stay in his crate, but if she lets him out we need her to do the minimal clean up if he has an accident while she‚Äôs on duty. 

Her response has been to threaten to quit. 

My kids love this sitter and they love their dog, which they‚Äôve had for four months now. AITA for asking her to clean up the mess the dog makes when she lets him out of his crate unsupervised?

EDIT: We have a dog walker that comes twice a day for exercise sessions. Either my husband and I do the morning walk. The dog is not crated when we get home at 5. At 6:30 we go for a family walk. On days where he seems a bit pent up one of us will take him to throw the ball around once the kids are asleep. He is not crated for 8 hours a day.",96,171,0.91

 When I was around 18 I turned the oven onto 200 Celsius for a nice frozen pizza and left the room while waiting for the oven to warm up. When I came back the kitchen was smoggy and a distinct plastic burning smell was coming from the oven. When I opened up the oven there was a stapler sitting there with all of the plastic melting off it and burning off the floor of the oven.

286,No A-holes here,"My fianc√© and I (gay men) are getting married next month in Austin, TX. Obviously Texas isn‚Äôt the most gay-friendly state, but Austin is super progressive and inclusive. My mom decided we needed a wedding planner to handle the contracts, plan the decoration process, and coordinate the day-of. The woman she hired says she has run plenty of same-sex weddings before and is comfortable doing ours. When I met her I was a little concerned as she‚Äôs an early 50s typical Texas mom but it seemed fine.

Over the course of planning there have just been a series of minor hiccups regarding inclusiveness, and it really wasn‚Äôt a big deal for awhile but over time it has irked me more and more. Here‚Äôs a list of examples:

* Every time we talk about the wedding party she says Bridesmaids and Groomsmen, when we‚Äôve only referred to them as ‚Äúthe wedding party‚Äù or ‚Äúgroomspeople‚Äù. 

* When talking about our families she‚Äôll often say ‚Äúparents of the bride and parents of the groom‚Äù

* She sent us a form to complete and return to her regarding ceremony preferences, and all over it is reference to ‚ÄúBride, bridal party, bridesmaids‚Äù etc

I know it sounds like I‚Äôm getting worked up over nothing because these things are so minor. But I also feel like a wedding planner, in a progressive city, should be on top of this kind of thing. Like not even having forms ready for man-man or woman-woman couples? Or bothering to edit the one form you do have before sending? 

I just keep running into this everywhere I go in planning the wedding and it‚Äôs irritating. I‚Äôm always having to scratch out ‚ÄúBride:‚Äù on various forms, gently correcting vendors to ‚Äúhe‚Äù when mentioning my fianc√©, asking vendors in advance if they work with same-sex couples, etc. It‚Äôs exhausting, and getting it over and over from the planner just feels bad.

So I was thinking of mentioning in my review (3 or 4 stars, depending on how the day goes) of saying something like ‚ÄúThis company doesn‚Äôt feel entirely experienced in handling same sex weddings because...‚Äù And it‚Äôs mostly so other same sex couples can know in advance what to expect if they choose this planner.

During our trip to the first mountain, I had altitude sickness that had me more or less seated at a corner with my father while my mother brought my 2 brothers(14 and 11) outside and played. I was so sick that I couldn't really remember anything else other than praying for us to leave. My head was hurting bad and my vision was blurred, my body was limp and I even thought I may just black out and die. 


On the day before the trip to the second mountain, I told my parents that I didn't want to go as high altitude made me sick and asked to stay in the hotel while they go and have fun. They said they couldn't leave me by myself as I am a minor, and my mother could not separate with my father as she cannot speak English, basically asked me to go and put up with it, it's just for another day.


As a result I threw a temper at my family, telling them they could either leave me alone in the hotel or stay with me, I am not going anywhere with a high altitude. I couldn't believe they'd rather have me to suffer for them to enjoy their trip. In the end we stayed in while the rest of the tour group go. My parents were angry at me because the money paid for the activities there were wasted. My brothers were mad at me too as they were looking forward to it.


Months after the holiday and my family would sometimes still bring this up, saying what a waste to not have been there up the mountain.

295,Everyone Sucks,"I \[32M\] have two younger sisters Sarah \[25\] and Abby \[27\] and they have asked everyone in our family to stop purchasing plastic straws and use reusable straws. They purchased steel straws for everyone and gave them out as gifts. I think there are much bigger problems that contribute to environmental degradation, but I went along with it with the mindset of ""reducing some waste is better than not reducing at all"". We had a family BBQ at which my parents bought plastic straws for the guests. The straws weren't really necessary as people can just drink from the plastic cups which were also purchased. I thought it was a little funny that my parents were using these metal straws while everyone had plastic cups and plastic straws. When Sarah saw this, she took my mom to the side and lectured her on purchasing so much plastic straws. My mom was visibly upset that this couldn't wait until the BBQ was over. I also saw that day my sisters using the plastic cups while glass ones from my parent's house were available. I thought Sarah was being highly hypocritical and called her out on it once all the guests had left. When I mentioned that I saw her using plastic cups, she blamed my mom for purchasing them in the first place and it didn't matter since they were already bought. This upset me since shes kicking my mom while shes already down and that she was being so hypocritical. So I called her out on upgrading her iPhone this year when she had upgraded last year and I said to her that her understanding of environmentalism was akin to that of a teenager following a trend. Upon hearing that she collected all the steel straws that she had bought for us and threw them in the trash saying that we don't deserve her gift and that we can kill the earth if we want to. I saw my mom taking the straws out of the trash and accused her of enabling my sister's bad behavior and I called Sarah some mean things to her including that she is a ""child"" and she was ""dumb as a rock"".

297,Not the A-hole,"This is a low-stakes encounter I had recently, and I'm not sure I did the right thing. I'm in the US.

I was driving on a 4-lane road with a middle turn lane, approaching a stoplight. I moved into the turn lane to turn left, and the light was green but not a green arrow, so I had to yield. Already I could see some vehicular fuckery was happening in the opposite lanes. The furtherest lane to my left was almost completely full, but the lane next to it was open. Opposite me there were two cars both going straight, one in either lane. The car in the furthest lane managed to squeeze through the intersection and fit in the full lane, but now no other cars could get through. The other car was facing the open lane. I'll call him Yellow Beetle. Yellow Beetle starts inching best he can toward his other lane, without going through the intersection. He clearly wants to be in the full lane, but doesn't have his turn signal on and right now he's still in his lane with about 20% of his bumper in the other lane. AT this point, seeing he can't get through, he's stopped and sees me waiting to turn.

[**Here is a state-of-the-art artistic rendering**](https://imgur.com/a/ToN0j0p)

Here's where I'm the potential asshole. Yellow Beetle begins waving me through to go. I don't move. I'm in a very low & short car and behind me is a truck that can clearly see over my head. Truck Driver starts inching up to my bumper and honking. I refuse to go until Yellow Beetle goes through the intersection (which he never does) and the light turns red. I wait until the next green, which is an arrow, and clearly still pissed Truck Driver is riding my ass the whole way. 

My logic is that just because Yellow Beetle was waving me through doesn't mean I have the legal right of way - he still does. If I went through and he started going through at the same time, I would be at fault for the accident.

298,Not the A-hole,"I want to start this by saying I'm not religious, or overly superstitious or anything like that, but I was raised by a superstitious grandmother and I believe that there is just some stuff you shouldn't fuck about with. This (fairly short) list consists of fairy rings, Ouija boards, and any kind of ritual that requires a name. I have made these views clear to my boyfriend before now.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 18 months, moved in together 6 months ago. He's between jobs right now, so I'm covering the rent, but we're both on the lease. 3 months ago he met up with his childhood friend, who just moved locally and is apparently really into the occult, which is a relatively new development. In the last 3 months he and his friend have seen each other every week or every couple weeks, and it feels like every time he goes to see his friend he will come back with something weird: a voodoo doll, a book, a candle with weird carvings and, yesterday, a Ouija board.

The reason I was raised by my grandmother is that when I was 7 my parents died in a car crash. My boyfriend and his friend were in the living room today with his brand new Ouija board and he said ""hey, babe, what are your parents names again?"" I asked him why he wanted to know and instead of answering he asked me to come sit with both of them and held out his hand. It was at this point I realised he was planning on using the board to contact my parents. I told him to leave me and my parents out of his bullshit.

Later, after the friend left, he asked why I got so ""weird"" earlier. I said that he needed to take all his occult stuff, and keep it at the friend's place. If this is what interests him then I'm not going to stop him from doing it, but do it somewhere else. He asked if he could still do it here while I was at work, and I said ""no, I don't want it in the flat"". He then got mad, called me crazy and superstitious, and told me that I couldn't tell him what to do.

AITA?

Edit: It's everywhere in the flat. We have 3 rooms - the kitchen/living room combo, the bathroom and the bedroom - and there is weird shit in the bedroom and kitchen/living room. The board has been stored underneath the coffee table, there's a voodoo doll sat next to the TV, the weird candle is on our shared dresser. There's other stuff he bought, and I'm not entirely sure what most of it is, but it's in a kitchen cupboard and it's definitely not food.

Edit 2: This is not a religion to him, he describes it as a ""hobby"". I can get past all the occult stuff. He's into it now, he wants to keep and use all that stuff, sure, whatever, but I've said that I don't want him to involve me in it. He took me to a psychic a little while ago and now he's trying to summon my dead parents via Ouija board, whether he thought any of this would actually work or not, it's too far.",437,872,0.94

304,Not the A-hole,"I live in a boarding house with four parking slots. Maybe 5-6 tenants have cars. As far as I know the rule has always been first come first serve. I've had to park a few streets away sometimes, no biggie.

The fourth slot is not really a parking slot. It's in the gap between two slots, with a post near the wall, so only small cars can fit. One of the tenants drives a microcar, a little red Wigo, that fits there perfectly. Good for her. She's never had to compete with the rest of us for parking.

Anyway our landlord had his garage repaired, so I came home today to find his giant pickup in one of the parking slots. It's so large that he parked it diagonally, taking up 1 1/2 slots. So I parked diagonally next to him as well, cutting off the little space in front of the post that's usually occupied by the Wigo.

Later that night, the neighboring tenant knocked on my door. She's in her late 50s, lives alone, has no children.

So she asks me if the sedan outside is mine. I say yes, and she tells me I have to move it so she can park. She also mentions that she's been driving for over an hour and is exhausted.

Me: Isn't it first come first serve for parking here?

Neighbor: Listen, like I told you, I'm very tired. Please just fix how you parked so I can park in my spot.

Me: What do you mean fix it? The landlord's pickup is in the way.

N: Well, what am I supposed to do? I've always parked there. Don't you just park somewhere else when the other slots are full?

Me: Yeah, there's a good spot in the next street, by the blue gate, no one ever cares if you park there. [I prepare to close door]

She puts up her hand to keep me from closing the door! I am shookt.

N: I can't park there. The pickup took your spot but that doesn't mean you can take mine.

Me: ...it's not yours.

N: I've always parked there.

Well we go around in circles for a bit longer. You can imagine how it goes.

Out of sheer aggravation I went out to try and adjust how I parked, just to see if I could slide in closer to the pickup and leave enough space for her to squeeze in. No dice. So I told her sorry it ain't happening, and she got angry and said she'd tell the landlord, and I said go ahead fam now park somewhere else and leave me alone.

My friend said my neighbor was wrong in how she approached me, but because she was old and alone and would feel less safe and have more trouble walking, I should have just given her the spot. My friend said I would have probably done just that if my neighbor hadn't been so aggravating, and that by refusing to move I let my anger get the better of me. So... AITA? Should I just move next time? The landlord's pickup will be there for at least a few more days.

TLDR: Older neighbor asked me to give up my parking slot for her, I refused.

Edit: I am also a woman, late 20s. I live with my sister who's out of town. I've shown her the replies so far and she says I didn't have to give up my spot but I should have been nicer to our neighbor and offered to go with her to speak to our landlord tomorrow.

Edit2: thanks so much for all the input. Just to clarify...
--I'm not guessing her age (good thing because I'm extremely bad at that). I was told. When my sister and I first moved in, we asked if we'd have to worry about loud/rowdy tenants, and this neighbor in particular was described as just that.

I can give a million reasons for why I don't want to do it, but the main one is that I feel like if people come over to my home that they can cope with not being online for that time. This only applies to phones, and literally everyone I have around does have both regular calls, messaging, and data plans for their phones, so it's not keeping people from contacting them in case of emergency or otherwise.

If someone needed to use a computer or game system while over, I would be happy to enter the password for them.

The reason I want to know if I'm TA here is because one of my friends has gone on a couple of rants lately on how weird it is that I don't give people the password.

Most recently, at a party i hosted (about 8 people), one guest made a passing comment about having some connection issues with specifically f-book on her phone. THEY did not ask for the wifi, but the previously mentioned friend turned it into a big spectacle about how I don't give out the internet password. Another guest offered the use of his phone hotspot (he has unlimited data, not sure if that matters) just to diffuse the situation because it was clear that I was getting upset.

313,Asshole,"I am a doctor and my husband is an accountant. Our daughter Lily is 18 and wants to be a doctor like mumma, and is working on her university application, but I don't think medicine is a good fit for her. 

Let me start by saying I'm not saying this because I don't think she could achieve it. She absolutely could. She is studying A levels in biology, chemistry and history, and is top of the class in the first two and near the top in the third. She has always been a bright kid and we are very proud of her. 

That said, although she has the aptitude for it, I don't think it would be a good fit for her personality wise. She is, unfortunately, very lazy and her intellect is very much natural talent. She does not revise at all. Her routine on schoolnights is to come home, and immediately get changed and go out to smoke weed with her friends, and going to sleep as soon as she gets home. She doesn't make much of an effort in school and has a bit of a truancy problem. 

We and her teachers were convinced that this was because the work was too easy and she wasn't being challenged, but when she completed work tasks early they trialled giving her more advanced university-level material and relevant tasks, but even that failed to stimulate her once she learned the material and was able to complete the tasks. Husband and I agree that the problem isn't that she isn't being challenged, but that she is hedonistic and enjoys her easy life. That's great, but medicine isn't a career which requires only intellect. It requires a lot of hours, dedication and sacrifice, and since Lily is too used to simply using her talents to coast by I'm worried it will hit her hard when she starts working. 

Also, while I'm sure we've all met a nasty doctor or nurse in the past, generally the health field is one which you need a good deal of empathy and care for others to thrive in. Lily can be lovely, but she also has a mean streak. A few years back we got calls from the school a few times about Lily getting into trouble for bullying. Nothing extremely serious, but serious enough that the school felt the need to inform us which they don't do for minor issues.

I've been in the industry long enough to know that the young ones who try to bring that ''popular kid'' mentality onto the hospital floor either crash and burn after not too long or go on to inflict serious damage to their patients and colleagues. I don't want either of those outcomes happening to my daughter. 

Lately I've been trying to convince Lily to change her mind. With her talents, she could do really well in something like research, but she is adamant on becoming a doctor. Yesterday we had a discussion about it which turned to an argument, and she ended up crying in my husband's arms saying I don't believe she's good enough to be a doctor, which isn't true at all.

316,Asshole,"one of my classes in school is called 'Skills For the Future.' We don't have assigned seats, but we have been sitting in specific groups for about 3 weeks now. A group of 5 (including me) people were sitting together. We were planning on working on a project together too. 

Basically, a girl i have had problems with in the past sat in the seat of one of our teammates. Though we dont have assigned seats, we have been sitting in the same 'formation' for once again, 3 weeks. The other person who was supposed to sit there is also in our group. However, this girl just sat in her seat and I didn't have the courage to ask her to move. (She's the teachers favourite, friends with my best friends and i eat LUNCH with her.) Our whole sitting plan was messed up, and the original person had to stand the whole lesson to be able to work with us.

The bad part that annoyed me is that the girl wasn't even working in our group, just sitting on our table, even though she and her teammate had been sitting at another place that was not taken that day for the last, once again, 3 weeks. She isn't in our group and has never tried to join it.

317,Asshole,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker here. 

So I‚Äôm currently 7 months pregnant and hopefully the baby will be here around Christmas time. I‚Äôm taking 4 months of maternity leave and my husband got 8 weeks paternities leave and 2 more weeks of just PTO. I‚Äôm originally from Malaysia and live in the US with my husband (my husband is from here). Since all my family is still in Malaysia and my husband side of family is nonexistent (long story) we decided to go to Malaysia when the baby is 8 weeks old so I have help with the baby (first time clueless mom here). My parents are gonna be here for 6 weeks only from the time when I give birth. 

Since my husband has never stepped foot outside of the US, and we don‚Äôt know the next time we can go to Asia again, I was planning to go just with him to other SE asian countries (Singapore and Bali) for a week and leaving our baby with my parents before my husband goes back to the states. My parents and I have great relationships and I honestly still feel like I‚Äôm babied by them. I trust them fully to take care of our baby (I mean they took care of me how can I not trust them). This only happens if the baby is perfectly healthy. I‚Äôm too afraid to take my baby for extended travel cause the baby can be too tired or not comfortable. Not too mention it‚Äôs super hot down there. 

I told my other preggers mom friends about this  plan and they said I‚Äôm an asshole heartless mom for leaving my 2 months old with my parents for a week. I feel a little bit selfish too but kinda justified.

319,Not the A-hole,"I decided to go out to eat at a somewhat nice restuarant. Not like McDonalds but not a suit and tie type place.

We get seated and it's just us and one other family there.

After about 30 minutes of not being served, I got impatient and finally, a waitress comes up.

""What would you like today,"" She asks.

I recited my order and my gf ordered and she said something like I'll be right with you. It took 25 minutes to get our order and there were multiple errors.

I called her over to fix it and it took another 15 minutes. I finally ate my meal. Now, I was a waiter but this service doesn't deserve a tip.

I explained this to her and she understood but my gf got a little mad and said it wasn't her fault, it was the chef's and she's taking the punishment.

Still I didn't tip her.

So AITA for not tipping my waitress?

320,Everyone Sucks,"I was born on a Res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. In my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. It's just how they do it. 

I have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot of joy.

Anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though, she asked me where I got them and if the person has an ""Etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

Now... personally I have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). It's just not done. 

I told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me ""Well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

I got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to HR about me being racially discriminating.

AITA? 

My reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",976,15079,0.79
321,Not the A-hole,"Me and my family currently stays together in a (supposedly large) apartment. My family consists of me [16F], my mum [50+F] + my 2 brothers [12M & 10M]. I'm still schooling and currently don't have a part time job. My school is Monday to Friday from 7.30am to 6pm, and I'd get home at 7pm too, hence between studying and schooling, I can't hold down a part time job. One of my brothers also has autism. My mum is unemployed. 

Some background info: My mum and my dad has been fighting for a few years already. My mum recently chased my dad out of the house, whereas they had been living separately in different rooms before. Since then, dad's been out of contact, he ignores court summons from my mum to pay bills for me and my brothers. The last text/contact I had with him was in March, where he promised to take me out for dinner, but of course, he didn't. My mum's been trying to squeeze out any cash she can get from dad, and the battles really bitter. My dad had told the judge that he basically doesn't give a shit about us. He sort of works as a freelancer, and is able to earn at least 10k per month. During his best year, he managed to earn upwards of 1 million. The thing is that dad's lazy. He doesn't want to work, all he wants to do is just enjoy life on the back of his motorcycle. My mum asked the judge to get at least 5k per month from him, but he claimed that he doesn't earn much, and due to him 'freelancing', he has no tax returns or anything. He just got ordered to pay 2k per month, and even then, he doesn't pay for it/refuses to pay from it. Basically, due to this, we're just living off mum's savings.

Relatives from my dad's side doesn't even care too. My grandmother is supportive of her son, no matter what shit decisions he makes. My aunt is just indifferent. On my mum's side, she has managed to sour off all ties to the rest of our relatives, and cut us off them. Basically, now, we hate them and they hate us. Therefore, the only 'family' I can call is just my mum and my 2 brothers.

Back to the point. Since we have basically no income at all, and despite the judge ordering my dad to pay for the monthly mortgage bills - of course he didn't - we now owe the realtor around 40k. My mum's been wanting to rent out the house to outsiders for 3.9k per month. The way she calculates it, she'd be able to pay 2k to the realtor this way. She's planning on renting dad's room out for 2.6k and she's going to get a roommate for me for 1.3k. The thing is, as a teenager I really value my privacy. I like to be able to just get up at 3am or come home at 11pm. I like my 2am alarms as well as having a safe quiet space where I just have my own thoughts. My mum wouldn't budge on this issue of getting a roommate. She has told me that if I stick to my usual habits of 3am alarms and whatnot, she'd kick me out of the house and not the roommate. I really can't be budged on this issue of wanting a room all to myself. 

Keeping in mind my family's monetary issues, AITA?

edit: I'm from Singapore and mum's trying to rent the room out to rich students (16-college age) from other countries looking to make use of our educational system, mum acts as their guardian and hence they're willing to fork out 1.3k.

edit 2: mum's gonna rent out dad's room to 2 students so 2.6k is guaranteed. I am fine with this. I'm just not fine with a student in my room. The way I see it 2.6k for the 2 students is enough for us already, but my mum doesn't seem to think so.",169,190,0.91
322,Everyone Sucks,"Ok so I know it doesn‚Äôt sound great and I can already sense the people telling me this story sounds fake, I know how it looks, but I‚Äôm honestly really upset about this whole thing and just want a bit of clarity. My boyfriend helped me write this and we‚Äôll be reading the comments together.

So my boyfriend ‚ÄúBen‚Äù has an amazing job. I can‚Äôt get into much detail as I don‚Äôt want anyone guessing who he is or what he does but part of it requires him to appear in YouTube videos every few weeks or so on his company‚Äôs channel. He‚Äôs not famous or anything like that but the channel grew in popularity throughout the last few years and people have increasingly started to recognize him when we‚Äôre out. I don‚Äôt really mind, most people just want to have a quick chat or show their support, not really any pics or anything. 

We went out to eat at this new restaurant we wanted to try and sat on the patio, right by the barrier. As we were waiting for our food, this girl (20-something) walking by recognized him and started FREAKING OUT as if he was an actual celebrity or something. He was a bit taken aback since she was being super loud and he‚Äôs not used to having fans, like at all. Everyone was staring at us, but I thought it was kinda funny and offered to take a picture. Afterwards though, SHE WOULDNT LEAVE. We‚Äôre talking like 25-30 mins of her pretending I don‚Äôt exist and trying to make small talk/explicitly flirting with my boyfriend. She was also visibly filming the whole thing too (pointing the camera at us then on herself, so I saw that was recording) Our food even got to our table and we weren‚Äôt sure what to do. I eventually just said something like ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm sorry but this is a special night out for us and we‚Äôd like to eat our dinner alone if that‚Äôs ok!‚Äù Which she ignored and kept hovering over our table. My boyfriend reiterated the same thing and she just sighed and walked away. 

She came back 10 mins later, still filming, and started talking as if nothing happened. I told her to stop filming us as it was uncomfortable and she pretended to not hear me, again. So I (aggressively, I‚Äôll admit it) grabbed her phone, deleted the vids, threw it back at her and screamed at her she was embarrassing herself trying to pick up MY boyfriend and needed to leave us alone. She started crying, said sorry, and left. 

‚ÄúBen‚Äù is telling me that I was a huge ass because she obviously seemed to have some sort of difficulty assessing social cues/situations, but to me it just looked like she was an entitled brat that wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. AITA here??

331,Asshole,"I was a daily weed smoker between the ages of 16-20. I quit for my own reasons. It was always a solitary activity for me. When I found myself spending less time alone, I had less time to smoke and the small amount of time to myself I did have became too valuable to spend smoking. So quitting was a natural, unconscious step. 



A few years later, I meet a girl. We're from very different backgrounds. She's a medical professional who has strong anti-drug opinions.

I've always had opinions that not all drugs are bad, just some people use drugs badly. And that cannabis is not in the same ballpark as what People think of with drugs. 


We spend a few years together. Life changes. We move in together. Get a place in a new town, change jobs and build a life together.

This obviously upsets my lady alot. As from her point if view, I've just picked up this illegal habit from nowhere after years of only seeing me sober.

332,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a long-term relationship and it has gradually shifted towards me paying for all of the bills of the household for both of us. I keep pushing for my partner to contribute to bills, even though I make significantly more than she does. She has pushed back due to the difference in our incomes.

Before any gold digger comments pop up, this is an income I started making AFTER we had dated for some time. She is not that type of person.

In terms of income, I make about $7,500/month after taxes and she makes about $1,500/month.

Our bills together come out to about $2,500 - $3,000 per month (we live near a high cost major city). In recent months I've been pushing for her to contribute $300/month of her income towards our household expenses.

She takes jobs that offer about 20-30 hours a week and works for a few months, gets bored, then hops to another job. I want her to be happy and I know she is exploring things she may want to get further into, so I don't make too much fuss about it. She is also trying to save for a Real Estate training program she wants to do, but has done several other programs for different careers and dropped out.

In terms of housework, we split everything equally. We take turns with dishes, laundry, etc.

I'm not sure if I'm an asshole for pushing for her to pay $300/month when I make so much more than she does. After paying the bills, I still have $5,000/month leftover (mostly saved towards a house down payment) which is still triple her total income.

For me, it's not so much about the money but moreso feeling like she is also helping to contribute in some way. At the same time, I feel like an ass when there is such a huge gap in our income.

The people on this trip are all people I've hardly talked to. Even though I know I have friends at home, it's quite lonely to walk around by myself while other people are chatting in their groups of friends.

That said, there is someone on this trip who I've talked to a few times, and who's pretty nice to me. I usually gravitate towards her when we have to get in in groups. She has her own group of friends on this trip.

I usually walk with their group, but I'm pretty sure they don't like me. Im quite quiet, but when I try to add to a conversation they either all stop talking or ignore me. I don't know if I've done something to make them dislike me or if they just don't like me as a person, or if they just think I'm intruding (though they seem to be fine with other people chiming in but not me??)

It makes me feel pretty horrible, but I know that if I go back to being all by myself I'll feel worse. The issue is I dont know if I'm being an asshole for trying to join in with them, even if I don't say anything, since they clearly don't like my presence.

Before work this morning I had to go to doctor's office to pick up a referral paper. There wasn't anyone there except for a man who looked kind of lost and acted weird.

I thought he might be drunk or homeless, since I don't live in the best neighborhood and there's a lot of these people around bus and train stations, stores, buses etc. Normally I don't like interacting with them.

So I put in my earphones to pretend I wasn't seeing or hearing him. He still came over and started saying something, but even when I removed my earphones I couldn't understand his sentences. It sounded like he was slurring and speaking very unclearly.

Basically I didn't realize he was deaf until he pointed to the cochlear implant on his ear. That's why he couldn't speak very well.

I felt really bad because I was giving him the silent treatment assuming he was one of those ""crazy"" people when he just wanted to ask about the doctor's working hours. We sort of found a way to understand each other, he understood me better than vice-versa though.

While he was living with me, I bought him some things to practice producing songs. All of those things costed me about $1.5k.

I told him I didn't want to because I was the one who spent money on all these items, and that's also going against he said.

I don't know if I'm the jerk for thinking the way I do, but I personally think he needs to understand how much more gratifying it is to be able to buy these things himself and also, I bought those things for him because I thought he would be a good person to me but he wasn't.

Now, I have a short attention span and tend to procrastinate a lot, usually it doesn't matter because I'm a fast worker.

So it's a day before it is supposed to be handed in and I've barely started. She tells me to write down the hypothesis becuase she didn't make one before the experiment like she said she would. I was a bit annoyed because I didn't make one either, she should've done it. I said that I would, I would just have to write one like I didn't know the results. 

So it's about 8 pm and she texts me. She is furrious that I haven't started yet. I honestly forgot so I became super apologetic. I started writing and was done at about midnight.

Now to current times, I am currently a babysitter and so Wed-sunday I leave the house to babysit. Usually I am gone for only 4 hours, but sometimes I am gone for 6-8 hours a day. My boyfriend works a night shift and comes home at 7 AM. I usually get chores done in the mornings before I have to go and babysit, however there are some times when I will ask him to switch the laundry to the dryer before he sleeps, or to pick up his dirty dishes and put them in the sink before he goes to bed. Many times I have come home and he has not done anything I have asked him to do, which was not even that much.

Now this past week, I have been horribly sick. I've even had to go to the ER and get labs done. I've been out since Sunday and today I am just getting back on my feet after taking my medicine. During this whole time, he did not do the dishes, he did not do the laundry, he didn't scoop the cat litter... nothing. So, I got mad at him. I told him that while I was sick, he should have at least kept the house in order a little bit because now I had to spend 2 hours on cleaning the house and doing chores. I love my boyfriend, and he was worried about me being this sick, but sometimes he frustrates me. When I am sick like this, nothing ever gets done and it frustrates me so much... But idk if I am the asshole or what. Ugh.

TL;DR:  AITA for being mad at my boyfriend for not helping keep the house in order while I was sick?",28,37,0.85

347,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 16F dating a guy the same age as me. We've been together over a year and ¬Ω and we're pretty open to each other. No secrets, and we share our thoughts and opinions honestly (not harshly, of course). But recently his hygiene has been bugging me a lot recently. I haven't found it in myself to tell him, but I feel like I should. It's not too much to ask him to take care of himself, right? I feel like it'll hurt his feelings somehow, so I'm not sure how to really ask him. 

For context: I am 5 ft. He is 6 ft, 2 inches. When I hug him, (and we hug a lot) I get a face full of B.O. He uses deodorant before school, but he doesnt re-apply after he lifts weights (which is his first class). He only uses cologne on ""special occasions"" and his hair gets super oily. He says he washes his hair every night but I personally believe he doesn't. He has plaque disease and a tooth decaying disease, and that causes him to have bad cavities, bad breath, and he will eventually need to get his teeth replaced. I don't blame him for that, but honestly his habits probably don't help. He also is very hairy. I don't mind, but he does get a unibrow and I have to beg him to shave it. He wears sweats every single day (I don't mind this one as much. He's been having growth spurts a lot recently and it's hard to find a pair of jeans that fit him properly). 

These things wouldn't bother me as much if he wasn't able to take care of himself, but he's fully capable and has the means to do so. Am I just being too picky?

Edit: The main reason I feel bad about asking is because he didn't have a man in his life to tell him how to take care of his developing body (his father was deployed the majority of his childhood, and was gone when he began puberty. He only lived with his mother and sister at the time, and I don't think they really explained personal heigine to him).

350,Asshole,"To give a little background info, I‚Äôm a grad student living at an apartment complex that is aimed at college students but not affiliated with my college. It‚Äôs not the nicest place, but it‚Äôs cheap, furnished, and includes all utilities. WiFi is included, but you have to have your own router. The only real issue is that the complex doesn‚Äôt do one-bedroom units, and since I didn‚Äôt have anyone to room with, I was randomly assigned a roommate. This original roommate didn‚Äôt show. 

Because I was the only person living in the apartment when I moved in, I bought the cheapest model of router at the store, assuming that I would be the only one using it. It‚Äôs a little slow, and the range isn‚Äôt great, but it works fine for me. It‚Äôs set up in my bedroom. 

Eventually, the apartment complex sent someone else to live in the other bedroom. When she moved in, the internet was actually down (service provider issue), and it took several weeks to get it back up. Once it was fixed, my new roommate asked me how to get on the internet, and I told her she would need to get a router. She asked if she could use mine, but I explained that it wasn‚Äôt a powerful model and that she should really get one for her own room. A few days later, she comes back and asks for my WiFi password because she went to someone else‚Äôs apartment and their router was in one bedroom and she could use it in the other bedroom. I told her no and shut my door. 

I admit that I could have been more patient, but one of my biggest pet peeves is when people ask me a question and completely ignore my answer. It‚Äôs the second time she‚Äôs done it in a week. Besides that, I‚Äôve never been great at sharing. I like to buy my own stuff and be the only person that uses it. 

That being said, I bought the router, but we‚Äôre both paying for WiFi. Am I the asshole because I won‚Äôt let her use my router?",130,260,0.91

353,Asshole,"So, my sister is 19 years older then me. I'm 19 (MALE) and she is currently 38. Growing up, I had no older brother to look up to. I feel like that is a relationship that my sister's boyfriend filled for all of my childhood. My sister dated this guy for close to 13 years. He was even at the hospital the day I was born. We did so many things together....baseball games, vacations, movies, everything. He was a major reason I was such a happy kid. When I was 11, he finally proposed to my sister. I had a brother-in-law. He took me out for our ""child-friendly"" bachelor party. Him, me, and all the groomsman spent the entire night at Dave and Busters. I will never forget the fun I had that night. (A week later they all flew to Vegas for their fun)

Shortly after getting married, things in my sister's marriage took a turn for the worse. Looking back, I'm not sure how I didn't grab the concept that they were splitting up, but It took me a while. He stopped coming around, I stopped doing things with him, and I would also ask my sister, where is he? Looking back I feel horrible for pestering her about why he wasn't coming around anymore, mainly because she was dealing with the divorce that I had no idea was happening.

All of the sudden, my best friend and brother were gone. I became a very lonely kid. It had come apparent that my sister and him had separated and he began seeing another woman before their divorce was official. There's details that I don't feel comfortable saying on Reddit, but my sister did some things that were very unfair to him during their marriage, so I believe they are BOTH at fault for their marriage failing.

Almost 10 years later, I'm going to be 20 years old in just a few weeks. I have never heard from or seen him again. Mainly because my family cut ties with him directly. They really despise him. I don't know why, but last night I did some research and he lives 15 minutes from my apartment. I was in utter shock. He's 40 years old now, married again and from what I found, doing well for himself.

Now here is my question. Would I be the asshole for reaching out to him and trying to catch up? My friends are telling me I'd be betraying my sister for what he did to her. I know for a fact my dad would lose his mind if he found out I tried to contact him. But deep down, a part of me still misses him. He was ripped from my life without a second notice. I never got to see my best friend again. I wan't to just say hi and talk to him about how the last 10 years have been for both of us. I wonder sometimes if he ever thinks of me or if he'd even recognize me if he saw me today. I have his phone number, but I'm contemplating reaching out to him. I don't want to upset my family if this somehow comes out. I don't want to betray my sister either.

Would I be the asshole if I tried to reach out to my sister's ex husband?

354,Not the A-hole,"I went out to dinner with three friends, of which the other two know another (their primary/first language) in addition to English, which everyone at the table is able to speak. I (unfortunately?) only know English. Periodically the others launch into a conversation in their primary language - and I don't mean like 1-2 phrase exchanges, I mean several minutes in length, while I sit there and they talk about whatever is they're talking about.

Afterward, I expressed to one of my friends that I thought it was kind of rude to go off into a conversation in a language not everyone at the table spoke, and that it essentially ostracizes anyone (me) who doesn't know the language for the duration of the conversation. He disagrees, saying it's easier for them to express themselves in their native tongue, so that's why they did it. While I don't doubt that it's easier to speak in their native language, my point of contention is that it leaves out anyone else who doesn't speak it. He saw no problem with it at all, even when I asked how he'd feel if the roles were reversed.

362,Everyone Sucks,"So for a bit of context I live in a dorm where I share the single room with two other people, roommate 1 and roommate 2. RM1 and I were roommates last year and she's honestly never here anyway, but when she is, she's quiet and sticks to her own space. RM2 is the new roommate (I prefer triple rooms because of the space) and they're a bit odd. They don't seem to have too many friends, which I understand can happen and make you really uncomfortable around other people. From what I gather, they're just kind of shy, but a well-adjusted individual. The problem is that they didn't seem to understand boundaries. A bunch of stuff happened where I had to step in and say ""please don't sit/let your boyfriend sit on my bed just because it's across from my TV. It makes me very uncomfortable."" and ""You're free to use/borrow my stuff if you ask."" I want to clarify I told them, again, they needed to ask me to use my stuff (other than the TV because I don't use it very often when I have classes on the same day).

They mostly respected that. Mostly. I have an ottoman by my bed that I store things inside of. I also use it as a night stand bc I have the lower bunk. (the room has two lofted beds with one lower bunk, RM2 has the bunk above me and RM I has the loft.) I put my wrist/arm braces on it in the morning, along with my keys/clothes/whatever. Every day, I would come in, find all my crap moved to my bed and the top of the ottoman was empty. Okay fine, RM2 probably was using it as a seat, I thought. I'd leave and come back and it would be the same situation. Every day, 2-4 times I would have to move all my junk back to where it what so that my bed was clear so I can nap when I can.

Eventually I figured out RM2 was using it as a table for their laptop/sketchbook. The room comes with perfectly good desks and chairs, and they even brought their own butterfly chair (which they have not sat in once and had had a box full of snacks sitting on it since the start of the semester). Eventually I got really annoyed after having to keep moving my shit when I had a cold and really didn't want to deal with it anymore. I intentionally left a bunch of tissues I had blown my nose in the night before on top of the ottoman, in plain view, hoping that they would get the message and be like, ""ew gross, it's contaminated."" I come in from classes, and it's all moved!! They literally shoved the tissues between the bedframe and the ottoman. So I kept doing it until I got better.

Well, now RM2 is sick and has been sick for like 3 weeks, and I feel really bad. They're constantly sleeping and coughing, I've been letting them have my cold meds (OTC), but I keep accidentally waking them up bc I can't ever tell that they're in the room. They're slowly getting better, and they've stopped touching my stuff, so I think they learned their lesson, but I feel rly bad for getting them sick. AITA?",27,88,0.94

364,Not the A-hole,"My family is ineligible for need based financial aid and my parents are completely unwilling to cosign loans. However, since they value education a lot, my parents have a college budget. When I went to school, they told me the money I could use was just enough to cover 4 years in an in-state public school. There were some conditions attached (major in something with high ROI, don't take any non-major related employment during the school year, GPA and milestone requirements, etc.).  I know I'm extremely lucky my parents paid for college, especially since a lot of my peers are struggling with college debt.

I turned down admission from (arguably) the best school in the country for my major because it was out of budget; the rest of the schools I was admitted to that were in budget were of a similar caliber so I picked the one that gave me the most scholarships. It was an OOS flagship that wasn't too bad but was nowhere close to being my first choice. My parents told me any money I did not use in the budget during college could be used for further education.

I (20, graduating from college this year) went home recently and found my brother (17, high school junior) making a college list. A lot of the colleges on the list were expensive, private schools. I brought up whether the family could afford any of this because some of the colleges were pretty selective and have a policy of not giving any merit aid. My parents had told him they could afford to pay for 4 years of any school. I was a bit surprised since as far as I know, my parents aren't doing significantly better financially than they were a few years ago. So, I asked them about it.

They told me since I chose a cheaper school and was graduating early, they could afford to give my brother almost 3 times the amount they had initially promised me. Essentially, the budgets for college were not per kid; when I was a high school junior, the number they gave me was half the amount they had saved for us both up to that point.

I asked them what would happen if I wanted to attend graduate school later (part of the reason I chose the cheaper school I attend was to keep the option for grad school open). They said since I had already accepted a job for after graduation, either my company or I could pay for graduate school later. Going to graduate school after I already had a high-paying job in my field would be odd and they would have only paid if  I went to graduate school right after undergrad.

I do love my brother and want him to get the best education he can. However, I feel like it's pretty unfair that I don't see any of the advantages of choosing a cheaper school and pushing myself hard while in college; my brother does and he may be able to attend the dream school I had to turn down.

She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her.

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.

I'm an in-law and have no sway but I think she should have some fun spending a nice chunk any way she wants and then live on the pension. To hell with anyone else. She has financially carried the inherotor for some time and frankly I think the family expects him to die soon as well after which they would share the money.

375,Not the A-hole,"Quick context rundown: I am a digital artist (I get paid to draw people‚Äôs characters.) Up until three weeks ago, it was my only source of income. Three weeks ago I got a full time job. (8-4:30 on weekdays). My boyfriend has had a full time job (9-3 Mon-Saturday, with Thursdays off sometimes as well). 

We had a routine where I would work on my art during the day while he was at work, and then when he got home he‚Äôd game and maybe stream. (He recently picked it up as a hobby, and likes to do long streams. Once he starts gaming he wants to go for a while.) That changed when I got my job. Now, we have to sort of switch off who gets to use the pc when. (We only have the one.) 

Issue/conflict: Since I started my job, I‚Äôve been too exhausted/drained to work on art (thankfully I have understanding clients), so he‚Äôs had the run of the computer (minus some quality time with me.) I go to bed earlier than him now too, so he‚Äôs also got that time. 

Yesterday, I used the PC and finished a couple pieces for one of my clients. The client approved the final pieces today, so I would like to post them and get the full images to my client who has already been waiting a while. This takes about maybe 15 minutes max. He gets home around 3:30. I get home around 5-5:30. 

I messaged him and asked if he‚Äôd be willing to either wait to stream until after I‚Äôd used the pc and posted my finished pieces, or take a little break during the stream to let me post. That way he could have the rest of the time to stream and not worry about me needing the PC.

He didn‚Äôt respond well to this. He doesn‚Äôt want to do either. He wants me to wait until he‚Äôs done streaming (which is long after I‚Äôve gone to bed usually.) He wasn‚Äôt rude about it per se, but his response did seem irritated and made me feel like I‚Äôm being unreasonable.

So. That‚Äôs my story. AITA here?",44,29,0.86
376,Not the A-hole,"Husband and I have an 18 year old daughter and 15 year old son. Both the loveliest kids you can ask for, but recently I've been trying to avoid them spending too much time with hubby's parents and their overly traditional views.

My daughter is a very bright girl. She is studying her A Levels and her grades are fantastic. She has always worked really hard at school and has spent countless hours revising. We aren't very pushy however, and while we do make her study we know that she should also be able to spend time with her friends and have fun which she does. She initially hoped to go to ''Oxbridge'' (won't say which one) to study economics, and everyone believes she could get the grades needed. However, she admitted to us that at the very last minute she decided not to submit her application, since she isn't 100% sure it's what she wants to do. She told us that she has been looking into an apprenticeship in animal care when she has finished her A Levels. Once qualified she will be able to work in a dog sanctuary, and she's always loved dogs and animals in general. We are fully supportive. Far as I'm aware there's no shortage of work in that field so that's a plus, and she should do something she enjoys. However, when I told my husband's mum (herself an oxbridge graduate) over the phone, she wasn't happy and demanded to speak to her granddaughter to ''talk some sense into her''. She didn't understand why daughter would turn down ''the opportunity of a lifetime'' to do ''hard, dirty labour''. I told her daughter was out to avoid drama. 

As for my son, he is a very sensitive boy. He would cry if someone played a prank on him even up to the age of 11-12. He isn't very competitive in anything whether academic or anything else. For years my husband's dad tried to get him into something like Rugby or Football, which he was never interested in. He does enjoy keeping fit with things like running and weight lifting but never in a competitive way. He's quite into things like Harry Potter and Dr Who etc. Granddad is strongly convinced that he is gay, and when he got his first girlfriend accused him of lying and making it up. When he told him that he had started lifting weights in the gym, Granddad said he shouldn't bother because ''there's not a drop of testosterone in you''. 

I've voiced my concerns to my husband but he insists his parents don't mean anything by the things that they say. I disagree and I don't like the way they behave towards my children. Husband said it would be unfair to ban them from seeing them, but I think it's the best thing to do.",54,204,0.96

378,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, on an alt account since my wife browses reddit occasionally. 

My wife just called me saying that her brother will be losing his housing in 10 days or less. He has a disorder similar to schizophrenia and bipolar where he hears voices talking to him telling him to do things, and he goes through swings where he goes from calm to shouting and cursing at people. He is living in an apartment community sponsored by a state program that helps people living with mental illness and recovering substance abuse issues. It's a public apartment complex, they just rent out a few of the units at a lower price to people in this program. 

We found out that he is being kicked out because he was yelling abusive language at families in a near by dog park while potentially on drugs.

My wife hasn't asked if he can live with us yet, but I am fairly certain that she will. I don't want him to live with us for 3 reasons: 

1. Only her and my name are on the lease. We're allowed short term guests but not long term guests/roommates, although it is kind of grey where that line is. 
2. He has been kicked out of his last 2 places because of being on drugs yelling at people. I like our home and our neighbors and I don't want to get a bad name in our neighborhood, or even potentially not being able to renew our lease, putting us in a difficult housing situation. 
3. Everywhere he's been stuff has gone ""missing"". TV's, phones, art supplies, you name it. It seems like anything we buy him lasts a month or two then goes ""missing"". Having experiencing a similar situation in my family I can't help but wonder if he is selling his possessions to buy drugs. I don't want to have to worry about locking up our things in our own home or having them go missing because he will be there all day, every day.

That being said, my partner has made some decisions in the past that I feel put his job in risk for silly stuff.  It usually ends with a somewhat heated discussion where I'm told that it's his job to manage but my concerns are expressed.

Suddenly, today, my partner has decided to give his work provided cell phone to a Pokemon Go friend of his so they can catch some shiny Lollapaloozas or whatever for some event he can't attend. We both work in IT so security is always a concern for our jobs and I just lost it. This is not a mutual friend that we know. Just some guy who he catches pokemon with occasionally and they've become friends for about 5 or 6 months now. I've never met him.

I feel like this is a huge risk to our finances over a stupid digital thing since I know his company would not want a company provided phone with access to company resources given to a non employee. In turn, this has really shaken my trust in his judgement.

I had the window open that faces his house. I saw him walk out and fix a few things on his property. I go back to doing what I was doing. I hear a scraping noise, like someone was shoveling something. Curious, I look out my window and I see a squirrel airborne and land on my front lawn in the mulch area. I've been a homeowner for just under 2 years now, I'm pretty sure you're NOT supposed to toss a dead squirrel onto someone else's property.

My brother is married and lives with his wife, and 4 children. They are all young girls (between 4 - 15). They both work full time and get a lot of financial help already.

Now, they absolutely suck with money management. They are in debt, but the insist of having expensive phone contracts, contracts on watches, buying tech out of magazines with crazy interest rates, expensive clothes, constantly dining out, smoking, alcohol, booked a trip to Disney that they are paying off.  This is just some of the things, I'm sure I'm missing stuff out. 

I've had a major falling out with my brother before because I told him he needs to stop taking advantage of my Dad. My Dad is soft as shit and keeps bailing him out and lending him money, but even he is frustrated.  

My brother text me this evening and said they have 30 pence on the electric meter and don't have any money until Thursday. This is NOT the first time they have asked for money for gas and electric. Several times this has happened and I've given them the money. But, they always say ""Can I borrow ¬£20 and I'll pay you back in 2 days"", so I'm like, sure, no worries. But they never pay me back. 4 weeks go by without a mention of my money. It's only ¬£20, but I absolutely hate having to ask them to pay me back. It's a matter of principle for me, if you say you're going to pay me back on X, pay me back on X!

This time I decided to make up some excuse and say I can't lend them the money. I'm sorry but you're two 30 year old adults with children and you can't budget for electricity? I feel sorry for the kids, I have guilt, hence me posting this. But at some point I feel they need to take some accountability for their reckless spending.

384,Not the A-hole,"Hi folks, I understand my actions were inflammatory but I feel some time of way about this situation. 

So I 21M went on a tinder date with this really awesome dude. We had an amazing night and everything spoke to him having a great time. Cue me getting really hopeful about dating him yadda yadda yadda. We went back to my place and watched a movie and started getting intimate. Before we went any farther than making out, I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested in a one night stand and that if he wasn‚Äôt interested in going out again, it‚Äôd be best if he left. 

He said he was having a great time and  ‚Äúprobably‚Äù wants to go out again. I asked what that meant and he said ‚Äúoh I mean, yeah I do. I dunno why I said probably‚Äù. 

Anyways we slept together. 

The next day I drive him home and he says he‚Äôll see me soon schedules permitting. I follow up a couple days later to no response. Then again a couple more days later. 

He responds with this long message about how he likes me but isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. I was kinda pissed but whatever, I was civil and thanked him for the date and wished him well. 

The next week my friend (a girl, the dude is bi) goes on a date with him off tinder unbeknownst to me. She tells me about it the next day and I tell her my story and how, based on what I saw and how I felt, that he wasn‚Äôt a great guy. 

She let him know that I told her that and ended things. 

The next day, I get a string of messages from him cursing me for interfering, how he thinks she‚Äôs the one, how I ruined their shot at a relation because of jealousy etc.

My wife and I haven‚Äôt been much help, and this sub taught me that my jokes about vegans were harming Sarah.

Additionally, because Sarah‚Äôs birthday is coming up in November, my wife and I told the kids that we‚Äôd drive all the way up to Mall of America, spend the night at a hotel, and let Sarah get whatever she wanted from the mall up to a $500 limit. 

Sarah thanked us and accepted our apology. My boys accepted the veggie burger night with some mild grumbling, but they were stunned to silence when I announced our birthday plans for Sarah and confronted my wife and I later that evening.

Luke: Mom, Dad, for my birthday, you only got me a Nintendo Switch, and for Scott‚Äôs birthday in July you got him AirPods and a Steam gift card. Both of those gifts are less than $500.

Scott: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to give Sarah special treatment because she chose to be a vegan.

My wife: Come on boys, these past few months have been hard on Sarah, and we all need to try to make her feel appreciated. She‚Äôs your sister.

Luke: We can be nice to her without spending lots of money on her and showing favoritism.

Me: If Sarah we‚Äôre here she would say that we were showing favoritism to you and Scott.

My wife: You may not understand why your father and I have made this decision, but we‚Äôre the adults here, we make the money and we choose how to spend it so we get the final say. 

Scott: Oh my god, you guys are so stupid. You‚Äôre punishing us because we‚Äôre normal. We have done nothing wrong. 

Luke and Scott continue to be unhappy with our decision. Sarah continues to be fine with it and my wife and I are sticking to our guns on this issue.

390,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married, my future husband and I are paying for everything ourselves including bridesmaid/groomsman and our parents' outfits. I am having my sister, his sister and my best friend as bridesmaids and he is having 2 of his childhood friends and his brother as groomsmen.

I went to a dress appointment a couple of days ago. Future sister in law couldn't make it but I brought my mum, my future mother-in-law (MIL), my sister and my best friend. Mum, MIL, and Sis completely took over the appointment. I found a dress I loved and they said it was ""hideous"" and told me to not even bother trying it on, then they started picking out dresses that were for my (married) sister to try on. At one point I came out in a dress they chose together and they weren't there, at which point my best friend told me that they had gone off to pick out their dresses.

I gave up at that point, and said I would sort the dresses another day. After we left Sis, mum and MIL started telling me what dresses they wanted to have, and showing me pictures online that are all totally different from the idea I told them I was going in with.

I have a day off tomorrow. None of the others are free, not even my best friend. It would be very easy for me to just go and try on the dress I loved. I messaged my best friend and she said I should go, try it on, and I could send her pictures if I wanted a second opinion. She then suggested that as I have everyone's measurements and preferences, if I had time while I was there I might as well pick out their dresses, too.

I wouldn't get anything anyone hated, I'd just get stuff I know they'd wear that would make everyone look good but make sure it doesn't break the rules I set for the bridesmaid and mothers dresses. I'd be paying for everything out of mine and my fiance's joint wedding fund, and I can get approval on the dresses from my best friend, but once everything is paid for I would pretty much be dictating what everyone else is wearing to the wedding.

WIBTA (or bridezilla)?

(my fiance approves of this plan and says that if I want MIL to go along with my plans I will have to pretty much force her into it, which is what this would be)

&#x200B;

INFO:  At my appointment my sister picked out a dark green floor length gown with a sweetheart neckline for herself and both mothers picked out gold dresses. My best friend has said if I send her pictures she can help me pick but she can't be there in person. 

I had 3 rules going in: stick to the budget, no blue (my dress is blue) and no train (for practical reasons). The dresses they picked at the appointment all fit in with these rules.

I knew going in that as all 3 bridesmaids have different body types, they could not wear the exact same dress, so my goal there was that they at least look similar (different style of dress but in the same colour or same style of dress in different colours). 

I'm thinking get the mothers the gold dresses they were looking at and the bridesmaids in dark green. I'd also be willing to postpone until my best friend and future sister in law could be there, in which case I'd get the dress my sister was looking at for her and get my best friend and sister in law to pick out their own, without my sister being there.",101,460,0.95

My Wife and I have been together for 6 years. I agreed to move 2hrs away to be with her family to not have to uproot her 2 kids. Recently her extended family started to relocate 17hrs south to a more populated, warmer location. We took a vacation there with her parents to visit her family. When her parents started looking for houses in that area, Wife panicked and started trying to convince me to move too. She landed an interview for a promotion for her dream job within our company, and finally convinced me to ""A new start"" in this area. She landed the job, I got a transfer, and we're renting her aunt's 2br condo while looking for a house.

Some back story

My Wife has 2 boys from her previous marriage 13 & 19. It was an ugly divorce and the boys learned to manipulate their parents against each other to get what they want. These boys have never really had discipline or any responsibilities Mom would come home after work to throw away their snack wrappers.

I also come from a blended family, was that spoiled child, but as an adult realize My Step-Dad made me a better person by showing me responsibility, discipline, and Love. I have tried to do the same for my step-kids especially because I will never have kids of my own, these ARE my kids.

So I tried to parent my new sons at the time 9 & 14yr old. I got involved with school activities, cooked them meals, helped with hw, set up game nights with friends, but gave them responsibilities and discipline. They respected me for it, but there was a lot of ups and downs with all of the changes, as expected. The oldest, Steve has self-esteem issues and always gravitates towards the wrong crowds. In middle school his friends were in and out of juvie. He gets away from them gets a job at 17, only to find a new group of bad influences. He has a run in with police after contributing to a minor and she gets alcohol poisoning, Starts skipping Vocational classes, using drugs, and was rumored to dealing. Steve turned 18 before graduating, Wife said we couldn't tell him what to do anymore. He forced us to buy new dishes because he would hide dirty dishes in his computer desk, and Lied about having them. But when we had to go to truancy meeting, Wife grounded him from his car. He flipped out said we're too overbearing and petty, and moved out to stay with friends.

Flash Forward

He miraculously somehow graduates, moves in with his Dad, Loses 2 jobs after working for a week 

each. Basically been unemployed all summer. When my Wife convinced me to move I told her I would not go if Steve is going too, Im not going to support him if he doesnt to work. She agreed he was not coming. Then while looking at houses, I correct her every time she mentions rooms for the boys, and say no just Sean. Finally when we find our dream home, I flat out ask ""Do you plan on Steve moving in?"" she said yes, ""I said then I do not want to buy this house."" She instantly got mad, said she was blindsided by this, and called me a monster.

My boss is away for 5 weeks so everyone is pulling extra shifts to keep things running smoothly (for reference, I usually work 20hrs and have been working 40+ while he's away). One co-worker (19f) is coming to the end of her semester at uni and is stressing out about all the assignments she has to finish (she has no exams to do though), she has been asking people to cover her shifts so she could study and finish her assignments. I agreed to cover 2 of them, one of them I worked last night and one for late next week. I should add here that I am also coming to the end of my uni semester and have assignments to finish but also 3 exams (plus have a 2yo at home). 

When I agreed to work her shifts it was under the guise that she was using the time off to study etc. Instead of using her time after work to study, she has been coming into work with friends and drinking. Last night when I was working her shift I was shown a video of her out for dinner and getting drunk with friends instead of doing her assignments like she said she was going to. I was pretty pissed tbh, I'm working 9 days straight because I picked up her shifts, and somehow have to find time to fit my study in. 

I called her this morning and told her I'm not working her shift next week because I thought it was unfair that she was using the time to get drunk instead of studying, and that she needed to sort out her priorities. She got really upset and said that I had already told her I would cover it and what was she supposed to now. I told her I would find someone else to cover it for her, but I was not working it. 

I spoke to a few of the other girls at work and one will swap shifts with her so she doesn't have to work it, but she still isn't happy and is calling me an asshole.

Little background: middle child, only girl. I've never been completely sure where I stand with my parents. There are moments I feel loved, and then others (most the time) I feel like the Meg of my family.  A quick example is that my birthday has been forgotten more than once, even though there's only a day between my dads (who's is first) and mine.

&#x200B;

When I was young I vocalized my want to remain unmarried for my life, my mother would give me shit saying I would change my mind. Despite my protests, surprise, she was right. I found the perfect for me guy and got engaged in 2016. I wasn't rushing to the alter because, well, money. I've never had a chance to have a big party for any reason, and won't ever again as I can't have kids and this is a one and done type deal with marriage for me.

&#x200B;

About a 2 years ago, my mother inquired about paying for the wedding because it was taking us so long to get married. I declined, in my mind I was planning on figuring out, saving, and paying for my dream wedding. She wouldn't drop it, and somehow(???) made me feel guilty for rejecting such a heartfelt offer. She also made sure to remind me my grandpa died while I was engaged and my grandma wanted to see us get . So we made a deal that we would both put money into a wedding account to help pay for it. My mom puts it in from her end, and I'll send her money to put into the account.

&#x200B;

Here's where the bitterness has slowly been growing and it gets a bit convoluted. Since the time we made the agreement I've spent 3k+ from my own account because she takes a while to transfer, they've only put $300 in the account total. My parents started a new business within 6 months of the agreement to help pay for the wedding.  My parents have been collecting at least half my paycheck since I was 14 (EDIT: Started at 114 and continued until I moved out,) but my mother regularly drops money into my little brothers bank account so he can buy clothes/go out. He's not made to keep a job like I was (see? I'm a resentful asshole.)

&#x200B;

I would be fine with the situation if I could work, but I can't currently. I was ""laid off"" while on FMLA and am trying to get diagnosed so I can go back to work and be healthy.  But I can't deny that I'm holding a lot of resentment for my parents currently. I'm their only daughter. Why would you offer to even help if you can't? I was fine before the offer, but now I'm feeling stressed about my health and the wedding. I'll never in a million years tell my parents I feel this way, but it doesn't change that I do. And I feel like a total sack of slimy runny baby poo for feeling this way at all.

402,Not the A-hole,"So my wife and I have been married for 12 years and have 2 daughters. We have always had our share of household duties disputes which is usually resolved. 

My wife quit work back in March to ""Focus on schooling and help her dad"" (he was diagnosed with liver cancer I think). Anyway she has only helped her dad out once by taking him to his surgery and after care which was back in April. She goes to school online so it is at her own pace to an extent. 

She has failed or nearly failed every class since quitting (2 or 3 classes) and does little to nothing around the house during the week. 

This all came to a head after this weekend. Our septic line from our house to the ground broke and I spent the better part of sunday underneath my home (trailer not that it's important) in sewage,mud and all other matters of nightmares to fix it. During this time my wife sat in our room watching TV. We needed to get groceries and she waited until I was finished and asked if I would take a shower and come with her to the store which I said no. This became a huge deal because I never help out allegedly. I work 40+ hours a week plus go to school (online) and spend time with my children (usually on Saturdays my kids and I go into town to play Magic the Gathering. 

So I ultimately got so angry about the whole ordeal that I bluntly told her she needs to start doing more around the house otherwise get out. If I am taking care of the kids paying the Bills and cleaning the house by myself I might as well be by myself.

EDIT 1: My wife has depression and anxiety, however I feel in many situations it is simply a fallback for her or rather a cop out. I know that sounds insensitive, but in every instance where she comes up short i.e. grades, promises (I'll go to the store tomorrow etc) nothing. To clarify something her anxiety only seems to be when it is convenient (again I know sounds insensitive). Back in May, we went to Chicago so she could attend a BTS concert. She had little to no problem traversing the crowds or merchandise lines. Yet grocery shopping is an monumental task.


EDIT 2: Although alot of people have alot of different opinions. I believe everyone sucks in my situation. I know I could have handled things alot more respectfully given she is my wife of 12 years and not simply a bummy roommate. I sat down with her last night and apologized for how I said what I said and explained to her how her actions or lack thereof really set me off. She acknowledged that she is not doing her part as the stay-at-home spouse. We are working on developing a list of everything needing done in the house and dividing it up fairly between us and our children. Hopefully things will work out and begin to turn around. I really do love my wife and children and dont want imagine my life without them.

EDIT 3: Resolutions are because discussed between my wife and I but due to the amount of helpful advice I'd like to add some other Information. I also have Depression with suicidal tendencies.  I have attempted suicide multiple times and have been hospitalized twice for it. While I no longer participate in counseling partly due to the lack of consistency on behalf of my local VA (Veterans Administration) so regular appointments were months apart. I have since become somewhat better. I'd rather not use this term for it but it is more bearable as I have found hobbies to get out of the house and around friendly people and spend time with my kids at the same time. For anyone wondering I've invited my wife to join us to go play Magic the Gathering as she knows how to but opts not to. I've made countless attempts to encourage my wife to get help with her issues and have been nothing but supportive of it BECAUSE I too have it and I dont want anyone to feel that way especially the love of my life and mother of my children.",817,4733,0.95

I have a cousin who I strongly dislike. She‚Äôs abandoned her kids for 3 months to do drugs in another state, she‚Äôs stolen from me, and went to jail for assault, among other things that she‚Äôs done to me personally involving my daughter. 

She has a brother who I‚Äôve always been close to. After she got out of jail, she went to live with him and saw the invite. She messaged me on Facebook asking why I didn‚Äôt invite her. 

I told her very honestly that I was having an intimate ceremony with only the people we love most in the world. I still resent her for things she did and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable having her at my wedding. 

My aunt called me later and told me I had made my cousin cry and I should forgive her because she‚Äôs a changed person. The rest of my family agrees, saying a wedding is about family and coming together but I don‚Äôt agree. If I don‚Äôt want someone at my wedding I don‚Äôt have to have them.

Taking kids to PT conferences is a very normal thing here.

My sister struggled with grief of him passing on and guilt from not making any effort to spend time with him whilst he was dying. I dont blame her for that, it would have been nicer for me and mum(also ill) to have a break for a day. Caring full time is difficult when you get abuse 24/7 aswell.

409,Asshole,"My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it‚Äôs stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn‚Äôt Catholic and wouldn‚Äôt like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn‚Äôt know there. He‚Äôd think it‚Äôs way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Raining Men‚Äù played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ‚ÄúHighway to Hell‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnother One Bites the Dust.‚Äù 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play ‚ÄúAnother One Bites the Dust‚Äù at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren‚Äôt very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I‚Äôve been thinking maybe not.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don‚Äôt know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn‚Äôt really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother‚Äô s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we‚Äôre going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

411,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend goes to a modern hipster church. It‚Äôs a very expensive building with no expense spared in the construction and decor. It has a cafe larger than most Starbucks. 

It has a large paid staff and numerous locations. It‚Äôs basically a corporation. They spend 20 minutes out of the hour long sermon asking for money, specifically $500,000 they need to start another church. 

I adjusted my work schedule on Sundays so I can attend, because I know how much it means to her. 

After the last service I was in the lobby waiting for her, and one of the pastors, who I admit, while in stage is very charismatic, was standing near me. 

I decided to introduce myself and he was the rudest, most uninterested person I‚Äôve met in a long time. 

I was so irritated that I did something I‚Äôve never done before. I fired off an email to the church (a different location, under an anonymous email) basically asking why there was so much expensive production, but very little content. Why they need so much overhead and so many paid staff members.

They seem to be asking for money to perpetuate their careers instead of using money to help the underprivileged. 

My girlfriend actually works part time for the church as well, so I‚Äôm nervous she‚Äôll eventual hear about the email and correctly assume it was from me.

So my boyfriend is in the driver's seat ready to go and I'm finishing organizating/putting stuff in the trunk of the car.  I live around the corner from a Safeway but my apartment complex has a parking lot that's not right off the street. Homeless people are hanging around the Safeway all the time.


So this homeless man comes up to me while I'm adjusting things in the car and asks for money. At first I say ""no I'm sorry"" and continue doing what I'm doing.  He doesn't leave and starts really begging me.  This time I say ""sorry dude I don't have anything"".  Except he doesn't leave and he REALLY starts actually begging me.

Sometimes I give homeless people money, but it's not like I make amazing money and sometimes I need what I have.

Around my 16th birthday, there was a little comic convention happening in my state. I was super, super excited to go to this. A friend and I made plans to go together on the second day, my birthday. My older brother (20) and his friends were going for all three days of the convention and were staying in a hotel nearby. My brother was also going to meet a girl (his now girlfriend) that he‚Äôd been long-distance with for a while at the convention.

I showed up on Saturday in my costume, and my friend bailed on me. I didn‚Äôt really have anyone else to hang out with at the convention. I went to go find my brother and his friends. I know my brother thinks I‚Äôm embarrassing, but let me join his group anyway because I was all alone. I knew they were annoyed I was there and I felt really bummed out. 

They all decide to leave the convention and go back to their hotel room. There are like 10 people in this hotel room. My brother and his now-girlfriend get on the bed and start cuddling and making out. Another girl and her boyfriend were making out on the other bed. The other 6 were just watching them, drinking.

I have been friends with F since high school. Ever since college has started, she has constantly accused me of making fun of her. She tends to overthink things a lot and my other friends have noticed that they can't joke around with her anymore because she blows up. Jokes that we used to be able to share are now a heavily sensitive subject for reasons I don't know and have tried to ask her about. This usually ends up in her blowing up and accusing me of talking behind her back. 

The thing that made me upset was when we were all in an empty classroom, a bunch of football players were there (very important because F values their opinion a lot) and other girls that were friends of the football players. She was talking about speaking Spanish, and offering to teach the football players, and I off to the side, made a joke to our friend about how fast she talks and that it would be hard for them to learn. This in turn causes her to 'call me out' in front of everyone.

Now the football players have no idea who I am or even care, and she decides to say, ""Yeah at least I'm better than OP, you guys all know that right? OP doesn't have a social life and I do."" The room got quiet and one of the girls tried to laugh it off by saying, ""yeah but you don't have a life either so chill"" and F says, ""Well compared to OP I do."" I didn't say anything and eventually left because I had class.

This morning she asked if she could borrow some art supplies that I have and I told her that ""my nonexistent social life doesn't allow me to leave my house when I don't have class"" This causes her to blow up and tell me not to start with my shit because I have done her sooooo much worse and she is ""soooooo doooonnnneee with my shit."" I told her how I felt when she called me out in front of everyone. If she had said the same thing to our friend group I wouldn't have minded, because yeah, I focus more on school instead of being social so there's some truth to her words. But what bothered me was that she said it in front of strangers who don't know me, in an effort to make herself look better all while pushing me down in the process. This is what I told her and she told me that I was being over dramatic and that I shouldn't play the victim because I said something so much worse.

Her response to me was basically ""cry me a river blah blah blah it already happened."" I made another joke about it, ""can't, I'm too dehydrated from crying over my ex boyfriend so I'll have to get back to you on that"" and she left me on seen, I'm pretty sure we're not friends anymore.

Last weekend my girlfriend and I were walking down a busy street in our city.  We were walking holding hands and while we were walking some guy takes a picture of my girlfriend. Honestly the guy looked pretty sketchy ( kinda disheveled ). We were walking pretty fast and within 5 seconds we were away from him and we were lost in the crowds.

The conversation went like this:

GF: That was really weird..
Me: Yeah totally
GF: I mean what would prompt a guy to do that
Me: yeah it‚Äôs weird
GF: someone should report him
ME: I mean yeah it‚Äôs weird but nothing we can really do
GF: what?
Me: I mean it‚Äôs not illegal to film people in public
GF: well it should be...

The conversation ended after that and a couple days later my girlfriend tells me how upset and angry she was at me because I wasn‚Äôt very sympathetic. I tried to say I‚Äôm sorry, and I‚Äôll be more mindful of that in the future. But the conversation kept going on:

GF: I mean what if someone was filming our future kids?! What would you do?!
Me: Leave and remove our kids from the situation?
GF: you wouldn‚Äôt go and demand he delete the pictures?
ME: what? No? First off, all I can do is request he delete the photo but he doesn‚Äôt have to. Furthermore, If the guy is actually a threat to me or my kids I‚Äôm not gonna go and start a confrontation with him?

I asked her if she felt unsafe when that guy took her picture. She said yes, and I replied, so wasn‚Äôt it the best course of action to just walk away from him as fast as possible like we did?

427,Not the A-hole,"Second update: so apparently since people are now APPALLED that I‚Äôm having a second wedding and shocked that people want to celebrate with us, here‚Äôs some backstory. My first marriage was at 19 years old, arranged due to my growing up in a cult, and was horrifically abusive. It‚Äôs been a long process of healing to escape it. People have been incredibly supportive and this wedding is something that a lot of our friends have been rooting for since we met. So yeah. People are excited for a second wedding. Frankly, so am I.

Update: we moved forward on the venue and put down the deposit today. We made so many other calls as did members of the bridal party and got a lot of ‚Äúyour date is already booked‚Äù responses. It was a shitty day and a good portion of you did not make it better. I appreciate everyone who gave actual feedback vs. telling me that my wedding will suck without alcohol. We will be doing an after party with interested friends after the ceremony.

Okay I don‚Äôt even know if this belongs here but anywhere else I post this, I‚Äôm gonna get shredded so here goes. 

We‚Äôve had mishap after mishap when it comes to planning, including our original venue being the host to a massive festival the day of our wedding and the person who took our deposit ‚Äúforgot‚Äù about this city wide event when we booked (yes we got our deposit back). We‚Äôve also had family drama, family tragedy (see other posts by me on r/JustNoMIL and r/AITA). 

So now we finally found a venue. Gorgeous, can house the ceremony AND reception, pretty central to all our locations, etc. So we start the booking process. And then we find out IT‚ÄôS DRY. No alcoholic beverages allowed of any kind. 

I love the venue. It‚Äôs gorgeous and it seems so perfect. But I don‚Äôt want people to be angry about it. Wedding shaming groups DESTROY dry weddings. And I‚Äôve always defended them as a valid option for people with a need to abstain. But now that I‚Äôm looking at potentially having one, I‚Äôm near tears with frustration and the possibly irrational that people will leave early or think we‚Äôre cheap. 

What on earth do I do? We‚Äôre eight months out and I‚Äôm running out of time and options.

At first I didnt mind but the more I think about it I can't help but feel a little insulted...I don't mean to sound entitled but I don't feel like I should have to prove my self like some guy who has never done this before with the experience and resume I have.

429,Not the A-hole,"My grandfather died and left me an inheritance, this was a surprise as not only was he not my biological grandfather but he did not believe in inheriting wealth. It's not a huge sum but it's enough that if applied right it could make a big difference down the road. I was trying to figure out a way to use the money to honor his legacy and settled on setting up some education funds for children to go to college.

I have this great neighbor, he is a guy who most people would hesitate to walk up to on the street but he goes out of his way to help me when ever he can. Even going so far as to physically intervene when someone tried to rob my house. He has two kids under 2 years old and I thought it would be a great gesture to give him $10k in the form of a savings for his kids to go to college.

My domestic partner did not react well to this idea and asked why I wouldn't do this for her sister who has a child and is also not in a position to provide financial assistance to her child should he want to attend college.

My reasoning was that my neighbor is a good person who deserves a break because of his actions. Whereas her sister comes from an upper middle class family who paid for her to go to college and chose to have a child with a felon and work as a waitress.

I want the money to have an impact but I do not believe her sister values education, Fox news would feature her as a centerpiece in a story about entitled irresponsible Millenials. 

TLDR: I want to give my neighbor $10k for being an awesome dude but my domestic partner wants me to give it to her butt head of a sister.

I will be looking into UGMA and plan to hold off until Christmas with any significant decisions. I will update this closer to December after I have some uncomfortable conversations.

UPDATE: I spoke with my neighbor and while he said he appreciates the generous offer he declined which makes me want to give it to him more. We talked through a couple of options and he agreed to let me set up a couple of CD's for his kids but asked that they not exceed $500 each.",405,5537,0.96
430,No A-holes here,"A little bit of background. My mom and my stepdad are getting a divorce. This has been going on for two years, and it has not been pleasant. My mom asked if she could store her things from the marital home at my house. I agreed, and her things have been here for a year, I also swap her tires for her now, instead of my stepdad. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when my stepdad sells the marital home. He had two weeks to move all of his stuff, including their hot tub. My mother helped with nothing because "" I haven't lived there in two years, why would I help?"". My stepdad didn't have time to sell the hottub, so he asked if myself and my spouse wanted it. If not, he was going to throw it out, because he just doesn't care anymore. 

My spouse and I agree to have it moved to our house and ask how much. My stepdad replies ""ask your mother, as far as I'm concerned your family and you can have it for free."" A week goes by, the sale finalizes, my mom knows we have the tub, we have made small talk about it. I ask her how much she wants for it, which unleashes a shit storm of crazy. 

She tells me that she is going for the cost of the hottub through her lawyer, as her and my stepdad had agreed to put the tub in storage apparently and sell it from there. I tell her that we can sell it from my house and she doesnt have to do that or I can put it in storage so she can sell it, or she can just give me a price. She replies "" your stepfather is manipulating you into fighting with me, he's just trying to fuck me over. Just you wait until we go to court, I'm bringing Gerry and Steph and they are going to testify that he's been threatening me. You're going to get a free hottub and you should bring popcorn because the show will be so good, the judge is going to ruin him.""

I became upset, told her she was being unreasonable, and that I would talk to her later. We haven't spoken since, and that was a few months ago. Yesterday, she sent me a rather formal text message, asking when I would be home so she could get her winter tires. We picked a time, and this morning a courier showed up to get her tires. A fucking courier. She couldn't call me, or speak to me like her child, or even see me in person. She just treated the whole thing like a business transaction. 

So WIBTA for telling her to get someone to pick up the rest of her stuff? She can't call me, or see me in person, why should I be free storage? If she is going to treat me like a business I might as well behave like one.

435,Not the A-hole,"Curious for judgement on my end because I now have to encounter this woman in my building regularly and want to know if I'm justified in glowering at her or if I should apologize.

My building has shared laundry - 3 washing machines and 3 dryers for 25 units, so sometimes you get screwed and they're all full. No biggie.

Last night I go down and they're all full but one is finished, and two have <3 minutes in them, so I hang out and wait for all of then to finish. No one comes down so I wait a bit more - I've now been down there 10 minutes so it's been at least that long since the first machine was done and a little less for the other two. I'm desperate to finish chores and go to bed so I take out the laundry and put in top of the machines and go about my business.

When I come back down (with 2-4 minutes to spare on my machines, because I try not to make others wait for me or make that awkward decision to move it) the other laundry is gone, not in the dryers - score for me! But as I'm loading into the dryer a woman comes down and asks if I'm the one who moved the laundry. I say yes and ask if there was a problem (thinking maybe I'd left a sock in or something) and she berated me for not being neighbourly by waiting, and says I shouldn't ""rifle through people's things"". Also said she waits hours for people to get their stuff and that's part of living in a shared space.

My view is the exact opposite - to me part of living in a shared space is understanding that these resources are shared, and trying to ensure Im out of there as quickly as possible for the next person.

So reddit, I'm pretty sure she is also the asshole here, but am I? Is it good etiquette to leave the laundry longer than I did?

438,Asshole,"My background (29m)

¬†Whilst at university I worked every weekend and saved. When I finished university I used some of the money to go abroad and travel for 6 months.

When I returned in around 2015¬† I got a job, did a room share for cheap rent, got a second job on weekends (now working 7 days a week) and also did extra jobs fixing up and selling things on. By doing all this I was able to save fast and after 2 years I bought a 1 bed flat in 2017, just before this i got a better job (¬£40k increasing to 45k over a few years) and quit my other jobs so I was then just working 5 days a week. I also put away about 8k a year of my income towards my pension as I want to have a comfortable life when I'm older. I have continued to do side work since and spend probably 10-15 hours a week doing this.
I'm also doing additional training and working hard towards a promotion.


background on my gf (29f)

We met in 2016, we were together a year before I bought the flat, we were both involved in the decision of the area as we intended to live together and so I wanted her to be included. She wanted to go travelling and so quit her job and went away for about 6 months at the time I moved, we stayed together and she accrued about 5k in debt. On returning from travelling she came to live with me as we planned, and when she got a job we agreed she would pay me ¬£200 per month towards bills. She got a job in the charity sector where she earns ¬£19k. She has spent the past 18 months paying off her debt and is now debt free. She has a degree and has the experience and ability to get a well paying job. She In fact had an interview for a job that would pay more than me but did not go. she said she wants to work in the charity sector and despite not getting paid much, the money does not matter as much to her as helping others working for a charity. I have always supported her with her choices. She is also wanting to go away for a further 6 month period at some point to do voluntary work.

The situation now

We both love travelling and go away a few times a year, we have talked about getting married one day and starting a family and are about to start saving for a house together. 

AITA If I say that if she wants to continue working in her job then I will support her, but when the financial responsibility of a house and a family comes she is going to struggle. And without putting money away she will either have little money on retirement or have to work.

AITA for assuming we will be splitting all bills and financial commitments 50/50?
¬†
In my eyes I work hard for my money, and have made sacrifices in order to get financially ahead. My girlfriend has not and despite having the ability to earn what I do choses not to. Whilst I respect that decision should it not be her that struggles financially because of this, or am I expected to bear the financial burden of her choices?

Edit: to clarify if we had children I would be more than happy to take full financial responsibility whilst she was not working. Or if she became ill and couldn't work or something unforseen happened and I would be happy to take the financial burden in this case. It's the current case where she is choosing her job where I am wanting to do a 5050 split



Edit:

Thankyou for some of your comments. Some have been very helpful and I have not been able to comment on all the helpful ones so I apologise for that. After seeing some of these I changed my way of thinking so that an equitable share would in my view be fair and reasonable.

I think there is some misunderstanding. We currently and always have split things 50/50. My gf has never had an issue with this and we have never argued about money. My title was poorly worded and i have not spoken to her about this before now. I am just thinking longer term as we want to save for a house etc. Also some people seem to think I would be buying a house she could not afford, it was always the intention to buy a house where we could each afford the payments. 

I have sat down with my girlfriend and talked about this now, at first she was surprised as she always imagined us doing things 50/50. Saying it has not crossed her mind to do anything else. When we discussed the bigger financial commitment and the bigger capacity of mine to pay more towards bills we both agreed that an equitable bill share is fair.

 talking about issues like this before they are issues is important to me so we can both agree on common ground and know what to expect. Thankyou again  to the helpful comments that helped me see that a flat 50/50 is not reasonable for a long term relationship.",620,1237,0.88

440,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôll try and keep this brief. I met my roommate ‚ÄúNicole‚Äù late July through mutual friends last July and she moved in August 1st when my old roommate moved out for grad school. Nicole seemed very sweet but we‚Äôre definitely more friendly than friends. She is subleasing so she pays rent directly to me on a month to month basis. She‚Äôs not on the lease and I told her that she could move out as long as she gave me a month‚Äôs notice. 

Her boyfriend, ‚ÄúBlake‚Äù is another story. He‚Äôs around at the apartment a lot, which is usually fine by me because I‚Äôm either at work or at my boyfriend‚Äôs a lot of the time. But Blake is a real asshole; he knows I‚Äôm a feminist and is always trying to get a rise out of me and tease me even when we really are not close like that. I try to be polite but he is just kind of awful. 

So last night, I was in my room when I saw I was overcharged for an electricity bill. It was almost double the usual amount. I went to the living room where Nicole and Blake were watching TV and I asked her about it. She said she didn‚Äôt know why so I went back to my room and called ConEd. The first representative was incompetent so I asked to speak with her manager; I was annoyed at the time but I wasn‚Äôt yelling. At no point did I raise my voice. The manager helped resolve the issue.

I went back to the kitchen and got a drink. Blake told me that I sounded like ‚Äúa real Karen‚Äù on the phone. I never heard this before so I asked what it meant. He said a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù is someone who gets annoyed and asks to speak to a manager. I told him ‚Äúsounds like sexist bullshit.‚Äù And he asked why I couldn‚Äôt take a joke and told me that he wasn‚Äôt sexist blahblahblah. So i told him ‚ÄúMaybe when you get a job and move out of your parents‚Äô house and start paying your own bills, you‚Äôll understand why it sucks to be overcharged.‚Äù I know this wasn‚Äôt the nicest thing to say but imo he definitely deserved it. He BLEW UP. He called me ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and I rolled my eyes, which only further aggravated him. It was honestly pathetic. It was like a large toddler throwing a tantrum. Ag no point did I actually fear for my safety. Blake and I went back and forth for a bit but Nicole just sat there silently, which I also viewed as pathetic. Then he and Nicole left.

Well today while I‚Äôm at work, Nicole sent me a text saying that she‚Äôs going to move out because she doesn‚Äôt want to be around such a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù person as me and that she didn‚Äôt want blake to constantly feel like he‚Äôs ‚Äúwalking on eggshells‚Äù when he visits the apartment. I told her that it was fine if she moved out; she already paid her October rent. I feel like it‚Äôs pretty obvious that she‚Äôs just parroting Blake‚Äôs language about me being ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù but I‚Äôm annoyed because now I have to find a new roommate. I want some outside perspective as to whether I was the asshole here.

UPDATE: I‚Äôm kind of overwhelmed by all these comments and I‚Äôve only read about a quarter of them. I‚Äôm done reading but thanks to all who responded.

Excuse my grammar writing this on my small break in a hurry.

I will verify from here that the dog will go to a VERY good home, the woman (new potential owner)  already has a bunch of lurchers and has lots of space + works from home.

I (26F) have two children with my partner, my eldest is 5 (S) and my youngest is 4 (K)

While S was the perfect angel as a baby, we have problems with K and still do, we believe that she might have autism or something due to mental health running in both sides of the family (schizophrenia and autism)


My mother got us a lurcher pup and straight away the children loved it, they loved walking and playing with it but as time has gone on they‚Äôve gotten bored of the poor thing, as children do.

I look after the dog, walk the dog, feed the dog and bathe it- my partner doesn‚Äôt do a thing other than pay it attention sometimes and on the occasion run it (rarely but it‚Äôs the only time he gets ran)

The first problem:
He gave K attention and she responded by screaming at the poor thing, I explained to her why that was a mean thing to do and she apologised to him, same thing happened again- this time  I wasn‚Äôt home so unsure of what happened.

Second problem: I have told both girls that there are to be no toys outside, ever unless we‚Äôre going park and they want their bikes/scooters, I can‚Äôt even count the amount of times that we‚Äôve all gone out there to pick up toys, dog was running around and caught himself on their toy pram hurting his leg, THIS is not the children‚Äôs  fault but my partners as he was home and knew they weren‚Äôt meant to have toys outside.

Third issue:

I work as does my partner so he‚Äôs often left home alone for hours,which is unfair on any animal IMO.

I‚Äôve told the girls that he‚Äôs got a new home and quite frankly they don‚Äôt really care, they didn‚Äôt bond to the dog plus they‚Äôre children they don‚Äôt well and truly understand.

My partner however is sobbing his heart out over the dog and begging to keep it BUT I know that at the new home he would have a better life.

452,Not the A-hole,"To explain things in short, my husband and I had a good marriage leading up to him taking a fall and bulging a disc.

At first I was understanding with his level of pain because I have dealt with chronic pain since I was in middle school. To the point that I missed school at times, work, etc, and didnt want to move in bed let alone get up from it. I put up with a lot of him being crabby and depressed and in general ignoring me mostly because he never said anything mean to me, and I've been there.

We've reached the point of just waiting around and hoping something works to fix this. This has been an issue for 6 months so far with very little progress in him getting better.

About a week ago I brought up to him that he always leaves our house right when I go to bed in the morning (I work overnights) and hes rarely home when I get up in the evening. I know that most of the time hes at his parents house but regardless it makes me sad to get up and see he isnt home. He doesnt call or send me a message at any time through the day to check up or just say hi like he used to. I know hes trying to be considerate to make sure I get sleep, but it still sucks.

When I brought this up he got really angry. He said that just because I had an issue within our relationship, doesnt mean that he has an issue with it. Meaning it's something I had to cope with, not him. I tried to explain to him that I wanted to work together to keep close in our relationship like always, and he got even angrier until I told him we should walk away for 20/30 minutes. He apologized after this break and said it was something he would work on with me.

Today he didnt come home until 8:30pm, which I normally sleep until 5, but I slept in because I missed my alarm. I called him and was upset because we talked about this not long ago. He got really irritable quickly, saying it wasnt like he was out getting shitfaced with his friends. The quick to anger thing has been common since he got the bulged disc, but sometimes hes really sharp with what he says. I immediately felt attacked and said I was walking away for a few minutes. He wouldnt quit bothering me, so I yelled at him to just leave me alone for awhile.

He walked away, but he told me if I wanted to be alone so bad then I might find myself alone for a good long while.

I confronted him on that immediately, because there was once a time where we threatened divorce on each other, but we've been past this. He tried making out what he said to mean something else instead of threatening divorce and I told him I'm not stupid. I took my rings off, and told him that I was going to be okay if we ended things, and if he ever threatened me with leaving then I wouldn't think twice about packing my shit and heading out.

After when things had calmed down, he asked me if I was concerned about him not being home because I feel like hes cheating. This didnt even cross my mind.  I'm lost and suspicious. AITA?",58,29,0.8

I was not happy she was goinf specifically at a time she knew i couldn't. We've been dating nearly a year, almost official for 6. She did tell me at the very beginning she was still his friend, and they hung out occasionally, but she has not made any mention of him since. She's the one who asked to be official. To be fair, I do trust her. I still feel like she betrayed my trust by purposely not saying it was her ex. I was upset, and she acknowledged it was wrong to not invite me, but there seemed to be some push back. When I asked her who she went with, she did tell me. I feel she should have been forthcoming with that information. Even if nothing did happen, to me it clearly means she either a) didn't think I'd let her go b) wanted something to happen. She claims it wasn't a big deal she didn't tell me, and justifies it by saying she told me in the very beginning that they were still friends.",128,226,0.91
456,Not the A-hole,"My parents are divorced. My siblings and I don‚Äôt have good relationships with our dad, because he treated us all pretty badly growing up. My dad has always blamed this on my mom for talking bad about him to us and turning us against him. My mom denies this and I‚Äôve always taken her side (even though she does shit talk him) because my siblings and I dislike him due to his actions which we have witnessed.

My mom has always been very hard on and even cruel to my sister and I while favoring our brother. This has been a source of resentment for me for my entire life. Recently these tensions came to a head and I drastically reduced contact with my mother and told her exactly why. I then heard that she blames my dad for turning me against her by convincing me that she favors my brother. My dad has never talked to me about this and I didn‚Äôt even know he noticed that she did it.

Last week my mom texted me telling me how hurtful it was that I won‚Äôt talk to her. I texted back and told her that it was hurtful that she doesn‚Äôt take my hurt seriously and thinks my dad planted ideas in my head. She said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt blame him for putting things in your head I just said he made it worse with how he behaved and things he said. Which is true.‚Äù So I straight up asked her if she thinks it‚Äôs possible for a parent to turn their kid against the other parent. She said yes, it is possible. I said in that case she turned me against my dad, because she actually did shit talk him to me a lot whereas he never said anything to me about her.

She stopped texting me after that but I heard from another family member that she was crying for the rest of the day.

457,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",6134,34157,0.78
458,Not the A-hole," I took a two month trip to South East Asia with two of my closest friends after uni. Their parents were both very well off and paid for their whole trips, while I was using money I had saved up working several jobs throughout uni.

One of my friends (I'll call her Z) wanted to stay home for her grandmother's birthday and start the trip two weeks later than us. Since I had a job lined up and didn't have too much time, I did not want to waste two weeks. Problem was, her parents were very protective and did not want her flying to Thailand alone. I decided I would fly out to Singapore to pick her up so we could fly into Thailand together. I took three days out of my trip solely to go get her and spent $1K of my own money so she didn't have to miss out.

One of my friends (I'll call her M) and I absolutely love scuba diving and were planning on doing it a couple of days when we got to Thailand. Z was very well aware of these plans. Again, Z's parents are very protective and didn't let her come scuba diving. M and I spent three days diving, but were done around 1300 everyday. The three of us spent the afternoons hanging with the friends M and I made while diving.

Z was apparently very upset because she felt left out. Z spent the two weeks being snippy and rude to me, so I started going off and doing my own thing. It was a once in a lifetime experience and I didn't want to spend it with someone so cranky.

About three weeks into the trip with one week to go, Z drunkenly comes up to me and is like ""I don't want to fight anymore, can we just have fun?"" I ask her why she had been upset and she said it's because I was off diving those first three days and she felt abandoned.

I come to learn she had been complaining to M behind my back. She wasn't upset with M because they weren't as close of friends so she expected more out of me.

This really upset me because I had taken the time out of my trip and spent loads of my own money to go get her so she wouldn't miss out on the entire trip. She was punishing me for taking a few mornings out of our once-in-a-lifetime trip to do my favorite thing in the world. And she expected me to apologize. M said she saw both sides and said we should both apologize. Maybe this is my pride speaking, but I refused to apologize. She never came to me with her concerns. She nearly ruined two weeks of the trip. And I had spent so much time and effort to make sure she could be there in the first place and never even got a thank you.

AITA? Maybe I should've asked her what was wrong instead of just doing my own thing, but she should have come to me with what was upsetting her. Is there something I'm not seeing?",29,85,0.91
459,No A-holes here,"I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. 

However, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while. But at the same time I've been here much longer and it's always been fine, so I don't want to have to change my habits for their sake, especially since they haven't said anything directly to me and instead have been a little rude about it.

WIBTA if I just kept smoking? AITA for going out on the patio even when I know they're out there, and possibly have been for a while?",52,44,0.83
460,Not the A-hole,"I come from an upper middle class family with a strong academic background. I have inherited my family's love of academia, and have recently begun taking a class at a community college. It's a really rough class and I have put lots of work into doing well.

One of them told me that my success was because of my family, and to stop bragging about my privilege. 

Was it insensitive for me to bring up the good grade, bragging rather than spreading good news? I feel sometimes I do brag, but I try to acknowledge my advantages both from my mind and family. I am also practicing not beating myself up (lol posting here).

461,Not the A-hole,"So I‚Äôm usually in the library during my dead times between classes. It‚Äôs not unusual to see segregated tables. All the Asians in their own tables, and Indians in their own tables. These two groups tend to take up whole tables, but on one floor, all the Indians hang out there and take up to like 4 tables. I have no problem with this, because there‚Äôs really no reason to be. It‚Äôs not peculiar to stick with similar people, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing, and I don‚Äôt have any problem with it. 

I come in early in the morning on test days to study for an hour or two. At this time, the tables haven‚Äôt become of one group of people yet. I sat in the first table that was the least populated at the time. The groups of friends that sit in the same tables, are always situated in the same tables, so maybe their argument that these are their tables is valid. 

So after about 40 minutes of studying, the groups of them start situating themselves at the usual tables in groups of 3-5. It‚Äôs the usual, and I‚Äôm not bothering anyone so I don‚Äôt really bat an eye. Soon enough, the table is fully occupied with the select group of students, and then there‚Äôs me, kind of in the middle of the table. 

I don‚Äôt mind being surrounded by them and their conversations, since they‚Äôre all med students and I honestly like hearing what they talk about, or their gossip. I‚Äôve sat at other tables and they‚Äôve talked loudly enough for me to pick up everything. And sometimes I laugh when they laugh because they‚Äôre having a good time and they‚Äôre ambiance is enjoyable. 

So once they started pouring in, they surrounded me, since I was in the middle seat. They usually take other chairs so they can all sit at the same table. I didn‚Äôt mind them sitting around me at all. I‚Äôm doing my work and not causing a problem. At one point, one of them walks in after everyone is seated and he pointed at me like ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this kid.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it and kept reading my stuff. 

They asked me to move, but I told them ‚Äúhe can just pull up another chair, its going to be hard for me to find somewhere else to sit.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôd find this chair, since there‚Äôs none available. 

They kept reassuring me to move from my seat for this last one, but it‚Äôs a hassle to find a new seat at this time of day. They asked me to move like three more times and I finally just sighed and informed him, ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôm not gonna move for you. I was here before anyone else at this table.‚Äù

Now they‚Äôve been giving me faces and shit. I could‚Äôve moved, but I‚Äôd have to spend about 10 minutes looking for an open seat.

462,Not the A-hole,"I went to Starbucks to study today. I know that it‚Äôs not the best choice of venue, so I usually don‚Äôt study there, but due to circumstances I had to study there. I did buy a coffee and a pastry so I wouldn‚Äôt just be taking up a table without buying anything.

I was sitting at the table, engrossed in my work, when a guy came up and asked me if he could charge his phone at the table. I looked around and there were other empty tables, but I guess none close enough to an outlet for him. I said okay, no problem, so he plugged his phone in. He left for a while. Then, he came back and asked if he could sit at the table. Again, I said sure. He took out his phone and started to compose some sort of electronic music. He was playing these electronic notes over and over, no headphones. They were piercing, high, electronic notes, not pleasant at all, with some sort of weird drumbeat behind them. He kept replaying the same clip, adding a second or two, playing the clip again, etc, 

I can tune out conversation and ambient music just fine, just as I‚Äôd managed to do before he sat down. But this was incredibly annoying. Finally, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and asked if he could move to an empty table since the noise was interfering with my studying. He says no, this was the closest to an outlet, and pointed out that I let him sit down. I said I wasn‚Äôt aware that he going to be ‚Äúcomposing‚Äù and I told him I just couldn‚Äôt study while he doing it. He demanded that I move, since I was the one bothered by his music, I was making the problem, and he was fine. I had all of my study materials spread out and I didn‚Äôt want to pack all of it up just to move to a different table, when I had been there first. I said fine, we‚Äôd share the table. 

I pulled out my laptop and started playing some electronic music, louder than his composing. He said to turn it off, I said no, and that he was the one with the problem and I was enjoying my music. This went on for 5 mins before he left. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about it all day and wondering if I was being an asshole since I definitely got glares for playing the music, and I know he had a right to be in the space too.",394,3738,0.96

464,Not the A-hole,"So, I usually don't consider myself a petty person. Me and my roommates dorm has banned anything with LED lights (its pretty bullshit) as a fire hazard, even when they're battery powered and turned off. My roommate has TONS of fairy lights and LED lamps. She failed her room inspection, I ended up having to go to the meeting because they had to fail both of us (even though they were hers- it wasn't a huge inconvenience because once she said they were both hers I got to leave- but still annoying to deal with). So after this, naturally, she got MORE fairy lights and put them up. They're now all over her bookcase.So anyways, I'm an early riser most of the time (I get up at 6:45AM on days I have early classes which is 3/5 days) and I have a really hard time falling asleep. Usually I take melatonin, but on this night in question I have an exam early and I don't want to take it cuz it makes me groggy. She knows I go to bed early and is usually respectful, albeit slow (I ask her to turn off her lights and she'll do it 20 minutes later).So, this night I get in bed at 10 and I ask her to turn off her lamps/fairy lights. She says she will and 10 minutes later they're off. However, 30 minutes later she says she forgot to do a quiz due at midnight and needs to do that and turns on a lamp. NBD it happens to everyone. So her quizzes are timed for 6 minutes, and she says she won't have the lamp on for more than 10 minutes, again NBD. Around 20 minutes pass and it's still bright so I turn around, and she's watching a movie on her laptop with all her fairy lights on. I ask her to turn them off and she refuses because shes ""watching a movie and can't see the screen without extra light."" Don't ask me why she needs extra light to see a laptop screen in a dark room because that's absolutely not how screens work and I wish I knew. WIBTA if I tell our CA/RA she has the fairy lights in here?I will say that I understand the lights aren't crazy bright, but I regularly have trouble sleeping (I'm getting an eye mask this weekend when I go home to avoid this problem in the future, I normally don't like using them because they're uncomfortable) and it's too bright for me to face away from the wall which isn't always comfortable either.

Edit: I asked her to turn the lights off and not her laptop btw.

*UPDATE 1: So I scheduled a meeting with our CA (corridor assistant) and she's coming by today. I decided not to report her for the lights but called the CA so we can establish boundaries for when we do things, and yes I AM getting a sleep mask this weekend lol which we are both happy about. I definitely don't want her to feel that she can't exist in her own room and it's important to be able to work at your own schedule, and I've made it clear to her that I'm not asking her to stop living/working at a certain time of day, but that I want some kind of boundary so we can know how each other operate and what to expect. When I asked her to meet with the CA with me she got very defensive and rude IMO, I said I wanted to meet with our CA and do our housing contract agreement (due to weird rooming circumstances we never did one) and she responded saying she didn't want to and she was sorry but it was her right to have light on- which, again, I responded by saying I didn't want to stop her from using her lights and it IS her right to use them as it's her space, and I just wanted to meet so that we could reach an understanding and talk it out. After that things calmed down. Right now in the dorm she's acting like nothing happened. Also, thanks for all the replies. I'll do another update after the meeting and then mute the thread because holy hell I got a lot of emails/notifs.*

*Also, the school website LITERALLY says string lights are not allowed nor are LED signs. If I knew how to post a screenshot I would, but I'm not comfortable linking the page and giving out what university I go to. Her string lights were confiscated the last room inspection, due to legal things probably they gave them back but told her she couldn't hang them up. She hung them up as soon as she got them back.*

**UPDATE 2: Things have been mostly resolved. Getting the roommate agreement from the CA helped and we both reached an understanding with the issue, and with other things that were causing tension and likely caused this to be such a big deal. I'll be muting the thread and idk how to make the thread resolved but if someone wants to close it I'd appreciate it. Thanks everyone for the responses, they helped me understand the situation a bit better and realize that I was being pretty petty/rude if I had turned her over.**",152,651,0.95
465,Not the A-hole,"Hi reddit. Let me try and make this as short as possible. 

1. they‚Äôre my fianc√©‚Äôs friends
2. They are a couple plus a one year old baby
3. We have 2 dogs and a cat

One week ago we started hosting my fianc√©‚Äôs friends family. For whatever reason they made the ill advised decision to sell their home before going on a month long vacation and had no where to stay afterwards and asked us if they could stay with us until they moved in on the 15th of this month. 

My fianc√© said yes and obviously we are trying to be gracious host by telling them to make themselves at home but several things are bothering me/him:

1. we are going on vacation a few days after they are supposed to leave... however they have had a change of plans and want to leave one day after we are gone because they don‚Äôt want to move in during the week. This means they will be in charge of the house while we‚Äôre gone (locking up, making sure everything is tidy)
2. They are messy. They don‚Äôt clean after themselves and we are constantly vacuuming crumbs off the couch and picking up baby food off the floor. Their room is disgusting and smells like baby poo. This combined with the mess of three pets is overwhelming.
3. They‚Äôre eating all the groceries. And not restocking. I eat mostly plant based and I wake up or come home to items I would eat in my normal routine missing. They‚Äôre not buying any groceries, rather they are buying foods we don‚Äôt eat, not replacing the ones they‚Äôve used and using a lot of the food as baby food. 
4. She borrowed my $300 purse saying she wanted to use it as a bag to carry baby things for the day and has had it for the 3 days now. Since then she‚Äôs been at the mall numerous times and has bought other things for her self. They drink approximately 6 coffees a day total (Nespresso, which are expensive) and he is stealing my fianc√©‚Äôs cigarettes. 

To say I‚Äôm annoyed is an understatement. I hate having to clean x 2, I don‚Äôt usually have to buy groceries every week, and we‚Äôre spending so much more money to make them feel at home...  
but I am starting like they‚Äôre taking us for advantage. 

I want to tell them they have to leave on the 15th, or a day later. To get the few belongings they have at our house and go... but my fianc√© thinks I‚Äôll be the asshole. He doesn‚Äôt want to start a fight. WIBTA?",29,51,0.94

469,Not the A-hole,"I love my MIL, but I have so many stories that would make bank (karma, that is) on r/justnomil. So, although I won't go into detail, this isn't just a one-time thing that she has said or done to make me upset, hurt, or uncomfortable. For example, she has said ""I can't wait until I can get *son's name* away from you and all to myself."" This made me extremely uncomfortable, but I truly don't believe she meant anything by it. She's just a freaking weirdo. 

Anyway, to the matter at hand.

Every single time she witnesses my husband or I discipline our son (1 1/2), she gets really upset and says something about it. It's not *how* we discipline him, according to her, it's that she believes that he doesn't deserve to be disciplined at all, ever, because he's ""a perfect angel"". 

I love my son, obviously. But part of that love also means I need to correct him when he does wrong or acts out. 

I was getting tired of her comments every time she witnessed us disciplining him (even small things, like saying no to him!), and told her what my husband and I have already decided about her watching our son; that she won't be, because we know that she would let him do whatever he wants and we don't want our son to be affected by that, negatively speaking. I said it after she huffed and shouted ""He didn't do anything wrong!"" to my husband (her son) as he carried our son out of the room due to him throwing a huge fit in the middle of a church service.

My husband wasn't even actually disciplining him; he took him out of the room to calm him down because he was having a hard day (teething two top canines can be rough!). My husband always takes him out of the room as to not cause a distraction (we were at church) with his crying and throwing a fit. Bringing him outside usually calms him down. After his fit, he calms down and then hugs us (like I said, he's just having a hard time, needs a hug and some lovin', not always discipline), then we bring him back inside. Which is what happened in this instance, but of course MIL did not know this.

Anyway, she was super offended. Which, I understand why- because she wont be able to watch her grandson. But if she had kept her mouth shut, then my husband and I would not have made this decision, ya know what I mean? 

She left without saying anything to me (she kissed our son goodbye, though).

I told my husband and he didn't care. He said that it was getting on his nerves, too, and he would have said the same thing.

470,Everyone Sucks,"Okay so a little background info: My GF and I are both 26, we met in college and both have our degrees. She is the first and only person in her family to attend and graduate with a bachelors degree and she did it with 0 assistance from them. They have always been really weird(insecure) about it and often make negative comments about college/education in general. She worked very hard and is now a teacher.

Last weekend we attended a family dinner at her oldest sister and BIL's house. Their daughter(GF's niece) just graduated high school and the topic of her attending college came up so my GF encouraged her to start taking classes at the local community college. Eventually BIL looks to us and says college is too expensive and is just a place for rich kids to party. Most of the family including her mom nods in agreement. I just say something along the lines of, ""yeah the cost of college has become ridiculous"". My GF adds that it's also a great place to meet people and tells them how we met our best friends in college, to which BIL responds ""you don't need to pay $15 grand a year to make friends"". GF insists she learned a lot in college and would not be who she is today without it and we move away from the topic.

Later in the night we're all playing an apples to apples variant game and the topic of college gets brought up by BIL again. This time he's obviously been thinking about it and launches into a rant about how the most successful people never went to college, specifically Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Saying how you don't need an education to start a successful business(BIL has a window tinting/car wrapping business) and he how makes way more than my GF without a college degree, so it's a giant waste of time and money. When he finishes I laugh at him and say ""Are you really comparing yourself to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates? I didn't know tinting windows was more important than teaching kids."" He gets angry and accuses me of being jealous of him because I wasted my time and money on college. I said ""why would I be jealous of your business when a 15 year old with an X-acto knife and a squeegee could steal all of your clients tomorrow? If college isn't important then why do you need a degree to work at Apple, Miscrosoft, and Tesla? I guess they think it's pretty important, also they did go to college, specifically HARVARD and STANFORD they just dropped out to start their businesses"". Then I say to GF's niece, ""your dad's right tho, you definitely don't need to go to college to learn how to tint windows"".

All hell broke loose and now everyone is mad at me, including my GF. I feel like I am the asshole for mocking his profession, but at the same time I really felt like he deserved it and I am tired of them making petty digs at my GF and me because we went to college. GF thinks I should've just kept my mouth shut and I should apologize to him. AITA?",320,1738,0.97

I went to a mid tier sushi restaurant (about 10$-15$ a roll) and ordered some rolls with a group of friends. When my first roll came I mixed some wasabi in with the soy sauce to make a dip for my sushi. In Japan and high end sushi restaurants the standard is never to mix the wasabi with the soy sauce. Instead you add a little wasabi to each piece of sushi. I know this but I prefer to mix the wasabi.   


So I am happily eating my roll with the mixed wasabi+soy sauce when the waiter delivers the next set of rolls. He sees me eating with wasabi+soy sauce mixture and proceeds to give me a very condescending lecture about the ""proper"" way to eat sushi.

We were both addicts and it took my other sister telling me that she would cut me out of her life for me to change. I took it very seriously and moved out and back in with my parents at 20 and went to rehab, my sister was totally fine from being excluded by my other sister and I don't think they have talked since. I am forever great full that I took her threat and got help. I am now 6 years clean. When I was 3 years clean I met up with my (addict) sister and she looked terrible, all boney/frail stringy hair, looked shot up and just not good. I hung out with her that day but then she offered me drugs and I was very tempted to do it. I stood my ground and declined. The next day I texted her this ""I love you and will be there when you are ready to get clean but for my own health I can't be around you until that point. Best of luck"". I never got a response to that. I felt terrible but it had to be done. My parents have kept in touch and tells me she's doing alright, no longer a hard core user but still does weed and alcohol which were my gateway drugs and have been banned for me for years now.

She is getting married and I got a random text last week out of the blue asking for me to show up and asked if we could hang. I didn't respond but called her, I was happy/excited thinking that she finally got better, she told me she got clean and same with her BF (now fiancee) and that she wants to hang out for the day and invited me to her wedding. I was happy for her and I accepted. We had a lunch meet up and it was great, she drove us there but when we got back to her place she started to smoke weed. I don't have a problem with weed smokers but I can't be around that, I tried to ask her if she couldn't do that when I'm over. She FLIPPED out saying how I'm just like our sister and how I'm just like everyone else looking down on her. I tried to calm her down but she was on a tangent and then kicked me out of her house. I was pretty hurt by this but left, later that day just the smell of weed got the urges back and seeing alcohol in the house too didn't help. I pondered it for a couple days and then I texted her ""I am sorry our last meeting didn't end so well, I love you and if you ever need me ill be there for you but I won't be attending your wedding. If/when you are willing to talk things through I will gladly do it but as of right now I need to put my health before our relationship."" She responded with an simple ""fuck you"" and that was it.

my wonderful wife is preggo, she‚Äôs at around 17 weeks now with our second, she‚Äôs also stay at home with our 22 month old. a while ago, I showed her a certain AITA post (we read it together for laughs) where a woman was using a body pillow and she decided that she wanted to give it a go and went and bought a similar full body pillow that was made specially for pregnant ladies. Not a bad idea, my problem with it is that since we started sleeping together it was kind of annoying because she has a tendency to steal the sheets in her sleep and leave me with barely any. I brought this up with her and we decided that when we moved in together, we would get a queen size bed so we wouldn‚Äôt have this issue....it‚Äôs gotten A lot better and I‚Äôve learned to put up with it. Anyways I digress.

since she got The Pillow, the problem has regressed - she now has more sheet usage than before and to make matters worse, she actually pushes me to the very side of the bed and I‚Äôve had nights where I‚Äôm just perilously close to the edge. Now I‚Äôve expressed my concerns to her and she just brushed me off cause the pillow is so damn comfortable for her which is great. I‚Äôm happy for her, I‚Äôm really am. But it‚Äôs seriously affecting my sleep, whenever she moves the damn thing it wakes me up and I can‚Äôt afford to be tired because it affects me at work which is usually challenging, to say the least. And on top of that I feel that it‚Äôs kind of inconsiderate. To add insult to injury whenever she throws up (she doesn‚Äôt have that illness that‚Äôs got the initials H.G, can‚Äôt spell it) she totally, and I mean completely misses the toilet bowl. I don‚Äôt care about cleaning up her puke, I‚Äôll gladly do it for her. But I just feel, damn couldn‚Äôt you make it a bit easier for the person who‚Äôs cleaning up after you? Like I keep the toilet clean and sanitary, so it‚Äôs not that. I got her a portable bucket but it‚Äôs been under our kitchen sink unused for the past few months. With the whole bed issue, I offered to move to the couch to give her more space but she said she wants me with her. 

It all came to a head today when I got back from work and went use our bathroom and There was leftover dried puke running down the sides of the bowl. I was just totally floored, I talked to her in what was probably a severely exasperated voice and I voiced these issues to her and she just refuses to compromise at all with me. I told her that she‚Äôs being inconsiderate and if this continues then I‚Äôll a) sleep on the couch till further notice and b) refuse to clean up her puke for her.

She is with her dad every other week, so while she sees that I am way more tired, she is clueless to the other side effects I am experiencing. She comes home from school and goes in her room to do homework, which she does until about 10.

a few months ago, it was my birthday, and some friends got together to get me a somewhat expensive bottle of gin (around 80ish euros) which made me very happy, since gin tonic is my favourite drink but i cannot get myself to spend that much on a single bottle of alcohol. i was saving it for a special occasion, and a friend recently got back from a prolonged hospital visit and we wanted to celebrate that. i had the bottle in my room since my birthday, but i couldnt find it before going out last weekend. i asked my mother if she knew anything about it, and she told me that she took it and tgey drank all of it when my aunt was at our house a few weeks ago, since they ran out of alcohol. i was pretty sad and kinda angry, since i actually hid it in my closet because my brother has the habit of making things ""disappear"" from my room when i am not at home, but my mother even scolded me from hiding such nice things from my parents and that i am being selfish, since they also share their alcohol with me, which is a half truth to be fair. i get the alcohol they DONT WANT that doesnt taste good/they were gifted when i ask if i can take anything to a party, but i get them their favourite wine in return the next time i go for groceries. im not sure how to feel since they did give me alot of alcohol for undervalue, but this situation feels different

486,Asshole,"So, I am a 16 year old boy. I got my G1 licence a few months ago, this is part of a Graduated Licencing system in Canada. It basically means that when I drive, I have to have an adult in the passenger seat. Now, my father decided to be the one who would teach me to drive. He did, I got the basics down, and I am now a pretty good driver. 

When my father started teaching me I was weary. He has quite a few speeding tickets and has been in 5 accidents in my lifetime, although only 1 was his fault. My father likes to drive above the speed limit and told me it's ok to drive above the speed limit, among a few other things that are certainly not legal. Recently my father has become a more aggressive driver and I told him I would not drive with him beside me, I want my mom to be with me. I also told him that if he is in the drivers seat I will NOT be sitting beside him as I don't feel safe. I also told him I want him to change his bad habits. He got mad at me and said he's a perfectly good driver and I should respect him. 

I told my mom that I will not be stepping foot in the vehicle if my father is driving. She blew up at me. She said I was being dumb and I need to trust my dad and that if I want to drive ever again I am going to respect him. I was never disrespectful. Personally, I don't feel safe with my dad driving. I also want to tell my younger siblings not to step foot in the car with my dad. I don't like the idea of them driving with him.

489,Not the A-hole,"Over the years I‚Äôve managed to save up 10k for my son (24). I wanted to have money available for him for whatever came up and so far it‚Äôs been nothing. It is not for emergencies. I intended to keep putting money in it, letting it further accumulate, and have it be a bigger gift for later on in his life. 

We had a big fight over his decision to take an expensive vacation. I had asked him how he could afford it. During this talk-turned-fight I realized that he‚Äôs been living above his means and I‚Äôve been enabling it. I gave him a deadline for when I would stop supporting him financially. I don‚Äôt want to pay his car loan and rent so he can afford to squander his own money on unnecessary expenses like saving up for a new luxury car and vacations. Honestly, I would rather he save up for a house and retirement first. 

We then had another big fight and he told me to give him ‚Äúhis 10k‚Äù. I wanted to compromise and pay off what‚Äôs left of his car loan and then give him whatever is left over. He still argued that he wanted the entire savings. I said no. 

I feel guilty about fighting over money. He‚Äôs always been hardworking and studious. He graduated last year, without student loans, and has a good job now.

Edit: I‚Äôm a woman. The savings is in my name. Ex-wife abandoned him after divorce. Did not want custody or visitation. She recently wanted to reconcile with him.

Edit 2: this question keeps coming up allot so I thought I‚Äôd address it.

My wife (25f) and I (25m) have two amazing children, however  our oldest (5f) is not biologically mine. Currently her father does not live in the country and is not allowed to return, so she primarily just sees her fathers parents (about once or more a week).

When my wife and I got our own place and she needed to move out of her and her Ex‚Äôs apartment I of course helped her, most of the stuff was his and so the grandparents came to pick it up, but when they saw I was there did not help me and were visibly upset. After that came the dilemma of birthdays and Christmas, for the last 3 years as this time rolls around the same thing happens, we have two birthday parties because they don‚Äôt want to be at the one I throw for her, and then I‚Äôm not allowed at theirs, and on Christmas I‚Äôm not allowed to come to their house to watch her open gifts, so I go home while my wife and her go and she opens gifts. 

I have talked to my wife about this every year and explained it‚Äôs unfair and that I‚Äôd love to be there as she opens gifts and is excited, and I hate just being at home waiting.

It was a big group of us in total 6 of us some guys and some girls. Now my friend Cindy joined us and we have been friends for a bit.

We had been standing in line for about 35 mins. When it was our turn the bouncer let two of our female friends through guessing it was because they were younger. However for Cindy and the other guys they charged us a minimum bar tab. Cindy then starts arguing with the bouncer saying that how come he let our other female friends through. We try to defuse the situation and even offer to pay for her bar tab.

She then says she is going to leave, and expects us to join her. We basically all stay and she leaves by herself in tears. 

After this she is angry with everyone in our group especially the girls in the group that got in free. She has told everyone she can about what happened about how we supported the devaluing of women.

I don‚Äôt think I was an asshole at all, we offered to pay for her to get in, and I don‚Äôt see how she can invoke gender equality when she was perfectly fine with us guys having to pay the bar tab.

My grandfather wanted to help my mom out and decided to send a set amount of money every month to help her get back on her feet. 

Fast forward a few years and he's still doing that. Not to say I'm not grateful because I am but my parents are too dependent on the money he sends. Neither of them have a job and whenever the subject is brought up my step-dad blames it on back problems, which I could understand if he actually had a medical disability. I can understand why my mom can't get a job because she has to take care of 3 kids including me, but she refuses to make my step-dad get a job and continues to defend him when the truth is right there in front of her. She said that she was willing to go through DSS (because I'm not old enough to legally work) and have me and my brother get jobs even if it would interfere with our education. 

So I finally got tired of it and tried to talk to them about how we can prepare for the future because when my grandfather dies we won't be getting his monthly check anymore, not to mention that the house we live in is under his name, so we won't have that either.

When we got married he was desperate for me to take his surname, while I felt more compelled to keep my own name, which felt like a connection to home that I didn‚Äôt want to sever (sorry, I know this was dramatic but I get really homesick sometimes). He really wanted our entire family to share the same name and it meant so much to him that I agreed to change my name on the condition that I got to name any future children we had, with him allowing to veto a name if there was a strong reason he disliked it. 

I told him at the time of this agreement and have mentioned many times over our relationship that I love Irish names and 100% will be naming my children Irish names, and he was fine with that. I am currently almost five months pregnant with our first child, and we‚Äôve been having the same argument for the last month - he no longer wants me to give the baby an Irish name because ‚Äúnobody can pronounce them and they sound awful‚Äù.

I agreed to go for a lower difficulty name (eg Niamh, Ciara, Emer for a girl or Ciar√°n, Darragh, Cillian for a boy) if he didn‚Äôt like my preferred (and admittedly more complicated) names but he‚Äôs really pushing back and his family agrees with him that it‚Äôd be an asshole move to set up our child with any Irish name at all because Americans will struggle with the rules of the language. I understand that it‚Äôs difficult to understand but the names I like are pretty easy to pronounce once it‚Äôs explained. 

There‚Äôs also a strong possibility that we‚Äôll be moving back to Ireland at some point in the next few years and that this would never even be an issue at all, but he says that since there‚Äôs only a possibility of that we need to focus on the certainty that we‚Äôre here for the time being.

I told the girl it's time you started earning your own money so you don't have to ask your parents every time you want to do something that costs.  Then I told her that right now I'm getting ready to mow my lawn and told her I'd give her $50 in a heartbeat if I could go sit my butt down and take a nap.  She agreed and I showed her how to cut the mower on and off.  I did tell her to go take off her flip flops and put on some shoes.  She got the job done in about 2 hours and I gave her the $50 as promised.

504,Not the A-hole,"FYI This all happened last year.

My brother (29M) was getting married to his fianc√©e (28F). The wedding was moderately sized, with the bride‚Äôs parents footing the bill for most of it and my parents also giving a contribution.

I (27F) was asked to be a bridesmaid. I got on pretty well with my brother and his fianc√©e and we saw each other 2-3 times a month. They had known my bf (31M) since we started dating 2 years prior and always seemed to like him.

When I received my invite, I was confused that my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt invited to the ceremony. I hoped it was a mistake so I texted my brother but he confirmed that bf was only invited to the reception. I was shocked and upset. I‚Äôd been to weddings without a plus one but I‚Äôd never heard of a sibling to the bride/groom not bringing their long-term partner, especially as a member of the wedding party. My future sister-in-law had been invited to every wedding since she started dating my brother, even those of extended family.

I presumed it was a budget issue so I offered to pay for my boyfriend‚Äôs meal, but no, apparently they had just decided to only invite plus ones if the couple were married. I took issue with this because: 1) I wasn‚Äôt sure I would ever get married so I took offence to them basically saying our relationship wasn‚Äôt worth anything, 2) I was the only person in the wedding party and only sibling in a long-term relationship, so the ‚Äòpolicy‚Äô they enacted disproportionately affected me, 3) They‚Äôd invited kids (who they claimed to hate) and some extended family (who they hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years) instead of inviting someone who they saw all the time and was potentially their future brother-in-law.

I put off telling my bf because I was deeply embarrassed, but when I did, he was hurt. I decided that I needed to put him first, as I felt we had a future together and I strongly disagreed with the reasons for not inviting him. Plus I would want him to stand up for me if the situation were reversed. I thanked my brother for the invite but said I would be unable to attend or be their bridesmaid.

My dad was very angry at my brother for being thoughtless and disrespectful. My mum accepted the guest list was up to them but was devastated that the whole family wouldn‚Äôt be there to celebrate together. One of my other brothers - the best man - was miffed that his gf wasn‚Äôt invited but they‚Äôd only been dating for 3 months so he didn‚Äôt make a fuss.

Well I heard nothing from my brother until a couple of weeks later, he announced that they‚Äôd had a change of heart and ALL siblings of the bride/groom as well as members of the wedding party could bring their partners - resulting in 3 extra guests at the ceremony. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else had complained or if it was just me. Our relationship with my brother and his fianc√©e was strained for a while, but thankfully was fine by the time the wedding came round, and we‚Äôve never mentioned it since.

So, was I the asshole for initially declining the invite?",60,119,0.93
505,No A-holes here,"I (53M) have grown increasingly worried about my daughter's (22F) weight. It has gotten beyond the point of merely an aesthetic issue, and I have genuine concerns about her health.

She doesn't live at home, as she recently started graduate school out of town. Our arrangement is that I pay for her tuition and rent, and she has a part time job that covers groceries, utility bills, spending money, etc. This works out well as I am happy to cover these expenses since she is in school. However, she often says that she wishes she earned more money, since she does not have a ton of spending money for leisure activities, clothes, etc.

I have tried to speak to her about her weight, approaching it as delicately as I could. She was actually quite receptive, and I could tell she was a bit hurt but she told me that she knew it was an issue that she should be addressing. However, currently she is not sufficiently motivated to do it, and is busy with her school and part time job so struggles to find time to go to the gym. 

I suggested that if she started going to the gym, I would give her extra money. This is to serve as a motivator, but also for practical reasons as she can pick up fewer shifts at her job and have more time to go to the gym.

The deal is $15 per hour spent at the gym. This is working on an honour system since I trust her, and I did not think it would be appropriate to pay her by pounds lost (could encourage unhealthy eating and so on). My wife thinks this is a ""disgusting"" idea, but I think I am helping her by replacing her shifts at her job with ""shifts"" at the gym - and financially compensating this.

So, AITA for paying for my daughter to lose weight?

**EDIT:** A lot of comments about how her diet is the most important thing, rather than exercise. Which is definitely fair. We did also speak about her diet, but her lack of exercise is the facet that had the most clear barrier (lack of time and motivation) which is why that is what I am addressing. Hopefully her diet will improve as well, especially since she should have some extra money in her pockets for more expensive groceries from this arrangement.",1436,9960,0.95

So we've been together for a very long time and we've had our hiccups. One thing im very uncomfortable with is him looking at real life porn. 

A couple years ago I brought up how it made me feel and asked that he stop. He did until be picked it back up and I asked him again and again he stopped.

I thought that was the end of that but last night I was using his phone for a certain social (that I won't mention so as to try and keep it being obvious in case he sees this post) media and saw in his photo gallery that he was downloading real porn again... It wasn't much, so I wasn't really going to try to talk to him about it, yet.

But then when I realized I had saved the wrong meme i went to trash it entirely.

I went into the trash tab and there were over 100 more pictures of porn.... I was heartbroken.

He knows how it makes me feel and yet.... He's looking at other bustier, curvier, sexier girls behind my back.

I love him I really do, but this is ridiculous. 

I want to confront him but i feel like if i do I'll be ""that"" girlfriend. The one who goes through phones because of trust issues or something but i swear its not that.

Edit: 
1)He gave me permission to use his phone. And i saw the photos by accident
2)He made our special promise he would stop lookong at real life porn.
3)The first time this problem happened he had over 500 pics and was ignoring me 90% of the time in favor of porn.
4)I didnt cut all porn off just real life porn and he definitely is into cartoon porn

Edit 2: (i think this is the comment i was suggested to add)

What so ridiculous about telling him that it hurts me to be ignored in favor of porn? He's the one who made our special promise to me about no more real porn. And honestly i didnt nag him. 

I literally kept quiet for so so long each time until i couldnt anymore. I cried every night for a good long while after i first found out about it all. I was being ignored and felt inadequate for his needs even though my sex drive is higher than his.

He chose porn over me regularly, id wake up and he'd be jerking. I'd come back upstairs and he'd be jerking. I'd get playful and try to be sexy and he'd just say ""no thanks"". It happened all the time. He'd rarely give me the attention.

One time when he did, he couldnt cum while fucking me and he HAD to look at porn to do so. It destroyed me. That right there fucking killed me and right now im near tears at just the memory. 

Porn may be natural, but its also natural to respect a promise you made to someone you love. Especially when you see just how much your actions hurt them",298,148,0.81

518,Not the A-hole,"(EDIT: there's been some confusion here. So my abuse from my parents is rooted in transphobia/homophobia, not anything else. They never abused my brothers (both cis and straight) My parents were never abusive towards the dogs when I was living with them. (For two decades.) Also I wasn't told that my dog was sick until I had to put him down. He wasn't sick when I dropped him off. My parents wanted to cover him getting fixed because they did the same thing for my brother when he moved out. It has maybe been two weeks between the time I dropped him off and yesterday, he was perfectly fine and healthy. I am in agreement that I shouldn't have trusted them, and I won't from now on, this was a huge wake-up call for me. Thanks for the input everyone.


Hey guys, before I get into it this includes a situation that deals with abuse and animal death.

So it's been a few days since I had to put down my dachshund who was my childhood pet. He was only middle aged at this point and at the time was of sound mind up until his passing, but unfortunately had to be put down because he developed IVDD and at that point became paraplegic. It was extremely sad and traumatic for me so I am unsure if I am right to cut them off. This dog was super important to me and helped me cope with my parents abuse and neglect until I managed to leave the situation. I was so happy that my life was turning around and wanted to share it with my best friend in the whole world.

So I moved into a new apartment at the beginning of August and I planned to bring my dog with me. Unfortunately, he was struggling with potty training and needed to be fixed. My parents offered to fix this for me, which was entirely managed and paid for by them. Over the next few weeks I asked about the procedure but they continued to put it off, until my brother told me that my dog wasnt walking.

My parents promised to take him to the vet multiple times but never did. As soon as I was able to take off work I came down and brought him to the emergency Vet. It turns out a disk in his spine slipped and destroyed his spinal cord from the waist down. I was told that if they got to it sooner there would be a much better chance of him recovering but at this point it was a less than 10% chance. I decided to put him down because there was no way I could take care of a paraplegic animal while still holding down a job.

I know for certain that there where multiple cases where my parents could have fixed/prevented this. I know for a fact my little brother slept with him on a tall bed and was the most likely reason for his illness. they could have taken him to the vet but never did out of inconvenience.

519,,"I (26, F) am lactose intolerant but I eat dairy products anyway because who can give up cheese and ice cream?? It does mean that I have to suffer the consequences. My symptoms usually set in about half an hour after I eat dairy ‚Äì cramps, diarrhea, gas, etc. I am okay with having this happening to me occasionally because I just love cheese so much. It has never really been an issue with anyone until I went to Italy with my older sister.

Italy is full of such great food and such great dairy! I have been eating cheese and gelato to my heart‚Äôs content, and it is all so much tastier than what you can get in the USA. Buffalo milk mozzarella is such a revelation and I love hazelnut gelato. Lasagna, pasta with cheese, pizza, burrata, gelato after every meal, yummmmm!

But after a few days, my sister asked me to stop eating dairy. She said she didn‚Äôt like having to drop everything and help me find a bathroom all the time, and that waiting for me while I was using it meant less time that we could use traveling to different areas. I told her that she didn‚Äôt have to help me find a bathroom when my stomach starts hurting or wait while I‚Äôm using it, and she could do other things without me. She seemed unhappy about that.

520,Not enough info,"As I said in my title, last night I sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major I will cease her tuition payments.

My daughter is currently a freshman in college. She has just started her first semester and I'm the one paying the bill. I have been saving for over 10 years to do this and I am happy to do it, as long as I feel she is actually setting herself up for success. During high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. She took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. I supported her through all this because I thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

This last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. My daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. I was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. She is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. Now I know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but I was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. When I tried to get why she was switching all I got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in LA. Apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

I tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""How do you plan to get a job"", etc. And she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. This angered me. I'm the one paying for this I feel I have a right to know and not be blown off like that. I thought over it all day and so last night I sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. I am the one paying for her education and I won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. I told her if she doesn't want to do CS that's fine. But she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys AND can get her a career. And if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. She can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

This did not sit well with her. We fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. My ex called me up after and told me that I'm no better than a dictator right now and that I'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what I want.

&#x200B;

All I want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. AITA here?

Edit:

Wow, did not expect this.

I have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. Before I say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because I see the same question sent to me and I don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

I do not have a problem with my daughter getting a LA degree.

If my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, I would support her 100%. I don't care what my daughter does with her life. I just want her to do something with her life. I am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. The least I feel I can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. I get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. And many of you have told me that I should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. For those two last points, I feel you are wrong.

This money that I have saved is not a ""gift"". This is what I have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. This is my investment in her. For people who claim that I should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, I respectfully disagree. Giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing I could do for her right now. Supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. And the fact that she seems to think that I am owed no explanation and that I should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment I am making in her.

I am not arguing whether or not I am wrong. If you all feel I am an asshole for this, then I will accept that.

&#x200B;

I called my daughter and left a message saying that I wish to talk with her about this and that I feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. If my daughter wants to go into LA, then that is her choice. Weather or not I pay for it will be mine.",6891,19918,0.86
521,Everyone Sucks,"I just *clicked* with my MIL. It is actually amazing bc my mom passed away when I was little and I admit I was happy when she started to get involved in our lives after she warmed up to me. Now we are 3 years in, planning a wedding & my MIL is overjoyed and even proposed to cover most of the wedding expenses.

Needless to say, I always felt I ""lucked out"" on a MIL.

Thing is, my bf is not the only son of my MIL. There is also a younger son who is already married (5 years) and I have to admit... The way MIL treats me and his wife, let's call her Kate, is like day and night.

With Kate she is cold, unwelcoming, sometimes even passive-agressive. At first I thought it is because Kate is just as cold and mean to MIL but I got a short version of the story from my bf after some coaxing. Apparently MIL simply disliked Kate from the very beginning and as the relationship got closer to marriage MIL got progressively colder until she outright encouraged the brother to break up with her because he can do better than Kate. That got shutdown real quick so MIL just settled on making it clear to Kate that she disapproves of her by simply ignoring her, excluding her or acting very coldly yet polite enough so bringing it up seems like an overreaction. 

I actually kept a friendly relationship with Kate from the get go and Kate sometimes ranted about the ""monster-in-law"" but otherwise seemed to be happy at least MIL isnt mean to me. But...recently during family dinner (FIL's birthday) when Kate was present, MIL said how happy she is that I will finally be an official part of the family and, since we seem to not be able to settle for an engagement ring (we got engaged without it), she would like to give me her grandmother's ring as she ""finally has a daughter to give it to"".

After hearing that Kate stormed out with her husband on her tail. Later I called Kate and when she finally picked up she said that she is done with me and MIL. She screamed a lot but a short version is that I am just as bad as MIL in treating her like shit because I keep taking whatever MIL gives me and never tell her off for being ""a cruel and petty woman"". I apologized but she said that if I want to apologise I need to do it with *the* ring. I said it's not mine to give. It ended at that.

I feel guilty for never speaking out on it but is it really an asshole move to not sour a good relationship with my MIL over a bad relationship she has with Kate?

522,Not the A-hole,"About a month ago, [I learned that most of my friends were not planning on attending our mutual friend's wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d2x3h0/no_one_wants_to_go_to_my_friends_wedding/). Yesterday, the groom texted me that the last RSVP holdout (Florida guy) had regretfully passed on his invite, leaving me the only one from our circle of friends to attend. Six were invited, including me. 

This does not change my desire to attend the wedding at all. I love this guy. We've made some lifelong memories. We've traveled to the other side of the planet together. I'd drop what I was doing and hop a train to be there for him if he called and told me that he needed me.

That being said, I'm feeling a little awkward about attending his wedding alone. I know none of his home friends, college friends, law school friends, and there's a solid chance I've collectively spent more time talking to his grandmother over the years than anyone in his immediate family. As a generally introverted individual, I can't really see this being a very comfortable situation for me to ride out alone. 

The reception is going to be at one of the more exclusive, upscale event spaces in the city. For as glitzy and rousing an affair as I expect this couple to have, I don't know that I'll have an enjoyable night without a friend there to enjoy it with me.

If it's worth anything, my girlfriend and I have been dating for over ten years, and she's met the groom a dozen times. We've cooked him dinner and sat Shiva with him when his grandfather passed, so this isn't me trying to get an invite for my recent Tinder match. 

I know nothing of what it takes to plan a wedding, so if I'm way out of line, feel free to bash me for being outlandish. I don't know if more people declining their invite is usually a welcome relief or an opportunity to invite people on the periphery. 

Would it be appropriate to text him something along the lines of one of the following:

> *If after you guys tally the RSVPs and sort out the table assignments, you think it'd be possible for me to bring Becky as a plus one since the five of them can't make it, I'd appreciate having someone to dance with so I don't creep out any of the children.*

*
> *I feel really awkward asking, but, if after you guys finalize the guest list you think there'd be a spare chair for me to bring Becky since the five of them can't make it, I know she'd love to be there when you and Jess get married.*

*
 
>  *Not sure if it's possible at this point, but if after you guys do the guest math, you feel like you could manage to give me a plus one, let me know. I'd love to have a partner in crime for the night, but I totally understand if that doesn't work into the plans.*

523,Asshole,"We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up. 

AITA for thinking everything should stick to the original plan? My wife disagrees with me.",1753,5978,0.9

For reference of how much time has gone by, we're both 21 now.  We've not seen each other since she moved away after 8th grade. We live in different states now. She was really cruel to me in the way only middle schoolers can be. I had loved school before she entered my life and, after her, it took me a few years to come to like it again. She would do things like take my books from me and throw them in puddles, which I know sounds like a minor thing, but it took me a long time to be able to build up the courage to purchase and read those particular books again. I was a little bit on the heavier side- not much- but that became something she talked about a lot. I was very bookish, which was something else she got on me for. Strangely enough, me being really good in PE and among the fastest runners in our grade was something she would mention as a bad thing? Either way, she made me feel bad about myself academically, athletically, about my interests, and as a person for 3 years. I haven't thought about her much recently, but her message made me remember all the joy of school she took from me.

526,Not the A-hole,"Background:

Me - 34m, Her - 34f. Been together 4.5 years. Lived together 3 years. No Kids. 

Yesterday was my birthday and I really don't like to do much to celebrate. At our age a nice dinner out at a place picked by whoever is celebrating and a card is more than enough for me. A gift is always nice, but I don't expect much. She has always been kind of a bad gift giver in that she never knows what to get, or picks something strange that I would never want/need. Of course for me it is only about the thought and I was raised to only show gratitude when given a gift, so I've never made a fuss or been upset in the past. 

When it comes to her birthdays I usually make little notes in my phone in the months leading up to it when she mentions something she wants. My gifts always go over very well and she is always happily ""surprised I remembered"". I also always ask her well in advance where she'd like to go for dinner and make all the arrangements. I make these notes and have reminders or I'd also forget. It takes very little effort to do this though.

The Issue:

She totally forgot my birthday. Like we woke up together (I arranged to have the day off of work so we could spend it together as she was off too) and I just went about my normal morning routine waiting for her to say something. She never did. It wasn't until she noticed my phone going off with friends/family sending me birthday messages that she asked who kept texting me and I told her. 

She got upset and apologetic once she realized what happened, but to me I was just hurt and her apology really didn't help that. 

She started asking ""what would you like for your birthday??"" and I just said ""don't worry about it, but maybe next year try and remember."" She then asked where I'd like to go for dinner, but again I was pretty hurt and didn't feel like going out or honestly sitting across from her at the table pretending not to be a hurt/upset. So I told her I didn't feel like going out and we could just stay in and make dinner at home. Basically I just needed some time to myself after all of this to get over being upset. 

Well she then got upset and told me I was just trying to make her feel bad, it was an honest mistake, etc. I said I'd prefer not to discuss it further and that the day was pretty much a write-off. The best gift now would be to just let me relax and maybe get some gaming time in. So that's where we left it and she's still upset at me today. In all honesty I never said I was mad at her, never got snippy, I was just hurt (something that is very rare for me as I tend to be quite stoic and rarely show feelings). 

So AITA for making her feel bad because I didn't want to do any of her last second ideas?

527,Asshole,"So my wife and I have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years total, living together almost the entire time. For the longest time, we‚Äôve had pretty much the same ‚Äúroutine‚Äù when we get into arguments. Usually it starts out with me either forgetting to do something or doing something wrong, she sees it, lets loose on me about it, and decides that it‚Äôs now a good time to bring up all the other shit I do or have done since our last argument that bothers her. I do my best to listen but once we reach the point where she‚Äôs laying it on too thick or I feel like she‚Äôs being unfair, I leave the house. If it‚Äôs a Friday or Saturday I just got for a long walk around the neighborhood and come back a couple hours later. Any other day of the week I‚Äôll drive to my job, which I have a key for, and try to catch up on some paperwork for a couple hours. I then go back to the house. Usually by then she has calmed down, but if not my last resort is to go stay at a friend‚Äôs house or I‚Äôll go back to work and sleep in the empty retail space upstairs, I‚Äôve actually got a pretty cool setup there with an air mattress and a travel toiletries kit I put together last year. 

Despite the fact that we get into these arguments, we have what I would call a pretty good marriage. 6 weeks ago, it changed a lot because my wife gave birth to a little boy, our son. She‚Äôs got another 6 weeks of maternity leave, I had 2 weeks off then I had to go back to work. Last night we got into our first big argument since he was born. I went through my usual routine, and ended up deciding I needed to sleep at work that night. When I woke up this morning, I had dozens of angry texts and a few missed calls (my phone automatically goes to Do Not Disturb after midnight) from my wife. She was pissed that I‚Äôm still ‚Äúpulling this crap‚Äù after the baby was born. She‚Äôs always understood my routine before, and actually at one point said she was happy that I‚Äôm able to turn a bad night into a good morning (because I get extra work done and I‚Äôm always on time the next day). I get that she would want help with the baby but he was fine when I left, he was asleep in his bassinet and he had just had his diaper changed and drank a full bottle of milk about an hour before that. I can‚Äôt stand to be in the house when she‚Äôs going on her rants and I don‚Äôt see why I should have to sit there and take it from her just because at some point in the next few hours she might need help with something. Maybe she should‚Äôve thought about that before she decided to belittle me. I love her and my son and I‚Äôd be happy to help with any of his needs but I have to stand up for myself, I‚Äôm not going to be a pushover and let her walk all over me just because her hormones are acting up.

532,Everyone Sucks,"I‚Äôm 28. I had one miscarriage with an accidental pregnancy with my ex 6 years ago. It turned out to be a blessing because my ex was verbally abusive and psychological. I was pretty emotional about my miscarriage at the time so I understand how heartbreaking it is. We‚Äôre going to call my older sister Julia. She is 8 years older then me and has a twin Peggy. Peggy has two kids. They are miracles . Peggy had her first child and then 4 miscarriages after before having her son. Julia was quite rude to us not really caring about our miscarriages and making comments like get over it. All that changed until she lost her first pregnancy.she never apologized for how she treated ya but wanted all the attention and sympathy for her own miscarriage. Julia has one son who is almost two. She has subsequently suffered 4 more first trimester miscarriages since then. She gets pregnant almost immediately but can‚Äôt sustain them. She‚Äôs seeing a fertility specialist who has done genetic testing. I feel bad for her. Everyone has suggested to her to take some time off trying to conceive and let her body heal. She‚Äôs had two miscarriages since June. We recognize her losses and reach our and ask what we can do to help her. Even if it‚Äôs just watching her son 

I don‚Äôt want children anymore. I had the start of cervical cancer so I may not be able to have any anyway. For some women this is a huge loss, for me I feel okay in the fact I may not have kids. They aren‚Äôt a huge want for me. My sister has known this before she even got pregnant. I like having the  freedom to sleep in on days off etc. freedoms having a child would take away. 

Julia came to visit yesterday. Julia has a very strained relationship with everyone. She‚Äôs very rude,condescending, pushes peoples buttons and just acts ultimately that she‚Äôs above everyone.

Yesterday she said something that really pushed my buttons. I lost my dog and cat in a month period due to old age and medical conditions. They were my babies. She said you can just get a new one.

533,Asshole,"So some background. My (25M) girl (25F) and I have been together for 2 and a half years. She has a 8 year old son from her previous relationship. We just had a daughter in December of last year who's 9 months now. 

There's a fair that comes to town for 2 weeks every year, always at this time. (Google Dixie Classic Fair)

I've been looking forward to it for a multitude of reasons. One of them being seeing my daughter react to the petting zoo, all the animals they have, and getting to see some unique things. We take her to feed horses about once every 2 week because she's completely fascinated by animals. Even cats or rabbits so we knew large animals would impress her.

I want to get to enjoy the fair one time with just the 3 of us. Slow walking the fair and getting to spend the day as a date of sorts. Her son is at school weekdays so my suggestion was a time when he was still at school. 

She is pissed at me for this. Telling me he's part of the family and we can't exclude him from activities like this. For the record, my suggestion was to go more than once. It's not like I don't want to go with him, or don't think he should go. He's just so hyper, and is going to want to ride all the rides, which is awesome, and I can't wait to get to do that with him. I just also want one trip where it's relaxing and we get to just experience this with the baby. I don't see anything wrong with us taking more than one trip, one with him as a whole family, and one with just us three while he's at school.

535,Asshole,"I (23F) started a new job in the last two months. Because of this I don‚Äôt have paid sick days until my three month probationary period is over. Two weeks ago I got an awful cold, like the worst cold I‚Äôve ever had. Hacked non-stop, blowing my nose etc. In my job I interact with a new group of 10 people everyday, in a small classroom in a large hospital. 

I felt bad going to work and wanted to stay home to protect other people from getting sick, but I‚Äôm not going to miss out on 3 days pay. I may have been coughing but I was capable of doing my job. They should give me sick days if they want to protect other people. I was careful to cover my mouth with my elbow when I coughed and used lots of hand sanitizer.

However, I could have afforded to miss a few days work, I have a good savings account and wouldn‚Äôt have been evicted or not be able to buy food if a missed a few days. They could have easily found coverage for me for those days.

Today I received the survey results from the people who were in the classroom two weeks ago. There were two comments that said that 1) my coughing was disruptive 2) they didn‚Äôt want to be near me as they didn‚Äôt want to get ill and it made them uncomfortable I was in the class. 

AITA for going to work with a really bad cold?


Edit: Hi everybody, thanks so much for your feedback. It looks like I am the asshole in this situation! I actually agree with that.

I think the reason I posted this is that I have been feeling more and more guilty that I went to work that ill. I‚Äôm not sure I realized how ill I was until after it was over. I thought I was sticking it to my employer by going to work sick, but I was just punishing innocent people for a bad policy. 

My previous job I was paid more and had more sick days, and I think I was a bit bitter about that, for this reason was vehemently against taking any time off.

I am new to working in healthcare, and have no healthcare background, and didn‚Äôt think about the consequences of working whole being ill in a hospital.

I probably would have recovered faster by getting more sleep and resting (I wake up extremely early for my job and was barely able to sleep due to my cough those days).

Stacy said she didn‚Äôt realize she had run out of personal days. She then asked if she could take a 1-day bereavement period. Now, we do have a policy for death.

I‚Äôm an American currently living in Denmark, and have been for the last few years.

When I first moved here, of course I felt very homesick and every year made sure to celebrate American holidays. One year, I invited my new Danish friends to celebrate July 4th with me. I had a very cheap American flag hanging up on a wall as part of the decor, and one of my friends wrote ‚ÄúHappy 4th!‚Äù on it. Others soon followed, writing messages.

It‚Äôs become a tradition now and every year, I bring out the flag for my July 4 party for friends to sign and write a fun memory from the party. It‚Äôs become one of my favorite keepsakes. 

This year, we had a new American colleague at work and I invited her to my party so she could feel at home and meet new people. All was well until she noticed the flag, with all the messages, and FLIPPED. Started screaming at me, calling me a disgrace, that I destroyed/disrespected a symbol of freedom etc. 

At the time I thought she was nuts and asked her to leave. Months later, she still won‚Äôt speak to me unless it‚Äôs work related.

My intention was never to disrespect the flag, my country, or the sacrifices it symbolizes. But I also know that‚Äôs no excuse and I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I should put the flag away for good. To be fair, I just looked up flag code and it seems that marking the flag at all is a violation, so she was correct.

Truthfully, although I love America and respect those who the flag represents, I‚Äôve never fully understood the obsession with the flag either. So it‚Äôs entirely possible I‚Äôm just being a dick.

Saturday morning comes and everything seems fine. I told her I would do some work in my bedroom (project dates had changed) and we could hang out after. She goes back to the guest room and only comes out when I call her.

Time comes for her to get ready, she gets her things and goes to shower. I pass through the guest room (the door was closed up until this point), door is open and I see she had been keeping all the dirty dishes/cups and trash in the bedroom. There's a LOT of them so she must have been doing it since she arrived on friday night. I waited for her to come out of the bathroom and tell her that she needs to clean it up before she goes. She says she'll be late for the party. I tell her she can either do it and be late or she can try to get out of it and stay at home.

She tried to convince me she would do it once she got home but I told her she should just do it now or else she would be REALLY late. She started throwing a tantrum saying that I was being an asshole and I should just let her go because mom and dad had already allowed it. I tell her this would be her last chance before I didn't let her go. She doubles down and that's when I tell her she won't be leaving and now she can choose when she'll clean up the room. There's a lot of crying and yelling but eventually she quiets down. I locked the front door (I live on the 4th floor) and kept the keys on me. I also notified our parents of what had happened.

Sunday morning comes and she has been in the room ever since. Our parents were coming to pick her up in the afternoon, so first thing I do is to check on her. The room is clean but I can see she had a rough night cause her face is super swollen for crying. I felt bad at this point but it was already done.

To my surprise our parents arrived much earlier, once they saw she was sleeping they just started arguing with me about the whole thing. They said I could have handled it much better and had they seen the messages earlier they would have told me as much. The birthday girl was her best friend and she had helped plan the whole party as it would be a surprise for the girl. They understoodd my reasoning but they said I was too harsh and I could have punished her in other ways. They stuck around until she woke up, she did not look at me and they left.

Now I do feel like an asshole but at the same time I feel like I worked with the information that I had at the moment and what felt right.

Info: I did not knew that my sister had planned the party nor that it was her best friend's birthday. I only learned about it once our parents were back. I also did not leave the house with the keys, I was at home until she left with our parents. I also don't know when she did the dishes but I believe she did it once I went to sleep because she did not leave the room when I was awake.

More Info: Our parents don't share a lot about their situation at home so I don't know whether or not she's a good kid all the time. Some stuff has happened but I don't know how often or how well she deals with being confronted.",353,256,0.89

553,Everyone Sucks,"\*INFO edit at bottom of post\*

I (30F) am currently arguing with my bf (35M) about this issue, and we both agreed that Reddit will get final judgment here. We both share a huge workplace that has insanely expensive parking permits - think $500-1000 per year range. The parking permit for my parking lot sold out relatively quickly (\~2 weeks), and I didn't buy it in time. Instead, I was able to buy a ($200/year) permit that allows me to park 0.5-0.6 miles from my building. Because I drive home every day on lunch, I now have an additional 40min of walking added to my day (10 minutes walking each direction). I acknowledge that missing out on this permit was my own fault (because I wasn't initially sure I could afford it), and now deeply regret it. My bf, however, had his parking permit automatically renew and therefore has the ""good"" permit, which he pays about $500 per year for (I would pay approximately $800 per year for the same permit).

The argument comes from the fact that I have occasionally requested to borrow his ""good"" parking permit - on days where it's rainy, snowy, or where I have a ton of meetings/appointments/etc that I need to be on time for. So far this has been 3 days in the last two months. If I borrow his ""good"" permit, we BOTH get to park in the ""good"" lots - my bf just has to swing by a drive-through parking terminal and pick up a FREE temporary replacement permit. This takes him an additional five-ten minutes at the beginning of his workday.

I think it's not unreasonable to ask him to accommodate me here and occasionally let me borrow his permit. We live together and have been together for 4 years, and because I go home for lunch every day to walk our dogs, he is able to pull an extended workday. (Because I take a long lunch, my workday ends later than his.) This arrangement benefits us BOTH. However, he is extremely upset about me asking to borrow his permit. I have asked him to explain why it upsets him, and he has clarified that it is because it 1) inconveniences him, 2) the parking dept will become ""suspicious"" that he requests so many temporary permits (they won't - I used to work for them and they genuinely don't care), and 3) it's the principle - I had the chance to buy a better permit and now I'm asking him to go out of his way to accommodate ""my mistake."" He thinks that I'm lying about not being able to afford it - he thinks I just procrastinated on buying the permit (I kind of did procrastinate, I guess? Because I wasn't sure I was able to afford it?)

TLDR: I want my bf to go five minutes out of his way for something that benefits both of us. He thinks it's ridiculous to ask your partner to go five minutes out of the way. We both think the other person is being insane. Help us understand each other's point of view here.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Really appreciate the great responses so far! I added the following comment below about us potentially carpooling:

""We have talked about it, but we do work different hours (offset by about three hours) and I have an extremely variable schedule - i.e., occasionally I start my day expecting to work 8am-5pm and end up working 8am - 12pm. We also live far enough away that the bus lines are not an option. I suppose my bf could take the bus, since his hours are not quite as extreme as mine.

FWIW we both drive zero emission cars, so I feel somewhat less guilty about not carpooling.""

This comment should have said 8am-12am. As in, a 16 hour day. Sometimes I do get off as early as 330pm though, so it's not always a long day for me.

Both dogs belong to both of us (although one was his and one was mine before we got together).

Also, solely for the sake of this thought experiment...would it make a difference if we were married? I.e. if he was my husband, and unwilling to share a permit with his wife?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

DOUBLE EDIT: All right, I accept the ESH/YTA judgment. I will add a few things: dog walking and dog daycare are not options in our area. There is no obvious carpool solution, since we work different hours. I think people are overreacting to the whole permit thing -  I wouldn't have asked him if there was any real risk associated with it. In avoiding giving out identifying personal information, I might have not communicated this adequately: the parking dept is in no way connected to his employer and he was ABSOLUTELY NOT at any risk of getting fired. In an absolute worst case scenario, someone at the parking dept would write me a $40 ticket, which I would naturally pay, a stern warning might be issued, and then we would never engage in such a terrible horrible no-good abuse of the rules again. Sheesh.",115,84,0.85
554,Not the A-hole,"I manage a small cafe in a college town. We are one of the places who doesn't have WiFi because we only have 6 indoor tables and WiFi encourages people 'camping' tables all day, which is bad for business (we aren't one of those ""No WiFI, JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER!!!"" places, it's just better for turnover this way. EDIT to add: we don't ask patrons who spend a long time there to leave or try to rush them in any way).

We have one regular who I'll call Sam who comes in every day, without fail, and camps out for 4-6 hours. Sam is about 35 and I believe is a grad student or was one at the nearby University. He clearly thinks he is a beloved regular and talks to the staff/hangs out near the counter every moment he thinks we aren't busy and basically drives us crazy. This has been going on for almost a year but was especially bad all summer when our front of house staff was all female (just a coincidence based on who quit for the summer). He doesn't exactly flirt with us but he pesters us with personal questions and boring stories in a way he doesn't pester male staff.

During his 4-6 hour stay, he uses a WiFi... dongle thing he brings from home, laughs outloud at things he's reading online (and then comes up to the counter to tell us), tries to police other customers' behavior around tables/chairs/cream and sugar/trash, and just stares at us waiting to pounce when we don't have a customer at the counter. During all this, he buys one small cappuccino, no tip, and sometimes paws through our day-old stuff and tries to get us to toast/heat it 'for him' even though it's against the rules.

After months of me politely but firmly trying to correct his behavior, he tried to police a group who pushed two tables together saying 'That isn't how we do it here' (this isn't even a rule here!) and I snapped. I pulled him aside, told him he's been driving us crazy for a year, that me asking him to leave us alone while we work has fallen on deaf ears, and he's banned. He had a FIT of course but he did finally leave and hasn't been back.

The staff and actual beloved regulars are split. Some feel bad for him because they think he's just a lonely dork and he didn't really break any hard and fast rule. My two favorite regulars and all of the female front of house staff are happy but the male staff members and other manager (who doesn't work during Sam's 'visiting hours') think I was too harsh. Our other banned customers are banned for like, putting poop on the bathroom walls or stealing, so being annoying isn't a capital offense, but I really believe his annoyingness was bad for business and staff morale.",1023,10492,0.97

556,Everyone Sucks,"My ex husband of three years doesn‚Äôt believe that our two oldest children are his. He has been telling people this, including the partner of the oldest child. The oldest has basically been disowned, and is hurt by by this. The children, all adults, are all his children. The youngest child adores the father, and doesn‚Äôt know he is acting like this towards the siblings. WIBTA if I got DNA test results and published them in a public way? In the local paper or on Facebook? This post is a rewrite of a post to Advice. Thanks

INFO: I did not cheat during my marriage. Turns out that he did. He has previously accused me of the older children being someone else‚Äôs, I told him that he could set up the DNA test and I would pay. This didn‚Äôt happen

EDIT: My plan is to have a conference call with the children in a day or so (when I can get through the next conversation without losing it) and just ask them what they want to do. Reddit is right. I would be TA if I published, and although some kind of slap down might feel good in the short term will do nothing for the children longer term.

557,Asshole,"I'm actually half black, but unlike the rest of my family I'm pretty pale which has been a source of amusement since I was a child. No, my mother didn't cheat (she's the black half of the relationship), but most people usually assume I'm latino or from some foreign country, or that my brothers are from another father and my mother must be white. Like I said, I've always found it pretty funny and so has everyone else. My nickname growing up was white boy and I've always called my older brother darkie in response to that, and it's always been cool. I spend far more time with the black side of my family given my father isn't very close to his own, and consider myself black personally. 

Recently while out with workmates my brother gave me a call and we started up with our usual carry on. When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee. At this point I got pretty annoyed and told her I could introduce her to my entire n\*\*\*\*r family if it'd calm her down.

She absolutely flipped out at this and actually stormed out of the place we were eating. A few of my (white) friends were pretty uncomfortable after this and said that I shouldn't have said that word. I see no problem with using a word I've grown up with and hear weekly from my family members and black friends.

Apparently she decided to contact our boss over what happened, because I got a text from him yesterday telling me he wants me to come in for a chat before my next shift. A few of my other co-workers have told me she's been talking about it with the rest of the crew and is still in an outrage over it.

When I told my brother about what happened and what I said to her he found it absolutely hilarious. He's even volunteering to go into work with me to meet my boss and hang around the place so the new girl can get a eyeful. The rest of my family also think the situation is funny, but my girlfriend thinks that's just because they know me and other black people might find it offensive given I don't look 100% african.

560,Not the A-hole,"I dont get along with my in laws. Long story short, they treated their golden child and her spouses like God, while my spouse is the scapegoat child and they treat me like shit. 

We have been married for 6 years, together for almost a decade now. Way longer than the golden child marriages. My in laws never tried to get to know me. For me, they are strangers, who act like assholes all the time. 

Our wedding was a turning point where i realized MIL does NOT give a shit about me. All i could remember from our wedding was the dramas MIL and SIL pulled over us. That was a heart break, i tried so hard to belong in his family, only to get dragged down, stepped on, and shat on. 

My spouse told me to get over it. Just because HE got over it, doesn‚Äôt mean i have gotten over it. Does that mean my feelings dont matter? I could forgive but i could never forget.

I have gritted my teeth and show up to family gatherings out of obligation. I pretend to be nice and smile, even when my in laws continuously gave me snides remarks. People around them let me know that they always talked trash about me, yet i put my Stepford wife mask on and smile. 

But i just can‚Äôt do that anymore. 

I had medical issues this year (tumors). MIL joked about it and putting it down like my health doesn‚Äôt matter. That‚Äôs when it clicked in me. They never give a fuck about me, why should i give a fuck about them? 

Fuck my in laws.

I dont know why i played nice when they continuously treat me like shit. 

I have not met my in laws since 3 months ago, and it has been the best. fucking. thing. ever. I have never been happier. There is only me and my work to focus, and i am on a fucking roll. 

Recently, MIL told my spouse that he‚Äôs not allowed to come to her house unless he brought me. Well, fuck her. I dont give a shit about coming to her house. Her house always smells like farts anyway, they never flush toilet in that house. 

The truth is MIL is afraid of losing her face in front of her friends. Everyone knew her daughter‚Äôs first divorce was caused by her controlling ass. She has many gossipy crotchety friends.

I know i am ranting. My spouse kept telling me, it‚Äôs just a ‚Äòdinner‚Äô. He never asked me if i want to have dinner with his family or not, he straight up said we‚Äôre having dinner with his family next week. 

Well, its not just a ‚Äòdinner‚Äô then, its an ambush. His family wanted to show up at our place. MIL has only been to our place twice in the 7 whole years we‚Äôre married. Why now? I can no longer stand MIL posting pictures with me like we‚Äôre ‚Äòone happy family‚Äô. We‚Äôre fucking NOT. She has made it blatantly clear that i am NOT her family. 

It gets to the point where i am thinking of renting a hotel room out of town just to get the fuck away from this dinner. I love my spouse, but i dont belong in his family.",80,243,0.94

562,Not the A-hole,"I and my girlfriend have been in a relationship since last 11 months, last month her childhood friend proposed her on Whatsapp all of a sudden, it was quiet unexpected to her. So she forwarded me the chat and asked me what to reply, I told her to let him know about us as the reason of rejection. To which she agreed but later on changed her decision and told him to give her some time to think. It was quiet clear to me that she had a soft corner for him as they grew up together, studied in the same school, although she had no feelings for him. That guy kept messaging her every day after that(and even flirted with her). This made me very uncomfortable and insecure about our relationship so I added him on Facebook and sent him a message telling him a about our relationship and also asking him to leave us be, not hampering the state of our healthy relationship. He reacted weirdly to this and texted my girlfriend telling her what i sent him, also told her i was rude, and it would have been easier for him if she told him about our relationship instead of me. My girlfriend was angry with me about this, didn't talk to me a whole day and apologized to him on my behalf. In spite of all this happening he continued texting and flirting with her after few days even started calling her at night. This was the point where I became mad and completely infuriated. I texted him cursing him, telling him to fuck off. This is where his fuckery stopped. But on the other hand this started an argument between me and my girlfriend, which profusely affected the health of our relationship. She nowadays gets easily mad at me, we have arguments over trifling matters. In brief our relationship isn't as healthy as it used to be.

564,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. 

About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. 

So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?

ETA: some questions people keep asking: 
1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 
2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3231,28889,0.88

567,Not the A-hole,"Okay this one sounds bad but hear me out (famous last words on AITA; I know). First off, I‚Äôm a lesbian. My fianc√©e Kate‚Äôs brother Charlie ID‚Äôs as a transwoman. He lives with their parents. I initially met Charlie about 7-8 years ago; he was 15 and gay then. At about 19 he became friends with this 16yo girl who is every LGBT-Tumblr-related nightmare of a stereotype you can imagine, and I say that as someone who is gay myself. He joined her friend group of similarly extreme teenagers and started dating her and calling himself pansexual. He got anxiety before every date and they never kissed.

He kept these friends and about 3 years later he met a polyamorous FtM and they briefly dated. Lo and behold, just as he was suddenly pansexual after dating the pansexual girl, after dating someone trans he was trans too. His mother talked with him about it and he basically thinks that wanting to do feminine things means he‚Äôs a woman. He has told me he doesn‚Äôt have dysphoria and that he doesn‚Äôt need it to be trans. Now he‚Äôs on hormones and frankly he‚Äôs become a total nightmare of a person. I pointed out the sexism of his beliefs about women once and that devolved into him yelling at me over and over again to shut the fuck up. Once I slipped up and made a joke in the vein of ‚Äúoh its 3 girls vs 1 guy‚Äù while playing a video game and I got read the riot act about how I was being really shitty. So after those incidents, I was getting pretty sick of having to be around him at all, because it‚Äôs obviously not fun to tiptoe around someone or to get yelled at.

This has gone on for a year, and the final straw was a few days ago. I write YA books for lesbians for a living and that's something that's very close to my heart because when I was growing up I didn't have any books like that to help me feel less alone so I wanted that to change. He texted Kate asking to borrow books, specifically asking for romances about young teen lesbians. He is 23. I thought it was so creepy, and when I told Kate so, she agreed completely and ignored him, but he's asked her two more times since and evidently won't let it go.

Anyways, I just know we will fight the instant anything about these issues comes up, and it seems to keep coming up every time I visit nowadays. And while I think he's become awful to be around, and I'm not sure I care too much about maintaining a relationship any longer, I want to generally keep the peace with Kate‚Äôs family, who I have known for so long now and will know for the rest of my life. It seems that the best course of action is to avoid a conflict by avoiding Charlie, but to do that I also have to avoid Kate‚Äôs parents until Charlie moves out, though of course they are welcome to visit us. Thanks to everyone who got this far btw; I know it's a mess. I just need an outside perspective. AITA?

EDIT: Alright, I tried to engage with a lot of people here in hopes of seeing different viewpoints, so thanks to everyone who commented, other than that one who said I'm a hateful person. One thing I want to make clear: A lot of people were upset about my misgendering. Charlie still goes by male pronouns, at least around family, and has not made a single attempt to correct anyone in the year since they've started transitioning. I see Charlie maybe once every other month and the parents Charlie lives with still use male pronouns when I visit, as does his sister, family friends, etc. It's not me deliberately being an asshole; it's just not an issue for Charlie irl, at least not one that's been vocalized around family, and I didn't realize how upset it would make everyone online who did not know the situation.

I really like his family and I like spending time with them, but to be honest whenever I go there I don‚Äôt really feel like I had a weekend or a vacation at all, because I am a person who enjoys being on my own, but whenever we go to his parents house I need to stay in the living room with them all the time, because apparently it‚Äôs rude to go to the room when they are still in the living room, so basically until they go to sleep we need to stay with them, have every meal with them and go everywhere with them, which I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with if it wasn‚Äôt so often.  
But I just feel it‚Äôs tiring to be with my in laws all the time... I also come from a family which consists only of my mom and I, my mom is very young  (40 years old) and we‚Äôre honestly just best friends so I always feel very comfortable around her, but my husband‚Äôs parents are in their 60 and also they are asian so I am not very comfortable around them because they are a more conservative family who really respects their elders so I just feel anxious being around them for so long.

571,Not the A-hole,"My (21F) father is rude to serving staff. He can be very passive aggressive and sarcastic. I was, ironically, raised to treat people with this status with respect, since they cater to my demands. 

I find it mildly irritating that he snaps when he pretends to be nice, persistently asks for a discount and doesnt get it. I'll be upfront, we have no need for discounts, we're generally a very well off family. However it gets tedious when he constantly demands little cuts in prices and his attitude flips when he doesnt get it. 

Also, he speaks in a very curt manner to them (rather than the ""firm but polite"", that i'm accustomed to), and tuts or curses them off when the slightest inconvenience happens. 

The nail in the coffin was when he sat in grim dissatisfaction, and was overall just cold, after one of our maids had a short exchange with the waiter, in their language. After, he made mockery  of her and asked to speak to the manager about controlling waiting staff. 

He's the arab, male embodiment of a Karen. 

I did try telling him several times that it was rude and comes across very spoilt and fragile when he uses this language, but he dismisses it or gets angry when i confront him. Naturally, that also pisses me off. My mother gets pissed off and told me to simply leave it as they should have been doing their job. I'm at loss to see exactly how our maid and...every single serving staff we've encountered have **failed** to do their job?

572,Asshole,"This happened kind of recently and shes still a bit upset with me so I dont really know if I was wrong or not. 

We‚Äôve been dating since high school, and currently we go to college, although we go to different ones. We‚Äôre not too far apart, but I only see her during breaks because I‚Äôm busy studying and working. I visited her once last year for a few days. She casually mentioned coming to visit me, because she has more free time, but I dont think I really want her to visit because then I‚Äôll have to entertain her and I wont have enough time to study. I told her this and she got kind of quiet and then asked about planning something for our break. Our breaks only overlap for a few days to a week, so I know I‚Äôll be too tired to want to do anything. I didnt say that though, I just kind of said I didnt really want to talk about it. 

I guess this was the wrong answer, because she started talking about how we never do anything and that I just dont want to do things with her. Its not that, I just dont always know how busy I‚Äôll be. Its not my fault I dont know when I‚Äôm going to be free. And all my money goes to bills and other stuff. She wanted to plan vacations or trips for our breaks but i dont really want to do that, I just want to go home and relax. 

Lately its like shes making some friends and now she wants more and more from me. Plan stuff for our anniversary, stuff for christmas, stuff for birthdays. She said that we‚Äôre not in high school anymore and that we should put more effort into our relationship, and even more effort because we‚Äôre ‚Äúlong distance‚Äù, but Im fine with how things are. She was fine with it last year, too, but now that she has all these friends she acts like its not enough anymore.

 To her I probably seem like a huge asshole, but I dont think I am. I‚Äôm just busy and really dont have the time to be planning trips or whatever. She made it into a huge deal though, which makes me think maybe I am the asshole. So AITA for being too busy for my girlfriend?

edit: holy wall of text batman

EDIT (again): I didnt just see her once in the past year. We see each other during breaks when we‚Äôre both in our home town. Our breaks dont always overlap, so sometimes i only see her once or twice, sometimes i see her 10 times. Also, i exaggerated how close our campuses are, because I didn‚Äôt think it really mattered. We‚Äôre 600 miles apart, which is like 2 days of driving (for me if I had a car, which I dont) or something like a ridiculous 16 hour bus ride, which she would take and I think thats too long to be on a bus so I dont want her to. Just wanted to mention because i think I worded things confusingly.",125,119,0.84
573,Everyone Sucks,"Recently I went grocery shopping and went to put my groceries away in the kitchen. My roommate was cooking dinner for that night and also meal prepping for the week so the kitchen was quite busy with food and items all over. I put my food away and noticed that there were some leftovers in the fridge that needed thrown away while I was making room for new food. While my roommate was cooking, I emptied the leftovers and put the containers in the dishwasher. Then I took the trash out as the bag was full. I returned and heated up dinner using a microwave and a food processor. The food processor went into the dishwasher. Later, I overhear complaining that I filled the dishwasher, thereby making it impossible for roommate to put all the pots and pans from meal prepping in once roommate was done and got rid of leftovers while roommate was cooking which was ""unappetizing."" I conceded that I should have begun running the dishwasher in anticipation of this need but I am not sure I should have either held off eating dinner or putting dishes in the dishwasher at all. I figured that after the 30-minute wash cycle, we could just refill it again but roommate washed all dishes by hand instead. As a good will gesture, I put away all of the dishes from both the dishwasher and the drying rack but I still can't parse out whether I was just entirely thoughtless or if I made reasonable moves in the kitchen.",18,26,0.88
574,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend and I have been in an amazing relationship for a while now. We live together, and we're very happy with the life we've created for ourselves. When we first got together, his ex didn't take it so well. When they broke up it was semi mutual as they both understood they had unsolvable issues, but he instigated it. They had been broken up for only a few months when we got together and they were still on good terms. They would chat occasionally and I was totally fine with this. However, when things got serious between us it clearly crossed a line because she started being rude to him and essentially just crossing boundaries so he cut her off.

He just stopped all communication, but she would occasionally email him. No more texts, but she'd send these long brooding poems that sort of waxed about what used to be or could have been. He was pretty confused by this and felt she was projecting or lonely as they had really both agreed at a certain point that it was best not to continue the relationship. We honestly both felt kind of bad for her as it's a hard situation to go through. He politely ignored it as responding just seemed to trigger further emails. And we weren't really worried about keeping up appearances as she lives across the country and we literally have no social connections in common. It should just be a clean cut.

Another poem was triggered when she saw we went on a trip to Europe together. Again, we cringed and ignored. Cue a year later to today (at this point we've been dating for two years) and he gets ANOTHER email! We were honestly both shocked. Again, it was sort of a non-commital poem, a sort of cry for attention where she was talking about their special connection and how she thought she saw him on the street and all the memories ""came flooding back"".

At this point, I was annoyed. Her self-flagellating musings about how she could have done better in their relationship and how her ""heart aches and the passing of time has only dulled her feelings"" feel to me like she is asking for him back in a roundabout way or at least looking for some validation that he feels some sort of nostalgia as well.

I trust him and he was very weirded out by the message, saying he felt like it was more for her benefit than his as well as calling it ""kinda gross"". He also is of the mind that again we should ignore it as a response would just validate her ploy for his attention.

I know it's probably a dick move but the worse parts of me want to message her and tell her to just get a goddamn journal or something. I'm sure she's sad but bringing that into our life and relationship is selfish and immature. It might be selfish and immature to throw it back at her as well - but I want to so bad. The mean girl in me wants to tell her to get a fucking life...in so many words.",33,50,0.89
575,Not the A-hole," I grew up in a strict religion, am not in it anymore. 

My (VERY religious) sister has helped me out a lot when I was younger. She bought me things, took me places, took me out to dinner and  loved me a lot. 

I really appreciate everything she did, but She uses it against me like she‚Äôs done so much and I do nothing for her. She‚Äôs really condescending and she ignores me when I don‚Äôt go to church, If I don‚Äôt do something she likes she ignores me or just guilts me, or cries until I apologize, Every time I see her she says I‚Äôm not happy and I need to change. 

She has done a lot for me and I love her. We have some really great memories. But I feel it‚Äôs a really controlling relationship and she doesn‚Äôt like who I really am, only what she thinks I could be. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to her but she always denies what she‚Äôs doing or saying she‚Äôs just misunderstood- Her intentions are good, therefore there should be no problem. End of conversation. So, I started distancing myself because I didn‚Äôt want her disappointment, and I just couldn‚Äôt be myself around her. I stopped calling and putting effort into the relationship. 

So a few months ago she came to visit and I told her I was done with the religion and said it was bullshit blah blah blah and basically told her I‚Äôm not talking to her until she quits her shit and treats me as an equal and stops trying to control me. 

It‚Äôs been 8 months since we last talked.

576,Not the A-hole,"Me and the spouse have been living with a roommate for as long as I moved in. My name and the spouses are on the lease. 

About 2 years ago, we got a new roomie in, one of spouses relatives. Despite not having enough money between me and the spouse, we were supposed to help financially support Roomie until he can care for himself. 

I did not mind at first. But the fact that Roomie always brings tons of people home, can be fairly loud, smokes weed, makes tons of messes and never cleans them up, etc, has gotten on my last nerve. I feel like I am doing most of everything in the house already, and now I feel like I am cleaning up after a grown adult. 

To make matters worse, Roomie often doesn't pay all of their side of the rent, stopped paying one of their bills 13 months ago, and never gives any explanation. In fact, getting bill money out of them is like pulling teeth, so I stopped trying. They are a grown adult, so I thought I would not have to demand and nag for basic rent and bill payments. I guess not. I have paid over 1300 dollars in money I do not have to pay for Roomies bills. 

I am constantly ranting at my spouse due to this, as it is their relative, but Spouse seems to be unwilling to do anything significant. 

We told Roomie 8 months in advance that we were moving from a 2 bedroom into a 1 bedroom. They said they would find a place by then. We asked over and over, and they aid everything was OK. 

Well, they moved into the 1 bedroom with us, with all of their crap, and is currently sleeping in the living room on the couch. for the past 5 months. 

I still get ignored every time that I mention all of the issues with him living with us, including the fact that the landlord has said that the house was too messy, and that stuff needs to be cleaned or else they will evict us. Spouse keeps mentioning things about roomie possibly being here next year, and every time it irritates me even more. But when I mention anything about it, I am tossed under the rug.

AITA for wanting him out? According to the way Spouse and family acts, I am just being a fuss bucket. But we live in a cramped 1 bedroom and 3 people and the Roomies friend, etc. My stress levels cannot handle all of this, and I am ready to explode. I already had at least 1 emotional breakdown. 

Maybe I am just the bad one here. Idk, what do you think?",32,37,0.87

He's been collecting unemployment for some time now.  So, when he was diagnosed with cancer she had to take FMLA which ate up her PTO.  They started a go fund me page to help with bills and got I think approximately $500.  I decided to give her $600 no strings attached.  

She texted me one day saying work had fucked up her check so her check was almost nothing.  I asked what happened to the go fund me money and she say that it was gone and they were still waiting on her husband's disability to go through.  I asked if she needed a loan and she said if I could she would appreciate it and asked for another $600.  I had the extra money and so I told her I could loan it to her and she could pay me back when she could.  

So a year passes.  Her husband's in remission and she hasn't even tried to pay me back yet.  I'm being patient but then she starts talking about getting a tattoo and buying a new dog and all I can think of is wtf you can afford all this stuff but you can't afford to pay me back even just a little.  

It comes to a head when her husband brought home a new dog and she acts like she's not happy about it but at the same time is showing off pictures at work of the dog saying how cute she is.  I'm a bit on fire now and text her asking if she's ever going to pay me back.  She texts back that she keeps telling her husband they need to but he doesn't listen.  I then proceeded to tell her that she just used me to which she called me a bitch and a shitty friend.  

Two days later she pays me back in full.  I'm not sure where the money came from but I took it.

I matched with a girl , after a few days of talking we decided to go out and I paid the bill that day.

After a few days when I asked for another date she declined . She started to sound kinda rude and always wanted to start a fight (wierd) which went on for a bit more than a week , so I decided to ask what's wrong and she said she has a boy friend and she feels guilty for coming out with me. She also added that we should stop talking , I was ok with that but I felt scammed so I asked her to pay half the bill from the first date for which she blocked me .

Which totally pissed me off so I texted her on other social media and made request in money sharing app . For which she called me ""a** hole"" and other things cause nice guys don't ask women to pay (WTF!) . I got so pissed off and called her liar and pig and eventually she paid up the money the same day.

We‚Äôve been separated almost two months and he is currently about one month sober. I put the background info as I feel it‚Äôs important. He recently had one death in the family and now his grandfather isn‚Äôt expected to make it much longer. They have always been very close. This will devastate him.

I have reservations for so many reasons. My concerns over his sobriety, the kids school, and quite frankly them going to another country without me.

It was late (around 1:30 a.m.), and my husband and I were really pissed (although we hid it as best we could).  We were super tired, and cleaning that blue shit off our carpet was the last thing we felt like doing.

The second time was last night.    This time, it was an almost full rum and coke.    The mess wasn‚Äôt as terrible to clean up, but this time the glass was almost full, so it covered our table, carpet, AND MY PHONE.   Luckily, my phone survived, and we were abele to clean everything up.

Both times, Craig expressed dismay, helped clean up, but didn‚Äôt say he was sorry for the mess.   Frankly, that pissed me and my husband off.

This morning, I looked online and found a collection of spill proof adult sippy cups for sale.

Also, my lunch is a 1PM, a 1.5 hour later lunch than it was last year.

Anyways, a few days ago on Thursday, I walked out of class when the bell rang because I was sick of that bullshit. While I was walking, she said loudly, ""Where are you going?"" And I said ""I'm going for my lunch, the bell rang.""

My(29F) bf(29M) got his first tattoo. It was a group thing with his very close friends where they all got a tattoo with the same theme. Not matching tattoos. His tattoo is meaningful because it was a group thing, but the design itself is light hearted. I have zero tattoos.

I was up late watching porn and saw a male actor with his exact same tattoo. I immediately screenshotted it and started to send it to him, but immediately reconsidered. 

I asked two tattooed friends if that‚Äôs something they would find funny themselves, or be bummed out about. My heavily tattooed friend said she thought it would be hilarious. My moderately tattooed friend said he‚Äôd hate it and that I should keep it to myself.

Again, this is not that serious, but I‚Äôd love to hear perspectives. The picture has been in my camera roll for weeks. Should I let it go?

598,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend (23) of 3 years and some of his mates got drunk a couple nights ago. One of them owns a tattoo gun. My name is Molly. The tattoo says Hollie. In large, thick, shaky black letters. It's about an inch high and 2 wide, and it's on the back of his shoulder. The first time he saw it properly was when I took a picture on my phone to show him.

My boyfriend, having seen the tattoo in all it's glory, was just sort of holding his head in his hands and was clearly upset. I tried to reassure him but he just went to take a shower. Before he went in he admitted he wasn't sure what to do with the tattoo.

I have a cousin who is a tattoo artist, and she has given both myself and my boyfriend tattoos before now. Due to how it was done - with a tattoo gun by a drunk friend - I was concerned about infection. He also wasn't sure what he wanted to do with it - removal, cover up, or leave it as it is. In the moment my cousin seemed like the best person to ask, so I sent her the picture with the caption ""\[boyfriend's name\] got this a couple nights ago. Drunk friend. Tattoo gun. At home. Any ideas?""

Her first reply was a few cry laughing emojis. Then she said ""change your name to Hollie"". Then she gave me some actually helpful advice, telling me that if we came by her tattoo parlour she would give us some stuff for aftercare and take a look at it. She said that when she took a proper look at it she could say for sure whether this was a removal, cover up, or tough luck situation.

My boyfriend got out of the shower, and I repeated what my cousin had told me. He then asked how she knew about it and I said that I sent her the photo. He didn't yell, or even get angry, but he said that he wished I hadn't done that or had checked with him first because now he looks like an idiot in front of my cousin. My cousin isn't the type to gossip and this photo won't go beyond me and her, but my boyfriend is upset that I shared it without asking him first as it is his tattoo. I was only trying to help, and he's said he'd have asked me to talk to her anyway, but it's the fact that I did it without asking first.

I'm not a selfish person and this is a lot of mouths to feed. I say I would like some nachos. They ask what kind of toppings would I like. I'm a simple man.

They brought back shredded cheese, shredded pork, tomatoes, onions, guacamole and sour cream. I politely asked where the cheese sauce was and the ground beef. They say they didn't want either of those and microwave nachos is easier to make. I politely decline the offer of dorm room nachos for my birthday dinner and they all say, ""I'm too picky,"" and that they got me nachos like I asked for so why am I being ungrateful?

My boyfriend and I are both in agreement that what she did was horrible and probably indicative of psychopathy. 

My boyfriend, my ex-friend and I all went to the same elementary school together. He ran into her a couple week ago for the first time in years and said hello.

A parent came in to the swing area with her daughter (4yo). I sense that she's approaching me:  


>Parent: Could I ask you a huge favor?  
Me: OK...  
Parent: Could you move to another swing?...   
Me: (Puzzled)  
Parent: My daughter likes that swing (motions to our swing) because it's a little bit longer than the others, and she likes to go really high. You're not even pushing \[your son\] that high.  
Me: (checks out our swing vs the other free swings)  
Parent: (notices what I'm doing) I know it's just, like, 3 chains longer.

The swing in question, on the right: [https://imgur.com/a/MgQG9eK](https://imgur.com/a/MgQG9eK) 

I don't make a decision immediately since I'm really trying hard to figure out if it really matters to her child that the swing may be a bit longer than the others. So she says to her daughter to just wait their turn until we finish using Swing 2.  


I swing my son maybe about 5 minutes more. I noticed that the swing beside me was about to be vacated. I'm thinking, oh great, another awkward couple of minutes with the parent.  


Another set of parent-child comes in the are, thinks there's some kind of line, asks the waiting parent of the 4yo if they're going to use any of the other swings. Parent replies that they're waiting for my son's swing.

She's kind of right on that last point about the time we've been on that swing, but I thought playground rules were that you give others a chance if there are no other free swings.

607,No A-holes here," My company took my team to another city for a week for a conference. It was an extended trip with a lot of free time, so we all did some fun things too and the trip turned out to be half work/half vacation. There is no beach in the city where I usually live, so I suggested that we all go to the beach one afternoon. At the beach, I stripped down to a bikini to sunbathe and go swimming. After I did that, a coworker pulled me aside and said that what I was wearing was inappropriate, that even though we had gone to the beach during the afternoon for fun, we had gone together as a team of colleagues and that we should not be dressed so ""unprofessionally"". 

I did not take him seriously, and just blew him off, I had a lot of fun that day at the beach. However things have escalated at work now, there have been complaints lodged about my lack of professionalism and inability to take criticism and change. Complaints have been lodged with hr and my boss right now. It is worth noting that none of the others were wearing a bikini, they were dressed way more conservatively, even at the beach. AITA?

Edit : A lot of the guys were wearing swim shorts and no shirt or just a pair of boxers. I don't know how that is appropriate, but I'm not? All the women were wearing more clothes though, not even just bathing suits. The women were wearing t shirts/shirts with longish shorts/capris/pants.

I‚Äôm very aware of how lucky I am and try extremely hard not to let any of it show. I never wear any flashy designer brands and typically never show off anything I buy. 


I‚Äôm a student in college right now and am roommates with a good friend of mine. However lately she‚Äôs been making more and more comments about my/my family‚Äôs status both around me and around other friends. 


For example I recently got a new MacBook and multiple times she‚Äôs brought it up in front of friends-‚Äúoh let X use her computer, must be nice to be born with a silver spoon like her‚Äù She‚Äôs also made some similar comments about surgeries I had to fix a birth defect-again, I was very lucky and received the best care but I don‚Äôt like it being brought up.

611,No A-holes here,"My (30F) 11-year-old daughter is on her third round of vegetarianism and I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end.

She has declared herself a vegetarian twice before and ended it suddenly a couple weeks in when she wanted to eat something non-vegetarian. In general, our household rule is that what‚Äôs made for dinner is the only option and no special accommodations are made, but the lady two times I did try to make it easier for her by adjusting dinner for her.

Needless to say it was annoying when she decided she wasn‚Äôt vegetarian for food she really liked. So when she came home from school and said ‚Äúguess what? I‚Äôm a vegetarian again!‚Äù I told her point blank I‚Äôm making no special accommodations she will be in charge of her vegetarianism.

It‚Äôs been about a week and she‚Äôs complaining of stomach pain. I keep our house stocked with healthy food, but just recently I have thrown away a bag of wilted lettuce, a barely touched container of hummus, like four bananas and apples are rotting on the counter as we speak. She chooses foods like popcorn, chips, muffins, etc. We had this same problem over the summer when I allowed her to prepare her own lunches. We ended up at the dr and it was confirmed her extremely poor diet is the problem. I told her today she has to go back to eating our dinners, meat and all, because she‚Äôs not capable of making her own healthy choices. I told her I can‚Äôt let her make herself sick and if she doesn‚Äôt start eating with the family I‚Äôm taking away her phone and other privileges.

She told me it‚Äôs my fault for not providing healthy vegetarian options. On one hand, I want to support her in her beliefs. On the other hand, I feel like vegetarianism is very much a trend she‚Äôs trying and I don‚Äôt have the time and energy to make it happen.

Also, I should add that she is a 6th grade girl with a really bad attitude at times which is normal, and I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant with my fourth child and out of patience and energy currently. I‚Äôm sure these contribute to the tension.

AITA?

ETA: I should have mentioned we encourage healthy eating, provide home cooked healthy meals nearly every night (some vegetarian, some not) and she has been taught how to do basic cooking and we are willing to buy ingredients and foods that are healthy and vegetarian for her. What I‚Äôm not willing to accommodate is cooking any separate food items for her at dinner time. I accept many people consider me TA for not helping her and taking her wishes more seriously.

What I‚Äôm struggling to accept is the number of people telling me I‚Äôm TA because I have too many kids, I let my kids eat muffins sometimes, or saying I‚Äôm neglectful and willing to let her be malnourished or that it‚Äôs my fault because I haven‚Äôt taught her to cook and don‚Äôt teach my kids about nutrition. That‚Äôs all stuff that‚Äôs being inferred without any proof.

Edit #2: It's been ruled NAH, but for the people still commenting ITA in regards to not investing that time and energy in her request, I see your point. For people saying I'm neglecting my child or suggesting that I don't even like her, please stop. Seriously. I'm a real mother who is trying her best and I absolutely love and adore my child. I understand I came to the internet looking for advice and opinions, but accusing somebody of not liking their child or malnourishing their child is so toxic and really does hurt the invisible people reading your comments.",674,1467,0.94

614,Asshole,"TLDR: My friend & her husband built a new house & it is cold & impersonal feeling; There are no decorations. I said we can go shopping together & she got offended. 

&#x200B;

My friend & her husband built their 1st house, they got the land 5 years ago after they got married, they lived with her folks while the house was built, & moved in in August. They had a housewarming party, & a lot of guests were saying how cute the house will be after they add decorations. 

My friend never had a ""modern/minimalistic"" taste, I'd describe her taste as ""old lady who likes flowers & cats"" & my own style as""modern/clean"".

I went to lunch at her house 4 days ago, & the only change in a month was she added 2 small plants to the kitchen window. There are no pictures on the walls, or end tables, no pillows or blankets on the sofa/chairs, no books or knickknacks. There are no decorations in her house, The walls are all gray or white & the house feels cold. The furniture is uncomfortable. All the floors are hard; Hardwood in most rooms & tile in the kitchen & baths. The 1 room that has carpet is Hubby's ""man-cave"" it has the same gray/white scheme; He has 1 plaque & 1 trophy on a table. She has a lot of trophies & awards from cheer now they are in storage, she was really proud of them. 

They don't have kids (can't), they do have a dog & a cat, but there is no furniture for the animals, no beds or cat tree. They do have food/water bowls for the dog in the kitchen (shoved in a cupboard) & food/water & a litter box in a closet for the cat.  They don't let animals on the furniture, or in the bedroom & man-cave. 

While I was there for lunch, I didn't mention the lack of decoration (she has chronic pain & depression) & it's hard for her to do things by herself. I said: ""We should go shopping for house decor together! I need things for my new place, & I bet you could find stuff too."" I didn't say I wanted to decorate her place, I didn't even mention her ""decorations"" at all. I just said we should go shopping together. She asked me ""what's wrong with my decorations?"" & I couldn't stop myself from saying ""You don't have any."" Then she pointed out every light fixture, doorknob, & drawer pull/handle & her two plants, saying the fixtures were decorative. (they are all plain & unremarkable)

I made an excuse to leave because she was acting weird. I don't think she's going through a depressive episode, but she's never turned down a shopping trip before.

It's not a $ issue; both work & have/make plenty. There is not a mortgage on the house since they had it built, & they were boasting at the party that they paid off their loan in June, so they're ""totally debt-free"". If it was about money; A vase for the end table & throw pillows & blanket for the sofa would not be much & would make it cosier & look nice!

I got a text this morning saying she ""forgave"" me for ""calling"" her house ""ugly"".

616,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I love each other to death. The issue we have is that I'm a very very sensitive person, and I don't deal with criticism well. Often I will immediately rebel and get upset, then think on it and do something about it, and even go to him and tell him, okay, you were right.

The thing is, I feel like I don't deserve all the blame. 

So in our latest argument, I just went and told him about how I wanted to go and help my mother put up wallpaper in a room so that I can get better at it for when he and I finally get a house together. It was meant to be sweet.  
Boyfriend goes ""yeah, that's nice BUT..."" then goes on to say, I can be good at certain things but I'm not great with details.  That I'm a big picture kind of person but I'm not good at the finishing touches, like, ""an artist would pay attention to every stroke"" I'm not that (\~\~so now he's also insulting my art).   
I get annoyed because I didn't really ask to be criticized, I just told him about something I'd like to do and improve on, and he just shot me down.

It turned into a fight because he often does this. I told him I wanted to do calisthenics, he said I was too weak for that and needed to stick to weight lifting first. I showed him my drawings, and he said it'd look better IF... and went on to compare my drawings with his sister's (his sister's are better because she does realistic style drawings with shading), there are other examples I can't remember right now.

It's come to a point where I don't want to tell him about some of my projects because I'm scared he will just shoot me down. Being creative is a big part of who I am and it's hard to deal with all the criticism, even if, to be fair, what he says is often valid. I'd just like him to be supportive I guess, and only offer criticism if I ask for it (or if it's about something that's causing problems in the relationship of course!).

I guess what I'd like to know is if I'm being way too sensitive and should just deal with his comments or if he should learn to filter himself and just be able to say ""that's nice"" and be happy for me and keep his thoughts that I won't do great to himself and just let me try...",60,140,0.94

The next day at around 12PM, my dad calls me and tells me that he and my mom are coming up to visit me and they were going to bring me an ironing board and 3 24-packs of bottled water. Again, I responded by repeatedly saying no and telling him that I didn't need an iron or the packs of water because my room is full. I told him to tell my mom not to come up, but then she called me saying they'll only come up this week to make up for the fact that they won't be visiting so often in the winter (when the roads are more harsh). Knowing that this would be the last time I see them for a couple more weeks, I agreed to let them come up to see me.

Everything was fine when they arrived - we went out to eat and then I went food shopping with them (which they paid for), but when they returned me to my place, things went horribly. My mom went into my room and started reorganizing everything despite my constant requests for her to stop touching my things and leave. She responded by saying, ""I'm not even done organizing everything yet - can you stop rushing me?"" I went out into the dining room and waited for her and my dad to finish redecorating my room (because I really didn't have a choice) and then when I went back in... I noticed she'd hammered nails into the door to hang a mounted coat rack on it. 

At this point, I flipped at her because she hadn't been listening to me for the past \~30 minutes and vandalized rented property, so I told her to take it down, and to get out of my room (and to take a bunch of things I didn't ask for, which she thought I needed, with her). She told me I was disrespectful and commented that whenever she came up to see me, I'd never be refreshed to see her. I responded by saying that she was the disrespectful one because she decided to come up despite me telling her that I didn't want her to come up today and she also created two holes in the door of my rented room without my consent.

Once my dad passed away suddenly in January 2018, I tried very hard to be there and offer her support emotionally and financially, even though I was going through my own issues and missing my father dearly. My bf planned a trip for us all to go to the beach the following July all of her expenses were paid by us. The day we are supposed to leave (5 months after my dad and her husband of 29 years passed away) she invited a man to our house and begins to hang all over him. I was very angry, confused and hurt. She stayed home from the trip. We had been helping her buy groceries, pay bills, and other monetary gifts to help her get by. She began to date this guy, moved out with him, I got stuck with her dog and 2 cats because she was just going to put them down.

I had stopped talking to her that Thanksgiving. She knew we would be moving the next week, and picked some stuff that she wanted to take with her to his house. Made a huge pile on my back porch that she said she would take when they came up for dinner. They brought nothing that the said they would contribute to the meal. It was my first holiday without my dad, the turkey turned into a mess and I was already upset and overwhelmed. So she comes up with her bf, and is practically dry humping him in my kitchen the whole time I am trying to get everything set up so all of our guests could get their plates put together. She goes into the kitchen and takes almost all of the leftovers in all of my BRAND NEW containers to feed her bfs two brothers. Then left everything she was supposed to take with her. She was also asking my bf to borrow $400 after I told her we did not have it.

I didnt talk to her for 3 months but decided once I found out I was pregnant to try again, and invited her for lunch. That lasted about 3 weeks.

 It wasnt until this past Easter that I finally had enough. She had a fight with her bf and called me to start a fight. She threw her phone in the river and went AWOL. Left me a nasty voicemail telling me how awful I was. She finally showed up to my house to ask me to activate an old phone, so I paid for it and she stayed to eat dinner. While I was clearing the table she told my bf's mom that she can ""have this baby because she didnt want anything to do with her"". Now this goes along with what she said while waiting for my father to be put into the ambulance, I was pregnant too then but it was ectopic. She said to me ""why is it that every time you are pregnant someone has to die"". My brother had passed away when I was pregnant with my son in 2012. 
Last week my uncle met with her, and she gave him stuff for my son, my baby, and $100 check for me. 
WIBTA for sending back what she sent for the baby and I? I do not want her in my life she just will continue to be hurtful any chance she gets no matter how much I help her.",25,57,0.89

629,Asshole,"FINAL UPDATE!!

I was actually able to catch them when I was walking home today! They‚Äôre all college dudes, I asked if they could move their car up a bit so it‚Äôs not blocking anything. They told me the roommate who owned the car said the battery was dead, but will try again when they get home. They said that they have a second car that they use as well, and was also able to get their contact info. 

I think some ppl missed some of my comments when responding, but to clarify a bit I‚Äôm okay with walking the extra few steps and taking the time to maneuver out from the side, I realize that at the end of the day it‚Äôs only a slight inconvenience and nothing pressing. I said that in an earlier comment but I‚Äôm not sure if some caught that. When I see that lady who said the towing comment I‚Äôll let her know that the car should be moving out of the way and it‚Äôs not necessary to call. 



‚Äî-


Okay guys first post here also on mobile.

My bf and I have been living in an apartment complex going into our second year. We live in the ‚Äúrear‚Äù, where there is an access lane to get to both that back area and to the other apartment complex for disabled people. The lane is about 2.5 cars wide, and usually there are cars lining on the side so really only 1 car can go in and out at a given time. 

For the past year, we have been parking in the back where our car fits nicely into the little spot next to our door, which is out of the way for cars to go in and out without blocking. 

Now, here‚Äôs our problem- there is new tenant next to us that just moved in, and decided to park in our spot. Usually this isn‚Äôt a problem, as I don‚Äôt mind alternating between spots with the other tenants as it technically isn‚Äôt an assigned parking spot, but these guys just haven‚Äôt moved AT ALL in two weeks. This has been pressing as it has forced us to park on the side, potentially ‚Äústealing‚Äù a spot from another car and it is more difficult to pull out of the side. And on top of it, their car isn‚Äôt pulled up all the way so their bumper is in the way of the access lane. 

I‚Äôve tried to knock on their doors to ask if they could at least move their car up, and maybe try to gauge what their schedule is to see when the car will not be there, but they haven‚Äôt answered their door.  

I‚Äôve talked to two other people who live in the in disabled apartment complex and they both have tried to knock as well and they haven‚Äôt answered to them either. One mentioned they‚Äôre considering having the car towed, as they think it‚Äôs a ‚Äústolen‚Äù vehicle and saw that the car itself wouldn‚Äôt start. While I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true as it‚Äôs just old and ugly, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt mind that happening.

WIBTA if I also called to have the car towed/didn‚Äôt stop the other person from calling?



Edit: okay a few updates- I‚Äôve contacted my landlord and they said those tenants aren‚Äôt under them. Someone also mentioned I write a note to them and slide it under their door since I can‚Äôt get ahold of them, which I will also do now. 

To answer some questions: no it‚Äôs not an assigned space, and no I haven‚Äôt called to have it towed. I know it hasn‚Äôt moved because the same amount of space is jutting out into the access lane. I answered some other questions in my replies and I don‚Äôt remember them all so feel free to look there as well. 

Someone said that I could potentially report it as abandoned and let the police handle it, and I might do that only if I wasn‚Äôt able to get in touch with them or the car hasn‚Äôt moved in like a month. 

Thanks you guys for your perspective- I didn‚Äôt even think of what some of you suggested I do.",54,195,0.89

631,Not the A-hole,"Just wondering because you can never be too sure. This is the email I'm planning on sending:

""Hi (manager)

I was in your Subway earlier. Although the lady who served me was kind and friendly, I was disappointed with the customer service I received. I've worked in food service in the past so I understand how difficult it can be but I still felt the service could have been better. I asked for a vegetarian sandwich and she didn't change her gloves. She put pepperoni on the sandwich and I reminded her it was vegetarian. She simply took it out and didn't change the bread. She then toasted it without me asking so even though I didn't want her to. Finally, she put sauce I didn't like or want on it.


This however isn't the first time I've received bad service here. I feel that the training of staff needs to be more often than it is now.

634,Not the A-hole,"I read a similar post right now, and I just remembered this. My ex and I are not platonic or amicable at all. She left me for her now ex BF, who was a decade younger than her. That fucked me up. I currently have have custody of my children every other month, somehow. And I make several times more than my ex even after alimony and child support, which I do pay in full.
 
 First of, I do not spoil my kids. If they do something wrong, I do punish them. I have a pretty spacious McMansion type of house. I have 3 kids. 2 16 year old girls, and a 8 year old boy. My job is the CFO of a moderately large company in my area. Now let‚Äôs get back to the actual story
 
My ex and I divorced almost 2 years ago. Finally I‚Äôm legally divorced. After 2 long years. It was not nice. I lost the family house and most he let‚Äôs, but at least I have 50/50 custody. My twin girls are currently interested in gaming. So I bought both of them a 1k gaming computer in their respective rooms in my house. They were both 4.0 GPA students, so that seemed like a fair reward, also it was just 1k, I have a way better system. My ex was pissed at me when she found out. She told me that gifts should be coming from both of us, since we are co-parenting. I disagree vehemently, if she buys them something, I won‚Äôt take credit. If I buy something for them, then she shouldn‚Äôt get credit. Especially since we‚Äôre separated. I made a trust fund to pay for all of their college educations, in spite of what my ex told me. Over dinner, I talked to the girls about their future, and that I‚Äôm going to be supporting their future educations. My ex was absolutely livid. She said some words, which I didn‚Äôt know existed. I do realize I‚Äôm getting my kids to regret going to their mother‚Äôs, but I‚Äôm not hurting my kids, since I do pay alimony and child support.

I offered to pour some out into a cup or something, she declined and asked me to pour it into the sink (art classroom).

I asked her why. She said ""bEcAuSe I sAiD sO"". I asked her if I was breaking any rules. She said yes because I was drinking a fizzy drink. I told her I could pour a tiny bit into the sink to prove it wasnt a fizzy drink. She said if I didnt pour out the whole thing immediately she would confiscate the whole bottle. Reluctantly I agreed and poured my drink down the sink. She watched me do it and clearly saw it wasnt a fizzy drink.

636,Everyone Sucks,"My husband and I work very long hours.  We make enough to afford help at home. I am in charge of hiring and organising the people who help us, which is one person to look after our kids and one person who cleans and cooks.


 My husband works longer hours than I do and comes home after the kids are asleep at least two days a week and is out of town at least one week a month. I pay for the people who help us out of my salary. 


My husband wanted a dog. He has never had a dog before, but wanted one because he thought it would be fun. I was adamantly against. I basically considered getting a dog almost equivalent to having another child. It is an enormous responsibility. I am maxed out on the amount of responsibility I can take. My husband actually wanted 3 kids but I told him we barely had enough time for the two we had. 


My husband got the dog anyway. I am furious and have told my husband that I will not take care of the dog at any time. And then I also said that no one else will help him either. The thing is both of the people who work for us have contracts spelling out what their jobs are. And taking care of a dog isn't in their contract and I will not ask them to do that. They have enough work as it is. 


Now my husband doesn't know what to do. There will be times when he's not here and so is physically incapable of taking care of the dog. He though I and the other people would be back up for him. Now he's stuck and pretty pissed off at me.

639,Not the A-hole,"So my gf and I both have our own dogs and we don‚Äôt live together but she and her dog (jack) are at my house a couple days a week.  I cook all my dog (summer‚Äôs) food and treats myself and it‚Äôs not cheap (around $50/wk) but she likes it and it keeps her healthy so to me it‚Äôs worth it.  

My gf feeds jack dry food but when they‚Äôd come to my house I‚Äôd give jack treats and if summer is eating I‚Äôd put a bowl out for jack too.  I‚Äôd also give her a bag of treats every once in a while to take home too. 

She gradually started taking bags of food out of my freezer for jack too.  It started out just one serving a week which I was fine with but now it‚Äôs ended up that she feeds jack almost exclusively the food I‚Äôm cooking.  Im now cooking almost twice as much and it‚Äôs costing me about twice as much now to feed both our dogs.  

Now where my friends/gf think I‚Äôm an asshole is I told my gf that I‚Äôm not going to keep feeding jack for free, she can pay me just the cost of ingredients and I‚Äôll cook it.  I also said jack can have treats when he‚Äôs over and I‚Äôll feed him if summer is eating but she can‚Äôt take anything home.  She can‚Äôt afford to pay that much for dog food and says I‚Äôm forcing jack to eat kibble when he doesn‚Äôt really like it.  My friends think I should just keep feeding both dogs because I can easily afford it.  So reddit, AITA?

Edit: I love my gf and her dog.  This is the only time she‚Äôs shown any sense of entitlement, but it‚Äôs probably because we help ourselves to each other‚Äôs food and it‚Äôs never been an issue. 

Regarding how easily I can afford it, the extra expense would just come out of savings, not a huge deal, but it would add up over time.  My friends all have at least one kid so what I spend on my dog is a fraction of what they spend on their kids so I have more disposable income than them.",74,270,0.95

I've known Tim as long as I've worked here.

Tracy started about 3 months ago, working part time to supplement their income.  She knows that I know Tim but still takes every opportunity to trash talk him and claim he's ""abandoning their family""  I've told her multiple times that I don't want to be involved, but she doesn't seem to care.

Recently she's been completely open about cheating on Tim, and after a few drinks at an after work outing she let slip that she's been sleeping with one of the supervisors, who is also in a relationship.  I feel like Tim has a right to know, he's been begging Tracy to go to marriage counselling with him, but she's refused.  He's aware they're in a rough patch.

643,Asshole,"So I took my wife out for lunch earlier today at a burger place in Brighton... we asked for a couple cheeseburgers - but without onions, pickles, mustard or ketchup and with mayo instead.

I scanned the rest of their menu and saw they had mayo on some other burgers so i knew they had some in the kitchen.

When I asked the waiter he told me that they had a ‚Äústubborn kitchen‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt make those changes... so I explained i hated mustard and ketchup and if he could please ask the kitchen anyway.

Another guy then came back to us and told us they couldn‚Äôt do what we wanted and that the kitchen could remove toppings from the burgers but not switch. He said that we had mayo at the table and we could put it on our burgers ourselves.

I have been to almost every big burger chain in the UK and love to try burger places all the time and never in my life have I been questioned for wanting to have mayo instead of ketchup and mustard, I am always extremely well received by polite staff.

I then explained to the waiter that I knew they had mayo on other burgers, and that I‚Äôd come to treat my wife to a meal out and shouldn‚Äôt have to make my own burger and he insisted that they just wouldn‚Äôt do it, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just the way we do things here‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been this way for 8 years‚Äù in a very rude tone, and that ‚Äúwe do it our way in the kitchen but it‚Äôs up to you what you do at the table‚Äù.

At this point the people sat next to us were scorning at us as if we were crazy and asking a lot.

The restaurant was quite empty and I looked to the kitchen and saw the chefs just stood there on their phones and couldn‚Äôt understand what was so hard about squirting mayo on my burger instead of mustard and ketchup.

We then left the restaurant and ate elsewhere.

So, AITA here? Were my requests unreasonable at a restaurant? Should it not be their pleasure to help the customer and make sure they have the best possible experience at their restaurant instead of driving them away for not liking certain toppings?

TL; DR: Went to burger chain, asked for mayo instead of mustard and ketchup on my burger but they were rude and kept refusing to help.

EDIT: so a bit more info. I never actually said to them ‚Äúmake my own burger‚Äù that‚Äôs just what i was thinking in rage. I wouldn‚Äôt say i stormed out i said thank you very much and left. i initially didn‚Äôt know there was mayo on the table until the second guy who came to the table pointed it out (it was behind the special drinks menu). i‚Äôm still just shocked that they would turn down such a simple

645,No A-holes here,"So me, my dad and his partner went to Crete this summer.

A few days into our vacation we decided to go to Balos. To arrive there you need to to walk down from the mountain by foot.  Going back up was the problem. It was nearly 40 degrees hot. I instantly started to hyperventilate and had do stop several times. At one point my dad had to throw water on my face because I was about to faint. During all of this my dad was very irritated. After a while I got some bad stomachache as well.  

After about 40 minutes we reach our car and I finally understand my stomachache. My bathing suit was *soaked* in blood.  I felt humiliated and i told my dad I wanted to go back to the apartment. But dad and Stefy (his partner) ignored me and started arguing if they wanted do go to another city or go back home. Thankfully we went home.

During that time, I burned my whole body too. So, after I showered, I told my dad and partner that I wouldn't be going out to dinner with them.  Stefy immediately said that i was ruining the mood of the vacation. I raised my voice replying that she cared more about me ""ruining the vacation"" then me being sick. She snapped back not to talk to her with that tone and my dad said the same. I replied i wasnt going and went into my room. Before they went I begged my dad to please get something for my burns: at first he said it wasn't that serious, then he said yes but only if I paid for it with my own money. I was pissed he was treating it like a luxury item, but I agreed. He didn't get it that evening.

Night passes without sleep from how badly my skin burned. In the morning I asked if we could stop at a pharmacy. We did and I finally got some aloe vera gel for my skin. Then we briefly stopped at a beach but I had to stay clothed and under the beach umbrella not to irritate my skin further. So after we go home i say that I prefer to stay home and rest instead of going out. Stefy snaps, saying again that I'm ruining everything and that I want to stay home just because I want to use my phone and that she doesn't want me in the next vacation. I stand my ground and say that we'll go out in the evening anyway. They leave and I rest.

Stefy was mad at me *again* the day after because I asked her to bring her own pantyliners because I finished mine (i was still leaking blood). She said i can't do anything for myself and i need to grow up (I'm 18). All day she was snappy and irritated, my dad said nothing about her behavior.

I feel hurt by what happened. He always acts like im faking in how much pain I am. And he does that with my mental health too: he called me lazy and a liar even after I started taking antidepressants.

So, WIBTA if I stopped seeing him? I know he loves me, he choose Crete exactly because he knows I love Greece But I can't deny that he's not that great at taking care of me. Maybe he'll finally understand that he needs to become a better dad.",311,796,0.94

I asked her if she has considered talking to Daniel about it, but she just said that she has never done anything to hurt him when they were dating and she intends to keep it that way when they are married.

Jack celebrated his birthday in September, and as many of you suggested, I told him that I'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. 

Kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

For those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum.

Jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

We‚Äôve paid for their meal, we‚Äôve done all this work to fit them at the venue after their late rsvp and now they‚Äôve started shit up by saying how we‚Äôve excluded them from the family, they don‚Äôt feel welcomed around us. We explained if we had a larger venue we would have gladly had them however that‚Äôs not the vision we had and we wanted a small intimate gathering, they were made aware since before the invitations went out no babies no children under 16. Now other family members in solidarity are threatening to not come because we were rude and not understanding of the plight of new parents.

655,No A-holes here,I am visiting my family from out of state for my nephews birthday. I have already bought the ticket and booked the hotel. This week my sister tells me that one of the days they are going to SeaWorld. Apparently there is a Sesame Street activity. I have big moral qualms about going to Sea World. The thing is that it's not something that has ever come up in conversation with anyone in my family. There's no way for my sister to know that I have these issues with Sea World. I'm trying to come up with a way to get out of it but it's going to be difficult unless I ditch the whole weekend.,78,155,0.91

657,Asshole,"My friends and I recently visited a friend who lives in another town. It was a three hour trip in total, we all rode my car and I drove. 

The playlist I had on consisted of songs by Dutch artists, and most of them were in Dutch. A few weeks ago for some reason Youtube recommended performances by contestants from The Voice of Holland and I liked a lot of the songs I heard, so I googled the songs/artists/coaches and now I have a Dutch playlist. I live in Asia and know squat about the Dutch language but I really enjoy listening to their songs. 

On our drive back, my friend Paul told me that he wanted to listen to music that he understood (there were a few English songs there like Calm After the Storm) and asked what my Bluetooth PIN was so he can connect his phone and play his playlist. I was a bit stunned because for me it was my car and I was driving so I should have the say on what music should be playing, and I myself have never thought of asking someone to change the music in their car even though I have been in trips where I don't like the driver's playlist it because it just seems rude to do that. 

I told Paul ""Sure, let me just finish this playlist"" knowing that my playlist had about another hour's worth of music and we were going to get home in about an hour. No one else said anything about the music throughout the trip and we all continued to talk while I drove. Paul never got to play his playlist.

My boyfriend says that I should've just let Paul play his music just to be considerate because sometimes it's hard to enjoy listening to stuff that you don't understand or like for a relatively long period of time. But I'm still a bit peeved that he asked me to change my music because I think it's very entitled to think that your music preferences as a passenger trumps the music preferences of the driver/car owner.

658,Asshole,"Once a month or so, I go to this Friday night party at a local art museum,  and I always run into this guy, ""Harry."" We exchange pleasantries and go on our way with our respective friends.

Background: I went on one date with Harry once like 4 - 5 years ago (maybe more). I never wanted another date after that. 

Yet lately, as in the past few months, every time he sees me at this party, he tries to have a conversation and inevitable leads it into something about ""we should get a coffee sometime."" I am in no way interested in him and I have a serious boyfriend now.

This past weekend, it happened again and he clarified that he wanted to get coffee AS FRIENDS. And I was basically like... ""But we aren't friends.""

He looked so confused. 
Him: ""But... we went on a date once.""
Me: ""Yea... like 5 years ago. That doesn't make us friends.""
Him: *blank stare*
Me: ""You don't even know me, dude.""
Him: *blank stare*
Me: ""Okay, if you still have my number, then text me and I'll think about it.""

My friend and I walk away. Then we pass by him again a little while later on our way out to leave.
He comes up to me with his phone and says, ""Is this your number?""

He still had me in his phone all these years later (ridiculous) with the correct number,  but incorrect last name (slightly misspelled). I took his phone, corrected my name and said, ""If we were actually friends, you would know what my last name was.""

Anyway, I think he got the hint because he never contacted me. Or maybe I still have his number blocked. Lol.

659,No A-holes here,"My future step mom is grest. I love her a lot. I'm so happy she and my dad are able to take this next step in their relationship. They're getting married sometime in the next 8-16 months. Still in early planning state. My brother will be my dad's best man and he'll have three other groomsmen. My FSM will have a maid of honor and three bridesmaids. 

FSM wants her sister to be her MOH. The problem is...her sister is an alcoholic who's been on the brink of death the whole 5 years I've known these people. The sister has pancreatitis, diabetes, liver failure, she's addicted to pain pills she's periodically wandering off to neighboring cities waking up in the ICU...the family just throws money at her hiring a nurse and getting a more secured apartment and things like that. They've tried rehab but the sister said she wasn't ""as messed up"" and everyone else and didn't get why she was sent there. Every 3-5 weeks it's a new crisis with some new level of severity. It's sad to watch. 

So FSM wants her sister to be there AND be in it. I think it's foolish. JUST ON FRIDAY (two days ago) FSM got a call from her mom about how sister was found unconscious in her newest apartment with four empty tequila bottles. They tried to get her to go to the hospital to get her stomach pumped but sister refused and became violent. So they just left her there to ""sober up"" and ""think about what's she's done."" This lady is in her 50's. 

So all this to say I have no role in the wedding outside of just having recently been married myself and I'm being heavily utilized in the plannjng process because I just did all this stuff and I've learned a few things. I very gently suggested to FSM that even if her sister can't be the MOH it might not be fair to invite her to the wedding where there's going to be a lot of temptation for her. She's clearly on a path of self destruction and it would be more harm to her than good for almost everyone involved. She seemed to realize the reality but is not ready to admit it. She jokingly said that I am about the same size as sister and could always ""jump in"" at the last minute if sister can't make it. 

WIBTA if I told her I didn't want to be a back up? I'll do it if she asks me for real and decides that sister is out but if sister is still in and can't make it or ruins everything I don't want to have to bear the burden of ""jumping in"" with anything from a few weeks to hours notice. 

TL;DR My dad is getting married and the lovely woman who will be his bride had an alcoholic sister who is three sips away from imploding. I've been reserved as the ""back up bridesmaid"" in the event sister can't make it and I'd rather not.",18,24,0.86

662,Everyone Sucks,"My (20f) brother, Tom (30m) and his girlfriend, Kate (30f) have been together for 6 years.  They recently had a baby a few months ago. 

We were having a conversation a few months ago about how thanksgiving was going to work (it‚Äôs the only holiday that they‚Äôd have to figure out how they‚Äôre going to spend it since our family is of a different faith than hers)

Tom told me that her family is going to our thanksgiving. Her family is on the smaller side (4 people).  Most of our family doesn‚Äôt know hers that well/at all (we‚Äôre not close with them) but they‚Äôre pretty nice people from what I‚Äôve know. 

I didn‚Äôt saying anything to him other than he should probably ask to make sure it‚Äôs okay with our grandma (who‚Äôs hosting) 

The issue with this is that our grandma (80f) hosts thanksgiving every year at her house. We have around  15 members of our family going to our thanksgiving any given year; If his family came, it would be ~19 instead of 15.

My grandma is someone who would do anything for her grandkids, even if she does not want to. She‚Äôs also someone who gets stressed about hosting (she loves thanksgiving though and wants to) and has OCD. 

I‚Äôm extremely close with my grandma and know her really well. 

I know she doesn‚Äôt to host an extra 4 people because I told her casually that Tom mentioned them coming and she was not happy about it whatsoever  (he hadn‚Äôt/hasn‚Äôt  discussed it with our grandma himself at all)

My brother has a history of taking our grandma for granted; when they got pregnant, they moved out of their apartment and in with our grandma.  They were only supposed to stay a few months but it‚Äôs been a year. He‚Äôs constantly telling her what she can and can‚Äôt do in her own house, rearranges everything (my grandma hates this), and has baby stuff all over her house (which stresses grandma out since she loves everything being clean)

(My grandma would never say anything to Tom about moving, but she wants him out. She constantly asks me if he‚Äôs talked to me about finding a place to live yet. ) 

It‚Äôs the same kind of thing with thanksgiving where I know she would have them over if Tom asked, but I see it as Tom almost taking advantage of knowing our grandma wouldn‚Äôt say no to him. 

I know that if I say something to Tom, he‚Äôll get pissed at me and say that her family is his family now.

668,Not the A-hole,"So my roommate and I are both 21F, doing the same major in college and have been roommates for two years going on our third. We're not close friends, but we're not enemies either. I used to think she was a fair person to live with but now she seems a bit lazy.

So our major has specific halls we stay in throughout our 6 year course. We're in our fourth year now and my roommate (Jazz) and I moved to a new place.

The past two years I was I the back half of the room in our old hall while she was in the front. This was because she has way more visitors than I do and I don't want them to have to pass through me at odd times in the night to get to her. Another reason is that I have asthma and the back half had better ventilation. We used our wardrobes to divide the room.

This August we moved to a new hall that has its own bath and kitchen that we have to share with two other girls in a connected room. 

Jazz called me during vacation and asked to take the back half for a change. I agreed, on the condition that she doesn't get any visitors after midnight and if she let's me know if her bf is gonna stay over, because he'd have to walk past me to get to the back. We also agreed that she would buy an AC, because the rooms are notoriously hot. She agreed.

Fast forward to school and there are many problems. The first one being that she still let's her friends in at odd times and doesn't tell me before. We live in Africa and I hate the heat, so I bathe right before bed and usually sleep naked but if she warns me about a visitor then I throw on some pjs or cover up. She doesn't warn me and her bf has seen my boobs at least three times in one week. 

I spoke  with Jazz after the third time and reminded her about the promise and asked her to tell me if her bf is coming to spend the night and to try to make sure he doesn't spend everyday here, but every other day. She agreed and I didn't see bf for three weeks before she started letting him in while I'm asleep again.

She has not bought the AC and looks like she isn't going to, and the ventilation is so bad in the front that my asthma is becoming poorly managed again and I constantly have heat rashes.

2 semesters ago a brilliant 13 year old child (Timmy) started the same career as me. Everyone here was pretty excited (including me) because it‚Äôs the first time someone under 17 started a career around here.

He and I were taking the same algebra course. Everything was okay until end of semester when I had to present an ordinary exam.

I failed that test so I presented the same test again (you can make the same test twice in case you fail the first one).

Anyway, everything was fine until Timmy, who presented both ordinary exams, went to the teacher (Sofia) and he demanded her his first test. She told him that he needed to wait because giving him his failed test would give him an unfair advantage over everybody else.

Timmy was very rude tu her, started yelling and throwing tantrums because he didn‚Äôt receive his past exam. Sofia refused to give him his exam and Timmy failed. All the classroom saw this happen.

Two months later Sof√≠a told us that Timmy (trough his parents) tried to sue her because of that. Obviously that didn‚Äôt work out, but all authorities were really scared there was backlash from this so they fired her.

Fast forward 2 weeks ago. The exact same thing happened with another professor. Timmy was about to fail so the authorities fired him to avoid any repercussions with his family.

We couldn‚Äôt believe it. It was completely ridiculous but that‚Äôs how it all went down.

Me and a bunch of other students that also shared classrooms with him reunited and wrote a letter that demanded the authorities to do better and, at least make some investigation because firing someone that way is illegal in this country.

We send this letter not only to faculty members, but to diverse government organisms so this teachers could, at least, defend their careers.

Fast forward to today.

Every news article in my town are talking about a 14 year old kid that was dropping off college after two and a half semesters because it was too difficult for him. It‚Äôs uncertain wether or not Sof√≠a and John (the other fired teacher) are getting their jobs back but everything points out to them teaching again next year.

We‚Äôre all very happy to hear that except Timmy‚Äôs family hates us but specially me because I started it all.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR brilliant kid in college started sueing all teachers who failed him so me and a bunch of students made a letter to the authorities and the kid decided to drop off.

EXTRA INFO:

1) We don‚Äôt know exactly why Timmy dropped off. All our bets are on him giving up after realizing he just wasn‚Äôt ready but we don‚Äôt know for sure.

2) The letter we made never demanded the authorities to expel him; the letter‚Äôs only purpose was to demand better treatment for John and Sof√≠a. Timmy was barely even mentioned.",15,69,0.9

Just in general she is still sort of getting used to a lot of stuff here.

So I get an invite to my friends birthday party. I am not super close friends with this guy, but we are still friends, and I know that he is sort of a hard party kind of guy, and so are all of his friends. I knew most of the people there. I thought it was a pretty bad idea to invite my girlfriend, just because she is sort of against drugs and dancing and hip hop and house music and she doesn't entirely... approve of that kind of stuff just in general, and I knew that there was gonna be a lot of drugs especially at the party. It was kind of a 'sketchy' party, and I could just tell she wasn't going to like it. It was just VERY MUCH not her scene. She likes like quaint cafes and yoga and art sessions and that kind of stuff I suppose, and this in general was something she would disprove of and not like. So I went to the party without her, and she hit me up that night and I told her I was at a party, and she got upset. I told her the reason I didn't invite her was because it was a lot of old friends and that it wasn't really her type of crowd, and she got upset at me for not inviting her. Not like, extremely upset, but still upset, and mentioned that I should invite her to stuff I go to even if I know she isn't going to like it.

She then brought this up again, and she felt that she didn't like the idea of me going to a sketchy party without her, and that we should do things together. I kind of understood what she was saying, and I kind of agreed with her. But some part of me kept thinking about the party, and thinking, ""holy shit, she would hate this and leave"" and just... in general feeling like it was a good idea not to invite her. And the thing is, I know people will say that I should have asked her, but she would have 100% said yes, she doesn't know shes gonna hate it beforehand, and I feel like me warning her might not have a big impact on that.

Because of that, she has a better career and lifestyle than her siblings. They do alright but they do struggle quite a bit more. My wife and I together are quite comfortable but don‚Äôt have kids so our money is ours. 

A couple of years ago, I made the decision to give each of my nieces and nephew a laptop upon graduating high school, as a congrats on going to college.

Context: Pretty early in our engagement, my fiance and I decided that we are going to do the big wedding thing and agreed we wouldn't have any kids in attendance unless they were part of the wedding party. I'm super close to my family but his family dynamics are way different. They are not close and his bro and SIL have always found a way to talk trash about our relationship. To make it fair, however,  we included both sides of our families in the wedding party including his brother, SIL, and their daughter as well as my sister, BIL, and nieces. Everyone was happy and agreed to the costs of dresses, shoes, hair, etc.

Now here we are 1 year later and 1 month away from the wedding and his SIL decides to pull her daughter out because the dress is ""itchy."" His bro and SIL also pulled out of the wedding party by saying that she doesn't feel comfortable in her dress either and he won't participate if she's not. At this point, all wedding arrangements are made, everything has been paid for, and I feel that this is a very inconsiderate move on their part.

(also he didnt bring a gift like other guests, or even just a card, so that was a bit embarrassing too, but whatever...) anyway i was kinda upset about it, i felt pretty awkward the whole time. afterwards i told him i was pissed about it and it put us on the rocks a bit. tonight we went to his friends wedding - again, i didnt know anyone. he was late to pick me up, we arrive in the middle of the ceremony. the wedding was outside and we had to walk down a loudass gravel driveway from the parking lot approaching the event DURING THEIR VOWS. we stayed in the back, and although several people turned to look it didnt really disturb anything, but it was still embarrassing. then we go into the reception and he has no +1 on his table card. we sit down and the rest of the table fills up until there is only one seat left. soon the groom comes over with an extra seat and a couple sits down. again, i was not on the guest list. (i will give him that when he initially asked me to go to the wedding about 2 weeks ago i said maybe and it was unclear if i was going. but he didnt call to check when filling out the RSVP days later. we did have a conversation about 4 days before the wedding where i confirmed id join him for the wedding and we talked about it a couple of times since, and the day of i asked him \*are you sure\* im on the list, and are you positive you want me to go with you? yes and yes. after dinner i apologized to the groom for taking up the space and thanked him for accommodating me. he was nice about it and said he sent a text to everyone to confirm their RSVP and he isnt surprised that he didnt respond.) when we left i told BF i was disappointed and why. he said i shouldnt be upset because nothing bad happened as a result; no one cared that we were late, there was no issue with the seating, and they didnt run out of food, so why be upset, no one else is and so its unreasonable for me to be. he says he is laid back and i shouldnt expect everything to be perfect and i was getting upset at stuff that didnt cause any problems. is it unreasonable for me to be disappointed about being in this situation, twice?",41,39,0.91

685,No A-holes here,"This happened a good nine years ago, but last night I met with some old friends and we remembered this story, and we were divided on whether I was an asshole or not.  
Back then, there were these two people in my class, Brian and Katy. Neither of them were close friends, but I got along very well with them. Katy had to take the same bus as me to go home, but she lived much closer from school than I did. One day, she told me that she knew Brian had a massive crush on her, but that she didn't feel the same for him.  
A few weeks later, Brian texted all the males in our grade asking for help. He wanted to ask Katy to be his girlfriend, and he wanted to make it big. Think a low budget version of those public proposal videos.  
I, and I alone, knew what would happen. I knew that Katy would reject him, and I didn't think it was fair to her to be asked this question in such a public way. The way I saw it, Brian would put everyone on his side, and when rejected, everyone would think Katy was the bad one. I knew Brian didn't have this intention, but that was what would have happened, regardless.  
Everyone was very excited about the idea, Brian has always been a very likeable guy, and everyone thought him and Katy made a perfect match. I, and I alone, declined. Everyone thought I was being a bad friend, many people knew I took the same bus as Katy, and started to gossip about me, saying that I declined because I had a crush on her. I tried to talk Brian out if his idea, without telling him that Katy already knew about his crush and would reject him, but he wouldn't listen.
As expected, he went on with his huge plans, and as expected, a very embarrassed Katy rejected him. As I expected, most of our school thought of Katy as the bad one who rejected a nice guy.
The divide is about whether I should have told him what would have happened, and some of my friends say that IWTA because knowing everything that was happening I let two people be embarrassed and ridiculed. I think that Brian was unreasonable because public proposals put an undue pressure on the girl to say yes.",21,32,0.8

We get the invitations 3 months ago. They specifically said no kids. I thought they meant kids as in people who go to primary school. My son is currently going to a university pretty close by.

During the reception, my cousin was literally shouting at me and my son and berating me that I didn‚Äôt even read the invitations, and the lack of respect I had for her.

687,Everyone Sucks,"I work in a satellite office with four female coworkers, we are all aged 28-38. I'm the youngest and the only one who doesn't have a child. Two of my coworkers, Lena and Bree, have elementary school-aged children while the other two, Josie and Marion, each have a year-old child. 

Children and childcare are often topics of lunch chats. Josie and Marion are always excited to tell us what their babies are doing while Lena and Bree like giving advice about what to do with the babies. As I said, I don't have a child of my own but I have a very sweet seven year old shih tzu, Kimmy, who I love to bits. I know he's not the same as a baby and in no way do I consider myself a mom just because I have Kimmy, but whenever Josie and Marion talk about their babies, I find that there are a lot of things that the babies and Kimmy do similarly so when there's an instance of that I share it with them. 

For example, Marion said that if she scolds her baby, then he will ignore her when she tries to call him afterwards. I told the group, ""Aw, Kimmy does that as well! If I tell him no more treats he will lie down and sulk and won't look at my if I try to call him after."" They usually just laugh and tell me that maybe I need to have my own baby now. 

Last week we had a new coworker come in who will also be assigned to our office from now on. Gemma is pregnant with her first children, twins, and the other day I overheard her asking Lena if I always talk about Kimmy whenever the topic of children comes up. Lena said yes I do that a lot because I don't have children of my own. Gemma said that's really sad and I should realize that dogs aren't children so I shouldn't be talking about Kimmy when we talk about children. I was shocked to hear that because I never thought there was a problem with what I'm doing and walked away before I could hear what Lena said because I think I would really be hurt and embarrassed if I hear her tell Gemma that she agrees with what Gemma said. 

So AITA and should I stop sharing about my dog whenever my coworkers talk about their babies?",223,200,0.85
688,Everyone Sucks,"FINAL EDIT-First off, thank you for most of your comments.  This was a huge reality check for me.  I completely understand and accept my judgement-I was a huge ass.  I didn‚Äôt need to bring my opinion into it.  For those of you who slammed me for being political, I totally understand your point and will not bring my opinion into matters such as this.  It was wrong of me to judge two parents so harshly because I don‚Äôt have kids, and therefore don‚Äôt know how things can go when youre faced with difficult decisions; and maybe this was a difficult decision for those parents.  I didn‚Äôt even think to separate my harsh, judgmental opinion from my valid argument and that is something I plan to reflect on and adjust.

Thank you to those of you who were able to call me out on my shit without simultaneously making me *feel* like shit.

For those of you who called my intelligence into question, and insulted my character and personality-best of luck to you.

Thanks again, I will do better in the future.  If anyone has any further questions or comments feel free to pm me so I can respond,

EDIT: my new internet friend, u/FuckOffSupreme suggested I update my post with this comment that i responded to her comment with:

I don‚Äôt think I deserve a pat on the back, trust me. I respect and admire people who can convey their opinions without sounding like a dick-im not one of them. The only reason i stated that was as a reason for being so pissed. I mention this in another comment more specifically, but my city is really high in terms of violence and homicide when compared to the rest of the country. Thats why it makes me so upset. Why bring a seriously, seriously impressionable kid to something that displays all that freaking shit for literally 2 straight hours. And it makes the violent guy reallly reaaally sympathetic dude and thinking about a kid seeing that and retaining it makes me really frustrated and really sad. Kids are not stupid. Id bet money on this film making an impression on that kid, and that pisses me off because it was completely unnecessary for the kid to see the movie in the first place. It pisses me off, and I did not mention it in order to get a pat on the back. Im sorry for giving you that impression, i must have phrased something in my OP wrong.


I (23F) saw the Joker with my fiance (22M) tonight, the show began at 9 pm. During previews, I hear a kid talking-clear childs voice talking about their ‚Äútummy‚Äù.  I look at my fiance and go ‚Äúdid i just hear a fuckin child‚Äù, he goes, ‚Äúyep‚Äù, and I respond ‚Äúanyone who uses the word tummy should not be seeing this fuckin movie‚Äù We were talking in a little quiter voices than normal speaking voices.


Throughout the film this kid is talking. Repeating words theyre saying in the film like ‚Äúpaycheck‚Äù.  Everytime a gun goes off, he laughs. After it happened 15 times, I say, somewhat loudly & during a quiet moment, ‚Äúthis is ridiculous‚Äù.  Then, during a particularly gruesome part of the movie, I turned around and gave the parents a look.

After the movie the Mom comes up to me blubbering about how I made them feel, ‚Äúworse than they ever felt‚Äù and, ‚Äúhow could i so harshly criticize someone i don‚Äôt know particularly a small child‚Äù. After she finished ranting I calmy told her that I couldnt care less about her feelings and that people who think bringing their 6 year old to a violent movie probably shouldnt procreate in the first place.  The woman didnt have anything to say but the guy looked like he wouldve hit me if i wasnt a third of his size and a female.

Fiance told me I was a bit of a dick. I guess I could have kept my mouth shut but I didnt care to. Kids these days in the US are already so wrongfully involved in fucking gun violence, why would you bring a child to a movie that (if you don‚Äôt have any context) basically glorifies it for 2 hours.

690,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I (F18) am a freshman in college and live at an apartment complex that is sponsored by my university and is under a company called ‚ÄúAmerican Campus Communities.‚Äù So, I was under the impression that the apartments were only available to college students.

My apartment leases by the bedroom + bathroom only, so i decided to get a two bedroom apartment. When you apply for a lease for a two or more bedroom apartment, you undergo a process called roommate matching where you input a bunch of different information on what kind of roommate you would best match with. Things like age, neatness, smoking/non smoking, etc. 

Well, I got matched with a junior at my university who we‚Äôll call D. About a week before move in day, D texted me and told me that she wouldn‚Äôt be moving in after all and would be subletting her bed space, which was fine with me. When I moved in (early August) D still hadn‚Äôt found anyone to take over her lease, so it would just be me living in the apartment until she found someone to take over. 

A few days ago I got another text from D saying that she had found ‚Äúanother girl‚Äù to take over the lease and she would be moving in during the weekend. I was perfectly okay with that until this morning.  I got a knock on my door and opened it to find a 30 year old woman, smoking a cigarette saying that she was my new roommate and she would be moving in tomorrow morning. I was in. shock. 1. because I would come to find out that she wasn‚Äôt a student at my university and had actually graduated from college around 6 years ago, and 2. because I had put on my application that I could not room with anyone who smoked indoors or outdoors because I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to smoke of any kind. 

When I contacted my office, they told me I either had to move out and downgrade to a 3 bedroom, or that I would have to deal with it until July, when my lease is up. When I asked D why she leased her bed space to a 30 year old woman, she told me that there was no age restrictions on who could live there and who could not. But I still feel screwed over. AITA?

Edit: There seems to be confusion as to whether or not the new roommate is a student. She is not a student at my or any university. My apartment complex is advertised as ‚Äústudent only‚Äù and is basically like an upgraded dorm. I hope this helps.

Edit 2: Okay so, my parents ended up driving up and we got it resolved! My apartment didn‚Äôt look at the new roommates application at all when she signed the lease, and didn‚Äôt see that she was a smoker and I wasn‚Äôt. In short,
I get to stay in my apartment, and they‚Äôre moving her into a different unit w/ another smoker.",207,564,0.95

692,Not the A-hole,"I had to go out of town with my family for 2 weeks and I was looking for someone to take care of my dog while we were away. A co-worker offered to take him in for the the time that we were gone. We made all of the arrangements, my wife was going to drop off the dog at her place the day before we left.

Now here's the thing. The dog is very anxious when no humans are around. We adopted him when he was a year old. He went from foster to foster but couldn't find his forever home. When we approached the shelter, we were made aware of his situation and decided to give him a try. They gave us a hard plastic kennel 2 padlocks and some toys. Everything was fine for the first week or so but then we left him alone in the house. We put him in his kennel but didn't think much of the padlocks so we didn't use them. Upon our return, he had managed to escape the kennel and wreck a baby gate, a screen door and some other stuff. We brought him back to his foster family thinking we wouldn't be able to handle his anxiety.

The next day, we felt horrible and decided to call the foster back and readopt him but this time for good. We were told that we had to use the padlocks on the kennel as he's able to open the door. Once outside, he goes berzerk and destroys stuff.

So we've had the dog for about 9 months now with no other issues. Once locked up in there, he can't get out and everything is fine.


When I made the arrangements with my coworker, I made sure to tell her that he needs to be in his crate locked up when she's not home. My wife brought her the dog and again, gave her the crate and locks, told her to use them.


Couple of days later I get some pictures through text. They're having a blast. She tells me she's making the garage doggy proof so that he can't escape. She wants him to have more room. Meanwhile, I'm halfway across the country and made sure to tell her that I don't think this is wise, I wouldn't want her dog to get hurt by my dog in panic mode. She tells me not to worry. 


Maybe a day or 2 later, I get a text from her saying something like this. "" I know it's my fault, but your dog is insane..."" I then receive 3 pictures of the garage. He chewed through a wooden door. Destroyed the garage door and wrecked some other stuff in the garage. She tells me she's going to leave the dog in a large metal cage outside of her house until I find other arrangements because the dog isn't coming back into her home.

At this point my wife and I scramble to find someone else to take care of the dog for the remainder or our trip which is really difficult for us since we have no family in the town we live in. We end up finding someone that took him in until we came back.


My friend hasn't asked for any sort of payment but I was just wondering if I should pay her back. Maybe in totality, maybe partly. I don't think I should since I warned her several times and she refused to use to the crate and locks.",33,38,0.86

696,Not enough info,"Throwaway account. I (25 M) and my GF (24 F) have been dating over three years. Recently, she told me she wants to tattoo her eyebrows. She's always been insecure about how thin they are, but I think she looks amazing with or without makeup (but she fills them in every day). I understand that this isn't for me, but for her - I just think getting a face tattoo is a little extreme and will look a lot different than makeup. She also works in a professional setting, and I know that the first week or so post tattoo can look really dark. My concern is more for the long term effects of the tattoo and the need/want to do so. Also, if I'm being honest, I just don't like the way it looks. I was never aggressive or accusatory, but asked her nicely to consider holding off. She's not happy that I am not supportive. We've talked about it over the month, and I'm trying my best not to tell her what to do with her body, but it's tough because that's how I feel. I feel nervous and sad and upset that she wants to do this (I think she'll look like a cartoon). At the end of the day, her body, her choice (I can't imagine this is something that would break us apart, we have a happy and healthy relationship). So, AITA for asking her not to do this, and more importantly, for me genuinely not wanting her to do this?

She's a very confident, out going person who doesn't censor herself, where I'm the shy, insecure one. So, no surprise, she's the one who can make friends where I struggle. She knows this. This is what started our argument.

She talks about her other friends a lot. She talks about their plans, them hanging out, stuff like that with me often. That's fine. I'll admit, I'm very thin skin and sometimes it hurts, but overall it's whatever. She'll also mention how stressful it is to balance out time with all her friends.

So I was at the (large corporate) store in my city the other day and I went to coustomer service to pick up a money transfer. While I was in line I overheard an employee on the phone with police stating that there was a young woman stealing make-up. They gave a detailed description of the woman including her hair color, clothes, backpack, tattoos and even the male she was with. After I picked up my money transfer I proceeded to the pharmacy section to pick up a few things. Once there I saw the young woman and the male that the store had decribed to the police. My mind started racing and I walked past her and did not stop. However after a minute or two of thinking I decided to approach the couple and told them that the store had called the police on the woman for stealing make-up and that most likley the police were on their way to arrest her. She promptly thanked me, put the make-up back and headed for the door. I do not know however if she made it out without being apprehended. Now like I said, I do not condone stealing in anyway. The reason I warned her is because I have been on the wrong side of the law for the majority of my life. I just in the last 2 years got sober and got my life together. I have been arrested many times in the past and spent a considerable amount of time in jail. Nothing good ever came out of me being arrested, and the fines, court fees, and loss of my license and jobs has seriously set me back in life and created a vicious cycle of getting arrested, loosing my job, then not being able to pay the fines and being arrested again for non payment. Also I really dont like police because of how they have treated me in the past, even though I was probably in the wrong. I just hated to see this young womans life be potentially ruined and be put through the grinder that is our justice system even though she was in the wrong.

Anyhow, I have to admit I'm very indifferent to law as a career. It's not dreadful, but not extremely fascinating either, and I don't think I'll ever practice. The reason I ended up deciding to read law is twofold:

1) I want to enter politics, and a legal degree from a prestigious institute will help immensely whether I practice or not

2) My parents encouraged me to study law since I'm interested in politics, writing, and debate. I didn't really know what to do with myself, so I agreed to go along with it.

My parents pay my tuition, but a few people I know think it is an asshole move for me to make my parents pay tuition for a degree I'll never utilize. I don't see it that way at all. Will I ever directly practice law? Probably not.

I said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""Samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. I told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

Fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. Nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. They don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

Now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. She thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. I've never heard of something like this before. I very much doubt I have this superpower of destroying relationships. But my sister is currently going around telling our relatives I'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

708,Not the A-hole,"So I'm 16 and of course, I hate children. I love my nephew but I refuse to watch him or be alone with him. He can be prone to throwing horrible temper tantrums and overall is a pain to deal with. My sister on the other hand, is 26 and she had him when she was 16. So he is 9 years old coming up on 10. Ever since I turned 16 however, my sister always asks me to watch her kid when she's off at work or hanging out with friends. To be honest, I don't want to do that during my free time. I go to school, have a job and sometimes I just want to relax.

So when she asked me if I could watch my nephew because she was going off to work, I told her no unless she was paying me because he is a pain to deal with. She started yelling at me calling me selfish and telling me to stop being lazy. I work my fucking ass everyday so I was pissed, so I said something I REALLY REALLY REALLY regret. I told her she wouldn't be having this problem right now if she had just kept her legs closed. She got mad and told on me. My mom and sister have been trying to force me to watch him but I refused.

I know what I said was out of line, but he's not my responsibility and I didn't sign up for this. I said what I said out of anger and you know what, maybe it had to be said. I want some unbiased opinions, AITA?

710,Asshole,"This happened on Thursday in a shopping mall. I was in a department store and an old man in his 80s was looking confused and rattled. I‚Äôm a man in my 30‚Äôs, just so you can get an idea. This old man kept dropping stuff and was looking around for someone. 

It was extremely noticeable he was distressed so I approached him and asked if he was ok. He said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find (name)‚Äù who was his wife. This is kind of the way the convo went. 

Him: She was just here, she doesn‚Äôt usually go far away from me. 

Me: Slow down. Who is (name)? Wife, daughter, granddaughter? I can‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt provide more details. 

H: My wife! She had on a blue sweater and black pants. She is very short and fragile. 

M: do you know the last place you saw her?

H: (getting agitated) NO! Where is she?? I said where is she? 

M: Sir, please calm down. I don‚Äôt know who she is and am trying to help you, but I can‚Äôt help you with you yelling and screaming.

At this point he keeps dropping things and I pick them up. Conversation continues as we start pacing around the store. It‚Äôs almost empty, and no employees in sight. 

H: She forgets where she is, she needs to be found. 

M: Which is exactly what I am attempting to do. 

We find her on the other end of the store sitting on a chair which made it hard to see over the clothing racks. She barely speaks and seems tired or confused. 

M: Hi, your husband was looking for you. Are you okay?
(Him and her talking and him asking why she walked away). 

M: Sir, you really need to be more careful. She seems like she is very confused. Please don‚Äôt lose her again, you might not be as lucky. 

H: you don‚Äôt know my wife. 

M: I know her from seeing her looking dazed she is nearly helpless. Do a better job next time and try not to let her wander. As I said, you might not be lucky next time. 

He screams ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough, shame on you‚Äù and walks away. 

I said it because I was worried and the wife seems genuinely out of it. Was i in the wrong for telling him not to lose his wife next time?",73,74,0.72
711,Asshole,"Earlier this morning I was at the children's playground with my 2 yr old and 6 month old.

A group of children and their teacher (presumably their physical education teacher) from a local high school came into the playground. Almost immediately one girl stood on the seat of the swing and began swinging (this swing is designed for children aged 24-47 months). Then some of the children started to come to the play equipment where my 2 yr old was. The teacher asked them not to take over the equipment. I spoke to him and asked him if he was in charge of the group, he confirmed he was. I told him the sign in front of the equipment where my child was playing stated it was for children aged 2-5. He asked the children to move over to the other side. I then also told him I felt it was inappropriate for the girl to stand on the swings that were designed for much younger children. He said it was made of chains and it was ok. I pointed out that the plastic seat could break and it just wasn't appropriate for her to play on the swing like that. (If she was my child I wouldn't be ok with her playing like that, she could hurt herself and its designed for little kids)

I took photos of the girl swinging and of him to use in an email to send to the principal of the school. He informed me I didn't have permission to take those photos. I assured him as it was a public place I indeed was within my rights to do so. I further stated they would only be used as photographic evidence to send to the principal.

At this point he said he felt he was being attacked and that I was ""nit-picking"". He said ""evidence of the crime?!"" I assured him no crime had been committed but it was inappropriate behavior. He then asked me if I knew what age the other playground was for (to which I informed him there would be a sign there stating it). He then instructed the children to go to the other playground (which I'm pretty sure is also for younger children, but whatever).

AM I THE ASSHOLE?! I think I was within my rights to ask him to ask the children in his care to play appropriately on the equipment. He could have made a good judgement call and ask them to play differently, but instead argued with me. I notified the principal of the school via email along with the pictures.",82,32,0.69
712,No A-holes here,"I (20M) spent the last year battling cancer. I was diagnosed last October so had to drop some of my classes at college in order to go home to a local hospital for treatment. I spent half of the fall semester at home and most of the winter (January-april) semester at home completing the treatment regimen. I went back to school in March for a few weeks but relapsed while I was there and then spent April-last week at home to do more intense treatment. That treatment included two weeks of twice a day radiation and a month-long inpatient hospital stay, so I was spending a lot of time with my parents without much of a choice. 

After my recovery was completed, I was able to return to college last weekend. I found out that my mom had texted one of my best friends at school asking her to chaperone me because she didn‚Äôt think that I was in the right state of mind to make good choices for myself. I spent a year with my parents at home after spending a year and change away at college making my own decisions. The year at home was incredibly testing and towards the end of my treatment it was clear how unhappy I was that I was stuck at home.

I see it as an unbelievable betrayal of trust that she would try to enlist one of my friends to chaperone me now that I‚Äôm not under her supervision anymore. When I confronted her about it, the only thing she was concerned about it was how I found out, not the issue itself. That only made me more angry because it was clear she knew I would not like this and knew that doing it behind my back would make me upset. 

AITA for not speaking to her because she did this?

717,Asshole,"Throwaway because my friends know my reddit account.

I have three children: a 27F who lives overseas, 26F daughter Amy and 16M son Terrence. Recently, Amy got engaged and she and her fiance decided to host a small engagement party with just our two families. The celebration was just going to be a brunch at a dress-up place and taking some pictures nearby. Honestly, it sounded like a normal casual family gathering and nothing out of the ordinary.

Amy initially told me it was going to be at 9am and that it would likely end around 11am. Now, Terrence is an amazing baseball player. He's part of the city's Triple A team and he's the only one who can (properly) play his position, so his attendance was very crucial to the team's victory. Terrence had a baseball game at noon, so I thought we could go to Amy's thing, leave a bit early and get to his game by noon (it was about an one hour drive away).

A few days later, Amy texted my wife and I asking if 3pm was okay. There were some relatives coming from out of town the night before and 3pm was the next available slot. We told her OK (my wife is not involved in Terrence's baseball games so she didn't know he had a game that day). My plan was to go with Terrence to his game, leave a bit early, change in the car and get to the party at 3pm. Terrence was on board with this plan as well.

The day comes and my wife asks why Terrence and I were not getting ready at 10. We explain our plan to her and wife calls me an asshole and starts lecturing me. Terrence and I try to explain how important the game is and how he already told his team that he will be there for the first half, but it's all lost to her. We end up leaving anyways and gets an angry call saying that it's a nice place and we can't just show up in sports gear. I assure my wife that I packed clean clothes in the car, but she hangs up on me.

When we get there, I get an angry call from Amy saying that I'm not taking her occassion seriously. I try to be nice, but she's not having any of it, so at this point I get pretty fed up and tell her I'll see her later and hangs up. Coincidentally, the other team surrendered but we don't find out until 1pm (we arrived and no one was there). Because of this, **WE MANAGE TO GET TO THE VENUE ON TIME.**

Despite that, my wife and several other relatives lectured me through the entire event and Amy refused to speak to me. I've been called asshole by a bunch of people. Their entire argument is that I ""could have been late"". I do think everyone else is overplaying the importance of this meal and going a bit too far to insinuate that I'm a bad father. We even showed up on time .... They have also been giving shit to my son  which I think is completely wrong because 1) HE IS A KID and 2) there's nothing wrong with caring about your sports team",62,49,0.8

719,Asshole,"Hi Reddit,

I (38m) recently had a horrible date with a girl (37f). The backstory is, we actually went on a date from a dating site 4 years ago. I drove an hour to meet at a place closer to her. It didn't go well. The reason cited at the time was distance as I was an hours' drive away and she only wanted something ""5 minutes away or so"". She also seemed to hint I wasn't at her ""level"" of success, though we both wanted something long term. For background, she's got a PhD and has a successful career. I had a masters, but was still relatively early in starting up my career.

Fast forward to present day, and lo and behold, we match again on a different app. Only this time, I've moved for a new (significantly better) job and am about 5 minutes from her neighborhood she's stayed in for the past 4 years. The first red flag was she had NO recollection that we had gone out before. How many different people have you dated if you don't remember ever meeting up with me? Anyway, we chat on the app and find she's super stressed and burned out all the time at work. Her dating life hasn't been going well as she's still on these apps 4 years later. In the same neighborhood.

I offer to meet up with her again. I'll also admit she's very pretty. We meet at a bar and go over what's been going on. She still doesn't remember me, but talks about her most recent ex from a couple months ago. The guy didn't want anything long term, requested an ""open relationship"" from the beginning when they started dating, lived very far away, was emotionally unavailable (her words), her friends hated him, and they dated like this for 12 months. In my mind I'm thinking this just sounds like an extended booty call, but keep silent. She then mentions she has high expectations for a significant other, and won't compromise, which is her choice of course.

This all sounded hypocritical given everything I'd learned about her and how our original first date 4 years ago went. When we originally met back then, I was ""too far"" away, and not at the proper success level. Now I find she's okay with doing an open relationship with someone who lives far away and doesn't want anything long term? On top of that, she mentions she wants to be married and have kids eventually. I mention that might be hard to find if you're not willing to compromise, and those guys who might meet her checklist criteria could be douchey as well (see her ex), and I could see her getting divorced if that happens. I didn't say this in a mean or lecturing sort of tone. She then flips and says she's gonna leave now, and immediately walks out. I sat there for a moment, finished my drink, picked up the tab, and left. I think about it and laugh a bit now given the absurdity of the entire situation. Was I an asshole here? Or did I just dodge another bullet for the second time?",41,43,0.75

722,Not the A-hole,"So, my baby is turning 1 next week, let's call her Ellie. Shes a very much loved first grandchild for my family but the second very much loved grandchild for my partners family, if that make sense. 

Her cousin, let's say Shelly, is a veery much loved first child for my partners family. Shelly is an only child and spends a lot of time with my partners mother (while mums at work etc), her grandmother. The love is strong, lol. And I do think that's pretty awesome, however.. 

Long story short, with out trying to sound like an over protective mum, grandmother wants to buy presents for Shelly to open on Ellie's first birthday ""so everyone is happy"". 

Which I think is fuckn bat shit insane. 

Now, Shelly is a, let's say, high maintenance child - with very little discipline. She gets whatever she wants, whatever way she wants it.

There's toys she's not alloud to play with, only Shelly, often will take whatever she's playing with for her own, etc. Just general kids stuff. Adults let it happen, I don't worry toooo much outwardly I just make sure to be fair. Ellie is spoilt enough with me and my family, she knows she's amazing and loved. 

However, it is important to me that my daughter gets to be number one on her birthday, like everyone should be! 

Admittedly it is her first birthday, and she's most likely not going to remember it AT ALL. I just don't want her thinking FOR EVEN A SECOND that someone else trumps what she wants (within reason ofcourse) even on her birthday.

Ellie's birthday lunch is at our house, just a small casual thing with a few gifts and maybe a few cupcakes or something. Very low key. Just family.

724,Everyone Sucks,"Not really sure the best way to word it but here it goes,

So my girlfriend (30f) has a great job. She makes 15k-20k a month and could support us both if it came down to it. She pays the majority of rent, i pay the majority of other bills. She is pretty high up in the food chain of her industry and for the most part only reports to 2 other people, one of which is her close friend. I (27f) work in the same industry at an entry level and make about 1/3 or 1/4 of what she makes. Im the youngest employee at my job by far and the only female, i do not know anyone at my job personally. We both work 50+ hours a week. We have been together 4.5 years.

Any time something happens that would put someone out (pet emergency, needing to be home for repair work being done, picking up forgotten groceries) her expectation is that im the one who does it. as an example today when i left the air was left off, our cats and dog need it on if it gets too hot. She wanted me to turn around and be 30-40 mins late to work to turn on AC. I can go on my lunch and offered that which was not good enough. Being that late means a write up, i cant do it. She cant do it because her position is too important to leave work. Im now in hot water for refusing to turn around with intentions of turning it on when i take lunch. She claims its normal to be frequently late for stuff regarding our pets (i have left work mid day because of stuff happening on our pet can at home) and that i should stick up to my managers for expecting us to be on time (?????). Her thought process is that if i lost my job she would be able to carry the weight financialy. My thought process is she is not my wife and if i burn bridges in this industry and she leaves me im fucked. 

Another example is that my work just implemented a new schedule that requires way more hours, she expects me to be able to take extended lunches (which i can do on some days if its slow with permission) to walk our dog. She also wants me to demand different hours (which i have been shut down my management on) and she thinks im just not asking when i have been turned down for that request already. She shows no understanding when these things dont work out.

I feel that she has been in management and working with friends so long she has no idea whats expected of entry level employees anymore. I also feel that its selfish to put her career above mine rather the seeing it as equally important given that we both work hard and want to get ahead. I dont expect her to do these things in my place but i do expect understanding and flexibility when it cant be done how she wants.

And to not just be negitive about her she is an amazing woman who takes wonderful care of me and i love our life together. Im also by no means a perfect girlfriend myself. 

AITA for wanting her to treat my job like its as important as hers?

She then put on a nightgown, think of a really oversized shirt if you arent familiar. She then went and layed down on the couch.
 After we cooked some food (ribs, mac and cheese, and coleslaw) I went to the bathroom (#1) and was in there maybe 1 minute. When i came out of the bathroom she was standing in the kitchen and had shit herself and the floor.
I went outside to smoke so I didnt lose my shit. She went into the bathroom and apparently shit everywhere except in the toilet. My husband came outside and told me that she went to the guest room and didnt say a word to him. I told him what I saw in the kitchen when I came out of the bathroom. He didnt believe me. Once he saw what happened he immediately went up and got her out of bed and made her clean it up. 
This is where it really gets me even more upset. She basically starts taking old bath towels and smearing it around using her foot on top of the towel. I go back outside because at this point I'm so mad I'm in tears. Once I go back inside she starts packing her stuff (she lives an hour away and had planned on staying the night) and I lose it. I start yelling how is she going to shit all over our house and then leave and not say I'm sorry and clean her shit up. She leaves in tears. 
My husband and I get out all the cleaners, bleach, mop, etc and clean all night. She has called him and said sorry, not to me, and said the reason was because the food was good and I took to long in the bathroom. She told him she also left because I yelled at her.

728,Not the A-hole,"So, the title is probably almost as weird as the actual explanation. Bear with me.

I've got the typical awful, overbearing MIL situation. The woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. Her son and I have been together almost 7 years. We have two kids. She's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call CPS if we didnt bow to her wishes. Suffice to say this woman is insane, and we DID end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.

So, we are no contact with her off and on. Currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. The most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. It's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. Now, maybe I'm just being petty because her and I obviously dont get on, but I'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.

My boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. So I was INSTANTLY suspicious of this fucking thing. I disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.

I was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a MUCH better idea than disabling it.

Put it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.

I feel like disabling it is enough, but I would be lying if I said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. Is it over the top to do this if I'm pretty confident that she WOULD just drop in and see this happening?

Thanks in advance!

However, last week my GF found out somehow and got extremely mad at me. For the record we have all our own separate finances and do not live together. She was as mad as I've ever seen her and she told me that I'm the biggest asshole she's ever seen and other stuff. She basically said that I have to stop giving my parents money or she'd leave me, so she's making me choose between my parents and her. I told her that growing up as a rich white girl she would never understand the situation my parents are in and how much we struggled growing up. And that she's lucky her parents are well off and don't need any help but some of us aren't that lucky. She just kept re-iterating that for us to get married and have kids in the future I'd need to stop giving my parents this much money.

Hes a bit claustrophobic and doesnt like being in his room for too long. he likes to go into dining room and play Solitaire. My dining room has hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings, everything echoes  in there throughout the whole house.  So, he goes in there and plays cards every day for hours at a time. He literally sits there 4 to 5 hours at a time twice a day. Now whats pissing me off is hes sitting there loudly shuffling the cards after each game, repetitively, he does it on avg 15-20 times, after each loud shuffle he bangs the deck of cards on dining room table. Im not exaggerating. This noise absoluelty driving me fucking crazy. Lile,nails on a chalkboard. It's all,day every fucking day. Ive tried to be accommodating, ive provided table cloths and things to dull the noise but he,just moves them out of the way. I have,to go outside to make a phone call. I've had to leave my house to,escape the noise. I can't take anymore. Ive asked him to at least play in,his bedroom he always says you know I'm claustrophobic . WIBTA if I just outright  forbid it, and throw all the cards away?

Edit: He is 49 years old. He has several computers, he plays guitar, he has this project in my back yard where he uses solar panels to power up small kitchen appliances. I understand that it makes him happy and perhaps i should have worded it differently i wouldn't actually throw cards away.

Que, me becoming his enemy and bearing brunt of his caustic comments at 14.I was called fat (I had a bmi of 20) and ugly and that I had no brains. I didn't even respond to those comments and my mom asked me to ignore them.

At 16,moved away to college, came home for about a month or two per year (I lived just 3 hours away) and I do have a good relationship with my mom. My dad always stirred up some drama making me dread coming home.

 Mom guilted me into mending relationship, I tried to by buying him gifts, cooking his favourite dishes and ignoring his caustic comments.

I was okay with putting things behind us but a week ago he started acting up again, screaming and shouting and I tried to calm him by giving him a glass of water, he fakes heavy breathing saying his bp is rising and then forgets doing this in middle  (haha). Takes the glass out of my hand and pours it on his head. I offer him a towel saying he'd catch cold and he says that he doesn't want my""fake affection "" and asks me 10 thing I did in last 3 years that show my affection.

I list out things and he says he doesn't need favours and that I should call a priest and hold a funeral as of now I have no father. I start crying and ask him to stop screaming cause people might hear and that I'd be seeing him probably once a year from now on and if he can just pretend things are okay. He says no.

Mom comes, asks him to stop his drama and he does!
And then asks me to toast bread for him and goes about his day as if everything is fine.

This sort of thing was common when I was a kid but I thought he might have changed. Frankly I have no patience for this behaviour. I'd be seeing him a lot less from January.

737,No A-holes here,"I am currently pregnant with my fourth/fifth (and last) children. During my prior pregnancies, I would always let my husband touch/kiss my belly and talk to my belly as much as he wanted, but something about it this time makes my skin crawl. I think it is because I feel so touched out since we have three little ones all under the age of five who need a lot of physical interaction each day and who also want to touch my belly. I spend the whole day with them and then my husband comes home and immediately wants to touch me also. I am glad in a way that he does, but that really is the last thing I want each night. 

I  also am struggling with him touching my belly, I think, because I am starting to feel like a brood mare, so when he focuses more on my belly than on me then it reinforces that thought. For example, he'll want to kiss my belly before he kisses me, and that makes me feel less like a person and more like an object.

I should also add that I wonder if partly this is subconscious resentment. I originally wanted three kids, but my husband persuaded me to have one more which turned out to be twins. And this pregnancy has been so much harder than any of my others.

My husband has been very upset about this because he thinks I am denying him the ability to bond with his children, and in some ways I agree. But right now I just don't feel comfortable with anyone other than my kids touching my belly.

738,Not the A-hole,"I bought a new house this year and now rent out the old one, have had tenants in there for a few weeks now.

When we lived there we didn‚Äôt get on with the neighbours because the house had paper thin walls and so could hear every movement, which we generally leant to ignore. The neighbour had 2 young girls who she would scream and shout at all the time as well as a dog which would bark which became harder and harder to ignore and accept.

To put it in perspective so you know I‚Äôm not being pathetic here‚Äôs a few examples as I understand that sometimes children do play up and voices need to be raised and dogs can also bark - I have a dog who barks.

Example 1 - earlier this year, on a sunny Sunday morning at around 8 o‚Äôclock. The neighbours two girls (6/7 and 9/10) woke up and went into the mums room. An acceptable time for this to happen. The girls were screamed at to ‚Äògo back to fucking bed‚Äô. 

Example 2 - the TV remote has gone missing. Instead of politely asking the girls the mum screamed up the stairs ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the fucking remote‚Äô

Example 3 - the dog barked in the day, I can deal with this but more often than not, it would quietly but consistently bark in the early hours of the morning (2/3/4 am) and wake me up. Her way of stopping the dog from barking was to shout at it. 

Today we had a text from her which began;

‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry if your ever heard us be noisy I never realised how paper thin the walls were‚Äô

Total bullshit as when the dog was barking, I would shout through the walls and she responded - she knows how thin the walls are!

‚ÄòYour tenants are so noisy that my daughter can no longer sleep in her own bedroom and they [the girls] have been exposed to the ‚ÄòC‚Äô word‚Äô 

The girls have been exposed to the ‚ÄòC‚Äô word as I‚Äôve heard her shout it on many occasions.

We‚Äôre actually not allowed to contact the tenant as we went through an agency. We‚Äôre a bit concerned about the house so will get a house check sorted but am I the asshole for telling her we can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt be doing anything about the noise level and she has to sort it herself - not my problem!

740,Asshole,"I had my first child, Jessica, with my ex-wife when I was just 20 years old. We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.

Eventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.

My wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica‚Äôs usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.

My ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn‚Äôt the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.

When Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn‚Äôt visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.

The next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.

In my mind we were simply being realistic. It wouldn‚Äôt have been fair to Jessica to be here in the chaos of a new baby, and it wouldn‚Äôt have been fair to my wife to make her care for a child that wasn‚Äôt hers when she was so vulnerable. In literally all other cases she treated Jessica like one of her own. Likewise, at the time my brother was a flake, so leaving her with them was not an option.

I ask this now because Jessica just turned 18. I called her up and asked if we could put the past behind us and begin again, as adults. She said she had no interest in making a relationship with someone who wasn‚Äôt even family to her.

I told her she was malicious and that she has chosen to hold a grudge for years. I said I would never be able to be worthy to her, and that I was done going through that pain. If she wanted a relationship I would be there, but I wouldn‚Äôt force it.

744,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Everyone involved is in the 25-30 years old range.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow, or rather in 12 hours, we have a family picknick and I just don't feel like going anymore.

Here's the thing. We had an absolute blast of a birthday today. A quality over quantity day which I will cherish forever. Until her brother started kissing GF's best friend. My girlfriend tried to matchmake them several years ago, but it never had any lift-off. Admittedly, they have the potential to be a great couple. What that set me off is that her brother is married. And has a kid.

When the involved friend just went to kiss my girlfriend's brother he went along with it. I can understand that, I truly do. Mistakes happen, especially under the influence of mind elevating substances. However, going back for more is crossing the boundary of it being a moment of weakness.

What amazed me the most was that her friends were cheering them on. The wife of the brother is a bit of a hermit. The friend of my GF is fun, attractive and social, so ofcourse everybody would love to see them together. I was appalled by the 'positive' reactions of (nearly) everybody.

Yet still, I kept my mouth shut and enjoyed the rest of the evening. He is an adult and it is none of my business. He knew what he was doing and the wife is aware of a history of comparable behaviour. If such a relationship works for them, then why should I choose to intervene and smite them with my sword of subjective justice?

What I could not accept is that my GF offered them her bedroom and we would sleep in the living room on a pull-out bed. It's her appartment, so it's her say. That is not the issue. The issue is that the person I trust and love stimulates (subjective(?)) immoral behaviour, because she would love to see her best friend together with her brother.

The brother, his wife and his kid are attending the family birthday picknick tomorrow.

The immage of sitting there and seeing them started to loop over and over in my head, so I packed my stuff after we already went to bed. She tried to figure out what was bothering me while I was packing my stuff. I explained what was gnawing at me, and her reply simply was ""oh you just don't understand"". Well, maybe I don't. Fuck man. Maybe I really don't.

I do not know what to do. I really don't want to go tomorrow. There is so many things that make me angry, sad, and another range of emotions which currently are exacerbated by drugs/alcohol. But still.. I wonder if I feel the same tomorrow when I'm sobered up. Her birthday is really important to her. I'm starting to severely doubt myself here. I'm not a black and white kinda guy, atleast I hope I'm not.

My truth is: He cheated on his wife. It is not a mere mistake if you go back for more.

The facts are: The friend of GF went in for the initial kiss. He went looking for more several times.

So, WIBTA if I cancel going to the birthday tomorrow?

***UPDATE:***

I would like to thank everyone for sharing their honest opinions, experiences and insights. I have gained a bit more information about the whole ordeal, and I feel satisfied with the answers I have received. ***To an extent.***

&#x200B;

Context:Brother is in the country for a couple of months. Wife and kid came along. I was unintentionally left in the dark concerning some information, but there seems to be a 'sweeping it under the rug' kind of mentality, and as I've understood so far the wife participates in that. Fine. But I do not consider that an open relationship.

Being left in the dark and having to see the experience unfold in front of me and being informed about it in hindsight is disconcerning to me. However, it is something I *usually* am able to cope with, as I deem the awareness part on the wife's side the most important aspect of it all. In addition, with that information I am able to understand what the motivation of my girlfriend is. She stated she would not accept them having sex in her bed. The friend who initiated was having a 'bad trip' of sorts and they were comforting each other. Again, fine. The chronological facts, personality of the friend and miscommunication all line up.

Now here is what is gnawing at me. He has been in the country for X amount of months. There were 'friends' in the room who were more distanced to the complex aspects of their relationship , but in order to react to the situation must have been:A. Aware of the situation and therefore could morally justify the actions (even I don't fully agree with it, I can still understand and therefore cope);

B. Unaware and therefore had an intersubjective (and immoral from my perspective) opinion that the initiating friend was a good trade-up, because she's more fun, X, Y and Z;

C. *Fill in your option in the comments.*

Fine. But!

I am a foreigner in this country, isolated from my own friends and family for more than 14.000 kilometers. These are ***her*** close friends, but I love them nonetheless as my own. I just have strong beliefs that if the relationship breaks up, our social network will naturally be more inclined to take her side. I do not resent that thought nor act upon it, but I keep it in the back of my head as a realistic scenario. Please criticise this thought if you think I am wrong, I am here to learn.

People consider me fun to hang out with, social, helpful and kind, but I am introverted as fuck (INTP). Social experiences drain me, but I do enjoy them and certainly try to add value to gatherings. I just can't keep up with a large consecutive quantity of social events. What if the day comes friends think that Mr. SomeGuyInTheFuture is a more suitable partner because they perceive him as more fun, X, Y and Z? Will they condone, encourage or even provoke a break up?

Yes, this sounds anxious. Maybe even paranoid. I hope that in a way it also sounds realistic. Again, please criticise if you do not agree or if I'm looking through a micrososcopic lens where the use of a telescope might be more suitable.

I promise to keep you guys updated concerning the follow up events. Right now I just need time to think about my feelings related to the update of the post. I truly value all of your opinions and it helps me get out of my echo chamber and have a constructive conversation with my partner.

My sincere gratitude.

745,Not the A-hole,"I am bisexual, but am not out to my paternal grandparents, or anyone on my dad's side of the family. While I do love my grandparents a lot, they (especially my grandmother) have a habit of casually dropping homophobic views into the conversation every so often. I've been out to my parents since I was 16, and they've always told me that while my dad's side of the family will always love me, they might not understand my orientation if I were to come out. 

Last week my family and I were visiting my parents' hometown for a holiday, and we were staying with my grandparents. We were all pleasantly chatting when my grandmother derailed the conversation by talking about how a friend of theirs was justified in hiding the fact that his daughter is a lesbian, and how she is acting inappropriately and shaming her family by being open about her long-term relationship. 

My parents and sister immediately started debating my grandmother, but honestly I could hardy hear them over how loud my heart was beating. After a minute, I couldn't stay quiet and blurted out that if my boyfriend happened to be a girl, I hoped that my grandmother would treat her with all the kindness she shows to my boyfriend now. My grandmother turned to me and calmly said that if I were to hypothetically ever come out (remember, she thinks I'm straight), then she hopes that she's long dead so she doesn't have to deal with the social shame. At this point I left the room and cried for a bit, and the rest of the holiday was basically ruined for me.  

Now here's the part where I may be in the wrong. After I was done being sad, I started to feel quite angry. I can't stop thinking about this incident and others like it, and I suppose I do want to ""punish"" my grandparents for their views. My grandparents are visiting for another holiday in a few weeks, and I really want to come out to them while they're here. I know that their reaction will not be positive, and I don't care. I want them to feel upset and ashamed, the same way that they make me feel when they say homophobic things. However, this is something that I can't take back, and I'm worried that if I do come out, I'd be doing so for all the wrong reasons. I'm in a serious relationship with a man, so it's not like I need to come out for a tangible reason. I also know that my parents would be on my side, which would make for an awkward visit. Overall I'm very conflicted, and am wondering if I'm being kind of petty about the whole thing.

746,Asshole,"My fiance loves talking politics, and is the type to get passionate and heated whenever a political discussion starts. He's very up to date on the issues and will often interject with factoids about things like law, tax policy, differences in jurisdictions, economics,  etc. Because of this, people tend to respect his opinion.

He's super liberal (as am I) and will often go on impassioned defenses of your standard fare liberal issues and earn ""You're such a great guy!"" comments from our friends and family for progressive views on women's rights and the like. On top of that, his mother considers him an expert on electoral politics and will seek out his opinion during election years.

My fiance has never registered to vote.  He has never voted. He is well over 30. He has been hiding this from everyone in his family for well over a decade. As far as I know, I'm the only one that knows his secret. 

I've tried to get him to register a million times (we've gone to the movies and walked by easy register stations and he will refuse and say he will do it later).

A couple weeks ago though I saved up for a weighted blanket because I thought it would be a lot easier to deal with and it totally was. Now I just use that blanket along with my regular comforter and sheet set. Now while I absolutely love it, I don‚Äôt need it to sleep.

Last week I (17) got roped into watching my niece (5) over night because my sister had to work and our mom had plans. My niece has autism which causes her to have tantrums every now and then which is why I don‚Äôt often watch her, but sometimes I have to because my sister (23) can‚Äôt always afford or find a sitter, which is why she still lives with our mom. In case its not clear we‚Äôre actually half sisters and half the time I them the other half I live with my dad and step mom.

So my niece had a really hard time going to sleep. Like it was almost midnight and she was all over the place. Which is not uncommon, but I was really tired myself and just wanted to go to sleep. So I thought why not try and use the blanket on her because thats kind of what they‚Äôre made for. Well it worked pretty well and calmed her down and she soon fell asleep. I was a little annoyed though that I didn‚Äôt have my blanket to use anymore. 

The next morning my sister found her with the blanket and we got to talking about them. I told her how well it worked. She didn‚Äôt really believe me so I let her use another night. My sister was very pleased by the results. So, over throughout the week when my niece had two really bad tantrums my sister asked if she could use the blanket. I said yes because she just looked so exhausted herself.

When she looked into buying one she became reluctant because my niece only likes very specific things my sister doesn‚Äôt want to get her another one that she may not like since I don‚Äôt remember which brand I got. She is short on cash so she doesn‚Äôt want to have to buy multiples because honestly they can get rather expensive. I know mine was over $100 because I wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the beads spilling out issues that a lot of the cheaper ones have. I

Well, when I went back to my dads the other night I brought my blanket with me. My sister calls me late one night completely frazzled and asks where I left my blanket because niece just wont calm down. When I told her I had it with me at my dads she was upset. Not at me, just at the situation she had to deal with.

Now I‚Äôm supposed to go back to my moms today and I don‚Äôt really want to bring blanket back over there or at least sneaking it over there and saying I left it at my dad. I‚Äôm tired of not getting to use it whenever I want and also I just don‚Äôt want to share it because something about a sharing blanket all the time feels gross to me.

UPDATE: Several people have informed me that it is very dangerous for a child to use an adult size weighted blanket, so I guess the whole thing doesn‚Äôt matter now. I‚Äôll just help my sister find a kid sized one.

Also sorry about calling the meltdowns she was having tantrums. Still learning about correct terminology.

Here's the situation: I (15m) have had a lifelong struggle with anxiety and depression. I finally have started seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression. For this she prescribed Zoloft. It took me a long time to accept this reality and I haven't shared it with anyone, including my closest friends. I also happen to be Gay? Bi? Pan? (I'm only 15 idk what's going on). This is an extreme source of anxiety for me and I've only shared it with people I've spent years building up trust with.

I asked her why she did this and she got extremely offended I would even ask.

751,Asshole,"I am sure it will be asked, so to confirm, this is our first child together and also her first pregnancy. It is an exciting time for us, but I have thought for a while now that my wife has gone overboard with how much she talks about her pregnancy. I am not the only one to have noticed. I have gotten comments on the side from friends and family members who think the same. 

To me, this is another life event, and while I agree that it is an important one, there are other things that still matter. I feel like multiple Facebook updates everyday and similar posts on Instagram is excessive. I also think she has been extremely rude by turning almost every conversation with friends, family and others into a conversation about her and her pregnancy. Even our conversations now are the same way. It seems like these days if it isn't related to her pregnancy she doesn't care about it.

I finally had enough last week. My job has been hellish lately, so when I get home each night I want to relax (usually by zoning out for an hour or two) for a bit. That night the same thing happened which has been happening - she wants to spend hours talking to me about things we've already talked about and that I really don't need to know or talk to her about again. I asked her if she could let me have an hour or two to unwind, and she refused. Instead she starts going on about how I never am interested in the baby or her pregnancy despite the fact that this is an absolute lie. I have done nothing but listen for months even though many times she isn't giving me new information. It is a repeat of something she has already told me many times!  This p\*\*\*\*d me off, and I snapped and told her that even if that was true it was because she talks to much about her pregnancy to the point where even her family thinks she is difficult to be around. I could have told her that they even have started avoiding her for this reason but I did not.

I love my wife and have always found her to be reasonable, but lately she has not been. I have indulged her more than what my father-in-law told me he would have indulged her (others have told me the same), but I think she needed to finally hear the truth about how out-of-control her behavior has been. I do feel bad thought because obviously what I said hurt her, but I don't think I was wrong for telling her what I did. She hasn't gotten any of the hints anyone has given her, so what else could I have done?

From my personal research I known that Mormonism is a racist ideology. It describes brown people as being brown for being cursed as sinners. I as a brown person, want nothing to do with someone who subscribes to racism even if it‚Äôs only part of a greater religious.

I told the Mormon guy about this and he said it‚Äôs true and didn‚Äôt deny it, but it doesn‚Äôt mean all brown people are bad now but come from a bad history. I feel like he is and his beliefs are insensitive.
 

I have told my friends this and have said that if is coming somewhere I won‚Äôt be there, most of my friends took my side. However the girl who invites him didnt and I have told her that, if she doesn‚Äôt think that racism is a serious issue, I don‚Äôt know if we can continue this friendship. 


I think that in the west Mormonism is so common that people are desensitized to the fact that it‚Äôs a racist ideology in plain sight, and I from having exmormon friends know this from them as well and i was told by two of them that Mormons during missionary training to convert others are told to avoid these ‚Äúsensitive subjects‚Äù and pretend it‚Äôs not true until someone is already convinced of the religion and then slowly tell them about it.

I do very well, and so do Amy‚Äôs parents, so Amy has grown up with a lot of brand names. I‚Äôm pretty young, 28F, and I like to dress nicely, I like hanging out with my nieces.

760,Not the A-hole,"I know this sounds awful and I feel awful but please hear me out.

My husband and I adopted our sweet Baby Grinch right after we got married. She was 8 weeks old, teensy tiny, and the sassiest girl ever. She was a chihuahua mix of some sort. Love at first sight.

It has been 16 years since we adopted her. In the past year, her health had been steadily declining. She began to have trouble walking on her own, she was less active, and she began having seizures. A vet appointment at the time revealed she was struggling with some very serious health issues and euthanasia was heavily recommended to us. We decided to try to medicate her and see if treatment helped.

For the past few months I have watched Baby Grinch deteriorate. I tried to talk to my husband countless times about putting her to sleep, but he adamantly refused. Another vet appointment and our vet said euthanasia was the most humane thing we could do for Baby Grinch, and that there weren‚Äôt any treatment options left. My husband still refused.

I know it‚Äôs hard to let go of a beloved pet. Baby Grinch was literally our baby. But it got to the point where she couldn‚Äôt even get up to go to the bathroom. She would lay in her own waste and have seizures. She didn‚Äôt have the strength to greet us when we got home anymore. She had no quality of life, she was suffering horribly. 

I had so many tearful arguments with my husband, begging him to put her to sleep. It hurt me so much seeing her suffer in pain. I tried having calm conversations, arguments, just straight up begging him. He refused. He was in denial about how sick Baby Grinch was, and he didn‚Äôt want to let go.

I hoped she would just die naturally so her pain would end but after weeks of waiting, she was still holding on. My husband pur√©ed her food and syringe fed her. He syringe fed her water. He would pick her up and carry her around the house. He would hold her while she had seizures.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I took her to the vet while my husband was at work and had her put to sleep. I texted him before the procedure to see if he wanted to come, but said she was getting put to sleep today, period. He blew up my phone and told me this wasn‚Äôt going to happen and he was going to come take her home immediately, he was going to tell the vet to stop the procedure. So I had the vet put her to sleep before he got there.

He hates me. He told me so. He‚Äôs cried and screamed at me, given me the cold shoulder, threatened divorce. I understand he‚Äôs grieving but I think I did the right thing for Baby Grinch. She was in so much pain. Watching her fall asleep in the vet office was the most relieving thing on the planet. 

But my husband and some of our family thinks I am a monster, and I feel like one.

AITA Reddit? I loved my dog, I really loved her. I just couldn‚Äôt watch her suffer anymore.

EDIT: I want to thank all of you for your kind words. This has been one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to deal with in my life. Your support means so much to me, and I deeply appreciate it.

To clear up some confusion:

1) I texted and called my husband before the procedure to give him the opportunity to say goodbye to Baby Grinch. He refused and was going to take her back home. I did not tell him the night before because he wouldn‚Äôt have let me leave the house.

2) My husband was continuing Baby Grinch‚Äôs treatment, prolonging her suffering indefinitely. He did not want to stop treatment and let her die naturally, which was one of the compromises I offered. She likely could have lived several more months with the treatment.

3) Baby Grinch had been deteriorating for several months. During this time I tried to communicate with my husband and find a solution for both of us. He did not want to let her go. We went to multiple veterinarians and he was able to hear directly from them that euthanasia was recommended. We went to a counseling session together, but got nowhere. I feel like there was no win-win situation here. Someone was going to end up hurt. I chose to do what I thought was best for my dog.

4) I loved Baby Grinch, and always will. I spent countless nights crying while holding her in my arms. So many fights with my husband where I wept and begged him to consider ending her misery. Watching her suffer was the most heartbreaking, traumatic thing I have ever had to live through. She would cry out in pain while she had a seizure. She couldn‚Äôt walk, she couldn‚Äôt eat or drink on her own, she couldn‚Äôt even lift her head up to greet us. She was suffering so terribly.

5) Husband and I had a meaningful and tearful conversation after this post went up. We now have a counseling appointment together to work through this. We both hurt each other, but I have hope we can fix this. We also have grief counseling together and separately as well. 

Again, thank you all for your input and support. Much love to all of you.",1155,4759,0.95

My sister, their mother, relies 100% on her boyfriend for everything. But since he's the only working adult in their house he can't watch the kids when she needs him to. In these instances it falls to my parents (early 50's) and myself (early 20's). I currently work two jobs and go to university full time so I have a LOT on my plate and I'm always tired (or begging for death). I'm also currently dealing with bronchitis so when she told me we have to watch her kids today (reason unknown) I told my parents and my sister that I'll be using my day off to do homework and rest because...bronchitis.

That apparently was the worst thing I could have said. Sister yelled at me through the phone saying I was the worst aunt and I don't love those kids. I eventually hung up on her because I don't deal with her bullshit and I had to go to work. Parents came to me and started yelling because I was disrespectful to my sister...I stressed I have bronchitis and my parents literally told me, ""The kids have a cold too, it's not a big deal."" I didn't know the kids were sick too so I told them I for sure don't want to be around them and get them even more sick AND have them get me more sick. I don't have sick days or paid time off at either of my jobs and if I miss class it affects my grade. So whenever I get sick I have to do my best to suck it up and work through it. That's why my days off are so important to me and I'd much rather do homework and rest than spend 8 hours with the kids.

764,No A-holes here,"I got married 3 weeks ago. No one was told or invited with a few exceptions.

My mum is an alcoholic and (in my opinion) narcissistic. My dad is lovely and generally supportive but he also enables her. When she drinks, which is always, she gets nasty. Whatever you do is wrong and if you agree with her on something she will change her stance just so she can disagree. The world revolves around her.
I didn't want this at my wedding but felt that if I don't invite my mum, it's not fair to invite anyone else.

We're not religious one bit in our family and I'm not too romantic outside of the house. We didn't get married for any lovey dovey reasons and could happily have remained together unmarried for the rest of our lives however it seemed prudent. A super small wedding with just me, my husband, and our 2 best friends from childhood seemed most suitable and we went out for dinner after.

I wanted to wait at least 1 week to tell my parents, worried that they would make a fuss and visit if they found out to close after the wedding. (They live 500 miles away). 
After the 1 week they went on a holiday with some friends, I wasn't aware of this and so waited until they came back, 3 weeks.
I phoned to tell them yesterday. My mum didn't say anything at first and then changed the subject to Brexit. My dad seemed happy but phoned me this morning quite annoyed that we hadn't told them and that getting married is a big thing that parents have a right to know. He compared it to having a baby and not telling anyone, which in my books are massively different. I tried explaining that I don't see getting married as a big thing as it doesn't change anything in me and my husband's relationship. He wasn't having it and we just ended the phone call.

We both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. I had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. It's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

Now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. I don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. She mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. It begins to smell immediately and after an hour? I've thrown up before from the smell. But whatever, kids gotta eat.

My problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. She'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when I'm at work. After 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. I always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. Try as I might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. I even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

After about a month of this, I've begun just throwing them out. Instead of cleaning them, I throw my dishes away. We have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate.

They roll their eyes and think it's not a big deal. But I do. It was bad enough at one point that I had to start counting my pens in the morning because I was constantly missing them. I moved my desk around and was able to mostly hide my cup of pens, but sometimes they'll still use them. When they use them, I never get them back. I find them laying all over the clinic.

I'm very particular about what kind of pens I use. I have also ordered them tons of pens/markers/sharpies to use so there is no reason to take mine.

I used to have a touch more flexibility but corporate has cracked down hard so now everyone is punished. I bring my own stuff because I do not want to use the cheap stuff from Staples.

779,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I just moved to a new city. We have a nanny for our child (2 years old) but she's only been working for us for 3 months and has never done an overnight till now (honestly I don't even know if she's willing to do them).


My brother has decided to have a small courthouse wedding with his fiance next month (budget issues). There's going to be a small reception afterwards. The thing is he lives a state away so this would be an overnight trip. 


He has decided he wants his wedding to be childfree. However my child has never been away from me at night and we're both not comfortable leaving our young child with our relatively new nanny for 2-3 days (drive up, attending wedding and reception,  driving down). We are planning on just sending a gift as we cannot travel without our child right now.


This will effectively leave my brother without anyone from his family at his wedding. My parents are not in the best of health and live in a completely different state. They are both only children and our grandparents have also passed away. We are not that close to our extended family.


My brother called me and said I was an asshole for not coming to his wedding. I tried to explain the situation to him but he didn't care. He said we should compromise for two days so he could have some family support for one of the most significant days of his life. I admittedly got pissed off that he was trying to discount the impact it could have on my child and I told him this situation was his own fault. If he wanted a childfree wedding that's his decision, but if he wants me to be able to come he's the one who needs to be able to compromise.

ETA: I don't live in the U.S. I think this might be relevant because everyone keeps saying a nanny is expensive and while it is, I'm not aware of any other options that I have to take care of my kid while I work.",170,252,0.92
780,Not the A-hole,"Me (F27) and my husband (M26) got married in July. About two weeks before it, his parents said they'd like to get us return flights to France as birthday presents for us. They have a house out there so we would be staying with them for free too. 

Sounds lovely, very kind, thank you. 

Then they booked them.

They booked without properly checking our a availability, or when we would like to go. This happened just at the point of getting ready for our wedding where we were doing final checks and preparations so I'll be honest and say we were already a little stressed and would have rather they waited till after. 

To be fair, they booked our flights for during the school holidays because I work at a school so they considered that.

However, I have university too, so I could only do certain dates in the holidays. Also, they booked it for 8 days which is longer than we wanted. Not only this, but they've booked them for ridiculous times - the check-in for our outward journey is 5am and there is no public transport that can get us there, and our homeward one gets in at midnight and we have the same problem. I appreciate that they want us to spend as much time in France as possible but this has made it difficult and we have a puppy to consider. 

Kindly, they changed the dates of my outward flights so that I could make it to university. My husband is still going for 8 days but now I'm only going for 4. I'm going to need to drop my husband off at the airport for 5am and then drive to university on the day he leaves, then drive myself a few days later for 5am again. We have had to pay ¬£40 to park our car. 

They have written my name wrong on my ticket, and told us the incorrect date that we get back so we have had to change dog care too. 

The flights are ¬£50 each and fly from Scotland where we live if you think that information is helpful. This isn't the first time they have been very generous but done it on their terms without consulting us whatsoever and ended up with us having to pay money to make something work or they have not considered that we have other things happening in our lives so they should check dates with us before they arrange things that can't be changed. 

One recent example includes getting a friend to buy us a dishwasher as a wedding gift when we did not want gifts and it was too big for our flat and there was no plumbing for it and we were at work when the delivery was arranged for. They thought this was all fine, and that it was fine that it would sit in our kitchen for ages and that it would be fine that we would have to pay someone the same as the dishwasher was worth to sort out the plumbing and kitchen for it to go in. 

So am I being an ungrateful cow here?

784,Asshole,"I went to a concert tonight and got back decently late (around midnight), after getting home I sent her a few videos from the concert. It all meant a lot to me, as it‚Äôs been an artist that‚Äôs inspired me a lot and helped me through so much. And sending my gf the videos, I expected her to watch them and hopefully enjoy them. Overall, it wasn‚Äôt more then a few minutes in videos, however she wouldn‚Äôt watch any of them even after I told her they were important to me and I wanted to partially share the expierience with her. We ended up getting in an argument, her saying those videos were meaningless and just felt like a boast because she wasn‚Äôt there (it was me and a few friends, it was planned in April before me and her were really that serious) 

She ended up stating that she didn‚Äôt care how important they were to me cause she knows they are but they don‚Äôt matter as much to her. And I get it if I sent her like a half hour of stuff to watch, but it wouldn‚Äôt have taken up much time, and then she could see what I had gotten to experience for the most part.

She finally conceded after telling me I wasn‚Äôt thinking about how she was feeling, and said she‚Äôd watch them. She came back after saying that she felt awful for watching them because she could never expierience it. So AITA for making her watch them?

Edit: I get it, i‚Äôm the asshole, I realize that now. I was just upset because she was being rude to me in my excitement to show her these videos. But that doesn‚Äôf excuse my overreaction. If anything I think we were both in the wrong, me for not trying to see it from her perspective, and her for some of the rude stuff she had said in response to me asking her to watch them. I‚Äôve apologized to her since, and we‚Äôre going to have a talk about why we both got so upset later. Thank you for all the responses

786,Not the A-hole,"I am 25f, my friend is 24m and his wife is 26f. I've been friends with him since school, her since they got together. They made me godmother to their 4 year old daughter, who I'll call L.


She is profoundly deaf, diagnosed at birth. I am a sign language interpreter and my husband is also deaf. We have been teaching her basic BSL (British Sign Language) and she's picked it up so fast. My friend is also willing to learn, but his wife is less so. She believes we should be teaching L to lip read so she'll 'present as hearing'. I've tried to explain that she'll never present as hearing, as she will never speak clearly because she can't hear her own voice.


L has started going to preschool over the last month. It's clear she struggles, and the preschool don't have a interpreter to help. I asked how she likes school and she said noone talks to her, not even the teachers.


For this reason, I put forward the idea of her going to a deaf school that my husband went to. It's about 40 minutes away by car, transport can be arranged and she would be able to be with others like her and be able to communicate.


Again, my friend was open to it, but his wife wasn't. She thinks the school is too far, and thinks L should be mainstream schooled to get her used to dealing with hearing people. It's caused a big row, and I'm now banned from coming over to see L.


I understand her mum's feelings, but feel like she is making things more difficult then they need to be. L could always do classes or activities outside school to get to know others, but she could struggle in school and delay others.


AITA for suggesting this?

Recently I got an opportunity to record my first EP at a really nice studio thanks to one of my student's friends and now he's begging me to go cause he wants to see the studio.

790,Asshole,"So today I asked my girlfriend if I could take her out to dinner. We had gotten in an argument this morning but pretty much gotten over it, so I figured this would be a nice way to put it behind us and have a nice night. She said she'd love to so when I got home we both got ready to go out. We were just going out to a casual spot, a brewery actually, nothing fancy. When we were deciding, 

I brought up that maybe we should eat on this side of the river so we didn't have to pay the $4 bridge toll. Normally, it's not a big deal but we're both a little broke right now. But the restaurant she wanted to go to was on the other side of the bridge so we decided to go.

We got to the spot but there was a 25 minute wait, so we decided to go across the street for a cocktail. She offered to pay but I told her not to worry about it because she's even more broke than I am, and she could buy us a drink sometime when she actually had some money. We got the call that our table was ready so we headed over there. Up until this point, we were having a great time. Making jokes and laughing and really getting along. So we get to our table, both order drinks and dinner and have conversation. 

When the waiter comes by to take our plates he asks about dessert and we tell him we need to think about it. We never get dessert when we go out, we typically think it's a waste of money and we usually have some sweets at home. I can tell she's interested in dessert, but I tell her we have ice cream and chocolate at home. She makes it clear that she still wants dessert, and I say something like ""Well if you want dessert, that's all you."" And based on her response, I immediately realized that my point wasn't communicated clearly. So I said, ""Just so we're on the same page, I don't want dessert but if you do, you have to pay for it.""

Immediately things turn. She is taken aback. She goes silent. She's pissed. We sit in silence until the bill comes and we pay. We walk out to the car, start driving home, argue about what happened, and then drive home in silence.

I know I should have worded it differently, but I tried two different approaches before just having to be blunt.

793,Asshole,"I read a few other parenting posts on this sub that made me think, so I‚Äôm posting now.

I have two adult children who are close in age (my daughter is three years older than my son). When they were growing up, my son was extremely sensitive. His father always tried to toughen him up and make him act like a man, which I thought was horrible and sexist. I couldn‚Äôt reason with him, so I tried instead to nurture his sensitivity and treat him with a lot more comfort and gentleness than I would otherwise treat any kid.

I homeschooled both kids. My daughter was always very academically gifted, and also three years older, so she was usually a lot further ahead than my son. My son was often jealous of his sister and felt badly about himself because he couldn‚Äôt compete. To try and curb this, I gave him extra praise whenever he did a good job on something, and I downplayed my daughter‚Äôs achievements, telling her not to make a big deal so that her brother didn‚Äôt feel bad.

They are both adults now and I have a great relationship with my son, but my daughter doesn‚Äôt speak to me anymore. One of the reasons she gave me was that she believes I‚Äôve always favored her brother over her. I don‚Äôt see it that way at all - I love them both equally, but I treated them differently because they had different needs growing up - but I thought I‚Äôd see what the Internet thinks.

795,Not the A-hole,"Some Backstory; My Ex(21F) has an extremely religious Mom who has always disapproved of her daughter being sexually active. That being said, she had been very passive about us being sexually active but that was due to the notion that we would be engaged soon, which did not happen. The last few months (3+), we did not have sex whatsoever and can say with 100% certainty that we did not conceive a child. When we broke up a few weeks ago, my Ex had sex with other guys and in some instances had unprotected sex. We have remained friends since and from what I had been told, she had not had her period. In addition, her and her mom began fighting for unrelated reasons a few days ago and have just since made up. These fights were extremely strenuous on their relationship and they are currently still mending from them.

 Fast forward those few weeks later to now  and she took a few pregnancy tests. More than half of these tests came back positive. I have helped her to get through this as it is troubling but when her mom figured out (Through some form of motherly intuition), she instantly asked if I was the cause of this. Not wanting her mother to know that she had been sexually active with others, she said yes. When I heard that she had done this I became very upset and asked her to clear up with her mother that it was in fact not on me and for her to tell her mother the truth. She said she would, and I heard nothing of it for an hour. 

She then came back and thanked me for being there for her, but said she was going to wait to tell her Mother the truth. Basically she was still saying to her that I was who she slept with/possibly conceived the child with and that she needed time to process everything. This made me upset again as I was already trying to move past our relationship but now was having the responsibility of her mother thinking I was the irresponsible 21 year old who got her daughter pregnant. I am also afraid in any sense to be roped into this, as I do not want the 100% false notion of me being the father to affect the life I am trying to build for myself. Due to this, I asked her again to tell her mother, this time saying that if she would not I would have to.

She immediately did so (According to her) and began to send texts such as ""Thanks my mom is crying now"" and ""You pressured me into doing something I was uncomfortable with, now I have all of this extra pressure on my head"". I know it may seem like I have it all figured out in my head as to who is in the right/wrong but I am still very conflicted. On one hand I feel as though I should have fought for my namesake to not be roped into a situation that does not involve me at all.

One mom was dropping off her kid and pulled me aside and said I had to be sure he didn‚Äôt eat any cake or pizza because he has celiac disease. 

I said alright but the laser tag staff were really running things so she should talk to them and identify her son for them because I wasn‚Äôt really going to be involved with serving lunch.

Before we could set up a date we started getting in touch with our families so we could know which date would be better so that most people could come over. My parents are divorced and there is a lot of animosity between them even though they're both married to other people. Most of it comes from my father's side but my mother will start on occasion. 

I called them both to set up everything and my father said that he would do it if my mother did not bring her husband because it was a family thing about me. I told him I would think about it but he would have to follow the same rule and not bring his wife, I don't have a relationship with either of them so I don't mind. He agreed and I moved on to speak to my mom and asked her thoughts about this arrangement (I did not mention it was my father's idea). She said she would feel more comfortable with her husband around but she understood if it couldn't be done. I spoke to my fianc√© and after a while we decided it would be better if they brought their partners so they wouldn't be alone.

809,Not the A-hole,"I was at a minor league hockey game with my daughter and a puck went over the boards and down at the bottom of the stairwell. 

She ran for it (she‚Äôs 10) and another kid also ran for it (a few people did actually) but she got there first. 

The other kid, maybe 6 was a few seconds behind her and started crying. 

I overheard the kid‚Äôs father come up to my daughter and explain they were from out of town and never get to live games so would it be ok if his son kept the puck. 

So, up to this point I would‚Äôve been in favor of her giving it away because we go to a game every month or so. 

My daughter says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve never caught one before‚Äù (true) and this is when I got mad. The guy starts trying to guilt my daughter saying ‚ÄúNow honey, don‚Äôt you think it would be nice to give my son the puck since he‚Äôs so much smaller than you? Look how sad you made him.‚Äù 

I could see my daughter was getting upset so at that point I came over and told them to move along. 

The thing is, I know my daughter wouldn‚Äôt really have cared one way or the other if she caught the puck. She would‚Äôve enjoyed keeping it, sure, but she wouldn‚Äôt have been upset (let alone in tears) over not having gotten there. 

I just thought the actions of the other kid‚Äôs dad were so inappropriate that I had to shut the whole thing down. But was I an asshole to his kid in the process? Because the kid did nothing wrong.",25,106,0.94

One day I went to the gym and there happens to be a guy with a younger girl that looks just like him so I'm assuming it's his daughter. I'm working out on a machine minding my own business. I look up and she's looking at me and smile and I return the smile. The dad happens to see and give me the dirtiest look. Out of respect since I'm a dad i actively keep from looking their way. 

I go to the gym at the same time 2 days later they are here again and before I even do anything the dad notices me and gives me the dirtiest look yet again. I let it go I'm here to work out and I'm trying to be a more positive person. I go to the gym the next day again around the same time and boom! He sees me and I get the dirty look again. Keep in mind I haven't even turned to look at his daughter. 

Fast forward a week (been going to the gym at different times) I go to the gym at the same time dude and his daughter are there I walk in not even remembering them and what do you know I get the dirty look again!

814,No A-holes here,"My father died last month, from a very short battle with cancer. It was honestly traumatic because it was NOT peaceful at all.

To be perfectly blunt, he died on the floor of my bedroom when walking in to talk to me. Fell, died right there in front of me while I was trying to bring him back.

I've been having a LOT of issues with trauma relating to that. It's hurt like nothing else, both the emotional pain and the mental pain from seeing him like that. I can't even sleep in my room right now, I've been sleeping in the living room for the past month.

We got a call his ashes are ready to be picked up (we did not have a service) and I quite frankly, do NOT want to go. 

My family's been retelling his last night over and over and each time, I remember things so much clearer when I think I've successfully numbed myself. However... I also feel massively guilty because even though I do not associate his remains as still being my dad, my mom would be picking them up alone and part of me feels so awful for that. I've been in a grief induced haze for weeks now. 


I've had nightmares, I've had anxiety attacks, all induced by just remembering that final moment of his life. And how much I hate myself because everyone says ""he wanted to see you one last time"" and I hate myself because if I had just stayed in his room with him, he wouldn't have forced himself to get up. I hate myself because he died in my arms and I think I did a shitty job of CPR. I have a LOT of feelings associated with his passing and... I guess I just want to be the vulnerable one. Everyone's been talking about how I've been their strength, how I've been the one to keep everyone grounded and together.

I wanna pick me this one time...

So would I be the asshole?


Edit: Thank you, everyone. It's meant a lot to read through this and feel better about my choices. 

Luckily, no one's forcing me to do anything It is entirely my choice but I haven't made it fully yet. My mom has made it very clear that it is in the end my choice and that she would not be upset with me if I didn't go with her. I just don't think I can mentally handle it without being a wreck. 

No one's blamed me for my dad's death either. That one's entirely on my own messed up emotions and that lovely little anxiety voice hissing in my ear. 

And I will definitely consider therapy, in the near future. I just can't afford it right now and I have no idea if my insurance will even cover it but I will look into it.",25,62,0.91

816,Not the A-hole,"Me (39M) and my wife(37F) have been married for fifteen years and we have two kids, a teen boy and a toddler girl. Our marriage started to fail about four years ago and we decided to have another baby in hopes it would fix things. Our daughter's birth helped things for a while but things fell apart. A few months ago she decided she wants a divorce. I've never cheated, I've never been ""physical"" with her or the kids. We're both two adults who were trying our best but realized it wasn't working.

I come home from work one evening to find her and our toddler packed and waiting. She said they were going to stay with her sister and BIL for the weekend. Over the weekend I was to move out, all my stuff, everything. That's how she said it, ""while I'm gone I expect you to use the time to find yourself somewhere acceptable to live and to be gone."" She said she was sending my ex-BIL over to help me move. Our son was already at his aunt and uncle's, having been picked up after school by ex-SIL. My wife took our daughter and left.

At first, in the hours after she left I looked into apartments, rentals, what I could do for myself and my kiddos, then I started thinking, ""why should I be the one to leave?"" My name is on the deed to the house, just like my wife's. We both own the home, it is our house legally, the both of us, named on the documents. Coupled with the fact that I've been suggesting therapy, church, workshops to mend our marriage, making a conscious effort to make things right, why should I be the one to leave? I don't want to make my wife sound bad because she's truly a lovely, hard-working woman and I still care for her, but she stopped trying a long time ago. 

When my BIL showed up the next day I sent him away, told him I'm not moving out. No one could make me leave, it's my house just as much as her's. If she wants to move out then that's fine, she can find a new home and I will take care of our children in the home and she can share custody with me. But I wasn't going to flip my whole life upside down. I had no warning she was planning this, and I was not leaving.

My wife spent the weekend blowing up my phone, calling me every unfair, unkind, untrue name and accusation. She came home that Monday and moved into one of the spare bedrooms. Our kids are also at home with us. We've been living like this for a while now, her in the spare bedroom, me in the master, parenting the kids but otherwise we're separated. She's even seeing someone now, but I'm certain she wasn't cheating.

She's been trying to alienate our friends against me and has enlisted them in trying to get me to leave. I've remained firm. Despite it all we've not let our children see the worst of it, although our 14 year old son knows we're divorcing.

817,Asshole,"Hi! I never thought I would be posting on this sub, but here I am. Throwaway account so my other posts don't get brigaded.

I have a coworker I'm pretty good friends with, Sara, who is part Native American and part of the Nakoda tribe. She's recognized by her tribe but not very active in the community, her father is Native American but they are now estranged. She grew up in the tribe with their traditions but is not living on the reservation anymore. She doesn't talk about her heritage often with her son.

Our sons are the same age and her son, Sam, comes over  at least every other weekend. He came over last Monday and stayed for my family's Family Home Evening (we are members of the Church of Jesus Christ o Latter-Day Saints) and during that time he asked what the Book of Mormon was. I let him know that it talked about Jesus's time in the Americas and focused on the first 2 Native American tribes the Nephites and the Lamanites.

He thought this was very cool and asked to borrow a copy because he wanted to learn more about his heritage. Last Friday at work Sara was very angry with me, accusing me of lying to her son about what the Book of Mormon contained, said I had no right as trying to pass it off as Native American history, and said Sam wouldn't be allowed at my house any longer. 

Now word has gotten around the office about what's happened and everyone has been avoiding me and someone went as far as openly mocking my religion at work. I don't think I did anything wrong here. Sam asked me about the Book of Mormon and I answered it as truthfully as I could. AITA for answer her sons questions?

edit- I posted to see if I was wrong for presenting the book as I did *when he asked for information*. I did not ask if I was an a**hole for ""pushing my religion down his throat"", which I didn't and I most certainly didn't ask for your opinions on my religion.

I had worked with this person (Jane), over 2 years ago and messaged me a week ago about this.

I explained to her that my workflow is to provide the raw gallery for them to select the photos, and review the final edits. I did not hear any feedback at the time, so I had thought I done a good job. Jane then asked me a question that sounded very loaded, 'take a look at the photos, do you think they were up to your standards?'. I feel that it was sort of inappropriate to ask me given that was sometime ago, and as an artist, my immediate response would of course say it was bad, as I would compare it to what my current skill/style is.

What I told her was that I think the edits I did were on par with the other work I did in that same year. But, Jane kept harping on this exact topic. So, I brought up the fact that I asked her at the minimum two times what she thought of the product, with no responses, other than it looks 'good'. Then I added, if you truly feel that I did not meet your expectations, I will refund you. She did not want that, stating 'I just want you to know how I feel about this matter.'.

She had decided to keep the baby name a secret because didn‚Äôt want anyone trying to change her mind like we all did with her first baby. 

Her first baby name was pretty unique but not extremely. She named her first born (a boy) Sailor and while I didn‚Äôt love it at first it grew on me. Of course I love my nephew though and that‚Äôs probably why. 

So honestly we were all fully prepaid for it to be another *unique* name but I was not expecting this name at all. 

She named her daughter Lock... 

When she told me I was honestly pretty shocked but said nothing. My plan was to say absolutely nothing UNTIL she asked me what I thought. Idk if my parents had lied or actually liked it but they told her they loved the name. When she asked me again I told her the truth... I told her I didn‚Äôt like it or understand it. This made her pretty upset. Of course she‚Äôs very emotional right now and started to cry immediately. She asked me why I would say that and I just responded with ‚Äúyou asked for my opinion!‚Äù Which only upset her more and I had to leave. 

I left and my father texted me later telling me I better apologize and tell her I love the fucking name. I said I would apologize but I wasn‚Äôt gonna lie! She had ASKED my opinion!

AITA for giving my opinion once it was asked?

EDIT: I could be spelling this wrong! It‚Äôs pronounced lock but after looking on websites I‚Äôve gotten other spellings. Her husband is Scottish so it seems the name is coming from there and they have different spellings.

So recently my 16yo brother in law went through some hard times with his father. (Alcoholic and verbally abusive.) My wife and I (25MF) decided to take him into our home so he can focus on school and get away from the awful homelife that he had. Things started off well but quickly began to deteriorate throughout the 2018-2019 school year. He made a new friend who is currently going through similar issues and my wife is allowing him to stay as long as they enforce each other to go to school. Unfortunately, things have been pretty rough. Neither will help with chores and they hardly go to school. (School year just started and they've missed 10/18 days). They pretty much just spend everyday smoking pot and playing video games. Today my wife got a call from a social worker who warned us about possible truancy charges if this continues. At this point, I definitely don't want to be held responsible for his friend and am contemplating the same for my brother-in-law.

Although I attend all weekly sessions, role-play, and take time writing down my stats, he is clearly more (mentally and financially) invested in the game than me. He bought himself books, figurines, and maps, listens to D&D podcasts, reads a bunch of D&D subs, and brings that topic into our conversations (Ex. asks me what class each of our friends would be in real life, sends me D&D memes, etc.). He even bought me a figurine and a starter dice set (7 dice for $5).  

Last week, he gifted me a beautiful set of pure rose quartz dice, which costed $80 (7 dice for $80). I was in shock. I thanked him for the gift, but immediately asked him to return them. He was visibly upset and told me he wanted me to have the prettiest dice in the campaign. I explained that I enjoyed D&D because I could use my imagination and spend time with our friends, and not so I could have the ‚Äúbest‚Äù apparatus to play with.

I've put in the time and effort to find people whose tweets I enjoy, which can be surprisingly hard to do sometimes. 

Despite enjoying my trash meme account, I recently decided to make a professional, public twitter account with my real name and identifying information to support the social media campaign I'm running at work.

So, he prefers to use my account. It's pretty annoying because he'll retweet things I don't necessarily agree with and uses my phone all the time, but it typically doesn't matter because the retweets go onto my trash account. Still, this is frustrating, and we'll get in arguments about me un-retweeting things he's retweeted onto my account.

Recently, he accidentally retweeted some things I didn't agree with onto my professional account, and I'm about ready to pull the plug on this. They weren't necessarily horrible things, just a bit more extreme views than I want on that account.

When our parents shared the bathroom too my sister cleaned up after herself, but since it's only us sharing it she stopped. Hair all over the shower, wet towels and dirty clothes on the floor, shit stains in the toilet, whenever she trims her bangs the sink is covered with hair she just leaves there, and more. I have to clean the bathroom before I can shower in the morning. The grossest thing is when she leaves underwear with used pads on the floor. 

I've tried everything I can think of. Talking to our parents, talking to her, making a cleaning schedule, cleaning up after her, or not cleaning up and just letting her live in that filth. Nothing has worked, I've been stuck cleaning up after her for a year (at least if I want a clean bathroom myself). 

I warned her once that if she didn't clean up her used pads on the bathroom floor I'd put them somewhere everyone could see. Well it happened again, so I hung her underwear (with the pad) on the door handle of the bathroom on a day my sister's boyfriend was coming over. I don't know what happened, but my sister is extremely pissed. My parents aren't happy either and told me to just talk to them next time. (I did, very often. Never worked.)

841,Asshole,"My son is 18 (though 17 at the time) and this is the first time he's ever given me the silent treatment so I'm wondering if I'm wrong here. He's been dating this girl since they were 14, known her for longer and I know her grandparents. His dad's mother is also very close to the girl's grandmother so their families are also close. This past summer, his girlfriend and her family asked if he wanted to go on a trip with them in July/August. They planned to fly to Ireland to a small family reunion for the last two weeks of July, come back to our state for a day, then fly to Mexico for a bigger one for the first two weeks of August. His grandparents and half sister planned on going as well and when he asked me to go, I said no. 

He looked really disappointed. Then about a week or two later (this was in June) he asked, well more liked begged me, to let him go and brought up how he'd have family there too and it's a good opportunity to see the world. I said no again and he honestly looked like he wanted to cry at this point and asked again and I told him the answer is no, I'm not changing my mind. 

He asked me one more time and got another no and I gave him the same reason I told him before, I didn't and still don't feel comfortable with him flying out of the Country for such a long time and without me. It's not that I don't trust those going on the trip, I just don't like the idea of him leaving the country without me.

He tried to argue that he was going to be 18 soon and that I should trust him more but I wasn't budging and he left it only and was very upset afterwards. He's been very distant toward me since and for most of the time they were gone he gave me the silent treatment. Even now, he still rarely talks to me and I just don't get it. He's never done this before when told no, hell he usually drops things after a single no but this time was different and now I'm wondering if I should've just let him go on the trip especially since the second trip overlapped with his birthday. I feel bad but at the same time I feel like my concerns were justified. I know how my son gets, he gets confused easily and is a little forgetful and impressionable sometimes. I don't want him getting lost in a strange country because he walked off with a stranger or something.

Was I an asshole for not letting him go?

Edit/Update: Those of you saying he'll cut me out and never want me to see him again, really need to calm down some. Me telling him that he can't go out of the country once isn't the same as locking him in a tower for 18 years in a diaper because 'I don't want him to grow up', I normally push him to go out and try new things but this time I went with my gut and it was wrong.

I do plan on sitting down with him after dinner tonight and apologizing but I also want to explain more to him as to why I didn't initially let him go. I love this boy with all my heart and I'll try to work harder on trusting him more to not do the stupid things he's done in the past.

Update 2: It's okay here now. We talked about it and we both see each other's sides a lot better than we did before. I apologized throughly to him for making him miss his trip and he forgave me, I even showed him the post. I'm going to work on not worrying so much.",223,160,0.73

843,Asshole,"Hello, so I‚Äôm a 40 year old mother to two children, one is an 18 year old girl who is wonderful in every way. The other is my 16 year old son who is lazy, addicted to video games, and anti-social. 


He had also been fired from work. He was in the employee room chatting with coworkers, when one of them said ‚ÄúI have to go now, my parents are here to pick me up‚Äù. My son responded ‚Äúthat‚Äôs impossible, your parents are dead‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why he thought that was funny, but that‚Äôs not how I raised him. It turns out that the girls parents were actually dead (no, my son was not aware).


I had confiscated all electronics from him because he was gaming too much (like until 2am on school nights and before his 6am work shifts). So I told him to write a new resume to start finding a new job. I allowed him to use my personal laptop to write his resume. I told him he had an hour, and if he didn‚Äôt finish it in that hour that he would have to use the public library.

He kept dragging it on by asking for help and saying he didn‚Äôt know where to start or what to put on it. I told him that was his problem and to use google.

After the hour he had maybe 1/4 of his resume finished. So I told him to go to the library and finish it there. He flat out refused saying ‚Äúthere are 5 computers in this house, there is no reason for me to have to go to a library when I can do it here.‚Äù

So I told him he has two options:

1.	Go to the library and finish his resume.
2.	Leave my house and find somewhere else to stay.


Unfortunately he decided to leave and claims I kicked him out.

So AITA here?

846,Not the A-hole,"So my daughter (13) does Irish dance, she's been practicing her little heart out this year trying to get down a new traditional set dance, practicing almost every day at home , and always asking for pointers in class. Right now she knows 2 traidtional sets,she is also the only one in her class that has mastered the newest set dance. Her dance instructor, the one who owns the school, has praised her multiple times on her ability to dance this set dance. So here's the problem, there's a dance competition coming up, she's so excited that her dance instructor told her she could dance the new set, this week her dance instructor told all the girls they are to do the original dance set because not everyone knows the new set. I asked her teacher via email weather that included my daughter because she has put so much effort into it and was previously told she could do it, I received no response. It pisses me off that my daughter has put in the effort , way more than the others girls (parents have told me they never practice) and now she's being penalized out of ""fairness"". I hate that shit excuse.  
So would I be an asshole if I told my daughter to go for it the new set ?

Edit: I feel like I should clarify,  I have not told my child that she should or shouldn't dance the new set. My daughter asked me to email her instructor and ask if she could. I told my daughter I would and we would go from there.

847,Asshole,"My sister Ellie (22) was diagnosed with MS three years ago. Shortly after diagnosis she was wheel chair bound and had little control of her body. In the last 2 years, she has made great strides. She is able to walk with a walking stick and has gotten her license back. She regularly has to see specialist doctors for meds and scans. She is on SSI. 

The problem: My husband and I work opposite shifts, I work two jobs. We have two children, 6F&2M. After a hurricane, our area lost most of its childcare. For six months my kids stayed with my parents/siblings in OH, we are in FL, so that we could do repairs and try to find care. After some issues with family, they came home but we did not have child care. 

We decided to move Ellie down to FL to provide childcare until we can find a reliable sitter or center. This was two months ago. We agreed to pay her $150 a week, her housing (her own room, my kids now share), food, toiletries are all included. When we agreed to move her here, it was discussed that she will need to get to her specialist appts. We agreed that we would make sure she got there. This was made thinking she would be seeing a doctor 2 hrs away (in a city I travel to for appts). She got doctors in a city 6 hrs away. Ellie is using the money she receives from us to pay rent on a home in OH that my parents ""own"" (they live in AL now). Without us paying her, they would not be able to maintain the home in OH, where my Gma, bro/sis lives. A week before she moved, I found a sitter who would do it for $30 a day, up to 12 hrs. We still had Ellie come.

3 weeks ago my sister took a bus to the doctors. She missed one and had to buy a 2nd ticket and she wanted us to pay for the tickets. I said that is not the agreement. When mentioning her next appt, I told her it 100% could not be on the 7th, my DH and I must go to an appt ourselves. 

Yesterday she told me the appt is for the 7th. I flipped. I told her that was unacceptable. She pulled the pity card and tried to act remorseful. I told her we absolutely can‚Äôt take her. She wanted us to take her today and pick her up at the end of next week. I told her she can‚Äôt tell us the day before an appointment and expect us to cater to her schedule. This is the last straw after many. When she left last, she was gone 4 days and only watched my son for 1 day. I am paying the sitter 3 days, afterschool for my 6 yo (because Ellie can‚Äôt go pick her up down the street) and her. She was upset that she only got $100. She doesn't clean the house as agreed, she is rude to my children (she has been a bitch her whole life and being sick doesn't excuse her from it), she doesn't watch them like she is supposed to. I feel I am bending over backwards to help her out and she couldn't be less grateful. I am sick of it and I want to fire her and be done with it.

848,Everyone Sucks,"A couple of days ago it was 93 degrees outside. For the fourth day in a row, while I was at work, my husband turned the air conditioning completely off. When I got home, it was close to 80 degrees inside. I've asked him several times not to shut the air conditioning completely off, we have a digital thermostat that allows you to set a temperature range. 

But as soon as I leave, he turns it off and I come home to an incredibly hot house that takes sometimes hours to get down to a comfortable temperature for me. My husband is currently unemployed, so he is home during this time and says that it's too cold in the house and so turns the air conditioner off.

I am so tired of fighting over this, he won't set a schedule for the thermostat or just turn it up a few degrees, he ""yes""es me to death and then just does the same thing over and over again when I am gone. I have asked him several times to stop doing that, I get hot very easily and I hate to sweat in my own house. Meanwhile he goes outside when it's snowing all the time without a winter coat. It seems to me that he can handle the cold a lot better than I can handle the heat. I just like to keep the thermostat between 71-74, I don't think that's freezing cold.

So yesterday I locked him out of the thermostat so he can't change it anymore via the app/Alexa/Google Home. He doesn't seem to have noticed yet since the temperature outside has gotten to the 60s and the AC hasn't needed to come on. AITA?",89,205,0.93

850,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I have been planning our wedding for the better part of a year now and we get married in 3 weeks. We had a limited budget so we picked a small inn in the mountains with a wedding package within our budget that limits our guest list to 18 people. She and I both aren't crazy about kids and with the limited guest capacity we have asked her sister, her brother, and my brother to please leave their children with someone at home so that we may accommodate our closest relatives but also have a child free, low(er) stress wedding weekend. 

I spoke to my brother a year ago when we started planning and he said 'no worries.' When it came time to book rooms, my mother booked an on site cottage so that the children could stay there since the inn doesn't allow children under 10 on the premises (didn't know that when we booked the place for the ceremony.) I caught wind of it and went to my brother who again said no worries, kids will stay home. A few months back I checked in with him again, he still tells me they're staying at home. A couple weeks ago my grandmother starts taking about how excited she is about the wedding and to have niece and nephew there with us. I once again go to my brother who confirms the kids are staying with his sister in law and her wife. 

This past weekend we had a house warming party and my mom mentioned the kids being there again. At this point I'm over it. I called her today and put it as plainly as I could that we have been asking for a year that no one bring children to our wedding. She says she'll call my brother and ""run interference"" but to just let it go, they'll do what they want. I say again that it's not what they want, it's our wedding weekend and we've been planning it a certain way, for certain reasons. Mom says that brother and wife may just not come (brother is my best man btw.)

Mom is paying part of the wedding expenses but we have the money and originally planned to pay the whole thing ourselves. To some people that will matter in their judgement of the situation.

Are we justified in being pissed off or should we suck it up and deal?

Edit for info: The inn is a 90 minute drive from home for my family. Her family is coming from Florida, Virginia, Mississippi, and further away in our home state. 

A bride/groom-zilla comment was made and it occurred to me that I left out my future MIL will 100% make a scene if my brother brings his kids while her people left theirs at home for 2 nights. Yes we want things our way but we also don't want to deal with anyone's shit.

Edit for clarity: A lot of people are calling me out for not letting the kids stay off site. The cottage is literally 200 ft from the inn. 

It was also suggested that I add the concern of the kids being snuck into the service and reception. If they are there, it will happen. I know my grandmother and she wouldn't hesitate.",210,608,0.96

853,Not the A-hole,"So my birthday was recently. Typically, I like to enjoy the day with my fiance, not monitor social media or tech, and just veg out as most of my celebrations happen whenever the weekend before was. In doing so, I missed a call from one of my best friends who lives an hour south. 

Precondition here is that, while I love the guy, sometimes it feels like he wants to compete with my fiance for that ""best friend"" status. It's quite overbearing.

On the day after my birthday, I received a text ""See you soon!"". I had no idea what this was about. When listening to the missed call, he mentioned he was just cruising up for a visit as a birthday present.

Unfortunately, my fiance and I had just moved into a new place and used a lot of expenses, so we were in no place to host guests. Typically, he eats off us, sleeps late, and kind of just does himself, and we weren't prepared for this. I desperately tried to call him to let him know, but he had turned off his device.

Eventually, I was able to get hold of him through Facebook, and he told me he wouldn't be coming anymore.

Since then, he has blocked me from all forms of contact and I can't get hold of him at all.

I do love the guy, and typically there's no greater friend, there was just no way my fiance and I could swing this visit with work, life, and money.

855,Asshole,"So me and my GF recently moved together, i work a couple of cities over so i have to wake up before 06:45am in the morning and are usually home around 5-7pm in the evening. She doesnt work full time, and has somewhat irregular working hours, but got days where she doesnt work or doesnt start before 01pm.

So yesterday my gf started work at 01pm and i came home around 7pm to no dishes being done, food from yesterday cold on the stove, no clothes wash on etc. So i got annoyed at her and snapped at her when she came home, telling her how i was annoyed that there was basically no housework done even though she had hours from when i left til she was going to work, to be doing atleast some.

For the record, ive told her earlier that i dont mind doing housework in the weekends or when she isnt able to (starting early, working late shifts back to back etc), but said when i get home after a 2 hour commute and a full work day, and she have spent hours at home or doesnt have work that day that i expect some housework done.

She got upset and said that she needs the extra 3 hours from when i leave til she is leaving for work to sleep, which i said to me is a bullshit reason to not do some chores.

Am i the asshole for expecting housework done after coming home from a full work day?

Tldr: GF not doing housework when she got way more time at home then i do, and i getting annoyed there is no housework done when i get back home, which leade me to snapping at her.

Edit#1: i forgot to mention that we have discussed the housework topic before we moved together which we both agreed that as long as i vacuum clean, keep the outside spaces clean and shoveling snow in winter that she would do mostof the dishes, washing clothes and dusting.

Last Friday our class was emptier then usual. Maybe 50/100 people there. A girl walked in late at around 2:45 I believe and sat right next to me despite me not knowing her and there being tons of open seats. Okay whatever. I‚Äôve seen this girl walk in late at every class so far albeit always a different late time so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there. 

At the end of the class she asked me to see then notes of what she missed before she arrived. I said sorry gotta run as I don‚Äôt know this girl and like I said the class is graded on a curve so unfortunately I feel a lot of protection over my own grade.  A friend I would help but not a stranger. 

This Friday the same thing happened - she arrived over an hour late and sat next to me as the seat was open. At the end of class again she asked me for my notes and I said the same thing - I had to go.

BIL uses his grandma‚Äôs house in our hometown (she‚Äôs in assisted living) and pays no rent for it either. In fact his only bills as far as I know are car insurance, phone bill, and his student loans.

I used to have no problem with this arrangement. We used to live in a much bigger 2-bedroom with a roommate, so I wasn‚Äôt really sacrificing my privacy in any way by letting him stay there. We don‚Äôt really need the help with bills. I also genuinely enjoy hanging out with him. 

The problem is, it‚Äôs stopped being the weekends. BIL comes in on thursday evening and drives home on tuesday night, meaning I get about a day and a half where I can just relax in my home without worrying about when my brother is coming in. BIL also sleeps til 2 or 3 pm every single day. SO works nights so he‚Äôs typically sleeping until then too, and when he‚Äôs asleep I typically go into the living room and relax and watch TV or read. I can‚Äôt do this anymore because I feel weird sitting in the living room while he‚Äôs sleeping.

My husband agrees he should probably be paying rent but is unwilling to start a potential argument with his brother, who he‚Äôs very close to. His argument is that we don‚Äôt need the money, and its not really that big of a deal for me to only be able to find privacy inside my bedroom, and if it‚Äôs such a big deal I should talk to BIL myself.

861,Not the A-hole,"When my roommate moved in, he brought up the idea of carpooling to work and out to bars. I thought it was a good idea and mentioned how much money he'd be saving. When I said, ""we"", he just kind of laughed it off.

Since then, I have driven all the time with one exception. When I found out I was selected for promotion, he insisted we go out and I could pick the place. I was just planning a chill night in as it was Tuesday, but he talked me down. When we got to the parking lot, he said, because I chose the place, I should drive, which sounded fair. Next week, we go to a place of his choosing, and I end up driving because he ""left his keys."" I brought up the trend a week later saying it was causing me not to want to go out with him. He said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. I agreed but stated that because I've already given him numerous rides (we went out to lunch numerous times at work where always was the one driving), that we should do 50/50 for October. He agrees.

Yesterday, I stopped avoiding him and we were leaving around the same time and he recommends a carpool. I say yes, again expecting him to drive but I again end up driving. Last night, we were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and he suggests a carpool again. I put my foot down and tell him, only if he's driving. He insists on me driving because he doesn't know the place but I say neither do I. He says my car will blend in more and nobody will mess with as opposed to his truck. After no budging on my side, he suggests an Uber, which I decline. I say I'm just driving and he says he'll tag along. I tell him firmly, that if I'm driving, he will not be in my car. He says he'll but me a beer, but I'm firm on the principle of the matter. Plus it's literally one dollar beer night. I stop talking to him and he assumes that means it's settle an tried to tag along an hour later as I'm leaving.

I stick to my guns, and end up leaving without but we have an argument about how with the beer I'd come up even on gas and if I'm going anyway, I should take him. I'm bring up all the other times I've given him rides and him if he sees my side and my point. He blatantly denies seeing my point I go to leave.

Background:   
 
- I work in a center for kids with different disabilities
 
- one of our verbal younger kids has a goal of identifying ‚Äútalking thoughts‚Äù versus ‚Äúthinking thoughts‚Äù. Which basically means identifying what is an isn‚Äôt appropriate to say.  
 
- it was scrubs get 20% off food night at the bar/grill
 
 
Okay so to the story:  
 
I took an Uber to a bar last night. The dude was somewhere between his high twenties and low thirties. When I first got in he turned around in his seat and did a creepily slow double take. Which set the tone for our ride
 
Throughout the maybe 15 minute ride he asked me a lot of personal/weird questions. Do I have a boyfriend? Do I live around here? Do I go to school around here? What do I do for work? Where do I work?
 
I dodged most of the questions politely but answered the work question honestly (not telling him specifically where I work - SSDGM and all that).   
 
He said something like; 
 
>  ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre wearing that nurse costume? I thought it was for halloween. You wear it to work everyday? Those lucky kids, and I‚Äôm even luckier!‚Äù  
 
I cringed, he looked proud of himself waiting for a response. So I said; 
 
> ‚ÄúYea, they‚Äôre pretty lucky to learn so much from me! I‚Äôll go through one of their goals with you. Was what you said a thinking thought or a talking thought?‚Äù  
 
He got flustered and asked what I meant. 
 
 > ‚ÄúWell since you clearly don‚Äôt know when to keep thoughts in your head and when to say them I was hoping to teach you. Was what you said a thinking thought or a talking thought?‚Äù  
 
He looked flustered then said I was rude. I told him to drop me off where I was. He protested and I demanded to be dropped off. He did and that was that.

863,Not the A-hole,"I adopted my first dog a couple of months ago. Growing up, my family had a firm ""no pets on the furniture"" rule, so that's what's natural to me. My dog is a greyhound with very little natural padding, so she's allowed on the couches (and I have plenty of bedding/blankets for her on the floor). The one thing I'm sticking to is that she's not allowed in my bed. She doesn't smell very much at all, but in my personal view allowing here there wouldn't be hygienic. Her foster family let her sleep in the bed with them, so the first couple of nights she wanted to come in my room, but I closed the door and she got the message pretty quickly. She's not the clingiest of dogs anyway, so she didn't seem that upset about it.

What has surprised me is that EVERYONE I know who somehow finds out about this thinks I'm the biggest asshole in the world for not letting my dog sleep in my bed. My friends with dogs and the people I've met through the greyhound rescue all let their dogs sleep in their beds apparently, and they acted like I leave her chained up in my yard when they found out. A guy I'd been seeing for a few weeks (who has a dog he lets sleep in his bed, as well) actually questioned my love for my dog and said he didn't get why I'd even gotten a dog in the first place if I wouldn't let her snuggle with me. At first I could just assure myself that we have different equally valid views about dog care, but I can't help but wonder whether I'm the one in the wrong here.

The other day, a room meeting was called by our third roommate, I‚Äôll refer to her as G, this isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôve ever had to do before. I figured it was about keeping the room clean or not drinking or something like that but turns out G has a big problem with masturbation due to her religious upbringing. She practically insinuated that she doesn‚Äôt want us asking for the room for a little bit to do it because she‚Äôs uncomfortable with knowing we‚Äôre sinning in our room. Me being a possible asshole comes in now because we agreed we could ask for the room as long as we don‚Äôt disclose the reason, and since I plan on doing it just as much as I was before I‚Äôve been asking G for it more frequently when she‚Äôs already out. like I plan on asking every week or twice a week until she‚Äôs so fed up over my sins that she moves out. AITA? 
TLDR: religious roommate doesn‚Äôt want me touching myself at any point in the room, How bout I do anyway and make her uncomfortable.

EDIT: hey guys, thanks for all the advice. 
A few points: 
- I would never ask either to leave the room while they‚Äôre already there 
- my schedule is packed so the only time I‚Äôm in the dorm is when one or both of them is already out of class, I can‚Äôt just be there when they‚Äôre gone.
- I figured asking for the room would be more considerate than just having them unlock the door to find me scrambling to stop
- the only reason I‚Äôd want her to move is because she deserves to be in a space where no one is doing it, because it makes her uncomfortable, but I‚Äôm not going to stop that‚Äôs just unfair.",777,5632,0.91
865,No A-holes here,"Both early 30's. She has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship (lived together 2 years). Wedding booked in with deposit for 2021. Just started her 3rd year of Uni.

Situation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc.

She has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. 

Over this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me ""I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job."" and ""I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker"".

She did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.

She has also started saying that she is considering doing her Masters. Then her PGCE (teaching qualification).

I am starting to get big ""I don't want to work"" vibes in general, which will definitely impact our future plans. Wedding, having a kid , buying a house. I am not down for having a child out of wed-lock and as I say we are both in our 30's, so it's not like we have an indefinite amount of time to do that.

Now, I've never thrown my income in her face and dismiss the disparity if she raises it, but I used to have ~¬£1500 disposable income before we moved in together, I now have none. I'm now getting concerned that she is more interested in extending the length of time that she doesn't have to work, rather than building our life together that we have had planned.

Whenever we talk about it (it keeps coming back up), I say the same. Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans. Especially if she is planning on doing her masters and putting off getting into work by another year, which definitely would put a spanner in our plans and we would have to reconsider buying a house and having a child. If she needs more time, that she should try cutting down on things like reading facebook or watching TV alone in the middle of the day rather than dropping work. It's only 10 more months.

869,Asshole,"Obligatory throwaway account for obvious reasons. And sorry, mobile so wonky formatting. 

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I‚Äôm not an asshole, and they‚Äôre family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It‚Äôs not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I‚Äôd get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I‚Äôd spent doing the small things they‚Äôd asked. No mention of the week that I‚Äôd put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they‚Äôve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can‚Äôt help feeling upset over being re-neged on.

When I tried to pay, the cashier said ""You don't have to worry about it. The car in front of you took care of your order."" I said, ""Really? Wow...wait, does that mean I have to pay it forward??"" She kind of grinned and went to get my sundaes. I felt like the answer was ""Yup.""

I thought about it and I asked how much the order was for the car behind me. She said about $13.00. I said, ""No. That's not fair. I come in for something small and now I'm supposed to pay extra?"" I didn't want to get on her though, b/c it isn't her fault I had questions and she didn't ask to be in this position.

I felt the other workers kind of looking at me. I asked, ""How long has it been going?"" and she didn't know. So, I said, ""Naw...I can't do it. I didn't ask for them to take care of me and I shouldn't have to pay extra for it. Thank you and if you see those people again, thank them for me, but I can't do it."" So, I took my sundaes and took them to my kids who think I'm the best Daddy in the world.

Inside though, I'm asking myself if I did the right thing. I had the money....I just don't like being peer pressured into paying extra for something b/c some idiot saw it on Reddit.

My English is decent, not perfect yet, but I've been constantly using it for 6 months now and I can notice improvement.

However when I talk in English for the whole day, study in English, take notes in it as well, I feel burned out at the end of the day.

With that said, my family pushes me to speak English with them. My mom wants to improve because of her new job, although her English is already good in my opinion. My dad barely speaks anything but broken sentences but he would like to learn.

I work in a fairly casual office, but I mostly keep to myself. When I started, a bunch of guys at the office were rude to me, there's mostly guys in the industry and I am not. but 3 women at the office were really kind to me. Two of them were Jen, in sales, and Anna, in PR. They don't really know each other.

Over time, I heard the rumors Jen was sleeping with Matt, one of the top managers there. Then that was confirmed because I was hanging out with Jen and drinking after work and she told me.

Then, I was hanging out with Anna one time and she said she thought Matt was hot, and I was like 'girl, I wouldn't"" and she laughed and said ""I might of already"" 

Anyway, it didn't seem like either of them knew he was sleeping around, which was kind of gross.. i prefer honesty. I also got the impression both of them had a crush and wanted more.

So I told Jen, I knew Matt was sleeping with someone else at the company, and if she was cool with it, all good. But I wanted to tell her just in case she wasn't. And oh boy she wasn't. She said he told her he hadn't been with anyone else in a long time, was a lonely soul, wanted to build towards something more (but keep it quiet because of work). I didn't tell her who, because I wanted to respect Anna's privacy as much as I could while still being honest with Jen.

Soon after, I told Anna something similar. I told her, it's all cool if you're cool with it, but you should know Matt is sleeping with someone else at the company. And she wasn't as upset as Jen, but she felt grossed out. She wanted to know who, and I told her ""Just like you probably don't want it getting out, I think he or she feels the same way. So I'd rather not say"" and she respected that.

But the fact that I said ""he or she"" made Anna suspect it's a man, and she's been spreading gossip that Matt's gay, which is awkward. I know she's hurt but I'm kind of embarrassed on her behalf. 

Matt has been seeming really antsy and stressed recently, and I suspect it's related. It sucks because he's taking his stress out on everyone.

So my girlfriend (F24) and I (M25) have recently moved in together and she uses a reusable period cup for when her time of the month comes. Today I saw it sitting on the stove in one of the pots that we both (+ other flatmate) use for cooking, simmering away to sterilise it before use. I'm not repulsed by her using a cup or anything, but I do think it's kinda gross that she uses a cooking pot for her cup. She says she washes it before she puts it in there, but I definitely saw some... red marks.

When I tried to ask politely if she would consider buying a new pot to sterilise her cup, she got mad at me saying that it's unnecessary because it's being sterilised and this way it's way better for the environment.

I've (26f) known H. (27m) since our uni days. He comes from a religious family but he's gay. He told me about 2 years after the start of our friendship.

Once that he visited home, he showed his family photos from our summer trip together. They instantly asked if I'm his girlfriend because he doesn't usually have female friends.

So H. posed the question to me if I'm okay with saying that I am his gf, just for the sake of his parents. I would never meet them since they live in Kosovo and we're in France.

I agreed because I didn't care a lot in that moment. The situation wasn't affecting me personally.

Honestly I even forgot about that until last month. H. told me that his family's coming to France after a long time to visit. They want to meet his girlfriend, me.

That was a little shocking. I wasn't prepared to play this role, I never said I would. Also because H. didn't mention anything for years, I thought maybe he already told his parents that we broke up.

I told him, no I won't pretend to be your girlfriend; especially since I'm seeing a guy I like and this even seems like cheating when you think about it.

He was more upset than I thought he'd be. He said shortly ""this is nothing to you, it's just one weekend, but your support means the world to me"".

878,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account because I know my brother knows my main. 

My older brother and his wife have 3 kids ages 9, 7 and 5. SiL left work after the second child to become a stay at home mother. At that point it wasn't really an issue in terms of their income, as my brother was making a rather impressive salary, especially for his age. Everything was hunky dory, and it was working for them. Great. 

Two years ago, the company my brother worked for went into liquidation and closed down, meaning he lost his job. He found another job in his field fairly quickly, but it's a lower ranking job and pays less than half his original salary. This posed a problem for them; he could still afford to cover the basics while his wife continued to be a SAHM, but there was no longer any disposable income and the kids and SiL had gotten used to living comfortably. SiL complained that my brother wasn't providing for them as well any more and eventually he took two additional part time jobs to supplement the household income. 

Working so much has taken a physical and mental toll on my brother. He's lost, by my estimation, about 30some lbs in those two years and he was a healthy weight to begin with. He also doesn't sleep much and seems perpetually exhausted. He's also begun suffering from migraines since he started working so much. Honestly, he just looks and seems sick as a dog, but SiL refuses to go back to work.  Note; kids are in school full time now, and by her own admission she just doesn't feel like working ever again. 

So to my potential assholery: we were all at a bit of a gathering at my parent's house recently and a few beverages were had. At one point we were watching a film and my brother fell asleep. My SiL woke him up and began berating him about being rude and lazy. Bro just kinda sheepishly sat and took it. I, three white wines in, got brave and said ""if his wife wasn't so lazy maybe he wouldn't fall asleep so much"". She asked what I meant and I said ""You stay at home and do nothing while the kids are at school and he works three jobs to keep you in designer handbags. Bit selfish, don't you think?"" She took the huff and left, brother went with her. She's furious at me for calling her out, but I think I was justified. AITA?

Edit: adding this on bc I was getting close to character limit and couldn't these things in the post:
- if ages matter, my brother is 28, SiL is 32 and I'm 19.
- SiL initially said she was gonna go back to work when the kids went to school and back peddled when that happened.
- To be clear when I say she was used to living comfortably I mean she was used to having an entirely designer wardrobe for her and all three children and was unwilling to give that up.",669,3458,0.96
879,Not the A-hole,"Jasmine and I have been together for just over a year now, and over time one of her male friends, Mike, has gotten a lot clingier. He's always (in my opinion) had a crush on Jasmine, but the amount of surprise gifts he's given her has really ramped up over time. It used to be he'd buy her lunch or bring chocolates into the workplace to surprise her with, which to be honest already made me uncomfortable, but now it's progressed to him taking her out for shopping and not letting her pay for herself, giving her surprise gift cards, and talking about buying her a new computer so she can play better games with him online. A couple of times when we've been out together with friends people have commented on Mike being such a devoted boyfriend, which is extremely awkward given I'm standing right there. It may be petty but it's probably worth mentioning Jasmine and I are both lesbians, which makes it feel even worse for me because pretty much nobody ever will peg us as a couple if we're out with Mike, even if we're both holding hands. It makes me feel like our relationship isn't important or meaningful to her at all.

The worst part is that it's not just Mike who does this stuff. Jasmine has had multiple games bought for her from guys she's never even met in person, and she has NEVER paid for her own lunch while out with a guy. I thought after we were more out as a couple it'd die down, but if anything it's just gotten worse.

Recently after Jasmine came back with a few bags after a surprise shopping trip Mike arranged, I broke down and told her how shitty this entire thing made me feel and asked her why she felt the need to have men do this. She was extremely offended and told me there was nothing wrong with accepting gifts, and that I knew Mike was like this before she and I even started dating (which is true), and it's unfair to take issue now. I'm not looking for advice, but I wonder if I am being an insecure ass for getting mad at her when I already knew how Mike was with her before we were a thing.

883,Not the A-hole,"  

My cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) I became good friends with him and continue to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.

My cousin and I are very different despite being close as kids. We didn't hang out much but I harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to me. I was upset but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. ""People make mistakes"" I thought.

Fast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with my grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)

Cousin takes grandparents to lawyer‚Äôs office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because I don't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:

""That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.""

Giving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.

She gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving my grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for my grandparents to get a ride home.

Cousin is also best friends with my wife. They would hang out all the time and my wife really enjoys spending time with her little one. For me though, it was the last straw. My grandparents are the sweetest old folks you'd ever meet and she tried to take advantage of them before making a scene like that. I explained to my wife that I understand they are friends but I FORBID cousin to step foot in MY house. 

Since that day I have had no interest in seeing cousin. Wife still sees her now and again but less than before because she knows I've disowned cousin. I understand cousin is still family and was hopefully doing what she did for her child in the end but I don't think that is enough for me to stomach associating with her after that last incident.

He does and says a lot of stuff that bugs me. I am very sensitive to sound, my entire equilibrium can be thrown off by mouth noises. He makes weird noises in voice chat frequently. I tell him to stop, he largely stops, but his mic picks up the saliva in his mouth when he talks. Drives me crazy every time he talks. I know this isnt fair and try to move on.

He constantly talks to fill the silence, which annoys me, I try to get him to stop. Limited success. He mumbles a lot at the end of sentences when his point is already made. I try to get him to stop, limited success.

His Sat char dies, he makes a new 1, more agreeable, but his out of character attitude declines. He‚Äôs often very frustrated. I start to get complaints but I try to work w/ him. Limited success.

When I was three my mom married a (black) man who later became someone who I called dad. Consequently all of my half-siblings are black, and on the darker side of complexion with type 4C hair. 

I, however, am extremely light skinned to the point that I just look white. I have naturally straight hair and my eyes are dark green. I basically have the same complexion as Rashida Jones from Parks & Rec. Basically, I just look like an olive-toned white person. People think I'm Italian, Greek, or ethnically Jewish.

Despite this I've had a very culturally black upbringing. I went to a very black school, BET was always on TV, learned how to do my sister's hair with a hot comb and all the fixings. I even have a stereotypical black sounding name (Imani). My sisters have been called the n-word, been followed around stores, have had women clutch their purse when they walk past. I've never experienced any of this, yes I've never thought of my cultural experiences as anything less than black. Therefore, I refer to myself as black. I consider myself a black woman.

A lot of people have issues with this. My sisters hate it. They say for all they know, I'm white. I've been told straight up by other black people that I'm not allowed to call myself black. I've been told by white ultra SJWs that I will never know what it's like to be a black woman (because they do?) and that calling myself is a form of appropriation.

I honestly am looking for opinions if I should change how I refer to myself or if I'm an asshole for insisting I am black despite sharing none of the physical features associated with blackness or facing discrimination the way my darker skinned family has.",672,1738,0.95
891,Not the A-hole,"So I 29f, have been thinking a lot about my future children and if my parents should really be in their lives. My parents are extremely homophobic. During my childhood they would say horrible things like if you are gay you will go to hell or they would threaten me with genital mutilation. (There were worse things but I felt it better not to repeat them) 

I never took the comments seriously for a long time because a) I wasn't gay, b) They always over exaggerate things so I didn't take them seriously, and c) I find most of their views pretty idiotic so it is more like a ""Bless your heart"" thing and let them be.

Once I got in my 20s I called them out more for their views, but they do not seem willing to change. And now that I am more looking to settle down I don't want their views to infect other aspects of my life. For instance, I know my parents wouldn't seriously do genital mutilation, but my future children would not know that right away. And if they were lgbt+ I wouldn't want them to have to hear about such horrible things said to them from people who are supposed to love them. I know I wouldn't be able to protect them from all bigots, but I should at least protect them from the bigots that I know about, even if they are my own family.

As for my relationship with my parents now, we are generally okay. I always go to the family holidays, hang out with them, but also always make sure to challenge their views if it comes up. I also know that they would be super excited to become grandparents. But when I have my children I feel that unless they change what they could be harmful to my kids whether or not they are lgbt.

So WIBTA if I told them if they do not change their homophobia that they would not be able to be in their future grandchildren's lives?

EDIT 1: Thank you for all of the responses so far!

EDIT 2: To clarify since it may change some views, when my parents threaten me with genital mutilation they say things along the lines of, ""I'll sew up your vagina."" or ""I'll sew up your butthole."" Etc. As I stated that I recognize these as exaggerations (Not jokes since that isn't funny in anyway) and that they would never actually do these things. Other example, my father also said that he would never marry my mother because he would kill her. He claims he is joking, but my mother never found this funny nor was it some sort of inside joke. And it took me quite a while to understand he wan't serious and effected my view of him and relationships in general.

My reasoning is that even if there was no real threat behind what they are saying, saying it is still very harmful. But I understand that some may think threatening to keep their grandchildren away because of this may be extreme. Hence why I am asking other people about this.",153,383,0.91
892,Asshole,"Throwaway because my friend might see this post and I  don‚Äôt want her to know my main. The genders of certain parties has been changed for an additional layer of obfuscation. Let me give some context first before diving straight in.

My online friend, ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù, lives in a foreign country that is very far away from the USA. ‚ÄúFrancis‚Äù, her long distance boyfriend, lives in the USA. They have had an on-again-off-again flirtation for almost a year, if I remember correctly.

Their relationship has been... rocky, to say the least. I know that Francis cheated on Sarah multiple times with his ex. His explanation? He can‚Äôt stand to be in a long-distance relationship, as he needs physical contact and texting just doesn‚Äôt do it for him. I don‚Äôt begrudge him this - a lot of people just can‚Äôt do LDRs. Unfortunately, their relationship will have to stay an LDR, since Sarah will be in her country‚Äôs military for the foreseeable future. Francis is also currently in school.

Sarah and I are fairly close friends and every time she breaks up with Francis, I get an ear-load of it. It‚Äôs been like 4 times already, and each time, she‚Äôs broken up, drinks a lot, and swears that she‚Äôs done with him. Well, that was a lie. I learned a couple days ago that she and Francis are dating again. From what Sarah has told me (and from the screenshots she‚Äôs sent me), Francis seems somewhat emotionally manipulative and lowkey unstable. Possibly - probably - not entirely over his ex. Which is not fertile ground for a relationship.

Anyway, I texted Francis (this is all through a social media platform) and basically told him that I‚Äôm sick of seeing this train wreck replay for the fourth time. It wasn‚Äôt necessarily a threat, but he could definitely sense my annoyance. He gave me some spiel about how he needs Sarah yadda yadda. I asked him how he thinks this is going to play out, since they have broken up so many times before. And this is the fucking kicker - he ADMITS that it‚Äôs ‚Äúprobably not going to go well‚Äù, and straight up says that he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt handle LDRs so far away‚Äù and most likely isn‚Äôt willing to move to that foreign country either. So I was thinking that he just admitted there‚Äôs no goddamn future for him and Sarah, right? I call him out and tell him they‚Äôre ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù. I tried to be more or less sympathetic, since I‚Äôve  come out of a year-long LDR myself and we broke up because of the distance as well, but it might not have come off that way.

Anyway Sarah is SO fucking mad at me, told me that I ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù her relationship. She tells me not to text Francis ever again, which is fine except he keeps texting me and asking me questions. She tells me to block him and butt out of their relationship, basically. I don‚Äôt know if I permanently damaged our friendship.

I concede that somewhere along the line, I could‚Äôve been more tactful. But I just wanted to save Sarah from more seemingly inevitable heartbreak. Reddit, AITA?",15,29,0.89

894,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so I (30F) am 3 months post partum, and have recently been given the okay to work out again, which I had planned to do from home for now.

 My house has all hardwood floors except for our main living room,  (right next to the kitchen and bathroom) which has a nice and somewhat comfy area rug, the only place I seem to have any comfort working out in due to terrible Sciatica during my pregnancy, I still even need to use a yoga mat on-top of it to make  it comfortable.

My baby has been on a pretty set sleeping schedule were he falls asleep at 11 pm, wakes up at 530 am to feed, and we go back to sleep until about 7, when I wake  up to get my other kids ready for school. After that he pretty much spends his morning and afternoon eating and sleeping until about 3, where he's mostly active and awake until bed time (little cat naps here and there). Because of this, between 9 and 230 (when I leave to get my kids) is the perfect time for me to try get a workout in. 

My BIL (31m) lives with us and just graduated from university, he's been looking for a job, but unfortunately no such luck yet, so he stays home all day, and usually goes out around 5pm to do whatever (gym, hang with friends etc) and the odd interview. Usually back by 8.

Now, I don't know what it is, but ever since I had my baby, I am constantly over heating and sweating (doctor says it's just hormones) but it's terrible, the only way I can get through a workout is to practically be in my underwear. (Sports bra and booty shorts more or less)  Which leads me to my problem. I am not comfortable wearing it while my BIL is home. I've tried wearing yoga pants and working out in other rooms, but I either get way to hot, or the hardwood floor is to painful on my back for me to work out on.  I have also tried working out after my BIL leaves, but with my baby (who is exclusively BF) only sleeping maybe 10-15 min at a time, and my 2 other kids running around, and my husband not getting home till around 7, it's almost impossible.

I told my husband about maybe asking my BIL to stay off the main floor while I'm working out, and he instantly got mad and said his brother shouldn't be confined to an area for my convenience, I then suggested maybe he could go to the gym earlier in the day which made my husband even more mad, as it comes across as me kicking him out and making it feel like it's not his home. 

I feel so weak after this pregnancy and just want to build my strength back and feel healthy again, my husband is more or less telling me to get over being uncomfortable, or to go to the gym with my baby during the day, which I'm not willing to do either.

897,Not the A-hole,"About a month ago, I finally moved out of my parent's house and in to my shiny new apartment. I have the place all to myself and I've never felt better. I love coming home every day and enjoying time to myself, not feeling guilty for cooking at 3am and not having to deal with my loud, obnoxious, gross, controlling family. I finished unpacking everything last week. Last night, my mom stopped by to check the place out.

When I was first starting to save for my apartment, I told my mom that when I'm in my own place she will not be allowed to smoke inside. Even before she walked inside, I told her she wasn't allowed to smoke inside. What does she do 5 minutes after coming inside and checking everything out? She lights a cigarette.

This really pissed me off. She has no respect for me and my rules in the place that only I pay to live in. I told her to get out and she thought I was kidding and told me it isn't fair because I smoke in my apartment. I smoke weed, not cigarettes. She still didn't put it out so I took her cigarette, threw it in the toilet, and told her to get the fuck out.

This morning, I woke up to a million and one texts from both my parents talking about how ungrateful I am and how horrible of a daughter I am and how they always knew I was a piece of shit but I had hit a new low. My dad hates her smoking around him too, so him jumping in on this and attacking me is making me think that maybe I am an asshole.

Maybe I could've handled it differently, told her to put it out or go outside before taking it and kicking her out. But at the same time, I've been telling her for many years that I would not allow smoking in my own place and had told her the same thing not 15 minutes before she walked in last night. She smokes over 2 packs a day, I'm not even overexaggerating, so why can't she handle herself for at least 45 minutes to visit her daughter? AITA?

Edit: tbf I didn't ask her politely to put it out. The conversation went something like this:

After checking the place out, I walk to the kitchen and she is still lingering in the hallway between the bathroom and bedroom and she lights a cigarette. She isn't trying to hide it but she did hide her taking out the pack and lighting it before walking towards the livingroom/kitchen, puffing away.

Me: ""are you fucking serious? Did I not just tell you you can't smoke in here?""

Mom: ""I birthed and raised you, gave you a roof over your head and food in your stomach for 21 years. That's longer than I needed to. Plus you smoke weed in here, and don't say you don't because I can smell it.""

Me: ""so fucking what I smoke in here? It's MY apartment??? I've told you over a hundred times for YEARS that when I get my own place you can't smoke inside. What if it's actually a rule and I could get in trouble for it? Get out.""

Mom: *shrugs and continues puffing, as if she's saying ""too late now""*

Me: *takes her cigarette out of her mouth and goes to the toilet and throws it in* ""get the FUCK OUT."" *goes to the door, opens it, points out*

Mom: ""you have to be fucking kidding me"" *storms out*",100,185,0.96

901,No A-holes here,"My brother texted me the other day asking if I could do him a ""favor"". With all the ridiculous things he's asked me for over the years, I had no idea what to expect so I said ""maybe"". 

Turns out one of his friends from college love ""close"" to me and his dad just passed away. He asked if I would be able to make something for him and take it to his friends house. He said that he would Venmo me to cover ingredients for it and everything.

The main issues are:
1. ""Close"" is a 45 minute drive (my brother does live halfway across the US away so closer than he is but still)
2. I am a relatively awkward person and would not like the social anxiety of showing up to the house of someone I never met, while they are mourning, with a tray of cookies and have to explain who I am and why I'm there. ""My brother said your dad died. Hope you like oatmeal raisin""

906,Not the A-hole,"I'm a U.S. servicemember eligible for the [Post 9/11 G.I. Bill](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_gibill.asp). If I don't use it can transfer this education benefit to any or all of my spouse and children. When I joined I was leaning toward transferring it to my children as I don't do well in school (I might have some kind of undiagnosed learning disorder) and I'm afraid it might be wasted on me. However I could use it to learn a trade, or earn certificates or other qualifications that might be more attainable.

Life happened and my spouse and I are separated and headed for divorce. A large piece of this is that I am in an ongoing struggle with mental illness that has gotten in the way of me being any kind of functional. This issue is likely not related to my service so I would not be eligible for medical retirement / disability.

My spouse has asked that I transfer them the G.I. Bill benefit for their use. If I did have have no doubt it would be used well, as they already have a Bachelor's degree and over the years have done comprehensive career planning as to what additional schooling would have the highest return on investment. Due to my unemployment / underemployment we had been unable to make this financially possible. I believe this course would benefit them and by extension our children, as they have and I expect will maintain primary custody due to a number of factors.

My concern is that if I do give up my G.I. Bill I will be giving up a lot of hope for opportunity and security in my own life. With my mental health, my career in the service looks uncertain at best. I am a reservist and my mental health has previously blocked me from career opportunities such as converting my contract to an active duty one. I am not good enough at my job in the service to leverage it to a civilian job, and even if I were the longest I've been able to hold a job is about a year and a half.

Basically, if I do transfer my education funding to my ex they'll be set and my kids will probably be ok. I'll probably just get by and will definitely spend the rest of my life well below the poverty line. If I don't, there's a real possibility that I'll waste it anyway no matter how well-intentioned I am, and no one will benefit.

So the work gym: You‚Äôre getting the essentials that you‚Äôd see from a regular gym. Except there are no ‚Äústudio‚Äù rooms meant for dancing, cardio classes (kickboxing, Zumba), doing back flips, etc . So as you‚Äôd imagine the space is considerably ‚Äúintimate‚Äù. There is just enough room for a couple bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and a free weight area with a couple benches. For the most part it‚Äôs just elderly people on stationary bikes, or they are doing free weight work outs and everyone is wearing headphones. Everyone tends to go at lunch time, so 11-12pm or 12-1.pm 

However, now on Monday-Friday there is a separate office of middle aged sales people that come down to the gym in groups of 7-9 people . They will move all of the benches for people to sit down on into the back of the gym but in between the weight machines. This is preventing people from using those machines and blocking the walk ways. So often times we just can‚Äôt use those machines. They put down a speaker and blast what sounds like pop and latin Music and start this intense dancing and jumping. My issue is that it feels unsafe because of the tight spacing and the fact that they wear jeans and hard toed shoes while doing this. 

Apparently, they are doing their form of Zumba. This isn‚Äôt a community class and hasn‚Äôt been authorized by management. It‚Äôs their own office rec. activity. And I have checked (with out snitching), and they were never given a green light to do this. They also never move the equipment back where it belongs and other staff and myself have to push the benches back into place and they leave sweaty towels on the floor for the janitor to pick up.

2 days ago she created an event on Facebook for the day and time we agreed on for the cookout and invited a bunch of people. I messaged her and she says to expect about 20 people plus her family. 

We are very low income, I am not working because we have a newborn and husband doesn't make much. I can not afford to buy meat and supply a barbeque for 25+ people. 

This was a thank you to her for helping with the brakes, not a cookout for her entire family and friends. I feel like she's using us to feed her cookout good meats and BBQ.

So, WIBTA if I made some excuse not to go to the cookout?

Tl;dr agreed to feed 6 people BBQ meat for a cookout, friend then invites 20 extra people and expects me to feed them too.

This did not bother me as she was kind of a friend of mine and I‚Äôm not against helping a friend, so I thought nothing of it.

A couple hours later, I got an email from my teacher saying I had been ‚Äúpassing around my answers with my phone‚Äù and that I, as well as the girl, will received a 0 on the assignment. 

This frustrated me and I sent her a polite email back explaining what had happened, though trying not to throw my classmate under the bus. She ended up not even using my work anyway, so I showed my teacher in class the next day our answers and they were completely different. She still said it was completely my fault and almost even let the girl off the hook.

922,Asshole,"So my fianc√© (30F) and I (33M) have been engaged now for a couple months. We haven‚Äôt talked too much about the wedding and all but tonight she brought up our wedding party.

I was excited to talk about this because I have many close male friends and a brother. I told her I wanted my 4 childhood friends, my best friend from college and my brother to be my best man. 

She told me this was way too many people. She had always wanted a small wedding party of 3 each. She wanted to be able to buy kind of expensive gifts for each person we asked to be in the party and she said that having 12 people to buy gifts for was way too much. 

I told her we could easily afford the gifts she had in mind for 12 people because we both do very well and both had large savings that we would be using for the wedding. This sent her into tears. She got very upset about this and asked me what she was suppose to do, ask strangers to be in her bridal party? 

You see my wife does not have a lot of female friends. She planned her bridal party to be her best friend (only female friend) and her step sister and her 1rst cousin. 

I felt bad this was upsetting her so badly but I always thought that it was obvious I was going to need these people in my wedding party. 

We argued a little bit until she sarcastically apologized for not having enough friends for me. She went to our room and locked the door still crying and refuses to answer me or open up. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve really done anything wrong but when I called my brother and told him he said I was being ass. He told me she was obviously very self conscious about her lack of friends and it was hurting her feelings. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hurt any of my friends feelings by picking between them and he told me didn‚Äôt know what to tell me.

926,Not the A-hole,"My mother and father have been in an ongoing separation  process. My family lived in Central America and I have been living in the US for about 6 years now for education. 

My father left my mom claiming that she had an affair with his personal business attorney, in charge of all his assets. She had accused him of cheating in the past but nothing serious had come out of it. My mom vehemently denies these claims and the two have been telling me directly opposing information every conversation we have had since.

My mom left Central America with my siblings without my fathers knowledge and moved in with me, telling me to pick her up from the airport no sooner than her landing (am since living with roommates in another city). She said he was physically threatening her and that he had paid off government officials to turn a blind eye to their separation proceedings. My father has never paid her (in legal custody of my 15 & 7 year old siblings) absolutely anything (including for food or rent) for years. 

I tried to stay as removed from the situation as I possibly could (which has been a significant emotional burden), and have been enrolled in university. My summer after first year my father gave me an ultimatum where I had to drive my brother across the US-Mexico border so he could see him/pick him up, otherwise he‚Äôd stop supporting me financially. I told him that I would love to if my mother allowed it but I could not kidnap my brother, I pleaded with my mother and she declined. I didn‚Äôt drive him.

My father has cut me off financially, frequently texts me extremely hateful messages, and has repeatedly disowned me as a son. Soon after, I wrote a letter explaining the situation which my mom took to a judge and I gave my mom my dads personal laptop which he had asked me to repair. 

Since then my mother and siblings have struggled to survive financially while I have been living off predominantly scholarships and student loans. My father would still text me periodically, sometimes initiating normal conversation but more often angry ones claiming that I betrayed him and stabbed him in the back for not standing up to my ‚Äúevil mother‚Äù whom he claims had tried to put him in jail, poison him, and rob him of everything he has. Meanwhile my mom has been very supportive of my siblings and I and I have been relatively unaware of her legal involvement with my father. I feel that I can‚Äôt vouch for the validity of anything outside of my direct personal experience with them as they have been saying such opposing things.

Yesterday my father has been extradited by the US government and is in jail. I don‚Äôt have much info to the situation but I know he would view me as facilitating his demise, when I really have never deliberately tried to do and have repeatedly told him I love him despite his anger.

928,Not the A-hole,"I have a few friends that I've known since high school. One of them, we'll call Joe, had (or still has I'm not really clear on that) a crush on me. I dated another friend, Bill, for a short period senior year but we broke up when we realized we were better off as friends. Shortly after that Joe asked me out and I rejected him. I genuinely wasn't interested in him romantically at all and he asked me out like 2 weeks after Bill and I told the group about our split. After the rejection, Joe became very insufferable. 

A list of incidents with Joe that occurred during the following years:

* He would wolf whistle at me anytime I wore a skirt or did my hair nicely 
* He tried multiple times to guilt trip me into dating him
* He once told me that he would breakup with his then gf if I wanted to date him (I really really didn't)

I ended our friendship about halfway through college after our friend group met up to go to the movies one time. Joe and I were the first ones there and in the 10 or so minutes we were alone together, he made me so uncomfortable that I went to the bathroom and didn't come out until my other friend, Jessie, arrived and could come into the bathroom and help me out. The theater was crowded so Jessie and I used that as an excuse to sit away from Joe.

After that I stopped talking to Joe. Bill and Jessie were very understanding and supported this. A few of our other friends were less supportive. 

It's been about 5 years since I last spoke to Joe directly. We been apart of the same group chats since then, but I haven‚Äôt reached out to him and he never reached out to me. About 3ish years ago, I met Daniel, my boyfriend. It started out pretty casual, but once things started looking a bit more serious I told my friends and family about us. Bill and Jessie were the first ones I told and I‚Äôve told almost everyone else at some point. I‚Äôve also posted pictures of us in our group chat.

Last week, we had a friendly get together where we went to a movie and had dinner at a nice restaurant afterward. I brought Daniel as my plus one. Bill and a couple other friends brought their SOs too. While at the movies, Joe tried to sit next to me, but Daniel was already there and Jessie was on my other side. I told him that we could catch up at dinner.

At dinner, Bill's gf asked Daniel and I if we were planning on getting married. We have been talking about it on and off, but we've decided to just go with the flow. Joe flipped out. I realized then, that Joe was the only one at the table that did not know about Daniel and I because I'd never spoken 1-on-1 with him since we got together. 

Joe was very upset and difficult to talk to for the rest of the night. Since then, a few of my friends have said I was in the wrong for not telling Joe because I knew he had a crush on me and he should have been told. Daniel says I'm not wrong and that it was an honest mistake, but I'm not really sure.

We live in a nice / safe neighborhood that's pretty old-school in the sense that all the kids run around the block freely and we regularly will have kids coming in and out of the house. It's very 1980's; and outside of feeling a little overwhelmed when we will suddenly have 6-8 boys running through the house, it's a good life. That said, we have new neighbors and their kids are 3 to 6 years old and there are anywhere from 3 to 6 of them living there at a given time (must share custody of children based on the fact that they are only there some nights and most weekends).

It's not uncommon to have a group of 5 or 6 children that we don't know playing on our porch...running, screaming, etc. The question is, AITA for not wanting kids I don't know playing on our porch and sidewalk when I try to relax after work or read the news on the weekend?

We were required to immediately take our shoes off, change into lounge clothes, wash our hands, etc. upon coming home. While I'm not as clean as my parents, those rules have been engrained in me and I would say I definitely keep a cleaner home than most of my peers.

Recently the weather has gotten colder, and my boyfriend has a nice waterproof jacket that he wears constantly. It's that type of material that you don't wash often, kind of [like this](https://www.sunnysports.com/Image/Product/Large/MRMMJMLRAN.jpg).

The problem is that he insists on wearing this jacket inside, even when we're cuddling under a blanket on the couch. It drives me nuts because when I'm home, I'm usually in ""clean lounge clothes"" and I don't want to cuddle up next to a jacket that's been at work, on the bus, thrown on the floor, etc. This type of material is also very ""outside-only"" typically so it's hard for me to mentally relax when I see it on inside, kind of like seeing someone walk around with a backpack on at home.

I've offered him hoodies to wear instead (they're his hoodies, he keeps them at my house but rarely wears them), but he refuses and says his jacket is more comfortable.

937,Asshole,"Obligatory clickbait title, sorry! 

I was working as a server at a restaurant for the last 2.5 months. Sunday I got into an argument with the manager about how it is a violation of the law to tip her out. On Monday morning she called me and said my services were no longer needed.

Three weeks into the job they found out I was pregnant and coincidentally I lost one of my two shifts to someone who per the owner has ""more availability and wants to to work more."" 

I asked if it was because I'm pregnant and was told they've had multiple ""girls"" (ugh, women, hello) have babies and they never had a problem with it. This is true but those women worked there for many years when they became pregnant. 

As a side note, the manager made multiple comments about how I was getting fat. I always responded ""Yeah, that's how pregnancy works.""What I really wanted to reply with was ""Yeah, you got any clothes I can borrow?"" But I was trying not to be an asshole!

Anyyyyyfart. This past weekend another employee tells me mid-shift she just saw the manager swipe a $20 bill from a table and stuff it in her pocket. So after the shift we sit down to do the tips. The employee asks her about the $20. She says the customer gave it personally to her because she works for him on the side. I don't think it's cool she's taking tips from customers while she's on the floor but fine. She also says that she runs food, busses tables, seats customers and if a customer wants to personally give her a tip that's ok. She's always complaining that she does those things so I told her doing that's the manager's job: to back up the waitstaff. And on top of that, us tipping her out is a violation of the law. 

She loses it after that. She tells me I'm nasty, have an attitude, I'm greedy. My response was ""I haven't raised my voice or called you names, though you have done that to me."" We argue for 30 min, her defense is she never asked for the tips. 

The next morning she called to tell me my services were no longer needed. I'm not sure she told the owners the truth (that I brought up a violation of the law) because I find it hard to believe they would be cool with firing me after that. IANAL but that's illegal right? 

I'd like to say here that she is \*beloved\* by the customers and the owners. Though she's worked there 30 years, the waitstaff find her obnoxious and hate tipping her out. But they're all afraid of her.

Here's my dilemma. Legally, I think I was wrongfully terminated. Ethically, should I just let this go? She's 70 years old. She is definitely underpaid by the owners and this is her main source of income. Part of me feels like I should just be a bigger person and let this roll off my back.

So here's the problem. 

My gf wants to be the vagina but she was the dick last year so I want to be the ""main/primary"" part this year but she won't change her mind. If she got to be the dick last year, why can't I be the vagina this year? I love her very much and I want her to be happy but it only seems fair that I get to dress as the vagina to the party right? So tell me asshole enthusiasts, am I really the asshole my friend's Halloween party this year?",69,278,0.79
942,No A-holes here,"This happened a few months ago and every time I take an Uber (8-10 times a week) I'm still dumbfounded by the experience and wondering what happened here. Relevant intro - I look young, but not that young - I'm in my early 30's, maybe could pass for early 20's but pretty clearly not a teenager. 

I use Uber to go to work 3-4 times a week, and this morning was one of those mornings. Driver (\~mid 50's male?) pulls up outside of my house, I walk outside, open the door, say ""Hi \_\_\_ how's it going"" and he just turns around and says ""How old are you?"". I was a little taken back since that's a pretty odd way to respond to ""how's it going"", so I responded with ""I'm sorry?"" and he repeated himself. I asked him why he needed to know how old I was, and he told me he needed to make sure that I was old enough to ride in an Uber. I told him I was old enough to ride in an Uber, and he responded by telling me that if I wouldn't share how old I was with him that he wasn't comfortable driving me so I told him that's fine and got out of the car and called a different Uber. 

AITA for not just resolving this situation by telling this guy my age?",493,3067,0.96

944,Asshole,"I (22M) went over to my GF‚Äôs(21F) place to sleep over. When we went to go to bed, she put on a t-shirt given to her by some guy she slept with. I jokingly said to her that that was a poor choice of clothing, since that college is my college‚Äôs biggest rival, and I know how she got that t-shirt. She initially replied jokingly, asking oh yeah how do you think I got it. So I stated the obvious: it‚Äôs three sizes too big, and it‚Äôs for a college neither of us goes to and everybody who doesn‚Äôt go to that place hates it because they are usually snobs, so she must‚Äôve got it from a former lover. She then got super defensive and said she only likes it because it‚Äôs comfy and this and that, and started getting mad at me for being upset at that. 

So, am I the asshole for being uncomfortable sleeping with my girlfriend when she‚Äôs wearing another man‚Äôs shirt, whom she used to have sex with, and to top it all off it‚Äôs a shirt for a college I hate(think just shy of UNC-Duke level rivalry)? It‚Äôs not like she doesn‚Äôt have any other shirts to wear, her wardrobe is big and full. I know some people will call me insecure for that and I probably am a bit insecure, but my GF also has insecurities that I have to accept and help her with. I agree that this is not a big deal and I accept her past (not slut-shaming her at all), but I think it‚Äôs reasonable to not want to be reminded of my GF‚Äôs past lovers while we sleep together.

EDIT: Idk if ‚ÄúShacker Shirt‚Äù is the best term to call it, I‚Äôve just heard sorority sisters call it that and didn‚Äôt know how else to describe it succinctly.

EDIT 2: She explicitly said she got the t-shirt from a guy she slept with.",705,754,0.91
945,No A-holes here,"***[EDIT/UPDATE below]*** I will be the first to admit that while I love my dad, he has his faults. He is a charming, charismatic guy, with a booming laugh and loads of interesting stories (he had a tough but interesting life and generally has a good attitude about it). But he has this one habit that has always annoyed me: he is always on his phone/laptop for work. To a ridiculous degree. My brother has told me about a guided tour they went once when he came to visit him in college - dad got on the phone 10 min in, kept talking loudly for half an hour to his business associate, and wouldn‚Äôt stop until another person on the tour told him he was being rude and to shut up. My brother nearly died of embarrassment. It is that bad.

We‚Äôve all talked to him about it, and he has gotten a little better, but insists that he needs to keep working (if it matters, we grew up pretty poor and he and my mom still struggle financially). So he‚Äôll do things like come to a family dinner and bring his laptop, so he can sit at the table and work after the dinner portion is over. He has now done this twice at dinner parties my fianc√©‚Äôs parents have invited them to. Fianc√©‚Äôs parents are super gracious, like my parents personally, and have never commented on it. My fianc√© is livid though. He finds it rude and disrespectful to his parents. It is and I talked to my dad after both incidents.

The problem is he hasn‚Äôt stopped (he‚Äôs taken calls while at lunch with fianc√© and I as well), and my fianc√© wants me to give my dad an ultimatum: if he can‚Äôt leave his phone and laptop off, he can‚Äôt come to these events anymore.

I would normally recognize that as fair. However, my dad is pretty old (70s - he had me pretty late in life) and was recently diagnosed with an incurable condition that will kill him. The doctors can‚Äôt say when - could be today, could be 10 years from now - but it is likely he doesn‚Äôt have long left. And if it doesn‚Äôt kill him soon, it will probably decrease his cognitive abilities until he is a different person. Given this, I don‚Äôt want to exclude him from events. I want to spend as much time as possible with him, and have him be part of these family moments, even if he is a little rude. Am I the asshole if I refuse to ban him for future events?

***EDIT***

I really want to thank everyone who provided their judgments and thoughts. Even the unkind ones gave me some insight to help me address the issue. Having thought about a lot of the suggestions, my boyfriend and I had a heart-to-heart last night. We both apologized for our reactions during the first conversation. He admitted that he‚Äôd called his parents and they were both upset about his ultimatum. They are the ones extending invitations to my parents and said they‚Äôd feel mortified if they invited my parents to something only to have me tell my dad he wasn‚Äôt welcome for any reason. They felt it wasn‚Äôt our place when it was their events.

But they acknowledged they found his behavior rude and that they are also concerned about the effect it has on my father‚Äôs health. They are really fond of him, and would rather have him around with his rude behavior than not at all, but they hoped we could come up with something else.

For my part, I recognized I had not done enough to try to curtail the behavior or soothe the anxieties that may have caused it, and that (regardless of how his parents feel about it), it isn‚Äôt fair to them, my fianc√©, or any other guests. So we discussed and agreed upon a less extreme course that will require change, but not exclude my father from important moments.

Based on some of the suggestions I got here, I‚Äôve decided to have a family intervention, where we explain to my father again just how hurtful and embarrassing his behavior is for all of us. But we will also all explain to him that we love him, so much, and that we know how much he has done for us. And that, even if things didn‚Äôt turn out exactly the way he expected, he DID succeed in the promise he made us and himself. He gave me and my older brothers an amazing start in life, such that we‚Äôve all done really well. We have more than enough for ourselves and to support them if they ever need it. We don‚Äôt need any money or material things, we just need his time. At the end of the day, there is nothing more valuable. I am hoping that love may succeed where shame has failed.

We will not require him to stop working entirely, since I do believe, as some here have suggested, that this is something he is doing for himself as well. But we will require that he not pull out his phone or laptop at events with other guests. We hope that he will just agree to this after the intervention, but if he takes out either item at an event we will give him a soft warning once, and if it is not immediately put away, then calmly and quietly remove the item and lock it in one of our cars. He can have it back when they are leaving the event. It may create some initial unpleasantness, but my brothers have already indicated they are onboard.",143,924,0.96

947,Everyone Sucks,"My fiance (M/22) and I (F/30) have been together for a year now, and during this time he has not had a driver's license. Out of necessity when we first moved in together I bought a car in my name for him so that he could work, with the promise that now that he had income he would go get his license. Added factor in the issue is also that Fiance does have ADHD, and just got treatment for it for the first time in the last 6 months.

 Cut to a year later, he still does not have a license. I finally decided to let him know that he has a month to get his license. During this month I backed off of him, didn't constantly remind him as he requested, and just let him do his thing with the explicit promise that if he did not get his license, he would not be able to use his car and he would be taking the bus. Last week of the month and he still doesn't have his license, hasn't studied for a minute, nothing. He asks me to extend it to yesterday, I do, still nothing. Yesterday I told him that he could not use his car, and that I would not be taking him to work (I am currently at home on medical leave), and he did not react well. He told me that he felt as though not having his car was enough, and that I was going too far by not taking him to work. Today he has declared that if I don't take him to work, he will simply call out.

 I know one thing for sure, I feel like the asshole.

TLDR; fiance hasn't gotten license for a year, I take away car and won't take him to work, he feels me not taking him to work is too far

EDIT: I said in the OP that I felt like TA, and that has been confirmed. 

Just to clarify. I realize there are many factors in our relationship that make it difficult. I am a patient person by nature, and I try to see the best in people and do what I can to be supportive of my loved ones, apparently to a fault. I appreciate the constructive criticism and have begun (and will continue) taking steps to better myself in healthy ways, as well as working with my partner to set healthier boundaries. I understand that my relationship might not make sense to some people, and that's totally fine. We all have different and unique lives and I think that is something to celebrate.

949,No A-holes here,"My wife has talked about surrogacy a lot, and I support her on the matter, however I don't know if I fully support this situation...

Some Background...

She has been talking with my cousins wife about how they have been having trouble to conceive. They are willing to let my wife be a surrogate, will pay for her services, medical expenses, and maternity clothes. All sounds nice and we could use the extra money. But the thing is that the only way for this to work for them without spending the most amount of money is using my wife's egg. So that would mean that biologically it would be my wife's and cousins child. That just kinda of makes me uncomfortable seeing how we hang out with my cousin and his wife a lot, and I feel the risk emotionally to everyone involved just isn't worth it. I am close to my cousin, he is basically my brother and I don't want to ruin the relationship with this surrogacy thing. She says she is perfectly fine with doing the surrogacy and sees no issues and my cousin and his wife are fine, but seem to understand the uncomfortable and weird nature of the situation. I talked to my cousin about my concerns and he totally agreed and said not to stress to much, they will be parents either through adoption or other means with him and his wife somehow. 

I told my wife for now, its a no for me. She is highly upset with me saying she is so disappointed with me and how it isn't fair, that it is her body and I can't make decisions for her. It honestly makes me feel pretty bad...AITA?

edit1: In case anyone is curious, we do have one child. He is a little over one. She has been into surrogacy because she says she likes being pregnant, but thinks it would be to hard to raise another child. I agree one is enough for me.

edit2: I voiced my concerns to my wife first as well.",328,884,0.97
950,Not the A-hole,"My and my friends are planning an out of province grad trip because the drinking age is lower and alcohol is cheaper in said province. We are planning on staying in an AirBnB for 5 days, and since we are teenagers, most of us are broke as shit. 

I found a place for $200 a night, everything we would need (sleeping space for everyone, bbq, firepit, plenty of yard space, large living rooms, and a large kitchen). There are about 10 of us so it would come to a nice $100 a night for the 5 nights. 

One of my other friends has ‚Äòimplanted‚Äô and idea into about half the people‚Äôs heads that they absolutely need an indoor pool. The only place they found was $600 a night times the 5 nights coming to $300 per person. 

On top of this I have suggested 3 cheaper alternatives. 1) find a cabin near a lake. 2) go to a campground on a lake. 3) find a place near a public pool (walking distance though because we will all be hammered). 

AITA for refusing to pay an extra $200 for a pool that won‚Äôt be used?

EDIT: They have decided to meet up for brunch today (October 4th), and they have made 0 attempt to contact me until just now (12:33pm) asking where I was.

951,Asshole,"So my gf and I have been dating 9 months. Things have been going quick. We recently moved in together. We're in our early 30s. The other day I found out that her and her ex and joint custody of his kid. She never mentioned this kid before. It came up because we were selling some stuff online. I asked about one of the items and she said it isn't hers and it was this kid's. 

So it concerned me that she never mentioned this kid before. They had joint custody, a couple days a week, so the kid was definitely part of their life at the time. Not really something that you would forget... Another concerning factor is that they got together when this child was months old. In addition to this they were going out every weekend which is something we do occasionally. We both play music so this night life stuff is pretty normal. And in general we are night people. 

So I'm also a bit concerned about moral character. IMO if a kid is involved that should be the focus even if it's not yours but your partner's.

TLDR; AITA for being concerned about a secret baby not being secret any more.

Edit: To be clear it's not her kid, it is her Ex's. And the kid is no longer in the picture. She just never mentioned she was raising a kid with her ex till now.

Edit again : I'm not from the US. Here cohabitation is a legal status, just short of being married. My gf and I do not have this status. We are ""single"" legally. Although her ex and herself had cohabitational status. So with this cohabitational status would come some responsibility to the child regardless of whose it is.",51,38,0.83

953,Not the A-hole,"So this happened about a year ago but I'm curious. My wife said I drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

So my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. So I was excited too and asked him what. He said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

I felt a little bad but said to him ""you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've learned that's actually not true."". I said I can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. 

The next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right, but he is still skeptical.  

The next day I compose a nice email, not rude. Simply stating I told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him I am incorrect. I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

He emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it. As of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

So I email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because I cannot produce anything showing he is correct. He finally relents and says I must be right. 

But at this point, I now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  My wife asked me to please stop but I didn't. I emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

He did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

Now I feel that I have taught my son a few good lessons.  A) it's ok to question things including those authorities B) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence C) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

Was I an asshole for dragging it out?

Edit. To those calling me an asshole? What is the best way to handle this then? I'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

Edit: well this blew up. I'll accept my nta. But these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? Nope. Couldn't care less. But I wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

Final edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through. But I was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days.

He recently moved to my city because of a boyfriend. Everything was going pretty good, the boyfriend seemed cool, Sam was looking for a full-time job while freelancing a bit, they seemed happy. Sam spent a lot of money on his move and he was already kind of broke and depending on his boyfriend when he found out his boyfriend was cheating. Sam confronted him and the guy pretty much reacted by kicking him out, leaving him with no money and no place to stay.

I put him up for a few days and I ended up lending him 1500 dollars, and telling him that if he needs any more help, to just ask.

I told my mom about this and she got mad because about 2 years before, I refused to lend my sister the same amount of money.

So to help remedy the fact that we only see each other a few times a month, we like to play video games at night and talk to each other.

I explain to her that I have work responsibilities that needed to be taken care of and that I can multitask so I can finish the work, and have lady time, but she still seems pretty upset about it. I didn't mean to upset her, I just wanted to make sure I take care of work responsibilities and make sure I spend time with her as well. I feel really bad.

Figured I would turn to this subreddit to get others' opinions on the situation. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong, but I figured I would double-check myself before I double-wreck myself.

EDIT: So it looks like I‚Äôm the A-Hole here. Damn. I messed up. I didn‚Äôt have any malicious intent when I decided to finish my project while talking to her, I just tried my best to try and achieve the best of both worlds and failed in that regard. I want to thank everyone for their insight on this situation and for voicing their opinions. I will be sure to try and be more thoughtful of my partner‚Äôs time in the future.

972,Not the A-hole,"Basically, I'm (19M) in 2nd year uni, and ever since the very first class of my accounting course, I have sat beside this dude from the congo.

From the very first day he told me how he was too poor to be able to use a laptop since he came straight from the congo on his own, half the time it's really, really hard to understand what he's saying (important later on)

So for the past 6 weeks, I let him glance over at my computer to grasp concepts and see certain slides or questions.

This wasn't really a problem until maybe the 2nd week where he started asking question after questions.

I'm trying to listen to the prof but he's constantly asking me questions in really broken english, so I'm always having to say ""huh"" and ""sorry, can you repeat that?"" It probably doesn't seem like a big time waster, but the prof goes so fast that I end up missing like 3 slides worth of content.

Not to mention he has no regard for personal space, he literally will go over my arm rest and poke his head towards my screen to see better, it's driving me nuts and I don't think I can deal with this for the rest of the semester.

I have no idea how to tackle this situation, as we have a midterm coming up and I really need to just sit down and focus.

I've tried telling him before that he sits too close to me, but we end up whispering back and forth ""huh"" and ""what"" and ""sorry can't hear"" while trying to be quiet during the lecture.

WIBTA for just ignoring him or turning my laptop away from him? I'd talk to him before or after class, but he literally always comes to the lecture 10 mins late, or leaves like 20 mins before the 3hr lecture is over, so this is literally my only option.

Edit-

To those saying ask to move seats, its not designated, nor is the class ever full (practically empty) so he can sit wherever and beside whoever he wants

I have gone to the prof, she's the laziest fuck ever, gave me the stanky eye and told me to deal with it myself, beyond that she has told me""there's nothing I can do""

EDIT #2=

I just had my class with him today, this post isn't big or anything, but thought maybe some of you might want to know how shit went down today.

For those of you who say I need to grow a backbone, or that I'm a bitch for not just growing a pair (lol), imagine dealing with the most socially inept person who also happens to be super duper nice. Yes, he is super nosy but he's so kind and polite most of the time, I really just feel so bad for him.

Also, sorry if I seemed a little curt with some of you, it's a little upsetting to hear judgement's from people who obviously haven't read the whole post, or who think that I'm really going to waste my time ""printing out the slides with him"" or ""helping him find office admins"" / ""foreign help programs"". As much as I do feel bad for him, I have enough on my plate. Like a lot of students, I have more than one midterms on one day.

Anyways, today when he came late, I tried what some of you said, to sit in the front of the class, at the end of the row, with my bag on the other side. He came late, saw my bag, asked if I could move it, and I did- but I told him firmly to ""Not leave because I need to speak with you"".

He did the usual, asked me a butt-load of questions, he tried to leave like 30 mins before class ended but I ended up walking out with him so I could talk. I essentially told him I'd no longer be willing to answer his questions, if he wants to keep looking at my slides he can, but not to come into my personal space.

He seemed really hurt but he must have understood because we ended up hugging for like 3 solid minutes lmao, and he told me he was truly sorry.

Anyways, thanks for the help guys- my dumbass really probably would not have been able to do this on my own",116,312,0.95

974,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I hardly fight but we're at a standstill over the big fluorescent light in the kitchen of our 1BR apartment, and I'd like some arbitration. I'll try and lay it out as objectively as I can.

My side: I know it's weird, but I hate overhead lighting, fluorescent in particular. I feel like hate is not even a strong enough word. When that kitchen light is on it causes fight-or-flight in me. I want to get away from it, but it's permeating everything. If I go in the bedroom and close the door I can see it coming through the cracks and it feels like it's seeping into my brain. The only analogy I can think of is a stink bomb. I become anxious and unhappy until it goes away. Sure I have to deal with fluorescent at work during the day, but I'm anxious enough outside the house. I don't want to live that way in my home at night. I'm happy to buy and maintain as many table and floor lamps are necessary to produce adequate light. I know I'm not the one who cooks, but honestly if it were a choice between the light or takeout, I'd prefer the latter. I think my boyfriend should accept my preference and not use that light while I'm home. If I lived alone it would go completely unused, I have no issue doing the dishes or using the kitchen with just the other lights we have. I think it's unreasonable of him to subject me to this discomfort.

His side: he does the cooking and most of the dish-washing (I work full time and he doesn't, and that's part of our division of labor.) He cannot see as well when the overhead light is off. Aside from that, he enjoys the lights. Any more table lamps in the kitchen would not be feasible. If he were living alone he would not use any other light for the kitchen/living room area, he'd leave it on all the time. He thinks it's unreasonable of me to insist that he cook and clean ""in the dark.""

So what do you think? Who's the asshole here?

EDIT/INFO: I could totally deal with this by spending time in the bedroom while he cooks/cleans. It would be fine for me if he used the light while I was not in the living room/kitchen. But if I go to the bedroom and close the door when I get home he says I'm being silly and gets sad that I'm not spending time with him, then I say ""well it's because the scary light is on"" and he makes faces at me. But that stuff is more for a relationships sub. I just wanted to clarify I am ok with him using it while I'm home, just not while I'm in that half of the home.

FINAL EDIT: yes, I have a myriad of mental health issues and no joke an entire medical team that I work with to help me be functional enough to contribute to society. I'll certainly bring this up with them, it just seemed relatively minor compared to everything else I deal with. But all the YTAs make it clear I was missing something, so I concede.

975,Asshole,"My fianc√© (22F) and I (25M) have been living together for about a year now.  We have our small fights here and there, as all couples do when they first experience being around each other 24/7, but nothing serious.  She can be stubborn and temperamental (as can I), but I love her so much and I can't wait to marry her.  However, she has one quirk that really rubs me the wrong way sometimes.  For background, she's a pretty light sleeper, whereas I could probably sleep through a tornado.  If she goes to bed first, there's a good chance that me attempting to get into bed will wake her, no matter how quiet I think I'm being. The problem is that I'm a notorious snorer.  According to my family, my snoring sounds like a wild boar (I've recorded myself and I don't think it's THAT bad, but can confirm it's fairly loud).  Since we moved to our apartment, my fianc√© has only gotten worse in her light sleeping habits, partially due to her paranoia of a new environment (we don't live in the safest area ever, lots of break-ins, robberies, etc. so it's not exactly baseless).  This means that if she's not dead asleep when I go to bed, my snoring can evidently wake her up pretty easily.  My issue is that if my snoring wakes her up, she will then wake ME up, regardless of what time it is, and make me adjust my pillows or turn over or whatever to try to make me stop.  This usually doesn't work, so she'll wake me up AGAIN and try again. The worst is that if her calling to me doesn't wake me, she'll sometimes nudge me pretty hard in the side.  I haven't said anything to her, as I know she's a light sleeper and that's not her fault, but it sometimes really annoys me that she will wake me up an hour before I have to get up for work just because she wants me to stop snoring, which is something I have very little control over, especially since I get up early (around 6 a.m.) and she gets several more hours of sleep after I'm gone (she's a student and her classes usually won't start until 9 or 10 a.m.). So, I want to ask her to stop waking me up, as I don't get enough sleep already, and her waking me only makes me more exhausted when I do get up. I've considered a CPAP, but that's a lot of money for a loud machine that would probably also wake her and wouldn't necessarily fix my snoring.  WIBTA for bringing this up to her?

TL;DR - Fianc√© will wake me up for snoring and waking her often, and I want to ask her to stop.

EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful comments, my guys.  Some were harsh, but hey, no biggie, my post DOES sound super selfish and a bit whiney.  I can't do much in the way of doctor visits at the moment (I'm still under my parent's insurance as my current job has less coverage, but my dad is currently on strike and his insurance has been put on hold), but when that gets dealt with I'm gonna be looking into a sleep study and see what's going on.  Really hoping I don't have sleep apnea, but it'll be nice to finally see what can be done.",88,153,0.9

He doesn't see the big deal in me moving up my wedding date to accommodate him.  I don't really think it's my sole responsibility to fund his university, he should foot some of the cost as well.

I have asked him gently to shower and wear a T-shirt in bed, but he gets really upset, which is kinda fair enough because I know he can‚Äôt help sweating.

989,Not the A-hole,"I met this girl on tinder, and we got to talking and had great chemistry almost instantaneously. We talk here and there for a couple of days and we decide to meet up and go to the cinema. We met up like an hour before the film to just chat in the lobby and everything is going great. She was well educated and had a great job. She seemed to have her life together. I'm 23 and she's 24. 

We head into the screens and during the middle of the film I asked her ""How was work today"". She responded by saying ""I had to wake up early today to drop my son at nursery"". I looked at her and asked her if she was joking as she had a general playful personality. It was apparent from her facial expression that she was not, and replied ""I could have sworn I told you, I must have forgotten to mention it"". I fell silent for 10 seconds before asking out politeness the age of her son and making pointlessly small talk ( which I guess is not unusual in a first date). 

It was obvious my demeanor had changed as soon as she had told me about her child. I didn't mean to do it but I am what people would call a open book. I become more distant. Her profile did not mention it and whilst I am aware that being a parent isn't all she is I just am not at this age interested in single mothers. I do not blame her for not having it in her profile, but I do think it is a necessity to tell someone in the multiple phone calls that you are a parent. I watched the film with her whilst not engaging in her attempts of intimacy. I stayed out of politeness and tried to maintain some civility in order to keep the experience a neither bad or good one.

I then waited with her for her cab to arrive and dodged her attempt at the final kiss and took it on the cheek.

When I got home I got a message from her saying she realised that I stopped being interested as soon as she had dropped the news. I replied that I am to young for that type of commitment and that honestly she should have told me earlier. She replied "" A mother isn't all I am"" and "" I don't see how my child concerns you""

991,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago I was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I was told it was becoming more common for adults to be diagnosed as being on the spectrum due to a better understanding of the disorder. It explains a lot of things but I was in my 30s when I found out so I don‚Äôt let it define me.

A little over a year ago my mother in law started to see a man casually and it recently developed into something serious. Her SO has children from previous relationships, one of which is also autistic. Let‚Äôs call him Doug. Doug is 12. Despite me being twenty plus years older, my MIL has been pressuring me to hang out with Doug.

My MIL is usually well intentioned, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I think she has such a desire to be seen as a kind hearted person that she loses sight of certain things. Like the fact that a man in his early 30s just hanging out with a 12 year old would look kind of weird.

It isn‚Äôt even that I‚Äôm opposed to being around him. He‚Äôs a really good kid, smart and respectful and pretty good at Smash Bros. It‚Äôs just that the only reason my MIL is pushing for this is that we are both autistic. I also can‚Äôt help but feel she wants to look good for her SO.

993,Not the A-hole,"obligatory i‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for the formatting. 

so the gist of it is that i‚Äôm on vacation in mexico with my family. i went to my cousin‚Äôs house and noticed she had two adorable chihuahuas, which i obviously immediately got to playing with. 

my cousin told me they were her bothers‚Äô dogs, one from my aunt that passed away and the other from a litter his aunt gave him. right off the bat it was sketchy. they aren‚Äôt allowed inside the house (first one was until cousin‚Äôs brother got the second on a whim, then he kicked her out to the yard) which chihuahuas are definitely not supposed to be outside dogs. second their water bowl was filthy. i mean FILTHY with green grime/mold growing INSIDE the bowl. as soon as i stepped outside the dogs got insanely happy. one of them wouldn‚Äôt stop asking for pets and climbing all over me. 

i left it at that and over the three days i‚Äôve visited i‚Äôve played with one of them (the other‚Äôs VERY shy and flinched when i touched her, i don‚Äôt want to overwhelm her) and noticed his nails were EXTREMELY long. like, almost digging into his paw pads long. it had rained two days ago, and the wet groggy dog food was still on the ground (they don‚Äôt have a bowl), meaning they haven‚Äôt been checked in on in two days.

i asked my cousin and she told me her brother paid absolutely no attention to them. they don‚Äôt have their shots or dewormer and never get socialized. they also don‚Äôt even have collars or leashes and never leave the tiny space of yard they‚Äôre in. she tried to help them but he threatened her, and her parents aren‚Äôt dog people. 
he got the second dog on a whim. he also had a falcon before which died within a week because he forgot to feed it (the maid feeds the dogs and apparently not too often) as well as a cobra as a first time snake owner. he also has a cat which he also got on a whim and pays no attention to. she‚Äôs constantly meowing for food and attention and also not allowed inside. 

my cousin saw me infatuated with one of the dogs and asked me to take him. she told me that if i asked her parents they‚Äôd 99% say yes, and that her brother wouldn‚Äôt even notice he was gone till one month later. 

i talked to my parents about it and they said it would be a bitch move to take the dog without asking the owner, my cousin‚Äôs brother, but i think otherwise.
he‚Äôs essentially neglecting the dogs, which is animal cruelty. to me it‚Äôs the equivalent of watching a child get neglected and doing nothing about it just because ‚Äòit‚Äôs not your child‚Äô. it doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs it is to me, it‚Äôs still a LIVING BEING, which i value over a 25 year old man‚Äôs temper tantrum.

996,No A-holes here,"This all happened today. I am 18F and babysit a 2 year old girl, I'll call her Bailey in this post. Every afternoon Bailey and I go to the park, walk through town, look at books at the library, walk home. The park is by the high school where my boyfriend 17M goes. He normally has football practice in the afternoon but today I knew he was walking to an appointment after school. I texted him that Bailey and I were at the park if he'd like to say hello on his way by (he's heard about her a lot). He stopped by for about five minutes. The three of us played on the swings and slides like normal and then he had to get to his appointment and Bailey and I kept playing.

When Bailey and I got home from our walk her mom said to me, ""Tell me about your afternoon."" I gave her the recap but did not mention seeing my bf as it was an inconsequential five minutes of a five hour shift with Bailey. She then said, ""I drove by the park today and saw a man playing with you and my daughter. Please explain."" I told her the exact truth: ""My boyfriend was walking by the park on his way downtown and stopped by for a couple of minutes. He has little siblings and is great with kids. We were never anywhere private with Bailey, just in public at the park."" She asked, ""Did you tell him to come there?"" I told her that I did let him know we were there.

She then told me to leave. On my walk home I got a text saying ""Thank you for your time with Bailey. We no longer require your services.""

Clearly to her I did something wrong. I am embarrassed by how this played out but I am not positive what to think overall. AITA in this situation? My boyfriend is a minor, not even a grown man, and he wouldn't hurt a fly. Also I would never invite my bf or anybody else into Bailey's home nor take Bailey into anyone else's home. I fully value her safety. I am totally willing to be wrong here and obviously this is a learning experience but I want to get some outside commentary. Thanks.

Another edit: This is a small, pleasant weather town (hence the walking everywhere). Bailey and I run into friends and family all the time when we are out.

999,Not the A-hole,"My grandmother is 90, blind, & has congestive heart failure & dementia.

For the last 4-5 years I've been living in her basement to keep an eye on her & help out, & I also pay all utilities. I can afford to live on my own but stay because she can't be alone. The last time we left her alone, she was in the hospital in less than 2 wks & nearly died because she failed to take her medications & didn't eat more than Cheetos.

She stays at my parents' house every night, but she comes to her house during the day. My parents are medical professionals (one of whom has expertise in heart failure) so they are able to provide medical care, but she refuses help and ignores advice, stating that she knows her body better than they do.

The hospital visit mentioned above happened in January. She had pneumonia & didn't tell us she was sick. We checked on her daily, but she would always just say she had a head cold & would pretend that she was feeling fine other than the sniffles. 

We knew it was worse (for context, she's blind because she didn't tell us she was having vision issues), but there's a fine line between respecting your family member's wishes & forcing medical treatment upon them. 

Her ""head cold"" got to the point where she collapsed on me & lost consciousness for around 45-60 seconds. She spent the next 2 weeks in hospital.

Ironically, she hates doctors & thinks they're scam artists (she is also of the ""I'm sick because my faith isn't strong enough"" variety), so she has specifically told my parents that she never wants to see any doctors. They make her go for routine visits, but that's pretty much it.

Since that incident, her dementia has taken a nosedive. Today, she accused my father of being possessed by a demon & mere minutes later denied saying it. This past weekend, she accused me of messing with her CD player (I didn't), & when I refused to come upstairs & fix it due to me being sick with a stomach bug, she said, ""I don't care if you're sick. You need to fix what you messed up."" I did not go upstairs & let my father know about the issue. He spoke to her, & apparently she felt badly about how she acted, but instead of apologizing, she fasted for 4 days so she could ""get closer to God.""

She's hateful & manipulative, paranoid, obstinate, & deceitful, & my family & I are at our wit's end.

Except my Dad is determined to care for her. He & my Mom have been fighting recently about the situation, & we're all exhausted & frustrated. He doesn't think of it in those terms, however, because it's his mother, which is absolutely fair & legitimate.

So here's where WIBTA comes in. After a particularly heinous few weeks of my grandmother being absolutely impossible, we have planned a family meeting this Saturday to discuss options. I am planning to suggest a nursing home, but as this ultimately is not my decision to make I'm a bit reticent to say anything for fear of coming off as disrespectful.

1000,Not the A-hole,"My uncle has late stage cancer, and it will likely be terminal in the fairly near future.

I visited my uncle two months ago at the hospital, and he asked to speak with me alone, explicitly asking his wife, and others, to leave the room, and told me about some assets that he solely owned (\~$1-2 million in the form of apartment units) that he wanted my help dealing with so they could be put to best benefit our whole family.

In particular, he said he wanted to pay off all the student loans for his daughter and my brother (I have none), and wanted to leave some for my mom (his twin sister), as the property was inherited from their parents, and he felt he unfairly got a larger share than her, and he wanted to even it out, before leaving the rest to his wife and daughter, split equally.

A few weeks ago, I flew out to see him again, and it was the same story: he asked everyone else to leave, expressed the same wishes, and I found a good local lawyer, and offered to set up a meeting, and even cover the costs for the lawyer's time and any paperwork (despite the property, my uncle has little liquid assets and income).

Today, I flew down for the consult with the lawyer. When I got to their house to pick them up to drive to the lawyer, his wife insisted on coming, and my uncle, to my surprise, said ok.

At the lawyer's office, the story was suddenly different. After I reiterated my offer to pay at the start of the meeting, his wife did most of the talking, the story became that he would leave it all, directly, to his wife in a trust, with a clause that anything left after her passing would go to their daughter.

I didn't bring up the discrepancy beyond posing clarifying questions to give my uncle a chance to say something different. He didn't, and instead quietly agreed with how his wife had framed everything.

Afterwards, the lawyer sent over the engagement contracts, which are now sitting in all of our emails. This first meeting was the ""free consult"" and no fees have yet been incurred and I haven't yet signed anything, but everything is expected to take roughly $3k.

Now I'm considering taking back my offer to pay. I feel like this is not the same situation, and though I love my uncle, the thought of my mother and brother benefiting from this all was definitely a motivating factor for me in the first place.

WIBTA if I withdrew my offer to pay?

Separately, if I do withdraw the offer, what should I tell the lawyer about why I'm stepping back?

I don't want to poison my uncle and aunt's future discussions, but I also don't want to be an asshole to the lawyer (professional courtesy!) and not inform them of background information that might be relevant.",66,198,0.97

At one point we take it for a walk to the dog park, which she mentioned she‚Äôs done many times. I dated a girl in the past for years who had a Boston terrier, and a normal routine is the dogs all chase other dogs around.

1003,Not the A-hole,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôll make this as concise as possible.

I share an apartment with a few people. One of them (I‚Äôll call her Maria for the sake of clarity) is the reason I am posting here. She just moved in 3 months ago, the rest of us have lived here for 2ish years. She‚Äôs a mutual friend of one of my other roommates. 

I have a 4 year old chihuahua named Fruit Loop. He‚Äôs my baby boy and I am very protective of him. My roommates love him too.   

Maria is very, very obsessed with Fruit Loop. She posts him to her Instagram frequently calling him ‚Äúher baby,‚Äù is always doting on him, and has even bought him toys and treats. I appreciate her caring for Fruit Loop and none of this was an issue until recently.

Maria has been taking Fruit Loop on walks during the day while I‚Äôm at work. Fruit Loop already gets two 45 min walks a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, + lots of mental stimulation in the form of puzzles and training exercises. I feel very uncomfortable with Maria taking him out while I‚Äôm not home. She didn‚Äôt ask me if she could walk him or anything, just started doing it. One of my other roommates had to tell me bc she didn‚Äôt. She frequently takes him into town, sometimes hour or more walks, with lots of people and strange dogs. I just really don‚Äôt want other people walking my dog like that.

She also started dressing Fruit Loop in sweaters and other clothes which I absolutely HATE. And she was looking to enroll him in training classes without my consent!

I asked her to please leave Fruit Loop inside when I‚Äôm not home and stop dressing him up. She immediately got upset and told me she should be able to take him out whenever she wants. I told her no, he‚Äôs my dog and I don‚Äôt want him going out on long walks when I‚Äôm not home. She then brought up all the times she bought him toys and treats and says she‚Äôs entitled to do what she wants because of that, and said she‚Äôs like ‚Äúhis second owner.‚Äù She also said that it‚Äôs good for him and he enjoys it.

I got irritated and snapped that Fruit Loop is MY dog and I am his ONLY owner. If she‚Äôs gonna hold things she bought for Fruit Loop over my head then I told her to stop buying him things.

She got super pissed off and told me I‚Äôm being a terrible dog owner because I‚Äôm denying Fruit Loop walks and love. I told her I‚Äôm uncomfortable with how involved she‚Äôs trying to be in my dog‚Äôs life and told her she needs to back off and stop being so obsessed with him.

Petting him, playing with him, cuddling him, working on training? All good! But I feel she‚Äôs going too far with it.

1005,Not the A-hole,"My mother is wheelchair bound, and prefers to use the bathroom connected to my bedroom because it's closer to her room than the other, which is across the living room and down a hallway. Our rooms are adjacent.

She has always come through my room unannounced, throwing open the door and going past.

I've never said anything about it because, again, she's in a wheelchair and heavily disabled.

Every so often, however, she'll stop in my room and look at what I'm doing or what's around me. For example, if my desk is unkempt, or if the waste basket nearby needs to be emptied. She'll say stuff like ""Why do you let the trash reach the top?"" or ""Why is your desk so cluttered?"" or - most often - ""Why do you play games all day?""

I work from home. I pay for a lot around the house and cover every emergency expense. I paid several thousand dollars for her dentures, she immediately refused to wear them because ""they look stupid"".

So, I'm not wasting my time and I'm not ""playing games"" when she says this.

This all came to a head tonight, when she stopped in the room again, looked me over, and said the usual things. Why this, why that, why do you insist on this and that.

I asked her to leave the room, and she said no. I said I wasn't joking, and that I was actually mad, and she still said no. This went back and forth maybe ten times.

I got up to wheel her out of the room, and she immediately dropped her feet to the floor, saying ""If you push me you'll hurt my feet"", which shocked me.

I explained that this was my room, the only place I have any privacy, and she needed to respect that, to which she said I must sit back at my desk and wait for her to decide to leave.

I just yelled ""Get the fuck out"" and ""Are you stupid"" and the like. Not a good look, but if I was a saint then I wouldn't be asking ""AITA"". She said I needed to have respect, to which I said ""then don't treat your son like shit"".

She was blocking the door so I couldn't even leave the situation.

I've taken care of her since she broke her leg when I was a teenager, and this is just flat-out disgusting to me. The level of disrespect and abuse is really getting to me. This is a very unusual situation in this household, and on any other given day I'd be doing chores around the house, getting her what she wanted, making her meals, etc.

Tonight, however, I'm really just thinking she hasn't appreciated any of this and doesn't give a shit about me.

There are good times, of course, and that's what's easier to focus on, but right now I feel like I've just been fooled into thinking I had a caring parent for all of the years I've been used. Whenever we do argue, it always ends with her saying ""When you're my age, you can speak"" - which I will never be in a disagreement, meaning I'm just supposed to never disagree.

I yelled, insulted, and cursed out my own mother, but I have the natural bias that I'm NTA because I personally feel, in my mind and heart, that she deserved all of it.

We pursued different careers after college. I had a 9-5 job while she continued her career as a model.

Being extremely attractive, she attracted a lot of suitors but only entertained those with money to burn. She has become a gold-digger, to say the least. She justifies this by saying that she‚Äôs a single mom (but that‚Äôs a different story).

Last year, I had a major emergency surgery and my insurance didn‚Äôt cover everything. I tried to borrow money from her as I had to use up my savings and I will be needing to some time to recuperate. Also, I know that she shops for luxury items almost every month and she always has rich sugar daddies who provide her money. She turned down my request. She said all her money are being managed by her parents so she can‚Äôt lend me money. I know it is not true as she confessed to me (way back before I attempted to borrow) that this is her standard alibi with others who try to borrow from her. 

This year, I had a series of unfortunate incidents and bad business decisions. I tried to borrow money from her again (nothing over $3000). At first, she was half-hearted. She said ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù and might agree if there‚Äôs a loan interest which I think is reasonable. In the end, she used the same reason she‚Äôs always used.

She knows that I rarely ask for help unless I badly need it. She knows that I always pay my debt. This time, I feel like she let me down when I badly needed help. Those were the only instances I tried to borrow money from her.

Our kid‚Äôs only a month old, and she sleeps great. We‚Äôre up 2 times in the night at most which has been great. 

Every time my wife‚Äôs mother is round though, she insists on feeding her and basically taking over everything under the guise of ‚Äúoh you guys just need a break‚Äù, which we don‚Äôt but we all know she just wants to cuddle with her grandchild as much as she can.

My wife‚Äôs mother blames it on us not burping her properly, so she‚Äôs filled with gas, and this comment, quite honestly, annoys me a lot. 

We rarely ever have issues with her being gassy when we feed and burp her. It has consistently only happened whenever my MIL took over. If I were to guess, it‚Äôs probably because of how she holds her when she feeds and the fact that when our kid burps, you would know she did. My mother in law hears our kid groaning or making a noise similar to a burp and decides that she‚Äôs burped and goes on to cuddle with her (unburped) grandchild.

Now, two years later he tried to reconneect with my mom and me. Telling us via phone about ""how much he has matured"" 

Still homophobic though.

Honestly, i dont want to talk to him. Alot of my self hatred of my self through my pre and early teens came from him. Years of him making me feel like shit. 

I dont mind my mom talking to him. After all it is her son. But whenever i bring up my perspective about it, or that at least i dont want to sit and pretend that all those things never happened im told to suck it because he is family.

So reddit, lay it on me. Am i the asshole?

I work for a small privately owned company with 5 employees including me and have been able to move up very quickly by working hard and dedicating a lot of my time to going above and beyond. I‚Äôm not very social so I tend to stick to myself and mind my own business often times just listening to others problems and not discussing my own. Due to my rapid rise in the company I rightfully expected some people to not be happy and have some things to say and sure enough that was the case. I recently learned that some coworkers may be not only be saying the things I tell them to others but also twisting the truth and making ridiculous lies up about me. To test who was actually loyal or decent I told my 4 co-workers I was leaving the company and I told them all I was going to different companies.  Sure enough the guy I suspected told everyone and threw his own twist in the mix. Unbeknownst to me a guy from my job I really trusted also did the same.

So me and Alex have been friends for about 12 years, we played football together our whole lives. we went to the same schools, lived in the same neighborhood, and really did everything together for years. One fatal night I was working a late shift at my restaurant when I had received the worst phone call of my life, Alex had dove into a pond with some friends and hit his head on a rock upon jumping into the water and subsequently drowned. I spiraled into a deep depression without my best friend and am still working on myself to this day but his family dealt with it much worse eventually splitting up all together. Skip ahead 2 weeks to the day of Alex‚Äôs funeral.¬† His family said their piece and invited me and my mother to the podium to speak about Alex. I gave a 5 minute speech about everything we went through as best friends and how appreciative of the time I got with him I was. After I spoke they let anyone come up and say their piece as well so our coach spoke, some of our teammates spoke, and then I see a girl I knew from school but wasn‚Äôt very fond of come up and speak, enter April.¬†
April approaches the podium bawling her eyes out and then goes on to say they were in love and they were so close and how she‚Äôll never get over this and even told fake stories of their intimacy and ‚Äúcrazy adventures‚Äù they had together. Knowing Alex spoke to her once over DM and on occasion in passing at school, I became enraged. Alex was my best friend we talked about everything I knew every girl he was intimate with and every little detail of his love life as he knew mine. Alex never liked her and even made a comment to me once about how fake she is for Instagram and how she over exaggerates everything for attention ( she would make videos of her crying anytime a tragedy would occur on the news and say she just wanted to die because the world was too tough). Anyway, after the ceremony she approached me and told me we all love him dearly and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll miss him as much as you do... IF NOT MORE‚Äù.

1027,Not the A-hole,"Me and my fiance went over her brothers last week and her brother had a gun of guns. I told him I was uncomfortable around guns because I grew up in a neighborhood that had a lot of gun violence and I would prefer if they didn't shoot any of them near me. One of them asked 'why it was so bad', and I told them how bad my old neighborhood was. I also mentioned I saw a drive by shooting when I was 12 that hit a guy and killed him. My fiance sort of looked at me and said ""how come you never told me this?"" and I just said it never crossed my mind, and it was such a brief moment that I never thought it was a big deal. She was sour with me the entire night. At the end of the night, she asked me kind of angrily why I never told her that I saw someone get shot. I told her I never really thought it was a big deal and that it didn't affect me much because it was such a quick moment, and that I only found out he died the next day. She was quiet for a while, then asked again basically saying that its crazy I wouldn't think its a big deal to tell her something like that. She said that I could have PTSD and I need therapy and that she feels uncomfortable at the idea that I wouldn't tell her such a 'major part of my life' like that before we got married. Honestly, I just never thought about it that much. Some part of me thinks I shouldn't have even mentioned it at the table. 

&#x200B;

We've been arguing a bit on and off about this. She feels like she might have potentially married a traumatized person who was hiding their trauma, and that she feels like I have been dishonest with her on purpose, and she wants me to go to therapy. The thing is, she knew where I came from and how bad my neighborhood was. Seeing one guy get shot briefly was not the defining moment of the problems back then. I've also been to therapy for anxiety and she knows this, and I told her that I have mentioned my background, and she said I specifically need to see a trauma specialist. 

&#x200B;

I refused, almost on principle. Some part of me was kind of upset that I had this suburban wealthy girl telling me what is and what is not traumatizing about growing up in a high crime area. I know that sounds harsh, but the way she talks about it sometimes kinds of makes me think she views me as an inherently damaged person because of my upbringing and that nobody could possibly ever get past it.

1028,Not the A-hole,"My child is 5 years old and in a special ed kindergarten class (public school). He is not potty trained yet, and wears pull-ups at school. I send pull-ups to school for him to be changed into when necessary, they let me know when they need more.

Since school has started my child has come home a handful of time in a different brand of pull-ups. I buy one of the more expensive brands of pull-ups because I don't care for the way the other brands feel. It's just my choice. Anyway, they have sent him home in different brands (cheaper ones) and I'm a little irritated by it. With as often as I send them pull-ups, I can only think that another child is getting the ones I send in.

My husband is angry about this and demanded that I call and ensure this stops. I don't know the price differences off the top of my head, but some brands are significantly cheaper. So, why should my child get sent home in cheaper ones when we are constantly supplying the school with our brand of choice? Am I worrying too much about this? (Note: I haven't decided if I'm going to call or not. I'm pretty torn.)

tl;dr My child school is sending him home in cheaper pull-ups than we supply them with. WIBTA if I call and tell them to only us the pull-ups we send for him?

EDIT 1: I have decided to ask my son's teacher if I am not sending enough pull-ups to school for him. I don't intend to say anything else about it. I may buy cheaper ones to send to school, haven't decided on that. Reading through all the comments (sorry I couldn't reply to everyone) I've come to feel that isn't as big of a deal as I originally thought. There aren't any allergy concerns or sensory issues with the other brands. As for my husband, he IS an asshole, so I'm just not going to bring it up with him.

EDIT 2: I realize that my concern sounds a little crazy to a lot of people. My son is autistic and can't tell me how he feels about pretty much anything. I try to use my best judgement when choosing things, like pull-ups, for him. For perspective (especially for those who aren't well versed with Autism) my son has accidentally cut himself, bled profusely, and didn't make a peep about it.

I ask him why he is moaning our cats name and he says it was just an accident. I ask some of his friends if he knows anyone names Lucy and discover that is a coworker of his that I didn‚Äôt know he had. I talk to her and find out they have been cheating for the whole time we‚Äôve had the cat. He literally got me a cat and named it after her so he would have an alibi if he accidentally said her name. I told her that he was my boyfriend and she didn‚Äôt believe me so I showed her some pictures of us together and she started crying saying that she didn‚Äôt know he was dating anyone. I told her that I was sorry and that it wasn‚Äôt her fault but I‚Äôm glad we found this out. I kick my boyfriend out for cheating and he moves in with his brother. He tries to take the cat that he gave me. I don‚Äôt feel that he should get the pet since he didn‚Äôt buy it out of love but only as a cover for his cheating and I‚Äôve been the one taking Lucy to all her vet checkups and buying all her food and toys and everything.

Edit: I‚Äôll try and answer the most common questions. 
- I don‚Äôt think he planned to moan the cats name during sex, he has called me Lucy before in casual conversation and I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because of the cat. 
- I did try to tell him the cat was a gift but he started spamming me with messages and since he knows where I live and work I didn‚Äôt want him to start stalking me since he was showing signs of that. Once I told him the cat ran away he got mad and now doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore since it‚Äôs my fault I lost the cat. So now I can just take care of my cat without worrying about him showing up unannounced

1037,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I'm quite sure I'm in the wrong but I still want some opinions.

I (35f) love my husband (37). A year ago his grandfather who he was very close to died. He's never been the same since.  I tried to help him through this time the best I could and it seemed like he was slowly getting better. But something was off. About 5 months ago I discovered he developed a drinking problem. I confronted him but told him I support him, that's it's an illness and we're gonna get through this together. I thought he'd get out of it at first but really it's just been all lies since. 

 A while ago he started going out and getting smashed at the pub almost every  night. Quite often he forgets his keys but he usually gets home around 4am. He then yells drunkenly and rings the doorbell until I get up and open the door for him. I can't just leave the door unlocked for him as we have one of these doors that are automatically locked from outside when they close. 
I've told him countless times to take his keys with him but he rarely does it.
I'm a pediatrician so I need to be rested. 

So last night he did it again. He left at around 9. I saw his keys on the table. I tried to call him but no answer. I then texted him and said that I'd be awake until midnight then I'd go to bed and not open the door. He didn't come home so I disabled the door bell and went to sleep. I did however leave a swag in the backyard. When I woke up this morning I had about 30 missed calls and lots of indecipherable messages on my phone. I went to have a look and sa6my husband nearly passed out on the swag. I helped him inside, made sure he was alright and then left for work.  
I'm drained and exhausted and I will probably have to leave the love of my life.
I think I did this to just get some sleep but I also hoped it would be a wakeup call. But I have doubts now. AITA?

Edit: I saw a few people were concerned that I'm only enabling but not helping. I would just like to add some info. 
Just after his grandfather's death he started therapy. I went with him every 2 week so I could learn how to help him as well.  After  while my husband said I don't need to come anymore and he just uses his sessions to keep his mind focused. I accepted that but made it clear to him and the therapist that I'd be there within 10 minutes if needed. 
Then when I found out about his alcoholism I referred him to some of the best addiction therapists I know, I stopped drinking alcohol myself and made sure we keep clear of events with social pressure to drink ( hard in Australia). When it got worse I asked him if rehab was an option and he said yes so he went to a rehab clinic. He left after less than a week cause he felt babied. We looked for another one with a different approach but he was kicked out of that one because he managed to smuggle in some beers. We talked heaps and I made sure he knows I still love him and he promised to get better and give his best. 
Through my professional I know some sober alcoholics. So I organised for them to meet and talk, hoping it could help. But it didn't. 
Also I'm not going to divorce him over this. I'm talking about a separation so we can both get our shit together again and I'm not even sure I'm gonna do that.",96,344,0.93

My brothers and I found out that our dad (who recently passed away) left us with documents, notes and diaries that contain over 300 years of our family history, dating back to 1713. He wanted us to go public with everything but the choice has to be ours and all three of us have to be on board with it. There are 32 documents, 64 notes and 8 diaries along with other incomplete writings, personal items and photographs that contain over 300 years worth of information. All of it is extremely valuable in terms of history but it's also very tragic. 

There are documents, starting with a letter from 1788. that our ancestor wrote to (presumably) his son about 3 (possibly child) slaves he had traded and ending with the documents that our dad believed were written and intended for the 1850 census. It was a ''slave schedule'' of 14 people that only had their gender written down and approximate age for some of them who were the youngest. We have evidence that our ancestors owned 64 slaves between 1788. and possibly 1850.

Given that we don't have a solid timeline of slave ownership, we only have incomplete data from paper trails, the number is likely much higher than 64.
In his findings, our dad noted that based on the wealth timeline (how it changed over the decades) and property ownership of our family, that number could be well over 100 in the 1713. to 1865. period. My oldest brother is against us going public because of the political and racial climate today, he has two kids in college and he doesn't want them to become targets of misunderstanding or to be labeled and characterized as something they're not over their family history. My younger brother wants us to go public with this because he recognizes the historical value of these findings but more importantly, because it could possibly help the descendants of slaves trace their lineage and know their history.

I still don't know where I stand. I know that my decision is key because I can talk to my oldest brother and possibly change his mind about his decision, I just don't know if I want to do that. I feel like a hypocrite because I think of myself aa a fighter for human rights and equality and now that I actually have a chance at making things better, I'm hesitating. If we go public with this, if we donate everything we have, our names will forever be tied to this. I'm afraid I could lose my job. Based on our dad's findings, we are positive that there would be media coverage. There is valuable information that relates to 2 particularly known figures as well as political writings and details about other family names and companies.

Edited to add: I don‚Äôt purposely misgender my ex. I suck at pronouns and if anyone points out to me where I made a mistake, I am happy to go fix it. I included both pronouns in my original story for clarity. 

My ex-husband and I only got married because he knocked me up. We tried to make it work but I‚Äôm a bitch and he‚Äôs a serial cheater, so after 5 years we threw in the towel. 

After the divorce, I got custody of the kids via the decree and he got visitation. He moved to Another state about 6 hours away and proceeded to ignore us, get high, and have a sex change.

Ex would come back into our lives occasionally to call CPS on me because my son was walking our dog and the dog pulled him too hard and he fell down, or because I expect the kids to do chores around the house like put dishes in the dishwasher and take out the trash. None of these reports have ever led to anything, but we do have a pretty big file with the department of family services because of it. 

Last year, ex and his(her) new girlfriend decided to become more active in the kids‚Äô lives. My daughter is now 13 and wants nothing to do with her dad, but my son is 11 and is excited that his dad is actually showing interest in him. Son got a tablet with Skype and now dad video calls EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. So from 1-2 contacts a year to at least once a day. For several hours. 

Today, son and I were home sick with strep throat and dad calls. Son picks up (is laying in bed next to me watching TV together) and dad says ‚Äúshow me your house‚Äù.   

I was super put off by this because I feel like this is my personal space and if I wanted my ex husband in it, I would invite him (her). But it‚Äôs my kid‚Äôs house too, so I didn‚Äôt say anything and let him show our (dirtier than normal) house. WIBTA if I told him not to do that anymore and to only video call dad if he‚Äôs in his room?  It feels like an invasion of space on my part, but I could just be biased because I despise my ex and I definitely don‚Äôt want to show that to my kids.

TL;DR: ex husband asked my kid to show him my house via video call.  I don‚Äôt want him to.",110,123,0.86

1047,Asshole,"Not using my regular account because there are identifying details about me on there.

I've been married to my husband for just over a year and dating him for just over two. He has a daughter from his first marriage, Ali, who is 11. Up until recently Ali has been staying with us three nights a week and alternate weekends but she's been getting more and more difficult to deal with. 

She started acting out just after the wedding and her behaviour just keeps getting worse. She doesn't listen to me at all; if I ask her to tidy her room or brush her teeth she'll always respond with in a minute or similar things but not actually do it until my husband tells her to. She won't acknowledge me as her step mother at all, she only ever refers to me by name if she's asked who I am, if she's absolutely pushed to describe who I am in relation to her she says I'm her dad's wife. I've tried so hard to connect with her, I've invited her on shopping trips or to go out for food but she always rebuffs my offers. She often answers back to me and my husband and will be snappy and moody in general a lot of the time.

In the last few months my husband and I have been talking about trying for our own baby but the atmosphere and stress surrounding the house on days Ali is here are starting to worry me. I struggle to cope with her behaviour now, being pregnant is only going to make it harder. 

So my husband and I discussed it and decided it would be better to cut down on some of Ali's time with us. Instead of three days every week and alternate weekends we agreed to three weekdays one week then the weekend of the following week then back to three weekdays the week after that and so on. It's not a huge reduction but it will really lighten the load for me.

My husband talked to Ali's mother about this and she is furious. She called me some horrible names and blamed me for everything, she even accused me of trying to push Ali out of the picture to create my own perfect little family which is completely untrue.

My husband is on my side but is scared of fighting his ex. I don't think what I'm asking for is unreasonable but a friend said maybe I need to try a think about it from Ali and her mother's perspective. Am I being unreasonable about this?",1729,3966,0.87

I am pained that these folks are experiencing a situation where they need to ask for assistance this way, but I'm also deeply concerned that in the middle of a school day, school-aged children are wandering the parking lots as well, asking for food along with what appears to be their parents or guardians.

I DO NOT want to split up any family that does not need to be split up, but I've seen some of these families multiple times during school days and school hours, asking for money and food. I'm super conflicted - I want those kids to be in a safer, healthier environment like a nearby public school, but I don't want a call to CPS or the cops to potentially ruin a family's life.

Her father is not physically abusive, but mentally and emotionally. He doesn‚Äôt show her much respect and favours her siblings (none of whom live at home). He is away a lot for work, so she only lives with him 1-2 weeks a month, but she often tries to stay out of the house to limit arguing.

About a year ago I rented a room in my flat out to her. It wasn‚Äôt terrible but she never paid rent on time, up to a week late sometimes. She was clean and otherwise respectful apart from using too much heating and hot water (bills were included). After four months she moved back in with her dad. I suspect this is because he threatened to cut her off (she gets a VERY large allowance from him) and she couldn‚Äôt pay rent. Generally she is very irresponsible with money. 

We grew apart for unrelated reasons and are now trying to rekindle our relationship. She has asked me to be a reference for her new flat and I stupidly agreed without giving it much thought. The estate agent has sent me some questions and a lot of them pertain to reliability and paying rent.

WIBTA if I was honest and therefore she might risk losing the flat and have to stay with her dad?",63,30,0.81

So I have grown up with people constantly misreading my name when they read it out loud, or ridicule me for spelling my name the way I do.

During my lunch break I went to a restaurant and they asked for my name. I told them and the cashier asked if it was spelled one of the two most common ways to spell it. I told him it doesn‚Äôt matter how he spells it, as long as they can read it. He seemed really irritated that I wouldn‚Äôt just spell my name for him and he didn‚Äôt write a name down.

1055,Not the A-hole,"I got to a cancer center. I don‚Äôt have any active cancer or anything. I did last year but it was removed. I am fine now but require follow ups. 

I have health insurance but have a speciality co pay that is quite high. It cost me a whole day of work to see them one time. They both wanted me to see them for just blood work and a check up every three weeks. No feasible on my salary with my insurance. I tried to negotiate to maybe every 3 months since I am not requiring active/actual treatment. I should mention this isn‚Äôt an in and out visit. Because they are treating active cancer patients it isn‚Äôt uncommon for me to wait 2 to 3 hours after arriving to even be seen by them. Which was an issue because I have very finite time off now that I have run out of FMLA. 

We disagreed and they both decided they couldn‚Äôt see me if I didn‚Äôt follow their suggested plan of care. One doctor implied I had no idea what I needed and it made me angry. He kept telling me to stay off the internet because they knew better but I never even brought the internet up. This was solely about how I couldn‚Äôt afford the many visit they wanted for just the follow ups. 

I had a really bad experience with a nurse who was upset that I had to leave after waiting 3 hours to see the doctor. She was rude and condescending. 

I found another clinic to treat me and although they aren‚Äôt as great, they are faster to see me and are willing to see me when I can afford to be seen. 

The previous cancer center reached out and asked me to review them on a public 3rd party website. They also wanted to know if I would do their spotlight since I was one of their more well known cancer patients (I work in an art and fundraising  industry and hosted and brought together a large art community on my town to do a fundraiser/ awareness event with them after I had been diagnosed). I gave a honest review about how I felt pressured to see them more than I could afford after my active treatment was over and how I felt really upset that they were unwilling to listen to me. 

I‚Äôve also been advising my friends in the community about my experience. 

It has been heavily implied that the nurse who was rude to me is no longer employed. Likely not because of what I said but I don‚Äôt know for sure.

1056,Not the A-hole,"So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

After class we got to talking about who's doing what, how much pages we're all gonna do (it's a 10 pager, so we all took on the responsibility of 3, and I took on the extra paper). Dialogue goes like this:

""Well I don't think X would do a good job of doing the paper and I think we may need to do his part""

Me: Why?

Him: ""Well, I think he has autism or something""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I don't think that's an excuse for us to do his share of the work.""

Him: ""Why wouldn't it be an excuse?""

Me: ""Well, if he's functioning enough to participate, attend, and take notes in this class, then he should be functioning enough that he could do his own work. If he can't, we definitely need to let the professor know (not only because that's what she said to do, but because we either need to arrange a way to get this thing done or maybe it just needs to be the 3 of us and the other guy could do a different assignment or something)""

Him: What do you know anyway? You don't have--

So I cut him off and said that I do. And I 
*truly* do. I'm just really high on the spectrum, plus I was diagnosed really late as an adult so you won't see or notice any of my little quirks unless you hang out with me for a while and they start to ""push through"". 
I think the most that the public would see from me would be me reacting to a sensory issue or stimming.

The other guy on the other hand, you can definitely notice that he's nuerogivergent. Speaks to himself loudly, have laughing outbursts at really inappropriate times in class, etc.

I wasn't trying to make this into a debate or anything on who has the worse autism or what autism is, but I just felt like it shouldn't be an excuse. 
Nbd I thought until he quickly and bluntly said:

""You don't have autism. You *don't* have autism. Who diagnosed you? What did they say??""

So I told him, ""Mind your fucking business. It's called a spectrum disorder for a reason, and I don't have to tell you *jackshit* about my diagnoses. Anyway  I'll be willing to HELP him with his part as long as he asks in a timely manner, but I definitely would NOT be doing someone else's work for them""

He was obviously taken aback, so I just continued, ""Look, if you and the other guy wanna do his part, then totally fine by me. Not my business I have like 2 other big projects to do for this semester, so I don't have time for it. I just need you to promise that you would do what you say you would do because I don't want it to be a situation where y'all are way too swamped later in the year and we don't have our stuff ready"".

I‚Äôm a young (22M) guy who loves to dance and go clubbing. At these clubs and dance floors, they get really loud and crowded and frequently you have to ‚Äúlightly‚Äù push your way through to get through the crowd. 

When I‚Äôm trying to get through women, I generally put my hand on the small of their back and push from there. I do this because I feel like its gives me good leverage to get them out of my way and quickly and as smoothly as possible. I stay well clear of the girl‚Äôs ass and never have my hand there longer than I need to.

I would do this to men too honestly, however I‚Äôm bi and live in a conservative area and am extra paranoid about provoking a guy into a fight cuz he thought I was hitting on him. So I usually push them with my forearm and a much more aggressive to get through. 

Recently I was talking about this and a good friend of mine, told me that this was shitty of me and that girl‚Äôs don‚Äôt like being touched there at all.

We smoked a bit and just caught up.

After a couple of months I kinda got in the mood to play it again and asked him if I could get it back. He said he is sorry, but his dog chewed it up and it was destroyed. He then offered to pay me back. So no harm, no foul, he gives me sixty bucks right then and there and I stay to hang out with him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward about a week and me and him are hanging out again, going to a few stops we usually go to, to look at games or movies etc. Where I found a copy of the game for $20. So I buy it.

I have been with my girlfriend for about 9 years, she is 24, I am 25, so we started dating in highschool and have been together eversince, as a result the moment I got my own student appartement several years ago, I asked her to move in with me and she did, about a week or 3 in she bought a 2 year old German shepherd for the both of us without informing me, I was very happy about this and me and him quickly became best friends, unfortunately he passed away 2 months ago.

2 days ago my girlfriend came home with a new dog, a small dachshund and while it seems like a nice dog I told her to take it back to the pound right away, let me explain why.

When we had the German shepherd my girlfriend did nothing for him aside from petting him, she would not take him for walks, train him, feed him etc, untop of that she did not pay for anything I got stuck with massive vet bills especially near the end while she would spend her money on clothes and shit, she also never paid for dog food, toys etc etc.

As such the moment she came in with a new dog I told her to take it back, I love having a dog but if I am going to pay for everything and take care of it I am not going to let her pick the dog, also I dont appreciate having it sprung on me essentially ""Hey I bought us a dog now you take all the responsibility for it untop of your full time job!""

Now my girlfriend is gutted and crying saying she was doing something nice because I missed our dog and she really likes this dog, but I told her quite bluntly that she didnt take care of our previous dog, she took none of the financial responsibilities and she did not discuss this with me and if I want a new a dog I'll pick it myself given I will be the one taking care of it and paying for it anyway.

Well now she is not speaking with me and is refusing to take the dog back and what I was afraid of has already happened, these past 2 days guess who has been taking care of the dog?
I am getting pissed beyond belief at this point, on the other hand she obviously feels strongly about this and my own family is telling me I need to let up, but I dont want too, I dont want to have to pay for vet expenses, I dont want to buy everything else, I dont want to take care of this dog, but I am also not a monster I cant exactly let it starve.

Good news ladies and gents! Some of you may remember my previous post , if not read it bc it‚Äôs hilarious and has a cute cat.

The news: Our boy Nelson has found his furever home!

He got adopted 8 days ago and I‚Äôve been waiting so see if it stuck before posting. Nelson become a top priority to adopt out as he was one of our most difficult but favorite cats we took care of.

He become pet of the month and got the attention of an older gentleman who came in- get this- with a printed out copy of our Facebook post. It was very adorable of him. This man automatically took us as a great candidate for Nelson, since he was an experienced cat owner. He had a bit of a sad story, his wife passed last year and their 18 year old tabby passed away 4 months ago. He was very lonely and wanted to get a new friend but didn‚Äôt want to get a young cat. He is older and doesn‚Äôt have the energy to take care of a demanding cat. 

Nelson was absolutely perfect. I have seen very very heart warming moments with pets and their new families but this one was a top. As you guys may remember Nelson is a cranky asshole that you can‚Äôt help but love. He‚Äôs not really nice and he is stand off ish but I shut you not when we brought him into the meeting room he PRANCED OVER TO THE MAN AND HOPPED UP ONTO HIS LAP. My jaw almost hit the floor.

After 30 minutes if Nelson going ap shit over this man he was adopted and went off to his new home. 
The man has sent us photos and updates of Nelson since then and it seems to be going very very well. I guess he speaks cat. 

I won‚Äôt be posting photos as the man is in them and ya know, I‚Äôm trying to not get in trouble at work again. 

Thank you guys for being Nelson‚Äôs biggest fans and I‚Äôm so stoked that both of them got a happy ending together

1069,Not the A-hole,"So a few weeks ago my mother and father got a divorce. In all honesty I knew the divorce was coming for a long time, probably since i was little. They fought and argued a lot all the time and barely talked outside of that. 

So when the divorce finalized my mom and dad had one more fight before she was set to move out and go in with her best friend. Apparently my dad had called me and her entitled (which is fine I don't really mind that) and that pissed her off pretty bad. So he texted me a little after warning me that he pissed her off and said something that might make her mad at me. So instead of waiting i decided to give her a call. 

During the call she mentioned that he said that both me and my brother had known about the divorce officially from him for a few years. (They both would separately talk to us about their problems with the other so it wasn't new) On top of the fact that we would tell him the stuff she would say about him. (They were both known to also kind of bash the other)

She said she had felt like me and my little brother were betraying her or like she had no one to talk to because someone would just tell dad. She wasn't wrong, but honestly when we had to hear how much she hated him or whatever other thing he did to piss her off it kind of wears you out. 

Side note: My little brother is a huge momma's boy and so it took him till he was 17 to finally break down. He started to have nightmares about all the anger he felt around her due to how much she tells him. 

So I tried to tell her that me and him didn't do this on purpose to try and hurt her. My brother especially never wanted to but everyone has their breaking point. 

Now time for the part i feel kind of bad for, so this may be a very clear judgement on me. At some point during the call i asked her if i could be honest about how i felt about it all. So i told her that from a certain point in my life I wasn't able to feel that ""love"" or connection kids have with their parents. That the reason she used to ask where her happy little boy went was because the fact for whatever reason i couldn't feel anything towards her or my dad. Not because they are bad parents, but as a couple they were just toxic for each other. 

I know it hurt her and i tried to reassure her that this was how i felt about both her and my dad and that he doesn't even know this because i dont want to tell him.

For some context, my husband (30m) and I (28f) recently moved back to our hometown to buy a house. After living alone together for 5ish years, we are bouncing back and forth between our parents (mine 80%/his 20%) while we wait to close.  Previously, we had a TINY bedroom with the bed pushed against the wall. As I usually went to work later than him/didn‚Äôt read on my phone in bed, he got the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù and I slept against the wall. 

Last year I started a new job where I am up and out of the house over an hour before he gets out of bed.  At our last house, I stayed on the inside just out of comfort/he liked to be next to the outlet to charge/read on his phone. When we moved in with my folks (and his) the beds were in the normal, middle of the wall arrangement with outlets on both sides. I started to sleep on the right side and he took the left. It‚Äôs been this way for a few months now and I have gotten quite used to it. Also, at my folks there‚Äôs a long table next to the right hand side, I have a power strip with some USB spots for my phone, Alexa, watch chargers, lamp, etc. 

Flash forward to last night, it‚Äôs our first night back at my parents after spending over a week at his house sitting. It‚Äôs after midnight, I have to be up at 6:30 so I head to bed while he stays up. At 2:30 in the morning I am abruptly woken up with a hand in my armpit (side note, very ticklish) because darling husband is trying to roll me over so he can use the outlet and sleep on the right side.  At that point I refused to move over because:
1. I had been asleep for a few hours on that side. He knew it as he came in to say good night and offered to turn off the lamp.
2. There‚Äôs an outlet on the other side and he was acting like a child when having to walk to the other room to grab a power cube (but he HAD already grabbed his cord).
3. He woke me up by touching my armpit and that‚Äôs just not cool. 
4. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmy side‚Äù. (I know it‚Äôs petty, but thought I throw it in for arguments sake). 

Husband was not impressed by my stubbornness and proceeded to watch videos of his phone to fall asleep (he does this often, but usually turns it off if I request it).  Last night, he held his ground and ignored me, saying I was being the rude one for not accommodating his ‚Äúrequest‚Äù for the right side and this proceeded to watch YouTube.

Yesterday my boss walks in and tells me she's leaving for the week and that we need to get on top of our shit because the GM/owner of the restaurant is gonna be on our asses for the next week and isn't afraid to fire anybody on the spot while she's gone.

I just said ok, but I want to explain that the job she's giving me is not worth 13 d/h, it's not even worth 15 d/h. She wants me to work manager's hours with manager's authority for less than a dishwasher makes at the other bars in town. I've been offered other jobs for more money and less responsibility, I just don't want to let my friends down or leave them behind...",32,48,0.79
1077,Not the A-hole,"To start off my great-grandmother (Granny) passed away in 2011 she was in her early 80‚Äôs. She had 2 children my Grandmother and my Great-Uncle. She divorced their father in the 50‚Äôs and did the single mom thing in a time where it was uncommon. Then met and married my Great-Grandfather (Pop) in the early 70‚Äôs. When she passed she left bother her children a ring. My great-uncle got the ring from her marriage to his father and my Grandmom got the ring from her marriage to (Pop)

I always loved the ring and asked that when my grandmother passed it be left to me. My Pop said he would be okay with that and my grandmom agreed. I would always clean the ring when I visited and it made me feel very close to my Granny just caring for it. While my grandmom just left it sit in the jewelry box. 

Fast forward 3 years and me and my boyfriend start talking marriage. I ask my Pop if he would be okay with me using my Granny‚Äôs ring and he was happy with the idea but said I needed to ask my grandmom because it‚Äôs technically hers now. I asked my grandmom and she hesitantly gave it to me and made an off hand comment about giving her money for it one day. 

5 years later I take the ring in to be professionally cleaned and re-dipped as it was a white gold ring and was starting to show the golden color from constant wear. When I pick it up the jeweler said that it was a very beautiful marquis diamond and most she‚Äôs seen aren‚Äôt as nice as mine. She told me to get it appraised and insured because it‚Äôs probably worth about 2000.

I tell my grandmom and she gets nasty and says and ‚ÄúYou never even paid me for it! You better give me some money for it.‚Äù

So AITA is I don‚Äôt give my grandmom money for a ring she would never have used or sold and would have eventually been mine anyway?",50,115,0.95

1083,Asshole,"I (57) have a great relationship with my son (20) who is currently away studying at college. 

He has a large gap between his two front teeth, but otherwise his teeth are very nice and completely straight. We never ~~bothered~~ thought to get him braces growing up, and it never seemed to be an issue to him. However, a few months ago he began saying that he would like to get his teeth fixed.

His mother and I were completely supportive, and were willing to pay to have them fixed since he is a college student and has no income. The orthodontist ran through the options with my son of braces (~$4000) or Invisalign (~$7000).

I do well financially, and would be able to afford either without any significant problem, but would still be very reluctant to spend an extra $3000 where it is not necessary. That amount of money would not greatly affect my life, but I am not wealthy to the point that it would be trivial.

I told my son that I would be willing to pay for braces, but not Invisalign. My line of reasoning was that this is a cosmetic problem, not medical, and I am still willing to pay for it, but only at the more reasonable price.

My son says that he is extremely self-conscious about his teeth, and would be even more self-conscious for the (approximately) year that he would have the braces. Roughly in his words: ""I can't be in college and have braces, I'm too old for that. It's gonna be the first thing people notice about me and I'm self conscious about my smile as it is.""

It's gotten to the point that he's clearly upset at me most of the time (**edit:** he's not giving me the silent treatment or appearing to try to make a point. I think he's just genuinely upset, but isn't intentionally trying to throw that in my face). I genuinely feel for my son, but I am trying to stand firm. I am not dismissing his feelings, and trying to offer emotional support, but he is adamant that he wants Invisalign. My wife thinks I am TA, but she is not getting involved because in her words ""it's your money, you get to make the final decision"" (note: this is how **she** feels about our finances, I think it is both of our money).

Would I be TA if I do not get my son the Invisalign?

**edit 2:** My son never asks for anything, is helpful around the house, etc. This is the one major thing he has ever asked for, and is not a dramatic/spoiled person. Just to be fair to him, and paint a clear picture

**edit 3:** A lot of people are suggesting a loan for the extra 3000, which would make a lot of sense. But my son is in his second year of college, and is planning to do further postgraduate education as well (which I am encouraging!). He likely won't really have an opportunity to make substantial money until after he is done his education. It doesn't seem that feasible to me to hold the $3000 over his head for ~6 years, but I am happy to hear any and all suggestions

**edit 4:** I am getting a lot of YTA for not fixing his teeth as a child. I'm not trying to reject my judgment, I have respect for rule 3! But just adding in some info: I am not from America originally, and where I come from orthodontics are not nearly as commonplace. My son was born and raised in America, but I moved here just a bit before he was born, and frankly was unaware and admittedly ignorant to the importance his teeth could have on his self esteem and image. Him bringing it up a few months ago was genuinely the first time I had ever seriously considered that there was an issue that needed to be addressed, mostly due to cultural differences, and perhaps also because of my own unawareness",756,1276,0.94
1084,Not the A-hole,"I lived in a two-bedroom apartment with a housemate. We were both girls in college.

The front door had two locks on it. A deadbolt and a button on the doorknob. We only had keys to the deadbolt. we couldn't lock ourselves out with the doorknob lock, but if one of us was home she could lock the other out of the apartment. In an EMERGENCY the super could unlock it. The first time she locked me out I ask if we could only use the deadbolt and not use the doorknob lock.

She agreed. She said that because we lived together we needed to tell each other ever time we leave the apartment and say where we're going, who we're with, and when we'll be home. I started telling her all this sometimes, but I spent the night at my bf's place and didn't tell her.

She left the front door wide open when no one was home. Everyone driving past could see into our living room. I asked her not to do this and said she didn't need to lock the door as long as it was shut. She said ok but continued doing it.

I took out the trash and didn't lock the door. She asked me to keep the door locked but I misunderstood. I left the door unlocked while I was home and she got very upset. A bit later, I knocked on her door and said I was going to campus to study and I'd be home late. She didn't answer.

When I got back the doorknob was locked and I couldn't get in. After calling her a few times, my phone died. I was locked out overnight and didn't have a place to sleep. Next morning She brushed it off like it was no big deal. She said she needed to lock the doorknob because she didn't always know where I was and if I just told her my plans (like she had asked) then I wouldn't get locked out. She went off on why locking the door is important and said she didn't trust three of our neighbors ‚Äúbecause of the culture where they come from‚Äù. I tried to point out that the deadbolt is stronger, but she didn't care. She suggested we compromise and use the deadbolt during the day and the doorknob lock at night. I told her I have medications, I might need them during the night, and I didn't want to risk being locked out when I needed my meds. She said she'd rather the doorknob stayed locked until she woke up at 8 and I could get my meds then. She had no way of knowing what my meds were for and didn't ask if waiting that long to take them was safe.

To avoid being locked out, I started staying with my bf more. I told her were I was so she could lock the doorknob. She went to our apartment complex's office and in a meeting with them she said she didn't understand why I wouldn't just tell her my plans so she could lock the door.

1087,Everyone Sucks,"Ok so im 15 and my sister is 16 (both female). I wouldn't say were friends, but sisters (if that makes any sense). We usually have each other's backs when we do something that goes against our strict parent's rules. We fight a fair bit and don't get along a lot but I don't hate her, and we both try to have each other's backs as much as possible. This whole issue started when she ""forgot"" to warn me that our parents were home when I thought she was looking after me so I skipped curfew (idk if she intentionally did it or not but I find it hard to believe she just forgot). Needless to say I was grounded and I was pretty pissed that she didn't text me that they came home early, and the fact that she made fun of me CONSTANTLY for that and it really pissed me off. I was out with friends so I wasn't home but apparently my sister come home high as a kite and my parents FLIPPED THEIR SHIT on her and grounded her for like 3 months. I wasn't home and had no idea what she was doing or unless I would have texted her. She has been pretty sad about this cause now she's gonna miss something for her dance team or something. I felt bad for her I really did but then I remembered how she teased me for being grounded and I did the exact same to her. After like a day of me doing this she told me to F off and how she's not in the mood. I told her I'm just getting her back to how she acted when I was grounded.  She went silent and just said under he breath ""its different cause your the weird anti social girl at school and I'm not.""  I was pretty hurt when she said that but I was kinda mad and if she just asked me to stop I would've.  

We usually have these playful teasing matches, most of them get pretty heated sometimes but its usually all in good fun.  I started to bring up her punishment during those and she usually goes cold after that.  It makes me kinda happy that I have one up on her cause she ALWAYS wins those little bouts but now I have something.  No one is really hurt by the teasing but it does kinda make her shut down a little na just gives up.  She has done the same to me.

1088,Asshole,"This is something that has been ongoing for the last few months now so is still relevant God Dammit! 

Firstly, some background. I have a very close-knit family and at one point we had four generations all living in my childhood family home, which we have had for over twenty years now. Since then, my brother, his wife and their child have moved out to their own home, my mum moved in with her boyfriend elsewhere and I was in and out of the home while attending university at the other side of the country, thus leaving just my grandma, sister and two dogs in the house.

So, after uni I decided to treat myself to a well deserved break and wanted to travel Australia for a year. A month before I planned to return home I was told that my mum was selling my family home, de-housing myself, my grandma, sister and the dogs. I am very close to my grandma, so talking to her, she reassured me everything would be okay and worst case scenario I could stay with her for as long as I needed until I settled back in the UK. She also informed me that my mum had spoken to her and my sister and agreed on giving them a lump some of money to pay for a deposit on their own homes because she was basically kicking them out onto the streets. 

When I came home, the house had not been fully sold yet so was able to settle back into things for a couple of weeks and spend time with my family, apart from my mum who was on holiday at the time and my long term girlfriend. When my mum finally returned from her trip I decided to have an official sit down talk with her about also getting some money to pay for a deposit on my own home too. She was shocked that I asked such a thing and told me I had moved out years ago when I left for uni so she did not feel like she was de-housing me at all and the reason she was giving money to my grandma and sister was because they had no where else to go, whereas I could ""easily"" move in with my long term girlfriend, something that had never been approached by either of us. I found this even harder to hear as my sister has had a full time, well paying job for the last 5 year's whereas I have accumulated a huge university debt, as well as spending the majority of my savings on my recent trip. 

Since this disagreement, I have hastily had to move in with my girlfriend (which has been great, don't get me wrong) and have gotten myself an average paying job but I still feel like I have been treated unfairly by my mum and any time I bring up the subject of money she blanks me. This is causing a lot of strain on our usually close family and I have now been told to drop the whole subject for the sake of keeping relationships. So AITA?

TL;DR My mum sold my childhood family home while I was away and payed my grandma and sister a lump sum to find a new home. Upon return I was not offered the same deal and this has since caused a lot of arguments in our previously close-knit family.

Edit: Just some clarification on some points that have been made.

1.) I live in the UK so my university housing was temporary each year. I spent around 8 months a year at uni and then the other 4 months back at home.

2.) My trip to Australia involved both travelling and visiting family (my Aunt and Uncle) and was also funded by working abroad on a Working Holiday Visa. However, I still came back in the negative.

3.) Before I left for my trip I was living in my family home with the intention of living back there when I returned until I found a job.",63,46,0.84
1089,Not the A-hole,"My fiancee is currently angry because I've decided the car I want is a manual. I've always had a manual car since we met, and she has never been able to drive them. I tried to teach her in the past but her anxiety is way too high to drive it. 

In that time, there has been a couple instances where having a car she can drive was useful, but they've been few and far in between over the last \~4 years. 

I decided on the car I wanted- a Golf GTI. I prefer a sportier car but figure my next car should be practical enough to carry a small family and I'm thinking the hatch will suffice. She also has a \~2016 hatchback that she drives. Its in perfectly fine condition. 

The problem is the automatic Golf GTI's I found in my area are either at the end of their warranty, or manual. There is a 2018 with a manual at the upper end of my price range with 55 months left on the warranty. 

The only comparable warranty I've found on an an automatic is 4k more (out of my range). There is also a car with 2 months left in the warranty, but a bit cheaper. Both of these seem like silly options to me when I can get one that's protected for over 4 years. 

I told her if she wants to cover the rest of the payment between the one I found in my range and the one that's 4k more she can do that and I'll take it, otherwise I'm not spending that extra money just because she might need my car 1-2 times a year.

She says I'm just selfish and thinking about myself. My thoughts about us and our future together had to do with not getting another sports car that can't hold kids- not whether or not she can drive it. I think that's perfectly reasonable and that its unreasonable for me to get a car I don't want or one out of warranty just because she might want to use it.",107,129,0.89

We broke up two years ago because I started to have feelings for my now fianc√© Jarno. The break up was emotional but Linus said that he understood and thanked me for not cheating on him. We stayed friends and continued to spend time together with our friend group.

When I started dating Jarno, my friend Tessa told me that Linus said he thinks I won‚Äôt be with Jarno for long because of the differences in our social and economic backgrounds and that when we break up he is sure that I will go back to him. It was difficult to hear but I thought to myself that Linus was understandably upset that I‚Äôm dating the man who is the reason why I broke off our engagement, so he must be saying things to make himself feel better.

In the almost two years that Jarno and I have been together, Linus has been nothing but kind and helpful to us. He was always nice to Jarno and even introduced him to his friends who were able to help Jarno with his work. Linus never made romantic advances towards me and he dated other girls so I thought he already moved on. 

Jarno and I got engaged recently, and last weekend while I was working on my guest list with Tessa, she told me that Linus was upset and spent the night drinking when he learned of my engagement. I asked our friend Hans if it was true and he told me it was. I was surprised because the day after our announcement, Linus sent messages to me and Jarno congratulating us and wishing us the best.

I decided to talk to Linus and he admitted that he still has feelings for me. But he said that he accepts that I don‚Äôt feel the same and he respects my relationship with Jarno that‚Äôs why he befriended him and never made advances towards me. He said he‚Äôs heartbroken for himself but happy for me.

I still wanted to invite Linus to the wedding because it feels wrong to not invite him given that he‚Äôs my friend, he‚Äôs part of my friend group and everyone else will be there, and he has done a lot for me and Jarno. Jarno has no issues with me inviting Linus because he says he can‚Äôt get angry at Linus for still having feelings for me when he never acted on it and was always kind to us. 

But Tessa pointed out that we should think about it carefully because knowing what we know, inviting Linus will be like rubbing salt on a wound. Like telling him I know you still love me, now here is your front row seat come and watch me get married to the guy I left you for.

1093,Not the A-hole,"Background:
Not really my step daughter but my girlfriend's daughter. They live with me. We share finances. I share in all of parenting responsibilities with her mother, so you get the idea. 

  Last year my girlfriend and her two children moved across country and turned me into a parent. Anna (then 14f) started a brand new school for 8th grade, and fit in perfectly! She played on the volleyball team back at her old school, and wanted to play here as well. Her old school barely had enough girls to make up a team so we were a little nervous that she wouldn't make it, but she did and her mother and I were elated.
   We went to 90% of her games, her mom made matching hair bows for all of the girls, we brought them all cupcakes on Anna's birthday... etc, etc. Anna showed little motivation out on the court, and forgot her uniform/kneepads almost half of the time. Her team was really terrible, in fact the didn't win once all season, and we understood that it must have been hard to get motivated. 
   Spring sports roll around and she wants to go out for the track team... Again, mom and I take her out and buy her new running shoes, sign up to volunteer at some of the meets, etc etc. She didn't compete in a single meet for the whole season because she wasn't academically eligible (missing assignments in one of her classes was the largest contributor to this).
   We'll, now, freshman year is in full swing and she's talking about going out for the basketball team, maybe soccer, maybe track. I've already told her ""please don't sign up for any of these things if your mom and I are going to be more motivated for it than you are. It costs a lot of money to sign up for each sport AND we make special arrangements to make sure we can watch you play. Do you know how infuriating it is to rush out of work and drive 40 minutes to see that you haven't even brought the right equipment to your match?""
   Yesterday her grandfather (my gf's dad) sent her 200 dollars for her birthday. She was really excited about it. I said, ""good, you can use that money to register for some of those sports you want to do this year!"" They all thought I was kidding. But I'm not. I think it would be a valuable life lesson. Of course, if she goes all in on sports this year, I'd totally be willing to fund all of her future endeavors. 
WIBTA for enforcing this?


EDIT:  
So, her mom and I talked it over. I've read all of your comments, and it's not fair for me to punish her for not bring as committed as we were. 
We are going to pay for the registration for basketball, and also for a pair of very basic basketball shoes. If she wants nicer ones, she can pay for the ""upgrade"" with her own money. 
Also, we won't be attending all of her games. We're going to ask her to identify a few games that are important to her, and make arrangements to attend those. 
If she shows that she's committed this season, we'll up our commitment level. Until then, I think this is the best way to keep me and her mom from getting irritated with her, while still encouraging her to get out there and participate in being a teen. 
Thanks, y'all!

1094,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married this December and my fiancee and I are very excited, at least we were until my family just had to be difficult at every turn.

When we first started the planning I had asked my younger brother (17) to be my best man. We had been having some trouble with him wanting to follow the dress code for the wedding. He wanted to wear his bright red Jordans with the rest of his wedding attire. My fiancee obviously had an issue with this. It started to get out of hand when I got adamant that he not where those shoes because he would stick out and wouldn't match any of the wedding colors. He refused to change his mind and my Mom told us to let him wear the shoes because ""they look cool"". My Mom has always treated him like they baby since he is the youngest of three, it has really turned him into a lazy spoiled brat.

Yesterday we told him the rest of the groomsmen attire, a grey sweater, white button up, and navy slacks. He flat out refused to wear it. Somehow he got it in his head that he was going to wear an all black suit with a bright red tie. Our wedding is right after Christmas in a church, it is not a funeral. My finance was furious because he absolutely refused to change his mind saying ""its not a big deal"" and ""it doesn't matter what I wear"". I tired to explain he would look ridiculous standing next to the rest of the wedding part and that he only needs to wear it for one evening. When I ask his reasoning for not wanting to wear the clothes you simply says that he doesn't like them. So I told him if he can't follow the dress code then he can't be my best man or apart the wedding party. I asked if he would rather help my fiance's two-year-old daughter be a flower girl. All he would have to do is help her walk down the aisle and he would have a lot more freedom to choose what he wears, but he can't wear an all black suit. He still refused and insisted on wearing what he wants, so I told him if that's his choice he will not be a part of the wedding party and will not be in any pictures.

This whole situation has put my fiancee over the edge, because if he's being this stubborn on clothing chances are he's going to be just as stubborn everywhere else. My fiance's family holds no punches and always speak their mind for better or worse. They will point out the flaws in my mom's parenting and how horrible my brother is and will cause drama and fighting. My fiance feels afraid of her wedding and said she can no longer feel excited for it because she has to tip toe around my family. It got to the point she considered canceling or postponing the wedding. 

This was the final straw for me, I am fed up with my family.

There‚Äôs always been a lot of tension between my father and my family that adopted his baby. As part of the adoption agreement, my father is not allowed to have contact with Katie. This doesn‚Äôt bother me at all and I agree with the decision under the circumstances. 

In any case, this past summer I never went up and visited. I kept contact, and when asked about visiting I said I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd be able to because of work (which isn‚Äôt entirely untrue).

Every time I‚Äôve gone I usually stay over at my cousin‚Äôs place. I must admit that the idea of spending a week entirely focused around a baby sounds like the absolute opposite of a vacation. I‚Äôm not a kids person and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt willingly insert myself into their family dynamic. Even if I got a hotel for a week (which I can‚Äôt even afford but in any case) all of their activities would be based around the child. Which is great, I‚Äôm glad Katie has an amazing support system. But I know them, and I know that their entire lives are wrapped around this girl. Frankly I‚Äôd rather just let them enjoy their time with her. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is relevant, but to me at least it enhances the ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù atmosphere. My cousin is now pregnant (funny how that works) and couldn‚Äôt be more excited about baby #2

I haven‚Äôt told my family why I‚Äôd rather not visit, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve figured it out by now; or at the very least suspect why

Edit: to clarify... I haven‚Äôt completely cut contact with them, I‚Äôm not sure where anyone got that impression. I still talk to them and congratulated my cousin on the pregnancy, I just didn‚Äôt visit them this year.",219,595,0.93

1100,Not the A-hole,"Context, I live in a house share with 5 other good friends, I also broke my leg two days prior.

So the other day I was in our living room and realised that I needed to go to the toilet. In our house there is two bathrooms, one at the top of the stairs and on across the other end of the house, through the kitchen. So I walked through the house to the downstairs bathroom which is a struggle for two reasons, as we have heavy doors which automatically swing closed which navigating on crutches is a nightmare, and I also have massive blisters on my hands already from using the crutches. So I get outside the bathroom and I can hear the water running in the shower, so I knock on the door to ask how long my flatmate will be in the shower, as I didn't want to have to walk all the way back across the hallway through both the heavy doors and have to navigate the stairs, which would take me a good few minutes as getting up the stairs on crutches is very difficult. For the sake of five minutes waiting I would rather not have to travel all that way. I then knocked again as I had assumed she hadn't heard the first time, to which I again got no response. I was about to leave and try the other bathroom when I heard the water turn off, so I decided to try knocking for a third time, to which I again garnered no response. I knew at this point there was no point in going back up the stairs as she wouldn't be long to get out the bathroom. As she opened the door she looked at me and said ""I heard you but I was ignoring you because I was in the shower"". Honestly all I would have wanted was a response so I knew whether it would be worth me going to the trouble of going to the upstairs bathroom. I asked my other friend about it but she said that she would've been annoyed that I'd have knocked whilst she was in the shower as well. I appreciate no one likes being rushed in the shower but I wouldn't have expecting them to hurry, just to let me know if they were going to be long, as the amount of effort it would have saved me when I've been told at the moment to stay off my leg as much as possible at the moment, something everyone in the house knows, would've been notable. 
So AITA for knocking on the shower door?",51,131,0.91
1101,Asshole,"Me (M35), Wife (F33) have a kid (4). Testing our patience and challenging everything. I have been consistent with consequences, giving time out, counting to 3 and then issuing a punishment (no TV, iPad on weekends, etc...). We used to have timeout in our living room where we reside. Yesterday I made a decision to move it to the dining room where no one is when timeout is issued, away from distractions and people. This was on the cusp of her worst day at school.

Wife wants to watch a parenting DVD (mentioned two weeks ago) and I said that's fine, but this month is super busy as I'm studying hard for an important exam for work, one that I have failed previously a few times. So I'm diligent with it before my test. I expressed that I would like to watch it, but can we put it off until next month? She agreed. I suggested this because for me, with the current work load at work, maintaining the house and studying, I am at 100% mental capacity, it's just a lot going on. 

This morning as I'm getting fed up with the kid acting up again, not listening, etc... Just standing there staring off in the distance waiting for her to listen, saying nothing. She says (as she has mentioned several times since) ""We need to watch that DVD"".

I respond that I am fully aware of that and we will watch it, but if she could please stop bringing it up as a constant reminder it would be nice.

She responded ""Don't complain about her behavior until we watch it since you're changing things.""

1105,Not the A-hole,"So, we recently hired a new pharmacy technician at our hospital, and she has been fine up until yesterday evening when we began to make IVs. We have a certain protocol we have to adhere to, AND the other senior techs I work with trained me in a way to catch every little mistake (for example, wiping down products with alcohol to sterilize it). She has been working at other hospitals for longer than I have and is a person who always responds with ‚ÄúI know‚Äù to everything you tell her.

Anyways, I was training her and trying to catch mistakes she made, but she took this as nitpicking and blew up with ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you do it then?‚Äù To which I responded, ‚Äúwhy are you getting an attitude? Do you need to take a break to cool off?‚Äù So she stormed out and went to the bathroom or something, meanwhile I am degowning to speak with my supervisor about the incident.

I was honest and mentioned the areas she needed to improve and that she can‚Äôt work here with an ‚ÄúI know everything‚Äù attitude. My supervisor basically said this was the first incident of any issues and that maybe I need to let her do her thing.

1106,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post, and written on mobile so excuse formatting. 

So basically, I‚Äôve (23F) been going through my clothes for a month or so now. I had a large plastic bag of clothes that I was planning on taking to a second hand store that buys clothes, and selling whatever I can, then donating the rest to a a low cost thrift store. The place that I donate to gives you gift cards that gives you a percentage off your next purchase as well. I was planning to donate them within the week, so donating bag was downstairs in my family‚Äôs living room. 

My mom invited her friend over for a ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù of the house Saturday morning. I was still asleep as I work closing shifts (~3am). As I was sleeping, I guess my mom told her that she could have them. 

Now, I don‚Äôt mind moms friend looking through them and taking what she would wear. She has a 16 year old daughter that would probably wear some of the stuff, that‚Äôs no problem. The issue that I have is, when I brought it up to my moms friend, I said something along the lines of ‚Äúhey, I noticed you took my bag of clothes. Did you guys find stuff you liked that fit?‚Äù Very light heartedly. My moms friend looked at me like a deer in headlights, I‚Äôm assuming because she knew she didn‚Äôt have permission to take my clothes. She kind of stammered and then said ‚Äúyeah we found a bit of stuff. I left the rest of it in our back lane and it was gone the next morning.‚Äù

After she said that I was pretty choked. I mustered out an, ‚Äúoh, nice.‚Äù Then walked away. I‚Äôm still kind of upset about it. 

On one hand, we live in a not so great neighbourhood and maybe someone can get use out of the clothes. Or someone who can‚Äôt afford a thrift store gets use out of them. On the other hand, everything was in great condition and some of which was brand name. I paid for all of my clothes, and I feel like it was my decision to give her these or not. And now she‚Äôs stripped my opportunity of selling any. And who knows if the person who took them from the lane is even going to wear them, or just throw them out. 

I haven‚Äôt brought it up to my mom because I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll cause a tiff and we‚Äôre getting along well now. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

TLDR; mom gave my clothes I was planning on selling/donating to a friend without permission, who took some then put it in the back lane. I‚Äôm still kinda upset about it.

1108,Not the A-hole,"Last year my sister turned 16 and because she could start learning to drive my parents bought her a secondhand Mazda (about $7000).

I turned 16 this year, I can't get a license right now because of epilepsy. However, I can skirt the rules if I get an e-bike. I asked for an e-bike or at least a motor I can fit onto my bike. This didn't happen. This year she got a macbook in preparation for uni, but I'm not allowed to complain about that because she's 17 and I'm not.

Parents gave me $500 on a term-deposit on an account I can't touch. They told me my sister needed a car and I don't. They also promised me in 10 years that $500 will be worth over double my sister's car from the interest. I don't believe that, I did compound interest in maths class I'd need like 35% interest rate, that's practically impossible.

I know I'm ""technically"" not entitled to a gift at all, but my parents set precedent with my sister. They should treat us fairly. All my medication totals to about $1,500 a year, I'd even count that as part of my birthday present. I said to them that if they give my sister a 16th birthday present for $X, it's only fair that I get a 16th birthday present for $X.

1109,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôm kind of convinced that I‚Äôm overreacting and am in fact TA but I want other opinions first. Also, I‚Äôm tired so I‚Äôm going to make this as clear and concise as I can.

My Bf (20M) and I (18F) have been dating for going on a year now. We started out as FWB but then we both developed feelings. In the beginning stage of our relationship he would constantly take me out to dinner and buy me random things he found and thought that I would like (nothing ever expensive just a cute stuffed animal or figurine that he saw for example). At the same point in this relationship I would reciprocate these actions. I would bring him food to work when I went into visit him, I would buy him random presents and would surprise him with random dinners just so he knew that I cared about him.

Fast forward a couple months and he‚Äôs still doing everything listed above just less frequently. He developed financial struggles and eventually quit his job and was unemployed for about a month. During this time he completely stopped spending any money on me and it was entirely me spending money when we went out or did something together. This didn‚Äôt bother me at all as I understood it was only a temporary situation and I loved him.

He got his job back about three months ago making decent money (we make about the same amount) and I have recently moved about an hour and a half away to go to college so we only see each other every two weeks. 

The problem for me comes in because I am the only one making an effort to drive the hour and a half to either visit home for the weekend or take him up to my dorm. This costs quite a lot in gas. After I make the drive I am the only one who spends money on dates or anything we decide to do when we hang out and he frequently asks me if I can buy him food. His excuse for this is that we always hang out right before he gets paid (he gets paid on Monday and we always hang out the weekend before due to work schedules) and at that point all of the money from his paycheck is gone. He never makes any effort to save money even though he knows this is going to happen every time we see each other.

Today, he called me and told me that he went out with friends and tipped a waiter $60 because it was ‚Äúthe best service he had ever received.‚Äù I have not said that this hurt me or anything regarding the situation at all because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being an ass.

Going into the relationship, we each had a dog.

The relationship started out house to house, then she got her place renovated and moved into my place, which took about 18 months. Us, two dogs and housemate all living together.

Her reno got completed, and we moved into her nice house about a year ago. (Rich parents)

It has all been going well, but my dog is a bigger rescue (ridgeback/staffy x) and has been causing increasing strain. She has social anxiety as she was beaten as a puppy, barks at guests which can be scary, is overly attached to me, keeps messing up the veggie garden, my partner can't walk her cause she has shown some aggression to other dogs and is too strong etc.

She has now asked me to get rid of the dog, and while I have told her she is more important to me, and I understand her position. I am struggling with it and feel like I am building some animosity about it despite my best efforts not to.

I know my dog sucks, but she got me through depression where I would have wouldn't be here without her. So I feel deeply bonded to her as an animal, and now I am struggling even to look my puppy in the face.

AITA, for wanting to keep my shit dog when my partner is fed up?

&#x200B;

Edit:  Should have included we are only at this point after putting in a lot of work and training.She is a really well-behaved dog when not under stress but carrying deep trauma and is very physically strong and imposing.

Barks at guests last only a few seconds until she gets a pat and is acknowledged but is still pretty over the top and not a great way for people to enter a room to.

Thanks for the ideas on management and training options though they are all appreciated.

It came time to invite his little friends and I told him to invite whomever he is friends with, and within reason not to be too constrained by numbers (we have a big backyard so there'll be room for everyone and the odd parent who chooses to stay). He made a massive list which included all kids from his karate class, all kids from his after school club and most of the kids from his class. Except one. 

I know why he didn't invite this kid (let's call him Austin). Austin has autism and should not go to a non-specialist school, but his parents are in denial of this. They insist he is ready for regular school but he is most def not. He hits kids on a regular basis, sometimes with a vicious look on his face, the second things dont go his way. He hit my kid before because my kid refused to let Austin draw over one of my kid's drawings. He has screaming fits which are seemingly endless once they start, and he is just generally unpredictable and kids are scared of this. 

I tried explaining to my kid Austin's condition but I can't justify letting my kid or his friends be at risk of being hit or screamed at while at my house. There's already a big momentum at school by parents to do something about Austin's attendance and move him back to a specialist school.

I honestly can't believe I'm writing this, it seems so stupid but here we go. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday I went to visit my friend Rae and her 7 year old daughter Minnie. I was catching up with Rae for a while and Minnie was sat in the room with us playing with her toys, after I'd caught up with Rae I said to Minnie:

&#x200B;

Me:How're you Minnie, been doing anything fun lately?

Minnie:Mom just finished reading me Harry Potter.

Me:That's awesome, did you like it?

Minnie:Yeah it's really cool.

&#x200B;

Minnie goes back to playing and I say to Rae

&#x200B;

Me:I love HP, I cried like a baby when Sirius died, and Dobby and Hedwig, basically everyone.

Minnie:What? Dobby and Hedwig and Sirius die?

Me:Well yeah, but surely you know that if you've just finished reading the books?

Rae:We've just finished book 4

Me:Oh! You didn't say, I thought you meant the whole series. 

Minnie:Mom do they really die?

Rae:Well yes, but lot's of good things happen too and we can still enjoy reading all about it.

&#x200B;

Minnie went to play in her room after this so it was just me and Rae.

&#x200B;

Rae:I know you didn't mean to but just a heads up, when it comes to kids it's always better if you see what they know before saying stuff like that, it's the same kinda thing as Santa or whatever.

Me: Umm, OK?

Rae:Would you mind just apologizing to Minnie for spoiling it?

Me:Bur I didn't spoil it, you said so yourself, you can still enjoy the book together.

Rae:It would still be nice if you said sorry yourself.

&#x200B;

We argued a bit, my points are that it's not ruined, Rae literally said so herself, the books have been out for years you can't expect to not accidentally hear stuff about them and they didn't actually specify which books they had read. 

&#x200B;

The last thing Rae said was:If you're going to be a bitch about this then just forget it but I think you should leave.

&#x200B;

I really don't think any of this was necessary, I think it's rude to drag me infront of Minnie like a naughty school child and force me to say sorry, the idea makes me very uncomfortable. I also don't think that this is even close to a big deal and I think that by forcing me to apologize Rae is teaching Minnie that it's OK to make a big deal about little things and get upset over nothing. I'm also really annoyed that she called me a bitch over this, I think that was really uncalled for.

1114,No A-holes here,"Hey reddit,

So my university did a terrible job of matching me with a roomate. I filled out a survey with times that I sleep and function and study and if I'm a light or heavy sleeper. 
I got paired with a very kind girl who's extremely shy, we have only talked once. It's one of those dorms were we sleep essentially next to each other, 1 tiny room with beds.
I don't have many issues with rooming except that she is my polar opposite. Sleeps very early for like 10 hours while I usually stay up until 3. She is an EXTREMELY heavy sleeper, luckily, so i can still do my stuff. (You have to do something like slam the door or a drawer to wake her up.)
The only issue is her snoring. This isn't some normal snoring. This is the unhealthy go to a doctor ASAP because you're vibrating the room snorning.
I haven't slept well in a month or so because it either wakes me up or keeps me up. 
I've found that right before I sleep each night, I'll do something, 1 little thing that's loud and will wake my roomate up very slightly and the snoring will stop (closing a drawer kinda loud. In this time, I try to sleep immediately before the snoring continues.
I brought up the fact that she's a deep sleeper here because even though she wakes up just a little, it's been easy for her to fall back asleep immediately, and the snoring continues later on.
AITA for waking her up to sleep?
A few things
- I have requested a roomate change and the university said no. Only extreme cases.
-I've brought it up vaguely to her but she is very afraid of me (im an upperclassmen shes a freshman) and she seems to already know. There's nothing she does about the snoring. Also, I don't want to push and embarras this already shy freshman. 
-The lack of sleep is affecting me in class. Also, i shouldn't have to change my sleep schedule for how she works. I can't work that way.

Edit to answer a few questions: 
Yes, she is overweight. 
She does do the thing where she will stop storing/breathing then immediately do a weird gasp for air followed by loud snoring.
I can't fall asleep with noise, even music :/
And what if I don't wake up to my morning alarms with the earplugs?

My husband and I drove 4 hours away to a very talented tattoo artist, are paying a shit ton of money for him to be tattooed here and it is his first tattoo. It will be a sleeve, this trip is two days worth and only the first of several similar sessions.

I don't really want to go with him to sit in the shop for 9 hours (again) watching him get ink on a level I would love to have but can't because we wouldn't be able to afford it. I feel like never showing my own tattoos ever again because by comparison mine look like shit. I used to adore my tattoos and thought they were awesome but they're boring plain cartoon characters done in a more american traditional style with bold color and defined outlines. This artist is a cartoon realism style and looks fucking amazing. I have had mine for years and was proud, now I'm ashamed to show them. 

I feel jealous and regretful and feel shitty for feeling that way. He sat for 9 hours without any issue and he said it didn't even hurt much. To be fair this artist does not do lines in his work which I found color/shading way more tolerable but I feel kind of irritated he had such little pain and I was internally screaming having some of mine done. Like not only does he have amazing art but it didn't even hurt. 

I haven't said anything at all about how I feel because I want him to enjoy it and have fun and love his new ink. I don't want to ruin his whole experience over my emotional ineptitude. I know I will process the emotion and get over it... Yet I kind of just want to stay at the hotel or go do my own thing for the next day to lessen the amount of resentment I'm feeling right now. Would that be an asshole move? Or should I stfu and just stew in my emotions at the appointment.

EDIT: I realized I said I didn't talk to him at all, which isn't entirely accurate. I did tell him I felt jealous and how I felt my own art looks shitty compared to his. He just said my tattoos weren't bad. This was on the ride back to the hotel. He fell asleep pretty much immediately after we got to our hotel room and has been out since. That was the extent of it.

About twice a week I‚Äôll wear one anyways and every time I cannot wait to get home so I can take it off.

So most of the time I go braless. I wear tight fitting shirts that are a little revealing sometimes. I wear relaxed t shirts and hoodies most of the time.

She then said it was her birthday and I just haven't responded yet because I feel like that's a shitty excuse for a 31 year old to use.

1124,Not the A-hole,"I was married for 6 years, been divorced for 2.5. I have a grade school aged daughter with my ex wife and we still live in the same town and have 50/50 custody. 

I have been dating a new woman for about 8 months and things are going well.  During custody exchange this week, my ex (we are very civil for my daughter, even though we basically can't stand each other), gave me back some Halloween decorations she took when she moved out 2.5 years ago.  She said ""I'm not gonna use these, do you want them?"" I said yes.  I said yes because these were mine before, they aren't bad looking, and I'm a dude so I don't have an excess of decorations.

My gf saw she gave me these decorations during the exchange. 

Later we carved pumpkins (me, daughter, gf) and I put the decorations out with the pumpkins.

My gf got quiet and had her sad face on and later when we were in bed I asked her what was wrong and she told me she hated the fucking decorations and resents that many of my possessions are associated to my ex. I said the decorations are fine, they don't have my ex's name or a picture of her and she wouldnt have known they were associated to her unless she saw them come from my ex.  My gf is still very adamant about hating the decorations and got a tad bit dramatic when I suggested that her feelings were petty and a bit immature. I told her I have lots of property that used to belong to both of us, car, oven, house, bed etc

In the end, I called and informed her I put the decorations away and she won't see them.... but I also told her it was because I don't want to see her upset even though I think her reasoning for being upset is ridiculous. 


I care a lot about her and maybe this is a difference between men and women but I don't associate property with an ex and even if I did, such as a watch or jewelry, if I like it so what?

1125,Not the A-hole,"My little brother is 16. I'm 24 and still live with my parents. Our parents are strict immigrant parents and My brother is embarrassed of them so he never invites his friends over when my parents are home but sometimes does when I'm home. One of his friends is a wannabe rapper who records songs and puts them on sound cloud or whatever. He's often playing his songs for my brother. Honestly I'm not a big fan of a lot of the misogynistic lyrics and ""hood"" things in his songs (He's a white kid who grew up in the suburbs) but I usually ignore it. I usually stay in my room when they're over because my brother dislikes it when I interact with his friends at all.

However I came down to the kitchen to come get a snack and  my brother and his friend were playing one of his songs and the lyrics ""I'm like a Jew, I got dimes"" came up and my brother's friend seemed to think it was very clever because he shouted it out when it came up.

Honestly I think I was just annoyed and I turned to him and told him the lyric was anti semitic. My brother's friend just stared at me and then turned to my brother and laughed and then said ""what is she talking about."" I then repeated that the lyric was anti semitic because it makes the presumption Jewish people are wealthy. He then said ""Most Jews are rich though, you're acting like people saying you're rich is a bad thing. I wish I was rich. Why are you acting like I'm a nazi?"" My brother then told me to be quiet and they left the area and I heard his friend call me a weirdo. I then yelled out ""I might be weirdo but at least I'm not anti-semitic!""

Later my brother yelled at me for embarrassing him in front of his friend and how I'm not supposed to talk to them when they come over and I should mind my business and stop being a ""social justice warrior"" all the time and making a big deal out of something so minor.

AITA here? I honestly don't know why I said anything. I'm not Jewish and I don't really personally know any Jewish people  but my brother's friends annoy me and the way he yelled out the lyric really bothered me.",54,41,0.82

1127,Not the A-hole,"Hi, this is my first time babysitting.

I've had experiences taking care of my siblings in the past, so fair to say, I have experience with babies.

Basically, about a month ago I had a part time job earning a bit of money on the side taking care of this adorable 3 year old named Katie. It's a relatively easy job, and it's technically only a 2 hour shift in the evenings. She's an easygoing baby, the parents are nice, etc.

However, they did set some ground rules, such as no changing the baby's diaper or bathing her, no taking her outside, and don't let anyone in the house. Okay, whatever, that's easy enough to handle. 

Today though, they set me up for a 4 hour shift, as they both had to be away for longer. The pay is double, I don't have anything planned, so it all works out.

The problem arises when near the beginning of the third hour, it's very obvious that she needs a diaper change. (The brand that they use had a wetness indicator, so I knew). I'm pretty conflicted at this point, but she doesn't seem to be too bothered, so I figured to just leave it alone. However, about half an hour later, it is apparent that she really needs a diaper change, and Katie also seems uncomfortable. By this time, I've texted and called both the parents, but neither have responded or picked up at all. 

So I changed Katie's diaper, because I honestly could not deal with the smell, and both her and I seemed to be immensely uncomfortable with it.

AITA for breaking that rule? I felt that it was an emergency and needed to be done, but I can see that it can also be an invasion of privacy.",44,42,0.9
1128,Asshole,"I feel like I already know the answer but my friends are torn on thinking I'm an asshole or just drunkenly obnoxious so we're turning to reddit.

I was at a bar that offers a student discount if you show your student ID card. These IDs are given to you free when you enrol and you use them to get into university buildings, swipe in/out of class for attendance, check out books/study materials, and you have to produce it for security if you're on site after 5pm in the library etc. They're essential. If you lose it you have to pay to replace it.

But... if you lose the card, you have to go to an office on campus to sign a form and pay and have your new card printed. But to get on campus you need a card. If you lose the card you email security to tell them in advance or they literally won't let you in. I've lost my card before, showed up the next day and explained to the security guy, and he's told me I need to email before 6pm the previous day to have my name added to a visitor list for the day. It's a stupid system but the point is, without a card it's impossible to get onto campus so losing it is a big problem.

I had my card at the bar and I showed it to get a discount. At some point I was in the bathroom. I had my card and my keys in my hand. I put them down on the windowsill to answer a call from a friend who was outside and upset about something and when I left to go and find my friend outside I forgot my card and my keys. I was fairly wasted but once I got outside I realised what I'd done. I found my friend, made sure she was with the rest of our group, and went back to try and get in to retrieve my keys and my card.

The guy on the door said I was too drunk to enter. I told him I'd literally just left and I only needed to get my keys and ID I'd left behind. He said I'd have to come pick up lost property in the morning. I told him I really couldn't do that- I had an early class and was presenting something important that counts significantly towards my grade so I needed my card. The class was at 8am and the bar wouldn't reopen until evening. He said I was too wasted. I insisted I wasn't. The usual back and forth with drunk guy and security guy. He said at one point: If you aren't drunk, why are you slurring your words? I replied: I have a speech impediment.

I wasn't trying to be funny or a dick and it was a spur of the moment comment that comes out when you're not thinking. He looked a little uncomfortable, hesitated a bit, and then said I had two minutes to go get my things. Thankfully, my keys and ID were still in the bathroom. I thanked the guy on the way out and went with my friends home. Told them the story on the way and some called me an asshole, some said it was just dumb, but it got my ID back and I managed to go and present my project in the morning without a problem which I wouldn't have been able to do without my card. I do feel bad about pretending to have a speech impediment though. So AITA?",44,143,0.93
1129,Not the A-hole,"So I work at a fast food joint and theres another fast food joint next door and there's this employee with Downs syndrome that always comes in for a drink. Since we're neighbors we usually give him the drink since it's no big deal, but today he asked for some food. (Just some nachos, a cheap item)

Now for a little background I've been over there and I get the feeling that he is high functioning because he seems to perform his job perfectly fine. So I figured he should have the mental capacity to know that he needs to pay for his food. But when I asked him to pay for his food he looked really dejected and hesitated (he ended up not even giving me enough but it was only like 12 cents so I shrugged it off even though I can get in trouble if my till is short)

I've been thinking about it all day and I can't shake the feeling that I fucked up? Did I do something wrong making him pay for his food?

Well over the weekend was a wedding between one of his friends and his lady partner, which brought the whole group together. My husband was in the party so I was with the significant others for a good portion of the weekend. At one point, I casually mentioned that strippers were at the bachelor party. This was a mistake.

Turns out, the other guys did NOT share that there were strippers at the bachelor party, so I was the one who broke the news. The reaction from them was more ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad, but why didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù No one seemed actually mad about the actual hiring of strippers.

1135,Not the A-hole,"I have a coworker who became a close friend over the past year and a half. She‚Äôs getting married in 5 months, and having her bachelorette party in 3 months. When she initially invited me on the trip I was thrilled to be included. She‚Äôs from out of state and therefore I don‚Äôt know anyone else going along but I saw this as a fun and exciting opportunity to meet her friends and family from back home and celebrate her upcoming marriage! 

The bachelorette party is a 3-day cruise and the group of girls is working with a travel agency to book the trip. The pricing is very complicated since there are numerous types of rooms as well as ‚Äúperks‚Äù you can add on to your trip, such as unlimited drinks or special excursions. That being said, the actual cost of the trip was a little foggy at first. I‚Äôm rooming with 2 girls whom I‚Äôve never met and that live across the country from me, so I kind of told them to go ahead and take the lead and just let me know how much I owe them. 

However, I come to find out today that the cruise alone is just under $800 a person (reminder... it‚Äôs a 3 day cruise). Additionally, we have to fly to the port which is about $350 and stay in a hotel the night before which also costs about $100. Also, we are expected to divvy up the brides portion of the trip, which ends up being another $110 or so per person. That being said, this trip is coming in at just under $1,400. 

It‚Äôs a 3-day cruise which 11 strangers and 1 friend, and I also will have to pay for me and my boyfriends flight and hotel to the actual wedding 2 months after this trip, which I‚Äôm estimating to cost around $1,200. 

All of that being said, AITA for backing out of this trip after I have told her how thrilled I am to go on multiple occasions? She‚Äôs even complained to me about other family members and friends who have backed out because of the expenses and I rolled my eyes alongside her. But now when push comes to shove, I‚Äôm realizing how much it‚Äôs actually going to cost me and wanting to get out at the last minute.

AITA? What would you do in this situation? What‚Äôs the customary amount of money one is expected to spend on a friends bachelor/bachelorette party?? 

Also it‚Äôs fair to note that I have a stable income, and she knows how much I earn since we work together. It‚Äôs not like I absolutely cannot afford it, but there‚Äôs just many many other things I would rather spend $1,400 on. If I absolutely did not have the money to go, then I would think it is fair to assume I am NOT the asshole. However, her and I both know that I can afford this trip.",57,129,0.95
1136,Asshole,"Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. 

For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

During the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.

On the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. 

My husband and I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. He finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. He said Amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. 

As someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber.",2148,12868,0.9

1139,Not the A-hole,"Ok so basically me and my mom were arguing. She said one of my best friends is a bad influence and I said well they can't be a bad influence because they don't have much influence on me, I only see them once a week at most and I live with you, you have more influence on me. And also she's not the one who said she didn't want me to be her kid! So my mom said ""When did I say that?"" and I said well when I was in middle school you said that you'd be ashamed if your kid was gay and you still never apologized.

&#x200B;

Anyways my reasoning is: Saying something to a child is different than saying it to an adult because kids just believe whatever they hear and eventually it becomes their internal monologue. I spent like 5 years in the closet after that because I was ashamed. And it still affects me to this day. Also my friend isn't a bad influence because I know she has issues and even though she's my friend she's not someone I look up to like that.

They have tried to kick him out multiple times and he will not leave. Stepdad gives in because he doesn't want to be the person to put anyone on the street. My brother exploits this. 

Seven or eight months ago my brother was working at Six Flags and doing work on the Rattler. He fell and injured his back. He made it sound like he had bulging discs needing surgery. He got workman's comp, and immediately filed for disability which was my red flag. I finally got ahold of his medical papers and he has a pinched nerve. A PINCHED NERVE. He has gone through physical therapy to the point they said they won't do therapy anymore he should be fine. He tried to get the doctor to sign disability papers and the doctor said no way this is short term you're fine. 

I realized he was truly faking when I saw him feeding the cows and lifting a 50lbs bag of feed over his shoulder like it was 2lbs. He ran when he realized he hadn't shut the gate. He didn't realized I was outside and I watched as he got closer to the house and when he did, he changed his gait and went back to acting like he was disabled. My step dad feels so bad for him he is giving him tons of his pain meds that he needs. While my brother literally collects workman's comp, gets up at 8 am and immediately goes and gets his booze for the day, lays in bed, drinks, and is served food in bed only to sleep and repeat the next day. To make it all worse he is insufferable, I'm talking MEAN, hates anyone that isn't giving him something. 

Yes, I'm bitter. I need to stay here for a bit until I get on my feet and I'm working from home, doing all the cleaning, laundry, cooking, and I don't mind because they need the help but my brother has the entire back part of the house which includes two rooms, a kitchen, and bathroom. Meanwhile I'm working my ass off, paying rent, buying the food in the house, doing all the cleaning, and holding a job and I am forced to sleep in a recliner in the living room. You're damn right I'm bitter. I'm female and a single parent and he is a POS. Taking advantage of them and I've had it. Now he is taking advantage of the system. I had a car accident and broke 20 plus bones and returned to work in a matter of months albeit in a wheelchair. I also have Lupus and have survived kidney failure. He has a pinched freaking nerve and wants permanent disability?! I'm very bitter. 

That man has never seen a consequence in his life and while I'm not the judge and jury in life, I do know right from wrong and I think he should be reported. My mother thinks I'm not just the asshole for this but I'm Satan. What do y'all think? 

TL;DR My POS brother is faking injury to continue taking advantage of my parents and now the system using Workman's comp. I want to report him.

1145,Not the A-hole,"I know I'm an asshole for part of this situation but I need some help with the resolution.

Background: wife and I have been together 5 years, married 3. Last year we moved 10 minutes away from her parents. Since then my MIL has been coming to ours 3/4 times every week. 
MIL is a difficult woman. She's very traditional and conservative and very vocal about her opinions. Despite claiming she's tolerant of everyone she says a lot of un-pc things e.g. in the same sentence she'll say she has no problem with homosexuality then call gay people fags. I've called her out in the past but gotten nowhere.

For the last 15 months she's been coming over multiple times a week and driving me insane. When she comes over she completely dominates the house. Kicks me out of rooms, makes me change the TV or has extremely loud conversations with my wife about how much she hates FIL. She gets away with all of this because she's the guest and we must be accommodating of guests. BS in my opinion but it's hard to fight against her and my wife won't argue with her either. We've discussed this before but have never managed to make any headway.

Current situation: MIL was at our house this weekend, I was watching a show I was really interested in and she marches in telling me to switch off the TV because she and my wife wanted to sit and chat in here. I told her no, I've had a long hard week, I want to relax and I'm really interested in watching this. My wife suggests they watch with me. MIL then proceeds to comment constantly throughout the show. Ads come on and there's an advert for some documentary about the porn industry which sends MIL on a tirade about the 'disgusting and depraved things these people do'. She kept going after the show had started again. I ask her to stop please. She told me it was rude to interrupt her. I'd had enough, so I got up and said I was going for a walk. MIL says ""good, maybe we can finally have an actual conversation without inappropriate interruptions"" (referring to the porn advert) I just saw red and snapped""maybe if you did some of those 'depraved' and 'inappropriate' sex acts you wouldn't be such a miserable old cow and your marriage wouldn't be falling apart"". 

I walked out before anyone else could do anything, I came home in the evening and obviously MIL is pissed, as is my wife. I told her I know I messed up with what I said, it was out of line and I will apologize. IF we can acknowledge that this outburst didn't come from nowhere and put some changes in place. 1)MIL needs to stop coming over so often, 2 times a week max. 2)she needs to treat me better, no more kicking me out of rooms etc 3)no more hateful speeches about things she doesn't agree with, if she can't be civil about a controversial topic then we should just avoid it. If we can all agree to these terms I'll apologize. My wife says this is unacceptable, that what I said was so disgusting that I have no right to ask for anything and need to just straight up apologize. 
AITA?


Edit: A few of you have made comments about not dealing with the situation before it got to this point. It's hard to fit all the info in the original post with only 3000 characters so I'll add now what I've said in the past and how it's been met by my wife and MIL.

In regards to her coming over I have suggested:
1)Reducing the number of visits, the response: mother-daughter bonding is important, that I can't control how much time they spend together.

2)Going to MIL's house instead, response: MIL needs time away from FIL.

3)Sitting in the kitchen, response: Not comfortable enough.

4)Waiting until I'm busy with other things, response: It's unfair for my schedual to dictate what they want to do.

5)Going out together, response: too expensive. 

When trying to confront offensive comments from MIL her resposes are generally that I shouldn't police what she says or I'm being too sensitive and my wife will just tell me that it's a generational thing and she doesn't really mean it.


To the person who asked exactly how they are kicking me out, they don't physically take the remote but if I don't leave MIL will make me as confortable as possible until I don't want to stay. Being very loud, snide comments etc, basically how this situation unfolded except I usually just leave before it gets as bad as it did this time. 


The only reason I suggested holding the apology hostage was to give me some power behind my requests, as I've said I have tried in the past and been ignored, I thought if there was something at stake I may get taken more seriously. Unfortuantley this idea seems to make me TA but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. If I apoloize then ask for change I'm certain I'll be met with the same answers as always. My wife won't even entertain the idea of counselling.",130,595,0.95

I'm a single Dad with three sons. I'm a devout Christian and have raised my boys that way - they've always loved church and we have a wonderful priest who helped us through their mothers death. They continue to attend church (not always but regularly) - despite the fact they're all in their teens with a lot of social pressure from some of their friends. I'm so proud of all my boys. Our whole neighbourhood is so tight knit and loving and we don't have many connections outside of this church-going community.

Something I've always had a suspicion about is that my youngest son is gay - I have spotted a few significant signs - I know that may seem like I am stereotyping but its true. As he's grown he's become more and more defensive about everything, despite the fact nobody has accused him of his sexuality. He became over cautious about who he was and protecting himself at every opportunity for fear he would be discovered.

So last night, at a housewarming party that I had invited everyone to, out of the blue (and it has to be said after a few drinks) - my son called the room and said he had an announcement. He announced to everyone that he was gay and that's who he was now. If anyone didn't accept that then he didn't want them in his life. I wish he hadn't but he left the party right after which let the announcement stew in the room.

I am completely supportive - and I don't hold any religious views on the matter as I don't believe there is any indication in the bible to feel otherwise. However, after the announcement - I would say 80% of the congregation feel like he shouldn't return to our church and don't feel like he should belong to our faith any longer. I'm disappointed in them but feel like this is a new situation that they need educating on and it can be rectified.

I completely disagree with their views - but they are so so important to me and that's all I have as a community. I feel like given time and with my son's presence - they can be turned around.

When I spoke to my son about their reaction the next day - he wasn't surprised but said I would be a hypocrite in supporting him if I continued to associate with my friends in the community. My other son's are backing my son and say they will also refuse to attend church and be around my friends until they can accept my brother.

I told my son it was unfair to give me an ultimatum: either not continue to see my friends or not support my own son. He said I was as bad as they are if I don't reject them as people. I can see his side but he won't give me the time to manage the situation. I can see his point because my friends are encouraging the opposite in encouraging me to speak with my son.

He reacted badly when I said I wasn't going to give up on my friends - and I told him that's completely unfair and you need to realise my side in the situation.

Things have been much better, and I thought I would update you all.

After seeing these comments (and with Nyshia‚Äôs permission), I talked to the coach about reinstating her. We got it worked out, and as long as Nyshia scrubs coolers and does other grunt work for the rest of the season, he‚Äôll let her back. He offered the same ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù to some of her friends in exchange for being reinstated, and so far she is the only one who has agreed. I‚Äôm proud of my daughter.

Nyshia won‚Äôt be losing her scholarship after all, but we have put aside some of our savings for her anyway. She can use it to pay for a wedding eventually, or graduate school, or buying a house. The remainder will cover three years for Annabelle, and we‚Äôll figure out the fourth. 

Anyway, I thought you all would like to know what happened. Thanks for giving me the kick in the pants to sort things out with my girls.

Edit: thanks everyone for your well wishes! I‚Äôm truly proud of my daughters...they aren‚Äôt perfect, but they are wonderful young ladies. For those asking, I did change some details (what sport my daughter plays, the names etc) for privacy. I‚Äôd still prefer to keep that stuff private.",79,3716,0.98
1149,Asshole,"I go to a small private school, and my grade (10th) only has 63 people. I've gone to school with the majority of these people since kindergarten and besides am involved in a lot of stuff- I play soccer and tennis, am in debate & mock trial, founded the Stock Market Club, and am Class President, which means having to get to meet everyone in the grade- so I'm pretty good friends/on good terms with almost everyone in my grade, the one exception being this kid named Preston, who is weird/awkward and is, for lack of a better word, preachy- he has a certain idea about how everything in life should be and how people should act, and criticizes the shit out of people who do things the 'wrong way'. Basically he's a smartass neckbeard, and he annoys me.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, this past Saturday was homecoming. At my school, the dance itself is always pretty lame, and the afterparties are what people truly look forward to. I've been the 'party guy' in my grade since last year, since I a) know everyone well b) have a big house and c) my parents don't really care if I throw parties as long as my grades are up. I decided to invite everyone in my grade except for Preston, as well as some freshmen and upperclassmen I hang out with- basically just everyone I like.

&#x200B;

Preston figured out I was having an afterparty- probably from snapchat- and came to my house, even though he wasn't invited. When I saw him I asked him to leave, and after trying to convince me to let him stay, finally left. But while he was, he told me I'm a 'huge dick' for not inviting him.

Am I? I don't see myself as TA, since it's a perfectly valid thing to invite or not invite whoever I wanted to a party.",269,270,0.81

1152,Asshole,"My brother and I were betting on horse racing at the pub. We were in a different state and the betting slips were slightly different to the ones we‚Äôre used to in our home state.
We agreed to bet $5 each on a boxed trifecta and completed the betting slip at our table. It was my turn to go to the bar to submit it. I took it up and put it in the machine, expecting to need to pay $10. The screen showed that the wager was actually $50, so we must have filled the slip incorrectly. I saw that the race was about to start and I didn‚Äôt have time to fill in a new one correctly, so I just agreed to pay the full amount, taking the rest of the wager on myself. 
By the time I got back to the table the race had already started and was almost finished. I sat down and told my brother what happened. By the time I had finished explaining the race was complete and our bet had won. We were both very happy, but this was the start of our problems. 
I collected the money and brought it back to the table when he asked for half of it. I told him that because I paid $45/$50 of the bet, that I was entitled to 90% of the winnings. He said that we went into the bet at 50/50, so he should still get half of it. We argued for the rest of the day. 
Later that day we saw the rest of our family and they all agreed that I should give him half and that IWTA. I felt that this was wrong but no one could be convinced otherwise. To save relationships I eventually agreed to take back my extra wager and then split the rest.
This all happened many years ago but I still feel that I was in the right. I‚Äôve told many other friends and colleagues to get their opinions and the vast majority disagree with me. So now I am submitting my story this community, the ultimate arbiters of morality. Please tell me, AITA for not wanting to split my winning with my brother?",53,85,0.94
1153,Not the A-hole,"So little backstory, I am a 24 year old female. I broke up with a long term boyfriend about 6 months ago. The break-up was very petty on his part, and was the reason that i lost a lot of my old ""friends"". I left everything behind when i left him and basically had to start my life over.

About 2 months after i had broken up with him, i started to make some new friends and relationships. Some of these were military people who were in/thinking of joining the military. These people that i met gave me a lot of insight into what military life is like (job stability, challenging environment, getting to move and see some of our country, great pension, ect). These friends by no means painted a pretty picture, they also told me about some of the not so great parts of the training and job, such as, sleeping in the snow during a field ex. They gave me the tools and their own experiences to consider, as well, i did a TON of research on my own about the military and the job that it entailed.

So in June i decided to apply to join the military for HR (its something i am currently doing as a civilian). In my country it is a very long and tedious process. This process includes a knowledge test, a medical evaluation, an interview, and a lot of background and personal credit checks. I have also been physically training like crazy since this application to try to get in shape and gain as much muscle as i can before i get accepted in and have to go to basic training. So i have basically been working my ass off since i started this application process. If/when i get in, i will be posted away from my home province for at least a year to a year and a half at minimum for basic training and trade training.

Now, this is where i am having unsure if i am being a selfish asshole for wanting to leave to join the military.

My father has a medical injury that makes it so he cannot live on his own. Currently he is living with my grandmother because hes still fairly young and does not qualify for getting put into a ""home"" per say. This was a decision that my family has made, and i am my fathers only child, also my parents are divorced. I told my family about me wanting to join the military , and they lost their shit. The one reason that they made clear that they didn't want me to go to the military was because they expect me to ""take over"" the care of my dad in the near future. I feel like this is extremely unfair to me because i have not even had a chance to live my life yet, start a family, and i just left a 5 year long relationship and had to start over. My aunt and uncle who are insisting that i take over this care, they have two teenage children, their own house, my uncle works from home, and they are way more stable to take over this care more than i am. This same aunt and uncle don't think i can handle a military environment as well. 

AITA for wanting to enlist to avoid having to take care of my father?",68,179,0.94
1154,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a group chat for fans of a very popular band (several music awards, millions of followers). It's small because it's made up of long time friends. I joined more recently through my partner who's been a fan for a decade.

One of them, let's call her May, posts in the chat asking to see people's tattoos inspired by or drawn by the band (the lead singer does doodles and puts them online). One of the images is a tattoo on a girl's forearm, clearly drawn by the lead singer. May comes back an hour later with an exact replica of that tattoo, down to the handwriting in it.

A google search shows it was a custom drawing by the lead singer to a fan who was able to contact her and ask for a tattoo design. The lead singer posted the design on Instagram, and outright says in the caption she designed it for a fan.

I wonder if May didn't know this was a custom design, so I asked her in the chat.

May: I know it's a custom piece, I just thought it was gorgeous and had to have it! If I ever find out who the girl is I'll tell her thanks.

Me: you just copied someone else's custom tattoo? 

May: yeah?

At this point one of our friends attempts to change the conversation and I let her. May doesn't.

May: seriously, is there a memo I missed about getting these drawings tattooed haha? What's so bad about this haha?

Me: It's generally considered disrespectful to copy someone else's tattoo. It's considered bad tattoo etiquette to copy a custom design. You can sometimes get away with it if you ask the original tattoo recipient if it's okay to copy it and you have their permission. But you didn't do that, you don't even know who she is, and you stole a piece of artwork that was made specifically for her. She asked the lead singer for a design for her tattoo, and you copied it directly without even considering how she might feel. 

May: wow. Okay. I don't even know what to say. Nobody owns these drawings except the lead singer. We're meant to be a community. I thought this was a safe space where we could celebrate each other and our differences. I thought we were a group of nice people. Guess I was wrong...

May leaves the group chat.

I am immediately criticised because ""it will be on May forever"" and I was too harsh. I apologised for being harsh, but to me all I did was explain why it's considered a bad idea to copy someone's custom design. I explain that I have custom tattoos, and if someone copied them from me, I would be devastated. That doesn't matter to any of them, I ""shouldn't have voiced my opinion"".

It takes a lot of effort to get the attention of the band. That girl must have been overjoyed to get a piece designed for her by her favourite singer, and that really upset me.

I've had to leave the group chat. My partner is also pissed at me. I messaged May individually to say I'm sorry for being harsh, and that it's a lovely tattoo, but it's important to be aware of why I said what I did. She's ignored me.",53,55,0.89
1155,Not the A-hole,"So long story short I‚Äôm a nerd and I‚Äôm school didn‚Äôt have much luck with girls, puberty helped me out a great deal however at heart I‚Äôm still pretty much a nerd. When I had no luck with girls and spent all my time learning cool things one thing I learnt was how to do a rubix cube, my average time is below 20 seconds (really rounded up but average).

Anyway I found out it was such a cool ice breaker and a party trick that impresses a lot of people, pretty soon I became known as that dude that could solve these things fast as hell and being semi attractive (sorry if it sounds like I‚Äôm bragging) but yeah I liked having the attention and etc can‚Äôt lie about that.

Anyways my friend decided to learn it as well, this annoyed me because he was learning it just to pick up girls but ragged on me for learning previously & he literally just followed a tutorial. It takes him like 30minutes or so to solve it and he‚Äôs only solved it once, but now whenever it comes up or I‚Äôm introduced to someone at a party friend will be there like it‚Äôs not that cool a trick I can do it too.

1156,Not the A-hole,"This conversation happened last year between a friend and I when she was looking for a new job.

At the time I managed a small team of analysts, and my friend asked me if I had ever given someone a job reference. I told her I had, multiple times throught the years, and I always try to be objective and fair but I never lie about anyone's qualifications, abilities or work performance. 

She asked me why I wouldn't lie and I told her I don't think that's ethical and I wouldn't feel comfortable exaggerating someone's abilities if I know it's not true. 

So I gave her an example. A few months before this conversation, I received a call from a previous employee asking for a reference. Now this employee was very good at bullshitting his way through a conversation, any projects I put him on, etc. But when it actually came time to doing the work, he couldn't. In the time he worked for me, which was about 4 months, I had at least 3 coaching sessions with him per week as I kept finding scenarios where whatever he wrote was either incorrect, didn't make sense, didn't align with our procedures or was missing information. Honestly, I was a little glad when he decided to quit because it was going downhill pretty quickly and I was getting tired with having to explain the same thing to him multiple times, him saying he understands and then me finding more scenarios about what we had just discussed which clearly showed he didn't understand or he didn't care.

The company we worked for was a financial institution, and there are government regulations we have to comply with, but this employee honestly didn't seem to care. It was a frustrating to deal with because like I said he knows how to bullshit in a conversation and he was actually very smart. But all the coaching sessions we had didn't seem to make any difference to his work.

Anyways, he asked me for a reference and I was a little hesitant because of the above but he begged me to give him one. I caved and said I would do it but based on his time here, is he sure he wants me to do it? He said yes, cause he didn't have anyone else to ask.

The reference was sort of like a survey, where they asked questions and my answer would be a number from 1 to 10.

So, I gave him mostly 6s and 7s. When I told my friend this, she flipped out and said I shouldn't have agreed to be his reference if I was going to give him a poor referral and how I'm ruining his chances of getting a new job and his livelihood. 

I don't agree with this because I did warn him.

1157,Not the A-hole,"I work in a leasing office and I‚Äôve been at my job for about 6 months. My coworker, M, has been here maybe a month longer than I have.

Within the past couple of months M has been making some really serious mistakes. Things like putting rent money into the wrong accounts, lost really important city inspection papers, amongst other things. 

M has been written up more than once, and our company has a 3 strike policy for write ups (write ups are only for large offenses and used only if an employee has already been warned about something). Today M really messed up and basically made it sound like our rental criteria was breaking Fair Housing laws and a bunch of other local laws. It‚Äôs a huge mess up, like we had to call company lawyers 

I‚Äôm getting promoted to a higher position, and because of that my current boss let me know the company is going to be letting M go by the end of the week. My boss wanted me to know because I‚Äôm going to be the only one in the office for a bit, and I‚Äôm going to have to work extra shifts until a new person is hired.

My friends say I‚Äôm TA for not warning M about their impending termination, they say I should give M a heads up. I just don‚Äôt think I should, especially since my boss told me this in confidence. My boss has been trusting me with a lot more because they‚Äôve been planning to promote me for some time now, and I feel like telling M would betray the trust my boss is showing in me.

Edit: just because a couple of people have asked/brought it up: my friends that I talked with don‚Äôt work with me, they don‚Äôt know M nor do they work in the same career field as I do if that helps at all.

Update: 

Corporate was actually willing to give M another chance and was going to have my boss put them on a probation of sorts. My boss went into the office early so they could tell M, but when my boss got there they found M in the leasing office vaping and apparently doing something else they didn‚Äôt disclose. 

So M has indeed been fired even though corporate was going to give them another go around.",476,2956,0.97

I agreed because I wanted the experience.

1160,Not the A-hole,"Hello, I'm still fairly new to reddit so if this isn't the right place for this, please let me know. 

A bit of background: I (F19) am a college freshman and share a dorm with another freshman (F16). I've never had to share a room before because all of my siblings are boys, so I'm not sure if there are any unspoken forms of etiquette that I don't know about. 

The issue at hand: My roommate sets her alarm for a good hour and a half before she gets up, with more alarms happening like every fifteen minutes (from like 6:30-8am). This in and of itself is not a problem for me, except for the fact that she never wakes up when they start going off and her alarm will just keep going and going until she finally gets up at 8 to turn it off. So basically, for an hour and a half her alarm is just constantly going off nonstop and I can't sleep because of it.

This isn't a major problem on MWF because I have to start getting ready for class at 7, so it only cuts into my sleeping time by 30 minutes, but on TR when I can sleep in all I want it gets super annoying because  I have no choice but to lay there and listen to her alarm, or leave the room (I can put headphones on, but I'd have to blast the music to cover the sound of her alarm which doesn't help in falling back asleep).

I just want to know if I'd be the asshole for bringing the issue up with her and trying to work something out. I've already had to talk with her about her taking her trash out (she'd left wet food containers, like ramen cups and tv dinner boxes, in there for almost a month which gave us a bug problem that is finally going away) but this doesn't seem as cut and dry as that.",25,30,0.98

We also have guns which I know how to shoot (fairly well).

My mother recently installed a bunch of cameras outdoors. We had a mini-spat earlier this week because she wouldn‚Äôt stop checking them and it kept logging me out of the app, but she‚Äôs finally chilled out on that.

My main problem is one that‚Äôs in the main living area. I should be out hanging out in the living room so the dogs aren‚Äôt lonely (she doesn‚Äôt work so they‚Äôre used to people being around), but I feel deeply uncomfortable having my every word recorded for future listening.

She checks it every time there‚Äôs a notification at night, I know this because she asked about one of the dogs making noise the other night.

I don‚Äôt know if this is just her worrying about me or if it‚Äôs a control thing (like, maybe she doesn‚Äôt trust me or something, but I‚Äôm kind of the epitome of a ‚Äúgood noodle‚Äù), but my feeling is that she either doesn‚Äôt understand how I feel about it or that this is her way of being controlling even when states away.

Side note: It wasn‚Äôt like the kids were playing for him boring and uninteresting beginner stuff. No, they were playing advanced and intricate repertoire just for him.

The reason why they have a piano is because his wife was looking for a hobby for herself and saw that my kids play and that I am a piano teacher myself.

So recently my roommate was showing off his new Samsung watch. When I asked how much he paid for it he told me at the time it was $250, implying he paid for it..Anyway, I found out today he claimed the watch after signing a year-long contract with Verizon, a contract we all split evenly, and there are four of us. So I just brought it up to him saying I wish he was more transparent about claiming a $250 watch with mine and my roommates' money. He basically turned the conversation around on me saying he would have been happy for me if I received a free watch and it doesn't matter because it was free. My argument is that since we're all paying for a service, which comes with a watch, then we should at least know about it. His argument is that the watch came free with the service and it doesn't affect what we're paying so it should not make a difference to us either way. Am I overreacting or is he being ridiculous?

1169,No A-holes here,"My (21M) first post here after lurking for a while. Hi, everybody.

About a year and a half ago, I noticed my twin brother starting wearing bra's and makeup one day. I didn't really know what to make of it at first, but after a while he told me he wanted to go by she from this point going forward. I was a bit taken aback at first and their were some missteps here and there but of course I want to abide by my now twin sisters wishes. (In hindsight there were definitely some signs of this coming on earlier in our lives but that's neither here nor there.)

The problem arises when she recently informed me that she wants to save up money to start a fund for her eventual transition. There would of course be no problem with this except for two things: Our family is in a dire financial situation at the moment. Our father and mother recently became separated and our father is no longer living in the house, and is providing close to zero financial assistance. We live in one of the most expensive counties in America with 3 younger siblings to take care of, as well as putting my 18 year old sister through college. Its taking the combined incomes of me, my mother, and my sister just to barely stay afloat.

The second issue is that she told me that she wants to fly get this surgery somewhere in the Philippines or Thailand, some Pacific Asian country I cant specifically recall. Maybe I'm just misinformed, but I was extremely worried about her cutting costs to get this life altering surgery done as quickly as possible, especially from a doctor not certified to do this type of thing in the US. I told her that I empathize with her situation, but I simply cant condone doing this extremely costly surgery in the type of place were in financially speaking right now, and getting surgery in a place that could be dangerous. Keep in mind that both of us make close to minimum wage as restaurant servers.

She told me that I just dont understand, that her whole life she's felt like she's been missing a part of herself and that this surgery would truly make her feel whole. I didn't really know what to say after that and we kind of stopped talking about it. I really do care for my twin and I want them to be happy and safe. I just don't know. AITA?

Edit: ""Can't"" was too strong of a word to use here and its not what I directly said to her. I know that she can do whatever she wants with her money, and I said that to her while we spoke about it. Essentially what I said to her was ""You can do whatever you want, but I really don't think you should do this right now in our situation. Please consider waiting a few years.""",100,178,0.88
1170,Asshole,"I was close to getting off work when a costumer came in and started being kinda flirty. I dealt with it by being professional. I mentioned that I was getting off work soon when he asked, and he offered to pay me six hundred dollars to get coffee. I could tell he had money because he was throwing it around the store, and I figured why not? It‚Äôs not like anything is going to happen in a busy coffee shop, and the coffee shop he was offering to take me to was right next door. 

So, I went and listening to him talk for two straight hours. I just nodded along, and he just kept talking, and talking, and ranting about work, and stuff like that. I must have said ten words the entire conversation. At the end, he said we should make an ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù and do this again. I said sure, but I was really not planning on doing this ever again. He gave me six hundred dollars, and then I left. 

I didn‚Äôt tell my boyfriend because he‚Äôd have freaked the hell out and told me not to go. Probably showed up at my work. I did tell him afterwords, though, and he was (obviously) really upset with me. He‚Äôs really mad, but I don‚Äôt really get why? I didn‚Äôt do anything with this guy. I just had coffee, listened to him talk for an hour, got six hundred dollars, and that was that. 

If some ‚Äúsugar momma‚Äù was going to pay him six hundred dollars just to have coffee, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it. I did nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do with a friend. 

Speaking of rich coffee dude, I messaged him after talking to my boyfriend and I told him that I couldn‚Äôt do this again. Sorry about that. He replied and said it was cool. So, at least he was a nice guy about the whole thing. 

So, am I the asshole?

1172,Everyone Sucks,"Sounds a little bad but hear me out here. So I've been working in a small office for almost a year now. I'm the only guy in the office. Now I also want to point out that I am also the youngest in the office (I'm in my late 20s while all the women in the office are in their 30s and up). I'm a pretty reserved guy and honestly don't talk too much compared to my co-workers. They often rag on me, telling me to open up and stuff. They are constantly gossiping in the office about sex, their relationships, hook-ups, etc, etc. A couple of the younger women even make jokes about wanting to take me out drinking so I would ""loosen up"" and ""stay over at their place for the night"". I've even gotten repeated comments about how nice my butt looks when I wear a certain pair of pants that fit me a bit tighter than the other pants I have. Anyway, just thought context was a bit important here.

After working in the office for about a year now, I feel like I'm finally starting to get comfortable with everyone in the office. So I'm talking to my co-workers about how one of my college friends is coming to visit me for the weekend and I tell them that I'll be going out for some drinks. At this point one of my younger co-workers says she will likely be out for some drinks with her friends as well and that we should meet up for a drink if we are in the same area (one of the same women that invited me out previously and made jokes about hooking up with me). I agree and then I said to her, ""Hey maybe you can introduce me to one of your friends? Or maybe if you get me drunk enough, I could steal you away and bring you back to my place for the night.""

At that point I'm smiling at her and my own joke, but she clearly didn't find the comment amusing. She didn't say anything to me after being visibly upset and immediately walked away from me. I immediately felt bad, but I was only joking and I thought I was well within the boundaries of the typical work place talk that happens. Anyway, I get pulled aside from my boss later because she heard about what happened. I was basically just given a slap on the wrist because I think she knows about the type of dialogue that happens in the office but essentially I was told if I make comments like that again I might lose my job.

I don't know I'm just really confused. I feel like there is a massive double standard here, I've been told multiple times to ""lighten up"" in the office and when I finally try and make a joke about something that is commonly talked about in the office, I feel like I got reprimanded because I'm a male? Maybe it was the way I said it or something. Idk what do you guys think, AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes I know the joke wasn't funny. I didn't mean ""joke"" as in ""knock knock, who's there? Joke"" I mean't it as ""kidding around, banter joke."" I wasn't expecting it to be a knee slapper. I also did apologize to her after I was pulled aside from my boss and we are fine now, but clearly there is still a bit of tension about it. I honestly really did think she kinda liked me and I was just trying to continue banter that she already had made with me previously.",60,76,0.86
1173,Not the A-hole,"I honestly thought I was justified (and still kinda do) but my family strongly disagrees, so here goes. 

My (24f) mom always hosts a family dinner for her birthday, and invites our close family members, about a dozen people total. But she's recently broken her hand and hurt her elbow, so right now she can't really cook. No one else volunteerd to host the party, my dad and siblings don't really cook. So I told her I'd do it. Sidenote: I'm a vegetarian. 

No one really asked any questions, so I didn't go out of my way to tell everyone, I thought it was implied I wouldn't be cooking meat. I thought wrong.

Her birthday came, I went shopping and spend most of the day in the kitchen. I made three vegetable dishes, two starches, and dessert, making sure to include my mom's favourites, and some of the more popular side dishes at the usual dinner parties. 

The dinner came, it was fun but it seemed tense. No one really mentioned anything. After the dinner a few people (about 3, but that's still 1/4 of the guests) texted me that I should have told them there was no meat, that maybe they could bring their own or at least 'manage their expectations'. 

I tried to give neutral answers to the people texting me, but I let my parents know that I won't be hosting again. My mom understands (she was the only one who showed up early to help, so she knows how much work went into those dishes). But my dad thinks it's rude to refuse to host, and that I should just cook meat next time to please the family. I refused again. 

I mean, I'm clearly bias, but I didn't think it was wrong. Some family members do disagree, so I came here. 

AITA?

Edit: My mom doesn't prepare meat every single year, just most (maybe 8/10 times?). So though uncommon, it has happened before. It's one of the reasons I didn't think I needed to mention it. Half of the dishes I picked are from previous dinner parties too.

INFO: Everyone knows I'm vegetarian.

INFO: I cooked mac and cheese, potato gratin, parmesan roasted cauliflower, fried zucchini, and baked brussel sprouts. As well as blueberry pie.

MORE INFO: The party was at my house, everyone knew I'd be cooking and that I'm vegetarian. We've had mac and cheese as a main dish once before (though I made it without bacon) and it wasn't a problem, so I didn't think I'd have to notify people that I wouldn't be cooking meat.


EDIT: Well I didn't think eating mac and cheese as a main dish would be one of the most controversial things in my post. Is it really that different from eating pasta for dinner? In my family it's completely normal.",1618,4367,0.94

1179,Asshole,"So my office is really tight-knit and really keen on birthdays. We always celebrate every team member's birthday, with a little mini party during the day, and drinks/dinner at night. The cake is particularly a big deal, and usually people are very specific about what they want. We recently hired a new girl who so far has been great, and her birthday happened to be this week, so I set about asking her last week what kind of cake she wanted. She didn't ask for something really specific, but she specified that she'd like any kind of ice cream cake, any kind of cake with fruit and cream, or with interesting tea flavors. She also said absolutely no vegan cakes and no chocolate, which as you can guess, puts this cake off the list for most people. 

We have a few people with dietary restrictions, and they've mentioned feeling a bit sad at being left out before, so I thought it was pretty unfair of her to specify that she wants to exclude some people. Of course, no chocolate is also difficult to deal with with an office full of people since most people love chocolate. We've had wacky requests before, but it still seemed really off to me especially since she's so new. And since I'm technically in charge of the whole day party thing, I thought it would be nice if I could find something that she loved but that also everyone could enjoy. I ordered a beautiful matcha and strawberry vegan cake from a local bakery whose vegan baked goods I've had before, and thought it would be great. 

Come to the party. Everything was fine and good, she thought the cake looked beautiful, she was super happy...until she bit into it. Somehow, she could tell it was vegan. She asked me if it was, I confirmed, and she put the piece back down, gave me a look, and kind of walked off. 

My boss was pretty pissed and basically told me that I need to redo the party and get her a proper cake for the evening party and another one on Friday to make up for this. Apparently, everyone had already gushed to her about their various cakes and that kind of thing. On top of that, my boss mentioned she is an extremely valuable asset to the team, and that he knew for a fact she had other great offers. It was implied that if she left because of this, I'd be in hot water. 

I still think I'm not totally in the wrong for trying to include everyone, and I also think I can't be reasonably blamed if she does take another job. I really really thought she'd like the cake and it'd be a win for everyone, I wasn't trying to be petty or snarky. AITA?",271,298,0.86
1180,Not the A-hole,"This is literally happening today. I have to make a choice but I want to make sure I'm not going overboard.

My father passed down a guitar to me when he passed. It was a first run Fender Stratocaster, in pretty much immaculate condition, too. That is, if you don't count the natural aging, being exposed to air, etc. These can retail for $10,000-$15,000 brand new but I got it appraised around $7,000 due to the use.

Maybe some of you know a bit about guitars and maybe some don't. This guitar had a warped neck. Wood is pliable, it will contort and twist and bow with time (and tension, as guitars do). The neck was rotated about 10 or so degrees.

I brought it to a shop to fix this. It's trivial for a technician to fix, but sort of out of the scope for consumers. I don't have the tools for this, plus I wanted it done right.

Yesterday I brought it to the shop and today I returned to the neck completely snapped by the headstock. The technician said there was some cracks in the wood inside the neck itself, so when he adjusted it, it just broke off.

I can't even get a replacement neck of the era, or even a modern one that matches the serial as the manufacturer won't do that. There's still value in the body, about $1,000, but without the matching neck, it's not as prized as it was, even with the warped neck.

The shop has no insurance on these types of things so I want to personally file suit against the technician for $6,000. It's worth more to me but I'm going off of appraisals rather than sentimentality.

But would I be the asshole? It had damage in the neck, allegedly, which contributed to it snapping. It wasn't entirely his fault and it was honestly a fluke of physics. But money talks.",240,1446,0.95

* We've been dating for about eight months and it's going great!

* My gf recently lost a bunch of weight and is really enjoying her new found body image and confidence. I'm very happy for her.

* She has a close knit group of friends and they go camping and swimming outdoors, often skinny dipping. They have a trip to Hawaii in a week with a lot of camping and outdoor activities. I won't unfortunately be able to join them.

* Considering that she's now in a steady relationship and she confessed that one of her friends had expressed his feelings for her and they'd been in a fling for a while (but never went anywhere) I thought she shouldn't be doing anything that adds any tension to the group.

* She thinks it's long in the past (less than 3 years) and shouldn't be an issue and that me insisting on what she does is somewhat controlling.

1185,Everyone Sucks,"So my girlfriend needed to pick up her friend from across town and I had to go with her because her parents knew she had to go with me. My girlfriend's driving makes me SO uneasy. She has already almost hit a pedestrian, and has made some ridiculous driving decisions while I was in the car. All in all, girlfriend sucks at driving, with all due respect.

Her car is outside her parents' bedroom window so her mom can literally look outside and see that I'm in the passenger seat. She wanted to take her own car to put gas in it. I'm okay with my girlfriend driving when there's barely any traffic and especially pedestrians. But at night, everyone is going home and people are out driving like idiots. I told her she can drive another time, and I should drive across town.

By the way, this friend has her own car and can easily drive, but chose not to because ""she doesn't like driving.""

My girlfriend put gas in her car and we were ready to go, and I told her she shouldn't drive at night because it's a bit more risky. She started yelling at me and I got tired of it so I just gave her the keys. On the way there, she cut off a handful of people and the way she stops the car is so bad that I can't take it anymore. She promised me I will drive home on the way home, and she started getting mad at me again.

I don't feel good about her driving at night, because she has a permit and you can tell by the way she drives that she is an amateur. She sometimes strays in between two lanes, and if a cop happens to pull her over, I'm screwed too, since  I'm not old enough to be in the car with us two by ourselves if she is behind the wheel. Now I am the one who gets in trouble too.

I told her and her friend that we picked up and they started ridiculing me. I don't want to break the law when it was easily avoidable, and if I get caught, I would get a hefty fine.

So AITA for trying to not let my girlfriend drive?

Edit: I am 18 years old. For this to not be illegal, I have to have a license and be over 21 or 25. I‚Äôve had my license for a year and a half, but if we get pulled over, I‚Äôm breaking the law as much as she is.

1187,Not the A-hole,"Been at this gym over a year, in the past week I've had to gripe at people who leave no indication they are using a machine because myself or someone else gets on them and they come back and say ""no no no, I'm using that"".
Incident 1 was last Thursday. Guy is on the squat machine and kept leaving. Like completely leave the area for a water fountain drink or whatever. Three people came over during these periods since it looked obvious no one was using it and he came back on all of them ""no no no, I'm using this"". These folks were even nice enough to help him put the weights back on since they had time to take them off.
People were still waiting so I went  the front desk myself since I watched this for half an hour and got the guy off with the other corroboration of events and confirmed that if you leave the area, the machine is fair game. 
Incident 2 was yesterday. Free bench press is free so I start setting up. Here comes a regular from completely elsewhere where he was ""spotting a girl"" with ""no no no, I'm using it"". I told him there was no indication (tower, bottle, him there, whatever) that this wasn't free and he gets annoyed about it and says we can take it to the front desk. I told him I already had just a few days ago and they told me that if no one's there and no indication they are using it, it's fair game. 
That resolved that issue because I went to the assisted one, but twice in one week for the first time in a year? I don't want to be THAT guy and act like the police of the gym or keep going to the front desk so should I leave this be?

1190,Not the A-hole,"Using throwaway..

  I don't think I am in the wrong but just wanted to check with the sub if I am overreacting. 

  My older sister (49F) is a bit of a loudmouth. I (47m) have two other younger siblings. We are all pretty close but a realization just dawned on me  that my older sister has been a bit of a saboteur all my life. This realization came because of an incident that happened recently. 

Background: When we were younger, my sister used to be really good singer.  I loved to sing as a child but every time I tried, I was told by my sister how horrible I was at it. My mom backed her up too. So, I always assumed I couldn't sing and that it was a skill one was born with. 

  This stayed with me all my life. About a year ago, I decided this is something I really have to give a shot. I did some research and learned that with enough training and practice one can get reasonably decent at it.   I have been taking lessons for over a year now and have improved quite a bit. I recently sang at a large gathering. People really liked my performance and I got a bunch of kudos for it. I sent the video to my family. My sister called and completely flew off the handle. Telling me that I was wasting my time and that I couldn't sing. She ranted for quite a bit. I told her I was not looking for her encouragement or validation. This is a hobby and I am happy with where I am at and hung up. 

  But then I got thinking. I was taken aback by her reaction. I started thinking back to all the things that have ever transpired between us and came to the realization that she has always been sabotaging me. Not in a super obvious way but very strategically placed sabotages here and there. She would ruin my relationships with some well placed 'harmless' comments here and there. Nip away at my self-esteem at every opportunity. She even had me believing for a long time as children that I was adopted (She claims this was a joke). This has been a pattern all my life. She is not even self-aware to know what she has been doing and will absolutely not acknowledge any of it if I brought it up. She will laugh it off and gaslight me if I bring it up. 

  I don't doubt that in her own way she loves me. I am just perplexed at this behavior since I have had the realization of her sabotaging behavior. On my part, I think I have been great with all my siblings. I am very successful in life and I have made it a point to help them out as much as possible monetarily and in other ways. She has borrowed from me in the high five figures over the years and I have never even asked her to ever repay it. 

About ten years ago, I started cutting out all the toxic people from my life. This has worked really well for me and made my life much simpler. Now I am wondering if I need to dissociate from my toxic sister. I am considering severing all contact with her.

1191,No A-holes here,"I'm getting married on a shoestring budget next month and we've already received all of our RSVPs back with food choice. We offered pork, beef, and salmon options. We received three RSVPs with handwritten choices: two for halal, one for vegan. We didn't have a checkbox for these, they handwrote it and sent them back.

I can understand the vegan option but not the halal one. I thought beef and salmon were halal? We spoke to our caterer about adding these options and it's not in our budget. I'm talking $600 extra to cater to these three individuals, our entire wedding is only about $3,000, so this would increase our budget by 20%, just to cater to these three. The fact we're being nickel and dimed is besides the fact, it's too late to change caterers, not like we could afford to lose the deposit, anyways.

Would we be the assholes for ignoring these RSVP food choices and just serve what we have? If it changes anything, no one is Muslim or Muslim-observant of our invitees. I don't want to sound insensitive but it's likely two people being trendy or being particular for the sake of it.

An alternative I thought of was we'd prepare a halal and vegan offering ourselves and give this to these guests, but I think the idea is they want the caterer to supply the food. I'm not a chef, nor is my wife. It'd cost us maybe $50 to make these three plates, but it wouldn't be professional.

I dont know if this post is allowed due to rule 3. if so please remove it and I apologize. English is also not my first language so please be paitient with me. Now here is to the issue:   


I met my now wife several years ago when she was an exhange student in my country (Sweden). Long story short we clicked, got married and I moved with her to the US. Since sunday we are also now parents to a wonderful little baby boy and everything went fine with delivery. Now the problem is that my wife is jewish, she isnt religious her self but her father is and her uncle is a rabbi. I my self is an atheist and not a vocial antagonist towards it, I just think alot of it is silly and realy dont care much about it.    


Yesterday she dropped the bomb about him getting his circumcision when her family arrived, and baffled at the time I said no way am I maiming my son, if he wants to do it when he is older by his own free will its absolutley fine, but I refuse to let anyone do such a potential dangerous thing for something silly as religon! This did not land well and we had a big fight over it, it meaning alot to her and her pepole/family. She has never expressed any religious desires like this before (we have celebrated some jewish events but we have also skipped alot out of convinience). As I see it there are tonnes of potential risks, difficulty mastrubating etc so I realy dont want this for my son.  


Now it seam strange we never discussed this earlier, and in retrospec we realy should have,  but it realy was not in my thoughts since its an uncommon practice in Sweden, unless needed for medical reasons. Even if it legaly only require one parents consent in our state, any doctor will refuse unless both parents are on board.  Essentially she called me and asshole and a friend of hers agree.

1199,Not the A-hole,"My younger sister \[19F\] moved in with me \[22f\] (and my bf 24/m) due to a long list of reasons but mostly because of childhood trauma that made it hard for her to live with my mom. 

The finances part was clear- she would pay for everything (groceries, food, gas, her car, electricity, water) other than rent to allow her to save to move out

So, now to the problems. I understand that she can be tired because she‚Äôs working so much to save money, so I don‚Äôt really push her to do many things. 

Here‚Äôs a list of everything I have asked her to do since she moved in three weeks ago:

Clean my bathroom after she shaved her head the first night she got here - she did sweep it ONCE and I asked her several times to clean it again since her hair was EVERYWHERE. She never did.

Stop using all of my towels - I had six extra towels before she got here. She currently has ALL of them. I have asked her at least three times to do laundry so I can have them back and to not use so many towels. 

PUT HER DISHES IN THE DISHWASHER - She leaves stuff out anyway but when she does clean it up, she will wipe the food into the trash and then leave it on the counter next to the dishwasher instead of into it. 

Clean the kitchen - this was a last ditch effort this weekend to get her to help out. I literally had to remind her every five minutes for two hours before she had work before she finally went to clean it ten minutes before she had to leave. She wiped the counters and did a shitty sweeping job and left.

Help put groceries away - she has done this once since she got here. This weekend I asked her to help put them up when we returned and she straight up just said no and refused after my bf and I had just gone and bought groceries including some for her

Pay for her shit - The only money I‚Äôve gotten from her so far has been through my mom who has access to her bank account. Anytime I have asked her to venmo me money, she says she will and then never does

Clean her room - I only got her to do this ONCE when I literally said she couldn‚Äôt eat dinner with us if she didn‚Äôt clean her room. Since then, it has abruptly gone back into chaos

All of this stuff is really really small which is why it makes me think I‚Äôm overreacting, but she is living here rent fucking free. I‚Äôm at my wits end, and straight up am about to sit her down and either a) tell her she needs to get her shit together or I‚Äôm kicking her out because, really, I think I‚Äôm asking for the bare minimum here or b) start charging her like five dollars per thing I ask her to do that she doesn‚Äôt.

So reddit, I leave it to you, is my climbing rage legit or is it not that deep?

(she didn‚Äôt spent it ALL for herself but also bought stuff for our apartment or paid the bill for us when we were eating out, but I would say when we go out we fairly split it 50/50, like she pays 5 times and I pay 5 times)

I‚Äôm earning less and still managed to put away 4k(!) in the last years as an Emergency Fund, and 1k other Savings. Also got 2.2k tax money, more on that later.

She lost her job at the beginning of this year, now gets the same amount as me every month, which worked totally fine for the first months.

Now since March she became sick and has medical bills of 500‚Ç¨ per month and I already paid this once, and her parents twice. 

I saved money for a new Apple Watch, and wanted to go buy it today. Told her yesterday, she flipped out. Told me I‚Äôm TA for getting myself something nice instead of paying her bills when I know she struggles with paying them herself. I told her I already used all the money (and more) I got back from taxes for our 10-day vacation to Greece last month because she couldn‚Äôt afford it, but she wanted to go with me and I didn‚Äôt want to go alone (of course, why would I take a vacation without my gf when I can afford to pay for both of us?). I told her it‚Äôs fine for me that I paid the trip for both of us because I love her, but I can‚Äôt use all my savings only for her, because when she earned more than me I always told her she should set up an Emergency Fund!

As I said above *I do* have an Emergency Fund of 4k, but my gf doesn‚Äôt know about this and I‚Äôm not gonna tell her, because for her that would be free money. She knows I probably have *some savings* but I guess she thinks of 1k or something.

Of course I‚Äôm gonna use some of my savings to help her but ...

Reddit, am I TA for wanting to get a new Apple Watch for me?

**UPDATE #1**

Obligatory *‚Äùdidn‚Äôt expect so many comments‚Äù* but I really didn‚Äôt! Thanks so much everyone, and I‚Äôll try to keep you updated and give you more **INFO:**

I already replied to someone but I want to say it again: My gf is not in debt (and probably won‚Äôt be, and I‚Äôll not let her go into debt because that means she wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford her half of the rent)

Yes she‚Äôs struggling if she‚Äôs paying her bills herself. She can‚Äôt buy anything else for the rest of the month because of her bills. I paid the vacation because of that. 

Our monthly expenses are still being paid.

It‚Äôs a serious three-year-relationship, living together for 1.5 yrs. 

The medical bills are temporary and I expect them to be 100 % paid in December. I‚Äôll have a talk to her about this again, but we‚Äôve always been talking *december is the last payment* and I trust her on that.

**UPDATE #2**

Thanks so much guys, very good comments. What I learned so far is it‚Äôs probably *ESH* (and NTA/YTA also looks like 50/50?) and that I‚Äôll have a talk with her about money. 

Also, we love each other. We don‚Äôt have big arguments about much other stuff but this one stuck with me as I didn‚Äôt realise I *could* potentially be TA for using my savings for myself.

There are no red flags (except this one if you want to call it a red flag). She‚Äôs a lovely woman. We‚Äôre not gonna break up because of this.

**UPDATE #3**

I‚Äôm still rereading the comments because I only had a few minutes of time here and there. 

Looks like the judgement is ***NTA***! Thank you for that, but I see many many good comments saying YTA or ESH and I respect that!

We‚Äôre gonna have a talk later this week but I also have made my decision. I‚Äôm going to get the Watch either way. That‚Äôs what *I* saved for. I know we‚Äôre in this situation together but I also know she‚Äôs not going into debt, can ask her parents for money, and I still have my Emergency Fund when things get *really tight*. 

Also, this is in Europe. And it‚Äôs a real story. I‚Äôm not going to disclose any more information but even though health care in Europe is great, believe it or not it still SUCKS for edge cases.

Gonna update once we had the talk.

1201,Asshole,"EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their responses. I would be the asshole if I don't talk to her about it and thank you to all of you who threw in that 3rd option I didn't see right in front of my face. I'll see if she would be amenable to the idea of her paying a hostel rate for a hotel room. 

&#x200B;

My friend and I are travelling to USA & Canada for Christmas and New years eve. We've already paid for flights and our tour but we're arriving two days early to do our own thing in New York. The problem is my friend recently quit her job and can't afford the 50/50 split for a hotel.

I don't think she fully understands just how awful it's going to be flying from Australia to LA to Washington and then taking a train from Washington to New York with only a few hours of waiting in airports and train stations in between. She's never flown outside of Australia before and thinks I'm being hyperbolic/dramatic about the griminess and fatigue of not doing anything for extended hours let alone the massive jet lag we'll have.

I've already made a lot of financial allowances like the fact we're flying to Washington and railing it to New York instead of flying direct from LA because it worked out cheaper and we're leaving on the 1st of January despite the fact we'll be up all of the 31st because it's New Years. I really wanted to spend another 3 days after so I could sleep for most of the 1st and have fun on the 2nd and leave on the 3rd but due to her financial situation we have to fly out on the 1st.

I want to arrive in New York after essentially 36hrs of travel and just have a private hotel room, shower and rest. But she can only afford a hostel for those two nights. I don't really want to spend a little amount of money to be in a shared room with strangers when I could spend just a little more and have a private room shared with only my friend.

I don't want her to be burdened with owing me after the trip or having it hang over her head while we are in North America, cause I know I'd feel like shit if she had paid for a hotel room that I couldn't afford, but it's my holiday too.

Would I be the asshole if I just booked a hotel and have her pay me back her half when she gets a job next year?",66,80,0.98

1203,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôll keep it short, I (29M) live in a three bedroom apartment with my flatmate Peter (32M). 

One of Peter‚Äôs friends, Shane (31M), recently stayed with us for a week or so after he moved out of his apartment before travelling overseas on an extended holiday. I wasn‚Äôt fussed by this at the time as it was only for a few days. 

Following the first time he stayed with us for a week or so, and before his extended holiday, Shane went on a short trip home for about two weeks but has now came back to our apartment for a few nights.

Tonight I got home from work and thought I had the place to myself as Peter works nights. After I had a shower I heard Peter in the living room playing music, and while I thought it was a little strange (it was around 10 pm and he usually wouldn‚Äôt do that on weeknights when I work the next day), I went to say hi when I noticed Shane drinking and making out with a woman I don‚Äôt know on our lounge. 

I left Shane in the living room, went to my room and sent Peter a few messages telling him we need to talk about a few things tomorrow. He obviously realised something was up and we exchanged a few messages about Shane in which I basically said I thought it was not cool a guest in our apartment (who wasn‚Äôt paying rent) had decided to bring someone back to our place. I told Peter that if Shane wanted to do that he should either get a hotel room or have gone back to her place, particularly given Peter wasn‚Äôt home with him. 

Peter than accused me of being an asshole and said Australian hospitality is lacking (I‚Äôm Aussie, Peter is Russian and Shane is Dutch). I said Shane was taking the piss and if he wasn‚Äôt paying rent he needed to leave tomorrow. 

I should add, when he first stayed with us Shane either slept on a mattress in the lounge room or Peter‚Äôs room. Since then my other housemate has moved out and Shane has been staying in the third bedroom this time, although we have a new flatmate moving in later this week so that would have had to change shortly.

1206,Asshole,"Last week I attended a professional conference for work and met a few really interesting and cool people in industry. One of them, Grace, was especially lovely and cool. After I got home, I looked through everyone's cards intending to Google them, but started with Grace. One of the first things to come up is a video of her performing an original song on stage at a club. It was phenomenal. The video had been uploaded in 2015 and barely had any views (low 200s), and I was shocked because it was so good. 

So, I posted the video on Twitter mentioning I'd met Grace from (Company) at (Industry)Con and she had more talents than just (Industry). I have about 50k followers on my personal account (mostly fans of my company's products but a few industry people) and it was a modest 'hit' as far as tweets go with a few thousand likes and about 400 retweets. The views on the original video are now around 3600.

Two days later, Grace contacted me through my work e-mail furious telling me to take the video down. She said that she had been trying to get the club to remove the video (part of a showcase from years ago) or remove her name from it but the venue closed and no one is monitoring the account, and YouTube wasn't helpful. She said I overstepped my boundaries and thinks that I did it intentionally to embarrass her, since I didn't @ her in the post (I didn't know her Twitter name, the only one with her name was locked and didn't have her picture). She threatened to report this to my boss if I didn't take it down, which I eventually did.

I don't think I was being an asshole. I had no idea it was something she'd be embarrassed by since it was already online, and it was a really good song. I thought giving her a boost would be a nice gesture since I have a pretty high follower account for a regular Joe. AITA?",84,213,0.88

1208,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons. I‚Äôve lived with my girlfriend for about a year. They have three dogs. 2 yellow labs and a very old pug. They don‚Äôt harm the animals and treat them very nicely. But for all hours of they day they are alway in a cage. If they are inside they are inside of a cage that is just enough to lay down in and they all have about no hair on their elbows (which I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs linked to being in a cage all the time but I don‚Äôt see it in other dogs so I think so) and if put outside they are inside of a bigger cage for all of them but there is poop all around it that they just hose to the side. I don‚Äôt say anything because it isn‚Äôt my family but I feel very bad for the dogs and would like to help them.  WIBTA if I reported them to some animal shelter?

EDIT: they aren‚Äôt crate training them. They are trained. No one is allowed to let the dogs roam the house. If they are inside they are in their crate.  From what I hear from the family they used to roam but for a few years they‚Äôve only been allowed in a cage.",73,194,0.93

1210,Not the A-hole,"So here's the deal. I'm a lesbian as is my gf. Before we started dating, she already had a girls night established with some of her friends. I have no problem with this in general and kinda like having the house to myself when she goes to someone else's place and it's important to spend time with your friends. The problem is when she hosts. She expects me to leave the house. 

This feels kinda cruel to me for a few reasons. First, I don't really have anywhere to go. I end up going to see a movie alone or something and wandering around until I can come home. At the moment, I don't really have any friends to do things with. Second, I'm a girl too. If the event were simply ""no partners"" and not ""girls night"" I'd get it a bit more, but a few of the women in the group dated for a bit and both were and are allowed to go to girls night. This makes it feel just kind of arbitrary that I can't attend if they are in my house, let alone that I have to leave. Third, it is literally my house. I own it. My gf does contribute some financially, so I don't want to minimize her contributions, but I bought the place before we met and being kicked out of my own house does not sit well with me.

So, WIBTA if I refused to leave next girls night?

**Edit**: Wow. Way more comments than I expected. I'm putting up this edit to express my thanks. I've gained a much greater appreciation for how my SO is feeling and I've changed my mind about refusing to leave. This is the women I love wanting a relatively simple thing from me fairly infrequently. As much as I hate going out on weeknights, I think I've been a bit of a stubborn asshole. It's her home too and I don't need to be there all the time.",1623,9995,0.94
1211,Not the A-hole,"My daughter missed the first week back at school as she caught flu. Her attendance is now barely over 80%. This wasn't her fault, and it happens, but because it happened so early in the year it's hard to make up for it. The second her attendance went below 90% they sent an attendance officer round to verify she was sick even after I rang in and they explicitly told me to keep her off for the rest of the first week. Her school is from 8am to 3pm every day except Wednesday, when she gets out at 2pm.

Her dance rehearsals are usually at 3:30pm on Wednesdays and a longer session at 10am on Saturday. The dance classes are on the grounds of another school, a 40 minute drive from her school, and an hour from home. Because on Wednesdays she gets out at 2pm, this gives us an hour and a half to make the 40 minute drive and let her get ready.

2 weeks ago the instructor said that the class would be changing from Wednesday to Friday. The first week I tried to get her there as close to on time as possible, but she wasn't ready to begin until 3:50. The next week I told her to get changed in the back seat of the car, but she still wasn't prepared to start until 3:45. Both weeks she has gotten in trouble for being late. I explained to the instructor why she was late and she said that it wasn't her problem, I should just get my daughter out of school sooner. I rang the school and asked if she could even leave 10 or 15 minutes earlier on Friday, but they had the same response as the instructor: not their problem. They said that if I wanted her to leave school sooner then I would have to sign her out, but their policy states that this has to be done at least an hour before school ends. They warned me that as she has 5 lessons a day, this would take 1/5th of a day off her attendance each time.

I told my daughter what her instructor and school had said, and told her that because of her missed time I wasn't comfortable with letting her miss the final lesson of the week, every week. She said it wasn't her fault she missed that time, but I told her that the school doesn't care whose fault it was, just that she was barely over 80% attendance.

There is a second, nearer dance class, 5 minutes from her school. She tried it when she was around 8 but all her friends went (and still go) to the other class so she wanted to be with them.

I told her that she had 2 options: she could stick with her current class, but I wouldn't get her out of school early, so she would have to deal with being late or she could go to the nearer studio and she wouldn't be late.

She got mad at me and is saying I'm being unfair. Am I?

Edit: not saying my daughter is the asshole. She isn't. I guess the other potential assholes are the school(s) in this situation but not my daughter.

Info: We're in England. I've said that GCSEs should be a priority, but she wants to pursue a career in dance, but knows that this is unlikely. I've said that when she gets to sixth form she can do an A Level in dance, so long as she does at least 2 other academic subjects with it. In order to do the dance course she wants to do at college, she must achieve either a grade 4 or 5 (don't remember which) in dance, which she can get at the studio she is currently at, but not at the closer one. She is working towards it now. If she does not achieve this certificate, she must do a dance b-tech, which means she cannot do any additional courses at sixth form. I've told her this is not happening. While she is talented, she cannot put all her eggs in one basket, and she understands this.",312,1258,0.95
1212,Not the A-hole,"So a friend of mine (20) got fired from his job as an electrician 2 years back and has lived with his parents since then. He was fired because he was afraid of heights and just would not climb ladders. For this whole time he complained about not having money, not being able to go out anywhere. He had a short employment at McDonalds but quit the first day after saying he was allergic to the dish soap they used and later on worked a week in retail but quit because it was too monotonous for him. Other than that, nothing and he spent a year with his parents, having them pay for all his expenses.

So I decided to help him out and drove him to a job center. He got several job offers and gladly told me about how excited he was. 2 months pass and he hasn't sent out a single application. I asked him why, and he told me it was because he had no PC to write one and didn't want to bother any of his friends about it, including me. I was annoyed but agreed to help him write applications and invited him over. And when he arrived, he presented his job offers to me. All of them had expired. That's when I kinda lost my patience.

I yelled at him: ""Are you kidding me? Of course you're not going to get a job if you can't stick with shit and are too lazy to even get an application together on time!... Etc.""

Now he doesn't talk to me anymore and continues to be unemployed to this day. So am I the asshole?",317,2377,0.95

1214,Not the A-hole,"A week or so ago while driving my daughter to her swimming practice I spotted some school mates of hers, still in uniform, out walking their dog, which happened to be actively shitting. I saw them pick up the poo in a bag, but all they did was tie it up and then put the bag on the grass and start walking away. I have a pretty big issue with both littering and people leaving their shit (pun intended) for others to deal with. With this in mind I pulled over to ask them why they were leaving it in the grass for someone else to deal with.

My daughter was extremely embarrassed from the get go and pleaded with me to say nothing, and the kids were extremely combative and told me that they were going to pick it up on the way back and didn't want to spend the walk carrying a smelly bag around. I told them that nobody else wanted to smell it on the path either, and to stop being so selfish. At one point one of the boys of the group told me to fuck off and tried to convince the rest of them to leave, until I took out my phone and threatened to inform the school of what they were doing while in uniform, and also the police as there is a few hundred dollar fine for leaving dog shit behind (this was more to scare them than anything).

They did take the bag with them after that, but since then my daughter has been furious at me, and apparently I've earned the name of ""dog shit man"" at her school, and now she is known as ""dog shit daughter"". I personally find the name they've given me hilarious, but I am unhappy that she's being called that and plan to see the school to deal with it.

Rather than fault her peers for being petty and bitter over being called out, my daughter completely blames me for this situation and thinks I was in the wrong. My wife is on the fence and said she understands why I did it, but I shouldn't have done it while my daughter was in the car with me and easily identifiable.

1216,Asshole,"  First off it's not my intent to misgender but this is new to me so excuse me. One of my friends recently came out as trans and said she always felt like a guy trapped inside a woman's body.



  She has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. I have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and I don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   We don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. I mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and I think our feelings overtake his. Plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. I don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings.

1217,Not the A-hole,"A few weeks back, I arrived back from a vacation. I took a bus to get back to my hometown from the airport, which took roughly two hours. Since the tickets for the bus were so cheap when I bought them (a few months in advance), I bought both of front row seats on my side. The bus was a double-decker, so I even had a decent view. The main reason however was I wanted some privacy, since the plane would be much more jammed, and I didn't want to suffer the rest of the trip. I'm also 188 cm tall so some buses can be a problem for me.  
  
Anyway, my plane lands and I make my way to the bus, and get to my seat. I sit on the window seat and put my belongings on the aisle seat. Even though there were no reserved seats when I bought my tickets, it was apparent the bus would be full. When the bus leaves, I see a kid (about six to seven years old) come to the front, look at the empty seat and leave. Soon, his mom comes up to me and asks if it would be fine for her son to sit at the front. She says that they had to buy seats at the back, and her son gets nauseous when travelling there. She also says her kid really wants to sit at the front, in front of the huge window.  
  
I really didn't want to have a potentially vomiting kid next to me, on a seat I paid for. It wouldn't really interfere with how I sit, since he obviously is so short, but still, I couldn't spread out as much. Therefore I refused, but the mom stayed and argued for a while. Keep in mind that this bus ride was during the night, so there were some people trying to sleep, but the mom was quite loud. She kept saying ""it's not a big deal"" and claimed I was selfish. I offered to sell her my seats for 100‚Ç¨ (I paid about 40‚Ç¨ for them), but she refused. She even asked the driver to force me into letting her son sit there, but the driver simply said that they are my reserved seats and that's that. She left while calling me a prick one last time. When the bus ride was over, I'm pretty sure her kid had puked, judging by the smell and sick bags.   
  
TL;DR: Bought two front row seats for myself, mom asks if her son can sit on the empty one, I refuse and she argues and calls me names.   
  
So, am I the asshole?

This company employees 300 people and generates multi million dollar profits. Because I didn't pick sides, I got demoted by one and the other wrote me off his next project.

My brother got hurt and ended up getting a cushy job with the admins because he couldn't do physical labor. Now he is tabbed to have a major roll in the company's next big project. I am getting laid off this Friday, and he knows this.

I'm very happy for him and I have told him this. He doesn't have anyone outside of work to talk to except me and his girlfriend. I listen to him, but it pisses me off ( not at him ) that I got in this situation because I wouldn't play politics. He keeps wanting to fill me in on every single detail. I get it, he is excited.

Her parents are backing her up financially and paying for their part of the wedding(roughly 50%). My parents, whom are pretty well off, wont help me at all. 

Traditionally, in Indian weddings parents usually contribute - its part of the ""culture"" where the bride and groom are officially independent from their parents.

1225,Asshole,"I am a teaching assistant in a university in the US that has about 40k students.  I have taught the same undergrad science class for three years.  The teaching assistants in my program have been instructed by a new director to do a first day in class activity where the student writes down the following on a sheet and turns it in to count for attendance: (these are the instructions verbatim)

1) name (and preferred name)

2) pronouns (they/them/theirs, she/her/hers, he/him/his, others?)

3) major and class standing

4) why you selected this class over other options in the course catalog

WIBTA if I removed #2 from my instructions?  **No one would know but me if I modified the instructions.**  I dislike the idea of prompting students, as a captive audience where I am in charge, to list their pronouns.  I also see this as pushing a PC agenda.  I trust that those who want to list their pronouns will take it upon themselves to include that info.

EDIT FOR UPDATE: I put (Optional) in front of the question and overwhelmingly my students chose not to share pronouns.

So I think, why not ask her to stay with me until she gets everything situated and for her to regroup (plus we could still see each other this way). She was hesitant at first, but said she trusts me and did extensive research on me anyway (lol).

So basically, I am kind of getting annoyed with not having my own privacy anymore, and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs been looking for her own place once(talks about it hace completely stopped). 

Right now I feel married, and this woman was the first I started seeing after my divorce. So today, I mentioned that maybe we should get a dead line in place? She said, ‚Äúif you kick me out at this point, don‚Äôt think the relationship isn‚Äôt over either.‚Äù 

Also she got emotional, saying how could I implement this and I should of been more compassionate/understanding since it was my idea for her to stay with me. 

I just have no privacy, feel like I‚Äôm married. She‚Äôs upset with me, saying if I wasn‚Äôt prepared to have me and her kids long term, I should of never offered them to stay here. 

she‚Äôs pretty mad, as now she won‚Äôt even sleep on the same bed as me.

As you can see I'm pretty underweight and my appetite works like this: before the meal I would feel like I'm starving, then as soon as I start eating I have a ""timer"" where my body would feel hungry for about 15 minutes and if I don't eat as much as I can in this time interval I would lose my appetite and won't finish my meal. (Resulting in me losing weight eventually)

This week we've been on a holiday in budapest and we've been eating at a restaurant every day. Every single time my mom will order herself the tiniest dish on the menu such as antipasti (a small portion of oven baked vegetables) or the veggie dish that usually sucks (she's not vegan) and then complain that she doesn't like her food and try to eat from me or my dad's plate. I don't want to share because if I'm hungry enough I would normally finish my plate and if she eats 1/3 my food I don't eat enough, stay hungry and then lose my appetite.

It's hard for me to know from the beginning wether I'm going to finish my food or not, and if I refuse to share but end up not finishing my plate she would give me HELL about it. Lately I decided I've had enough of this shit and started answering an assertive NO every time she asks for ""just one fry"" (it's never one) or ""just a bite"" (it's never one bite) and she says I'm an asshole.

My parents pay for the food
My dad hates this too but is too afraid of her to say something

I do not use single use plastic or disposables if I can avoid it. This is accepted yet sometimes annoying to my SO (29m). We come from very different backgrounds but usually have a very loving, happy relationship. 

Tonight's issue: We recently joined a raquette club (think caddyshack but with tennis and no golf course). We like to swim, hit the sauna, hot tub, and have a beer while we soak. The club allows you to take your drink anywhere, so long as it's in a plastic cup. If you stay at the bar, they pour your beer in a pint glass, if you're going to walk around, you get a red plastic disposable solo cup. Now, considering we go a few times a week, I thought it would be a great idea to bring our own reusable plastic cups. So far every bartender has been down with this. One gave me a wink and said ""looks like a pint to me!"". I've considered pouring a pint of water into our cups and making a sharpie line at the water line so the bartenders know. We never have more than 2 drinks there. 

Tonight, my SO came back from the bar looking visibly upset with our drinks in our cups and said it was a stupid idea and he didnt want to do it anymore. He explained the bartender said it was against liquor law to pour drinks into our cups and made it very awkward. He allowed us to take beers poured into glass pints and after that he would turn his back so he didnt see my SO pour it into our reusable cups. My SO was embarrassed and thinks the whole situation could be avoided if we just took the red cups and shut up. After this, we had dinner, including his 6 yr old son, at the club house and they brought us a styrophoam box for his leftovers after I specifically said tinfoil because it can be washed and reused or recycled and I got frustrated and audibly said ""what? No!"" When I saw it. I could have reacted better but it just slipped out.

 My SO was embarrassed and thinks the whole situation could be avoided if we just took the red cups and shut up. I disagree. I'm not as familiar with arizona pecadilos in liquor law of such things but I am familiar with general laws and i am in the service industry and have been for years and this to me would not be a big deal if I were behind the bar anuwhere I've ever worked at. My SO feels embarrassed and I feel like my beliefs and morals are being dismissed. He is so upset he went to bed really early without really talking to me except to relay his hurt feelings.

Her office hours are by appointment only but she refused to set one for any of us. When I say refused, she would say an outright ""no"" or simply ignore the email. So some of us began to CC the Statistics department chair on our appointment requests. He responded to a couple of us and asked why we felt the need to CC him on these requests, and a couple of the students gladly explained what was going on with the professor. 

She got royally chewed out and now has a set of office hours twice a week from 18:00-20:00. She bolts the moment her time is up, though.

I posted in r/LifeProTips thinking it could help other students and was promptly told that this is a bad move and accused of tattling, and that I was insufferable, but this professor refused to help any of us outside of her class time and the chair agreed that she had to be available to students outside of the allotted class time for this very reason. 

She moves through the lessons before making sure any of us have grasped the concept and tells us to email her with questions, but she never responds to them, or she gives unhelpful responses. I mean she'll say ""go through your notes, the answer is there."" Or ""Just go over it again,  you'll get it.""

Example: 2 weeks ago she spent 10 minutes on the chi square distribution and didn't actually use numbers, just explained it to us. When asked if we could do an example, she said, ""we just have to plug in the numbers, it'll work itself out."" Excuse me?

1234,Not the A-hole,"This has been an ongoing issue for the past few months that‚Äôs now escalating so I need Reddit‚Äôs advice. Throwaway cuz my roommates use reddit.

I (24F) live with three other girls all around my age. The issue is with one of them, we‚Äôll call her Kendall. My two other roommates and I have been friends for a long time. Kendall is the cousin of one of them. We all share a 4 bedroom house with one main area. My two other roommates aren‚Äôt home very often as one of them stays with her boyfriend and the other works nights.

Ever since I moved in here three months ago, I usually come home from work and it‚Äôs just Kendall and I. At the core of it, I like Kendall well enough and I like to think that I‚Äôve always been nice to her. I‚Äôll go out of my way to cook meals that she can eat (she has an insane amount of food allergies), drive her to the airport whenever she travels and am overall friendly.

The issue is with how much she complains to me. It‚Äôs not just little complaints and I get that people need to let steam off but the minute I walk in the door from work and ask her about her day she launches into a 45 minute ranting session about how shitty her job is, how much she hates her coworkers, how all of her friends suck, etc. If I don‚Äôt try to slowly end the conversation and leave the room she will rant for hours on end. 

I work in a high-stress job that keeps me on my toes at all times and requires me to take a lot of shit from people who aren‚Äôt happy. (Think public government company).

The constant complaining from her about how much life sucks is so hard for me to deal with after a long day at work when I just want to relax. I‚Äôve tried to express this to her by saying ‚Äúsorry if I don‚Äôt seem like I‚Äôm paying attention it takes me awhile to decompress after work‚Äù but it never stops. 

I‚Äôve taken to wearing my headphones around the house sometimes in the evening. I‚Äôll come home from work and saw hi and briefly talk to her before going to my room. I‚Äôll then put in a podcast to cook dinner and do whatever. I only do this for maybe an hour max and then I take them out and I‚Äôll ask her about things, always trying to keep it positive. 

She recently mentioned me wearing my headphones to my other roommate and she kind of chewed me out for it. I don‚Äôt hate Kendall and I‚Äôm happy to talk to her about anything I just can‚Äôt deal with the constant negativity nonstop. If she had any actual issue that she needed or wanted my input on, I would be more than happy to sit down and talk her through it but I am not an unpaid therapist and I need time to desires for my personal mental health. 

My roommate thinks I just should suck it up and stop being rude by wearing headphones.

1235,Not the A-hole,"At the beginning of the year, we both signed a lease to get a nice apartment right off-campus.  When we went in to sign the lease, they had a deal going on in which we were able to choose between 50% off a parking spot or a free Nintendo Switch. Since my roommate and I do not have time for video games, he told me he was cool with me getting the 50% off parking since I am the only one that owns a car. I have a car on campus as it is helpful for getting groceries and I like to go back home at least once a month. 

I usually give him rides back home as our hometowns are very near each other and we typically split the gas. I usually charge him around $30 for a round trip back home that is three hours away. I never charge him for gas when we go grocery shopping or cruise around town.  Out of nowhere, he has been subtly bringing up the fact that he deserves at least 3-4 free rides back home because he received ""no benefit"" out of signing the lease. Right off the bat, I said no because I still had to pay for the parking spot and there are much more expenses that go into my car other than just the gas. I truly believe he is getting a benefit out of this as he is paying much less for a round trip to home compared to taking the bus or the train. He keeps bringing up the fact that he got ""no benefit"" out of the deal at least once a week since we started school this semester and he has been making me feel as if I am in the wrong for this. He has now even said that I owe *him* half of what I paid for the parking spot. My philosophy is that if he truly had an issue with this he should have brought it up at the time we signed the apartment lease.

So, were riding our bikes to the woods airsoft guns in air bags when a woman calls us over. 
  Trying to be courteous we go over to see what she wants, and she tells us, not asks, to take her son with us. Like I said before it is really unsafe and we also play with metal bb's with an unregulated PSI, and when these things hit you they usually cut your skin open.

1240,Not the A-hole,"Just as backstory my half-brother (m 25) started dating, moved in with, and got married to a girl all within the span of a year. Very soon after getting to know her I noticed a lot of red flags, mainly she was very open about being racist towards white people ( she claimed you can't be racist to white people), and things along those lines.
So all the while this relationship is going on I hear alot of things from her and from others stating that she is talking bad about my step-mother and has on multiple occasions been visibly disrespectful towards her for seemingly no reason.
Fast forward to now, she's pregnant, although the relationship between her and my step mom is strained, my step-mom still tries to be close to her for the sake of her son. In trying to do the right thing for her son and her daughter in law she went out and bought them a crib for $300+ as a baby shower present (a baby shower they held in a different city 3 hours away, my assumption is because she knew my step mom and dad couldn't make it, but that's speculation so I can't hold that against her). She told me all about bringing them the crib and being super excited to have a grandbaby but also felt a little bummed because she felt unwelcomed in their home when she dropped it off.
When she told me about this it was during my birthday dinner and she was almost in tears telling me the situation, she had to step away to compose herself, needless to say I was heartbroken that my SIL made her feel that way and felt worse that my brother allowed her to be treated that way.
Last note before my wrap up, I promise, a couple weeks back I was browsing Twitter and happened upon my SIL's profile, while browsing her posts I found one that made me go into a rage, I'm gonna paraphrase here but it basically read as follows ""The devil (reference to my MIL) stopped by today, and I'm happy say my dog didn't allow her anywhere near me"" I referred to the date and it pretty much matched up with the date my step-mom and dad went to drop off their baby shower gift.
I took a screenshot of her tweet and sent it to my half-brother asking whether or not the tweet was before or after she received the gift (obviously this was a rhetorical question since I knew the answer).
I never got a response from him but I knew it was received cause she set her Twitter to private.
At this point I've decided I can't just sit back and pretend everything is alright between us and I've tried on multiple occasions to get him to understand how this is impacting his relationship with his family, especially his mom.
I've made it abundantly clear that I don't expect him to leave his wife or do anything that drastic, I simply mentioned that they need to discuss this as partners. After all of our talks it seems he's perfectly fine with hurting his mother and allowing this woman sever ties for him.

My wife volunteered to be the best man, to which her cousin responded that she lacked a certain appendage. So she texted him back saying that she could wear a strap-on.

When I told her ""that's how rumors get started"" she brushed me off saying that he knows I'm not serious.

I told her that he's engaged now and there's a good chance that his fiance will see it too and people like to talk.

She brushed me off again and so I told her that if anyone mentions it, I'm going to say that she's a liar.

Long story short I forgot my antidepressants on a weekend trip with my bf and I asked him to drive because it felt like my brain was being sucked away and I couldn't focus. 

While he drove, he caused a minor accident that made part of the front bumper get torn off. 

My parents said it was my fault for letting him drive, my boyfriend himself, friends and brother say it was his fault. The issue was that it needed a $100 repair, and I suggested my bf pay it. Well, he went straight to his parents (he's a full time engineering student and hasn't been doing as well financially) and asked them to pay. 

There was some anger caused because I couldn't find a decent quote (they really do upcharge if you're a younger woman and will refuse to listen to your insistence that it needs a minor fix). I went to several places that all quoted me around $900 for the fix because they said I needed a new bumper. 

My bf's mom demanded I go to her mechanic (a 45 minute drive one way), and he did it for $100 and she paid upfront without telling me. 

I felt really guilty because my dad really drove the point that this was all my fault to me. I made a pretty cake for his mom and dad and brought it over as a thank you/apology(?) and offered to reimburse them, but they declined and thanked me for the cake and we had a pleasant dinner and his mom is still texting me as usual.

1246,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR this dog has bitten everyone in the house at least two or three times. I should clarify that the dog isn't vicious, and has never drawn blood, but he is very protective of resources and will turn on you without warning if you touch his things or get in his personal space. Last time I got bit I accidentally walked into him because he's the exact same color as the hardwood and I didn't even see him. He's a large breed, so big enough to do bodily damage if he really wanted to. Despite everything the owner has done to try and mitigate the issue (feeding him in a separate room, for example), it hasn't exactly addressed the root of the problem. I've already had a talk with my room mate saying how I can get in serious legal trouble, as the homeowner, if that dog were to ever bite someone who decided to sue me. I already feel bad enough that I had to lie to my homeowner's insurance company when they asked me ""has the dog ever bitten anyone?""

I know the dog is there for her ""emotional support"" but I feel like the dog's feelings / needs / wants are always being given precedence over mine. Any time the dog misbehaves, it's never the dog's fault. Would I be an asshole if I gave her an ultimatum? I want to tell her, if the dog ""reacts"" in this way again, he's gone.

**UPDATE 10/2:**  Well after posting this question to multiple threads, the opinions of Reddit seem unanimous - the dog is a problem.

I approached the room mates tonight, as gingerly as possible, saying that the issue needs to be resolved because of potential legal ramifications.  I didn't even tell them that the dog needs to go, I more or less said ""I'm out of ideas, but I know this is a problem and I don't know what to do"".  My concerns were completely discarded and they had the nerve to blame *ME* for the dog's behavior, because ""he can tell <you> don't like him""...  Folks, I've never so much as laid a *hand* on that dog.  I do avoid him because I don't trust him, and I've tried to befriend him several times over the years only to have that trust broken, so I gave up.

1247,Asshole,"So I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 11 months now. He is American and I am not.

So a few months ago my childhood friend let me know he was coming to visit America and he would be staying in my area for a little while. I was so excited! I haven‚Äôt seen him in 2.5 years! I immediately told him I wanted him to stay with me while he was here. At first he told me he did not want to be a burden but after some begging he came around. 

When I told my boyfriend about it he seemed very calm and accepting about it. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and my childhood friend would be sleeping in my guest room for about 4 days. I was happy my bf was ok with it though and was also ecstatic for them to meet. 

So today my childhood friend arrived! My bf and I picked him up from the airport and I was so incredibly excited to see him. We ran to each other and hugged and we exchanged a quick very platonic kiss on the lips after. I turned to my boyfriend to introduce them and he immediately looked uncomfortable and upset. He was very short and stiff with my friend and it was honestly just very awkward. The drive home was also a little awkward with him but my friend and I made great conversation catching up and sorts. 

When we got home I showed him around my apartment and to his room and told him he could take as long as he wanted to get settled. My bf had went to my room and when I entered he immediately started yelling at me. He told me it was disgusting and disrespectful to kiss him like that on the lips. I was very confused and told him that this was very normal for us and my other friends and family. 

We argued a little while longer and then he gave me an ultimatum that either my friend had to leave or he was gone. I told him this was incredibly unreasonable and I was hurt he was doing this. He said nothing and just left.

Since our relationship wasn‚Äôt going well, we decided that, rather than sign a new lease/move into a new apartment together right away, we'd first see if our relationship could improve. If things got better, we'd move back in together and continue on as before. If things got worse, we'd break up. For the last month, we live apart on weekdays but spend weekends together.

Today my boyfriend texted me that he missed me and was sad that we aren‚Äôt living together. He got mad at how I responded. I'm pasting the whole convo right here (it's not long) for your judgement.

Two pieces of background information. (1) I'm at work during this conversation (why I didn‚Äôt just call him). (2) When we lived together, my boyfriend used to frequently say that he ""hated"" our apartment, ""hated"" my furniture, thought our home was ""disgusting,"" wanted to move elsewhere. This used to hurt my feelings. With that, here goes:

Him: I feel really off today -- really sad and just like lethargic

Me: Why? I'm gonna walk across the street to get food, I'm starving. want me to call you?

Him: Yesterday's talk has been like repeating in my mind. Sure.

Me: What about it? I am here for you. Always.

Him: I feel incredibly sad and stressed. I really do.

Me: So what can we do to fix that? Or at least begin fixing it.

Him: I want to know/feel like I/we know what's going on, where we are, what we potentially see happening. I don't want to feel lost and unsure of what's the situation between us. I'm sad one day and happy the next.

Me: So what would be the first step in getting to that? In getting to that sense of security?

Him: To talk about where we are as a couple. I want to know what you're thinking/feeling and I want you to know what I'm thinking/feeling. And to then talk about what is next and if we have any plans in mind or can make some together.

Me: We can do that. It's sort of ironic, you saying that, because I felt like I had been begging for that from you and then I finally gave up and decided I'd let you initiate when you felt ready.

Him: Well I feel ready; I want to know what's going on and not feel lost.

Me: Well we can talk whenever you want.

Him: Do you mind if it's later, I have to finish up some work now.

Me: Anytime.

Him: <3¬†

Him: \[20 minutes later\] Do you know how much I miss our old apartment life? Like I feel so lost and so like, wtf happened.

**Me: I don't know. I thought you hated it there.**

Him: Ok. One thing is not being in love with the apartment for certain reasons and another is missing our life and how we used to live together. I feel sad and I'm telling you how I miss you and us. it's weird how you, in a way, are like throwing it back my way with that comment. Idk it feels like you are not there for me.

I have a friend who has endometriosis, and it affects her A LOT. I sympathise with her, but her constant need to talk/complain/ask me questions about endometriosis really tires me out (also I don't have endometriosis myself so idk why she thinks I can give her medical advice). I also have some chronic illnesses of my own which is really hard for me to deal with, and she never wants to listen to me talk about my issues, just reconnects anything I say back to her issues without letting me finish. 

I just don't have the energy to constantly care and support her through her illness, when I need that energy for myself.

Recently I've started telling her to talk to her doctor about any questions/issues she has with it, and she gets all huffy and puffy about it (note: this is not in the US so it's not about money). Or to google it or ask in endometriosis support groups. She won't listen to that, and keep asking/telling me about it.

The more she pushes it, the less I care about her struggles with it, I've heard it all so many times and my energy is just at an all time low due to my own illnesses.

I've been told by some mutual friends that I'm being a dick for brushing her struggles off, and that I should care more about our friend. (she's more open about her health issues than me so not many know just how bad I have it. I prefer to keep that part of my life more private)

She was on the lowest dosage possible because of this. Now, call us paranoid but, since we aren't ready for kids, during that time we also used condoms during sex just a secondary precaution. This is something we had both agreed to, and my knowledge, neither of us has any objections to it. I'm fact, she was the first to suggest we do this. We never had unprotected sex, and at most we'd start for a short time but, then I'd put a condom on for the rest of the session.

 Today, she had an appointment with her gynecologist and was told that her condition has gotten better to the point that she can have some time without birth control once her pills run out (in about a week). She called me to tell me this and I was very happy for her, I've known how much she hates the side effects of birth control pills and was genuinely happy. During conversation, I realized we'd be down to just condoms now and suggested we'd have to look for a new non-hormonal (to avoid side effects) method to go along with condoms. Well, she got upset and said me suggesting this didn't make her feel good because she feels like I think she'll trap me with a baby now. That's not the case at all. I trust her fully, I just know that woman can still become pregnant even when condoms are used (unnoticed breaks, it slipping off, etc.) and based on our agreement before, I thought it wouldn't be an issue to suggest. She didn't wanna stay on the phone and texting has been extremely slow since. So, am I the asshole for making this suggesting?
If you need more info feel free to ask.

EDIT: To avoid a bit of confusion because this has been coming up a lot. I never had any invasive method of contraceptive in mind (IUD etc), I was just thinking of something like spermicide but didn't get a chance to explain this to her.",82,48,0.9

1259,Not the A-hole,"Being a female engineer, I've always been passionate about promoting women in science and technology, so when I saw this science camp advertised for middle school students, I thought this was a good opportunity.  It's held at a local university for 3 days and is supposed to introduce kids to STEM careers.  So I decided to sponsor all the girls in our church who are within the age range (10 to 14) to attend.  It is $175 per person and so I made a donation of $2450.  

Now, I am getting a lot of pushback for limiting it to girls.  Some parents of boys are saying that they will send their sons as well (at their own expense) and accusing me of being sexist.  The whole thing has become a big argument and rather than being appreciated, I feel like I'm being villified.  The trustees are going to meet this weekend to decide whether they will reject my donation, which would mean that all the girls won't be able to go unless their families pay out of pocket, and the church will lose $350 in non-refundable cancellation fees because they have already made the booking.

We all were hanging out over the weekend to celebrate another friend‚Äôs birthday. Apparently a few people had the idea to give her ‚Äúpot brownies‚Äù and see how she‚Äôd react. The catch is that they had nothing in them at all. But they were banking on her acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. 

I didn‚Äôt find out about this whole plan until I got there. Everyone else pretended to be high and so did the girl, predictably. I didn‚Äôt participate in that part but I also didn‚Äôt tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. 

At the end of the night someone told her and called her out on always being fake. She got really upset and ended up leaving the party early by herself. I do feel bad for her but I also feel like she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she‚Äôs always trying too hard.

He found out today and told me I was being deceptive and had lied. He said it was important to share that info with him prior to us having sex.

Their sleeping arrangement is a bit odd as my brother sleeps alone (he works shifts of all different hours including nights) while his wife and my niece have taken over my old bedroom. I moved out almost 5 years ago and have my own place a couple of hours journey away but I still have stuff at my parents house and my old room is pretty much unchanged so they are sleeping surrounded by my old belongings.
I've been visiting a few times a year, usually staying at least a couple of nights, the issue is there really isn't enough space for all of us which leads to the question of where everyone should sleep. Whenever I visit, the bed routine goes like this - my niece fall asleep in my old room, she is then picked up and moved to a cot in the living room, then I sleep in my old room and my SIL sleeps on the sofa in the living room. In the morning my SIL is always grouchy saying she didn't get any sleep and sometimes she'll have to go to work like that, don't think my niece likes being moved much either.
I've never demanded that I sleep in my old room but I'll admit I've never offered to sleep on the sofa as my room is the nicer choice.

We were really surprised by that, we never thought he will ask us something like that. We ask him why but he didn‚Äôt want to tell us. We were worried so we send him to a therapist and now he goes once a week. In our eyes he is still the same kid that before. We tried to think about things that he may have.

1276,Asshole,"My daughter is a current college student and does not work as she is a full one college student. Her father and I give her a weekly allowance of $50 - which she can spend however she wants; which, is usually groceries, gas and fast food.

Now, recently her cousin whom I speak to sometimes, told me she asked him fo money a couple of times and that he speaks to her regularly just about college and stuff. I offered to reimburse him and then was angry that she went to him instead of her parents. I then called her and told her to stop begging for money because it makes us her look bad and like a beggar. Also, that if you do it once you get comfortable and continue to do it - and we didn‚Äôt raise her like that. She was upset with me and gave blunt one word responses and even tried to explain she only asked because she needed gas money. 

I told her if she needs something she should come to us and if we don‚Äôt give it to her, then it‚Äôs not that important. I feel that $50 is more than enough and she even talked about getting a job to which we said no. She needs to focus on school and there isn‚Äôt much she needs to spend her money on. She has a car, phone, and everything else that we pay for - except gas, but she doesn‚Äôt need to drive to her classes because she can walk or take the bus. 
 
However, my daughter believes $50 a week isn‚Äôt enough and that she barely fills her car because $40 is about a full tank when she she is running low. She also said that the on campus dinning hall and food places have bad hours ( dinner is 4:30-7, lunch is 11-1:30, breakfast is 7 -10) and that breakfast that early makes her feel sick, she‚Äôs in class during lunch and can only make dinner when she doesn‚Äôt have her volunteering 3-5:15 pm on tuesdays and Thursday‚Äôs. Also, on the weekends ‚Äúapparently‚Äù brunch is 7-10 and dinner is 4:30-7 but everything else like Chic Fila and those places are closed. 

I tell her to save her money if she wants to extra things like go to parties or do any local activities like the zoo, movies, or world of fun.

So am I the asshole for scolding her for asking family members for money?

EDIT:

Apparently I should‚Äôve added somethings. She stays on campus, public transportation is included with tuition. However, the public bus runs in a bad area (the city the campus is around is sketchy.) and she‚Äôs small so I don‚Äôt want her using it at night. 

Also, she volunteers with this thing called jumpstart where she has to train and volunteer 3-5:30 tuesdays and Thursday‚Äôs.

My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of.

Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life.

When I got home at midnight Saturday I walked in on my wife (f33) sitting on the couch with her high school male friend chatting together. I have never met this guy before and he is not someone I know other than what my wife has told me about him. For the last 12 years they have also never, to my knowledge, seen each other in person and only remained friends through facebook. I was suprised and they looked surprised to see me.

 I introduced myself to him and he said ""hello l'm John a friend of your wife's from high school."" I said ""nice to meet you.""  I go to use the washroom and when I come back he is essentially ready to leave and says goodbye to my wife and makes his exit. 

For the last day or so I've just been in shock as my wife doesn't feel she did anything wrong as they are just friends. He just happened to be nearby Saturday midnight while I was out of town and she invited him to catch up on old times.  To me it all seems too convenient and feel I'm not getting the full truth. It feels like a very odd way to reintroduce a male highschool friend back into your life at midnight while your husband is out of town. Wife thinks I'm overreacting as they were clearly just hanging out having a friendly conversation on the couch. I feel there are much better times and settings to go catch up with a friend like going for lunch. I don't think it is appropriate for some dude I never met to be at our place at Midnight while I'm not in town. I should also note my wife was pretty buzzed from drinking beers when I arrived. 

Am I the asshole for being upset by her actions of inviting this dude over that I never met to our place so late at night?

TLDR: came a day early at midnight to see my wife on couch catching up with a old highschool male friend. I have never met this guy and my wife has not seen him in 12 years.

I told him that I have already done it on my phone and all my electronics previously, including my broken iPad. Eventually, he asked me if I could do the same for him and clean his phone's ports. So, I cleaned both of our phones. Now since his screen was cracked some part of the electronic cleaning liquid got into his screen and now his phone display isn't working. He insists that I am the one who is solely responsible for the damage to his phone and asked me to buy him a new phone or repair the current one. I told him that how could I be completely responsible since this was purely accidental because nothing like this happened to my devices , and he was the one who asked me to do the same for him. So AITA here? and should I fix his phone with/without sharing the expenses with him or should I not?

1296,Not the A-hole," I work at a grocery store and happen to be the one employee that closes 5/7 days of the week. 3 weeks ago, I put in a time-off request to take off Saturday, Sunday. My uncle was coming into town, and we (my dad, uncle, and I) were all going to attend the Great American Beer Festival. We paid $85 each to get a ticket. 


On top of putting the request online, I also talked to the store manager, who was in charge of making my department's schedules until we got a new manager. I told her I really need these two days off, and she said something along the lines of, ""lucky for you we allow time-off! Just put it in online, and I'll take care of it."" Again, this was three weeks prior to the dates. 


A week before those days, I see they post the schedules, and lo and behold, I was scheduled on the two days I requested off. I went to tell the store manager, who said, ""I'm busy right now, I'll check it out tomorrow."" When I came into work the next day, I realized that she wasn't even schedules to come in that day. Basically she just lied to shoo me away. 


I don't mind if they want to terminate me. I was already looking for another job. The management is AWFUL and it's embarrassing working for them.

Furthermore my actual family gets shitty too, my step dad pretends like he doesn't have a family the entire time or would volunteer 12 year old me to rake his brother's yard, wake up early to care for animals, just general work that I didn't want to do because I was supposed to be on vacation. My siblings would rather hang out with my step-cousins etc. I could go on, but I don't like these people and it's never felt like they liked me, or that they would consider me family since I'm the only step-child of the family.

I don't like feeling cramped in my own apartment without any privacy. If it was just one friend, then yes, I'd be fine with that for a night. But the space is less than 400 sq feet and I just don't like the idea of cramming 4 people into a small space.

1304,Asshole,"My wife feels that I am pressuring her to have kids at a certain date. The absolute last thing I want to do is to pressure my wife to do something she doesn't want to do, especially something as important as kids. But in another sense I find it important that we have kids by a certain age due to fertility issues associated with women as they age. We want to have three kids.

&#x200B;

In feb 2017 right before my wife and I got married we discussed when we should have kids. I suggested we have kids in 4-5 years. She said she'd rather do it in 5-6 years. Right now I'm 31 and she's 25. If we have kids in 6 years from 2017, that means we have kids in Feb 2023, and I will be 34.5 and she'll be 28.5. She started working two years ago, I started working a year ago. We recently paid off all our student loans. We live in the Bay Area and our household income is $350K a year.

&#x200B;

I have brought up the conversation once in a blue moon but today I actually wrote down the dates and everything in a note on my phone, and I showed her that we should start trying for a baby in April 2021. My reasoning is that it takes 9 months to have a baby, and it may take a year to get pregnant. 

&#x200B;

She feels like I am rushing her to have a kid. She says she feels like a baby making machine. I just feel like I'm in such a crossroads here. In one sense, it doesn't really sound romantic to point out dates for when we should do this that or the other. It would be nice if it just happened naturally. But I think dropping the topic and ""letting things happen"" is a huge mistake. I think that would mean we end up trying to have kids much later than we should so there's a higher chance of birth defects and/or her not being fertile enough to have the second and third child. She got offended when I said the longer we wait the \*older\* you'll get and you'll be less fertile. She can't stand the thought of being old so she doesn't even want to think about it.

&#x200B;

Am I wrong for brining up this timeline? Will I be the asshole for trying to stick to a timeline? I told her she can edit the note to fit the dates she is most comfortable with. I just think we need dates so we don't get caught off guard and let time slip us by. She says she doesn't want a timeline at all. But she did agree that next week we could do some research together on woman's fertility issues to figure out how serious of an issue it is. I asked her today, just to clarify, if she wanted to have kids and she said of course.

1307,Not the A-hole,"TDLR... Dad moved in his mistress and new family, got married and I am struggling to accept this.

Hi Folks.

Parents, Step Parents, Siblings, Step Siblings, Exes, Mistresses and whoever else, I really want your opinion.

My (14 years old) Dad (35 years old) recently moved in with his mistress (35 years old) and her two children (Female 18 years old and male 14 years old.) Due to the legal agreement of my parents I had no option but to stay with them every other week.

They are all lovely people but I do not want to be their family, I do not want to be at their house and I do not want to see my Dad happy with his new and improved family. I'm resentful and hateful but pretend to be ok by limiting my responses and requests to a bare minimum. This seems to makes me angrier inside. They got married, I was forced to go. I have no control over any aspect of my life. I felt heartbroken (not a term I use lightly.)

Am I The Arse for not wanting to make everyone else feel happy by being overly accepting to a lady who participated in wrecking a family? Am I immature for being extremely hurt by the fact two random kids now have a stronger, daily bond with my parent then I do despite him being my Dad?

They have transitioned really well as it turns out they were a family way before the actual affair reveal. I love my Dad but I really dislike him and just need a break from him. The problem is my Mum is making the exact same choices with her new soon to be husband... No one puts me first, not at all.

1308,Not the A-hole,"My family is all calling me horrible right now so I thought i might as well risk the internet doing it too.



So, tomorrow my sister will be kicked out of her apartment and will most likely have to live on the streets if she cannot get into a shelter (there are very good reasons she would be turned away from a woman shelter.). And I could have prevented this. 

I'll start by saying I don't like my sister. I wouldn't say I hate her, just don't like her. She has been a constant force of negativity in my life. She borrowed over 5k from me in college and never paid me back. And then totaled my car while drunk, causing my insurance to drop me and refuse to pay anything. After this, I cut her out, For over 5 years I have ignored her entirely. Outside of family events and proxy connections through my mom. I have refused to even acknowledge her existence. 

Well, she moved out to the other side of the country in January. She went there to live with her boyfriend and her daughter. From what I heard things got bad quickly with him and she had to move out and live on her own. Sometime during the summer she lost the job she had gotten and hasn't found work since. Because of all this she ran out of money quick. My sisters landlord let her stay rent free for 3 months on the promise from my mom that she would find money somewhere. My mother is broke and lives month to month on social security and my other siblings cannot afford to help at all so this was never going to happen. The landlord lost his patience and now is demanding payment to the tune of 6k (4 months rent plus money she owed him from a loan) or her will be locking the apartment and taking her to court. 

This is where I come in. Last week my mom called me up and begged me to help. I am much better off financially than the rest of my family. I can afford to give what the landlord is asking for. So I talked to my sister for over an hour as she apologized and begged me to help her. Both my mom and my sister told me that this was a ""loan"", and once my sister was back on her feet she would pay me back. After an hour I stopped her and told her that I don't believe her one bit on paying me back and I'm not gonna bail her out of the situation she got herself into. She already owes me and I would not help her. I hung up and have ignored her since. 

My family is furious at me. They have been calling me nonstop all week trying to get me to reconsider through shamming me and telling me that I am being petty. My mom has begged me to at least buy her a plane ticket home but I won't do even that. I don't care if she lives on the streets. She decided to move out there and got herself fired. She had months to come back and stayed. It's not my problem. Everyone else says that I'm being supper hard. My mother has even offered me her house (once she dies) to help repay me but I still refuse to help. 



Am I being unreasonable here?

Edit:

Since people are asking and I wasn't clear enough. My niece lives with her father. He has custody of her. Its a long story why she lost custody (and involves why she would be turned away at a shelter). I'm not comfortable sharing more than that. She moved there originally when her and her ex got back together and to be with her  daughter.",479,1536,0.96

We had a party yesterday night with everyone we knew, so I spent the day cooking and baking, which was very stressful. That is so you understand just how irked I was when I left the kitchen for a minute and, when I came back, one of the delivery workers was in front of a stray of cookies I was had just baked, chewing on one.

The man was very young, I could swear he was in high school or just out of it. I said something like ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and when he turned to face me, he had an untouched cookie in his hand as he chewed on another. He looked at me, shrugged, and *he then brought the untouched cookie to his mouth and took a bite.*

I honestly felt like he was just insulting me to my face at that point, so I sort of made a fuss until an older coworker of his came, and I explained the guy had stolen my cookies. I know, it sounds ridiculous in hindsight. But the older worker took it very seriously and started talking the kid's ear off about how out of line he was, and ""just wait until [I assume their manager] hears that, you'd be lucky to still have a job tomorrow!"" more or less. The worker was laid back and detached when I was talking to him, but he became very apologetic and afraid when consequences were mentioned. He was brought out and I guess left to wait in the truck, because I didn't see him again.

I first I felt vindicated; he had been rude and got punished, not my problem. But after the party, I just felt guilty about it. I still think he was rude, frankly, but it was just cookies. Friends of friends came and ate them without asking permissions, and if the worker had asked me for a couple cookies, I would have given them without any problem.

1314,UPDATE,"After our text convo that led to my dad calling me asking whats wrong between us I texted her about a meet up at my place. This was the first time we actually met/hung out outside of a family gathering. Before she came over that realization gave me a new look on our relationship. The whole sit down went well, we actually got along and there wasn't any name calling or anything ""mean"", we talked about how we treated each other and this was the first time I've ever heard her apologize for how she treated me growing up and I did the same. We talked about how the text convo went, and I came to the conclusion that I still had the old image of how she was when I last saw her at 17 and was using that to picture her now. She still kinda acts the same (kinda moody but can hold it in so much better now) but its a lot better. We talked it out and spent about half the day together just hanging out and I will admit I enjoyed it. I don't think we will be super duper close but its a step in the right direction and there isn't a wall of tension between us anymore. I even invited her and her SO to my sunday football party and they showed up, we didn't talk much but it was nice she put in some effort to hang out with me.

I did half of it before setting off to school and the other half I planned to do at school (I get there early so I would have time).

1318,Not the A-hole,"My apologies for the long post.

My grandmother Connie passed last year and is survived by her partner, Tilda. My grandmother was a lesbian for (most) of her life, but still had children with my grandfather who I never met. Tilda is not related by blood but I grew up knowing her as my ""other"" grandmother. Tilda is in her 80s.

When Connie passed, she and Tilda were living with my aunt, but when my aunt passed, Tilda's living arrangements became turbulent. She couch surfed for a bit before the family convened and tried to figure it out. I'm 27M, and for some reason, I volunteered to house Tilda because no one else would volunteer.

The plan was to house her for eight months because she had planned to start chemotherapy today, actually. Once she begins chemotherapy, she'd move in with my cousin because my cousin is not working and can provide 24hr care, plus they plan to have a nurse come live in with them so provide 24hr care. I work but am otherwise home all the time myself.

Now that the backstory is out of the way, here's my conundrum:

Tilda has a dog. I hate this dog. I was told he was trained but he's not. My couches are ruined, my carpets are ruined, either by the dog or Tilda smoking and falling asleep with a lit cigarette in her hand. The dog chews on my walls. Tilda doesn't let the dog out. All told, it's something like $10,000 in repairs I have to do once Tilda leaves.

Which, let me remind, was meant to be today. I found out two days ago my cousin will let Tilda move in with her, but not the dog. Tilda now refuses to do chemotherapy because it means she has to move and won't without the dog. Tilda didn't move out today, evidently. My whole family is now fine with this. They think instead they'll convince me to let Tilda stay while doing chemotherapy, continue to have my house destroyed, and have a nurse come live in my house.

I'm not. I don't want a person to die in my house. I don't want to have to deal with the dog after Tilda passes. And if I can be frank, it's probably likely to be soon. Tilda is in deteriorating health.

As much as I love Tilda, this has been a bad decision to home her. I want to serve her an eviction notice which means she can be evicted in 30 days. She will _have_ to leave, and she will _have_ to give up her dog. Technically I can have her evicted at any time as she's not a paid tenant but just to avoid backlash, 30 days is what I want to give her.

Am I the asshole? I talked to an uncle about this and it spread through the grapevine. Now people in my family are saying I'm ""abusing the elderly"" and I'm a terrible person. Fuck them, I'm at my wit's end. If they care so much, they should volunteer. Even Tilda is being passive aggressive with me.",54,92,0.92
1319,Everyone Sucks,"I have 2 kids, different dads. I have a savings account for both. The account of my oldest, Lucy, has had ¬£10 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over ¬£13,000. The second account is for my son, Luke, who is 6. I have regularly added to this account since I found out I was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.

His father, my fiance, had a separate account for Luke and has told me he was doing the ¬£10 a week since we started the accounts. I recently found out the account he has for Luke only has a couple hundred in it. My fiance earns less than me but more than my Ex. If my Ex can afford ¬£10 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my Ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the ¬£10 payments each week (I earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by Ex). My fiance said he ""forgot"" and asked me to redistribute the contents of Lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from Luke's. I said fuck no.

Luke's account is around 3k less than it should be. We have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. We don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.

My fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k Luke is missing all at once. I have said that I want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account I control that is meant for Luke. I would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested I take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my Ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. I also said that I want him to set up a direct deposit of ¬£10 to the account that only I control each week. I will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.

AITA?

&#x200B;

For people asking why this is so urgent to me: It's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in Luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when Lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when Luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. While I don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what Lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.

&#x200B;

Update:

I asked him again why he didn't have the money. He said he just didn't. I asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). He refused. I told him that if we were combining finances in any way I should be able to see where his money is going. He responded that I wasn't showing him my financial information, so I pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. He then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. We had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. He has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.

I cannot see us getting married after this. Not ever. It's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",948,13225,0.96
1320,No A-holes here,"Morning, y‚Äôall. 

This post is actually more of an are *we* the *assholes*. 

There are seven of us kids, between the ages of 23 and 35. Six of us are into health and fitness. Five of us actually pursued careers in it (RN, dietician, PE teacher, physical therapist, and personal trainer). One of the others works as a carpenter, while the last is beautician. 

Well, coming from a small town, there really isn‚Äôt a gym available after you leave high school. The closest thing is the YMCA, and it‚Äôs about an hour away and doesn‚Äôt have much. A little over a year ago, I (29m, former PE teacher) and my five other siblings who are interested in exercise and the like decided to start a gym. The runt (23f, personal trainer) was already basically running one out of a gym bag, so we figured it was worth a shot. 

We offered my middle sister (27f, beautician), I‚Äôll call her Kim, a place in the business, but she refused. 

Well, as businesses do, the gym has a way of creeping into our conversations. It‚Äôs where we spend most of our time, so it‚Äôs where most of our lives take place. Whether we‚Äôve got a funny story or an issue, it comes from there. 

Kim is upset. We‚Äôre spending more time together as a group, but even when we tell her it‚Äôs work stuff, she wants to join in. Then, when she gets there, she complains about what we‚Äôre talking about. 

We‚Äôve had to start not mentioning when we‚Äôre doing work meetings in front of her. We‚Äôve tried instituting a ‚Äúno work talk‚Äù rule when we‚Äôre with her, but it ends up us just sitting in silence. 

About a week ago, Kim approached us about joining the business. Now, let me be blunt: Kim is not into working out. She‚Äôs one of the most sedentary people I know. She doesn‚Äôt want to become interested in fitness. She‚Äôs ‚Äújust tired of being left out.‚Äù

I get it. We‚Äôre all each other has in terms of family, and she‚Äôs not feeling part of it anymore. But this is our *business*, and I don‚Äôt want to jeapardize it by bringing in someone who has no knowledge about or passion for it. 

Are we being dicks here?

1322,Asshole,"Quick backgroud: 
My son (23) graduated college and majored in BA Theater Arts, and since graduation he's mostly been earning by acting in a few small productions. Although, hes had major roles in some of his plays, we live in a country where theater isn't paid really well. He still lives with me (62) and my wife (57). We pay for everything (food, phone, gas, etc), give him an allowamce, and don't make him pay rent. This isn't a problem since we are very financially well off and most of the things we have we plan to let our kids inherit.

Anyways, a few days ago me and my son had a talk, and he mentioned how the pay for his next gig was so low. I jokingly mentioned that he should just take over the family business if he wants to earn money. This led to him snapping and saying I wasn't being supportive of him. After he mentioned this, my head just exploded and we had a long argument. I MEAN, I PAY FOR EVERYTHING AND EVEN GO TO HIS PLAYS TO SUPPORT HIM. In the end I threatened him by saying if he doesn't make it big in a year, he either learns the family business or I disown him. We havent talked in a few days since then.

My wife says I was too harsh and that he's still young. My younger daughter (20) hasn't been vocal about the matter, but shes been trying to make me and my son reconcile.

I'm not against my sons dream of becoming an actor, but I want him to have a stable future at least. I mean what's he gonna do if me and my wife die?? He doesn't even know how to operate our business or the problems some of our properties have. What he earns isnt even enough to pay the expenses of the house. So, AITA for threatening to disown my son?

EDIT: When I meant disown, I meant kicking him out of the house and removing all financial support (also his car since I paid for it). Jesus Christ, I won't remove him from the will. He's still my son.

EDIT 2: My bad for using ""disown"" instead of kicking him out. Always believed ""disown"" was kicking somebody out when they're not yet ready.

EDIT 3: Thank you for the responses, I can see how I was wrong. I suppose since in my culture success means being a doctor,lawyer or businessman I didn't really consider his career as legitimate. To answer why I never made him work as a waiter or get a part-time job is because minimum wage in my country is $10/day and those are 12 hour shifts. If he wants to rent a decent condominium, he has to pay $300/months. I do not want my kids to have that kind of life.",405,1378,0.9

One of my [14F] nearest and dearest things broke today. I cried a lot because of it. I texted my parents, saying that it had broke and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Reason this is so precious is because it‚Äôs the first big purchase I made on my own. I never dropped it, did anything to it, and I even didn‚Äôt use it when I had colds or when it was dark.

 When they were back at home, I told them to read the text messages (because they hadn‚Äôt read it already). My mom told me she had no idea what to do and that she would ask my dad. I was disappointed (I hoped that she would at least comfort me as it was something that was extremely precious to me). 

I went along and asked my dad anyways. He told me to bring the thing downstairs. I did. He asked for another thing that would help him solve the problem. I told him I tried that already and it didn‚Äôt work. He shouted at me to bring it, so I did, whimpering. He took the thing away from me. I took it back, as I wanted to do it because I was very, very gentle with it. He snatched it back, and I didn‚Äôt stop him. I told him that I would prefer if he did that somewhere else, he said it was alright. 

I went back to him after doing that, telling him it wouldn‚Äôt work anyways and that I had already tried. He told me to just try it again, and screamed about why I was so dramatic and why I was crying so much. 

My mother and my father began shouting at me, telling me how I was stressing them out so much and that I was extremely dramatic for crying that much about what he was doing and what happened to that object. 

I know it‚Äôs kind of a stupid post, but my dad constantly calls me egoistic and tells me that I am full of drama. I want to know if his claims are true in your eyes. So, AITA?

Well i wasn't aware of that until a few years back since my dad and stepmother never told me about it. I found out when my friend, whose dad died, told me she had a savings account where her mom deposited her pension every month - so she had a considerable amount of savings that she wanted to save for hard times.

my parents told me that the money went into my expenses like food and school supplies but i feel like they forced me to pay rent so i was allowed to live with them. they stole money from a child. we are an upper middle class family and there is no way they took the money because we stuggled to survive. should a kid pay rent to live with their parents?

1328,Everyone Sucks,"We‚Äôve been together for close to three-years now. I‚Äôm very happy in general- and from what I gather she is too. 

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the time I talk to her about things I‚Äôm - she pretends to be interested and aware but she‚Äôs not, doesn‚Äôt even really try. She usually replies in single words and the occasional empty platitude, and it generally just feels like I‚Äôm talking into the void because she will literally stay quiet through most of what I say. Her sister does the same thing to her own boyfriend- it runs in the family. 

When she talks to me about everything- even if I don‚Äôt have a lick of familiarity about what we‚Äôre talking about I do my best to engage it. 

I was telling her about a conversation I overheard- and in that conversation, a guy was arguing with another guy who was a bigot. The non-bigot used the word empirical and the other guy didn‚Äôt know what the word empirical was. 

So she cuts me off and goes ‚Äúhaha- he‚Äôs so dumb, he doesn‚Äôt know what empirical means‚Äù 

Note, he‚Äôs dumb because he‚Äôs a homophobic bigot. Not because he doesn‚Äôt know what empirical is. So I giggle a little bit and tell her ‚Äúwhat does empirical mean‚Äù, and she doesn‚Äôt know. She gets red-faced and visibly angry and tells me she does not want to talk to me. 

Now I know this embarrassed her, and she says I made her feel dumb- and I feel bad about that but my reasoning was that she consistently misses the point of what I‚Äôm saying, and only really responds to just make the conversation go by quicker.

1330,Not the A-hole,"So I live with one roommate in an apartment, and we've lived together a couple of years now.  Long story short: normally I'm not home on Sundays/Monday mornings, but today I needed to drop some stuff off at our apartment.  My roommate normally works Monday-Friday, but she has off today for Rosh Hoshanah.

Apparently, when I'm out on Sundays or for the weekend, my roommate locks our apartment normally (two locks, one deadbolt and one knob lock, both of which I have keys for) and also uses our sliding chain lock (which means no one can get in unless the person inside unlocks it).  I didn't know this, tried to get in at eight this morning, and couldn't.  I tried calling my roommate's name and calling her phone, but she was dead asleep and her phone was off.  Eventually after five minutes' worth of knocking, she woke up and let me in.  By this point, I was kind of pissed off, admittedly, and she seemed annoyed at having been woken up.

We haven't actually hashed this out in full yet (I just wanted to dump my stuff off and go to work) but she said that she likes to do this when I'm not around to feel extra-safe when she's alone.  Normally, this hasn't been a problem, because she goes to work in the morning earlier than I do, so when I've dropped stuff off sometimes in the morning, she's already gone and the door is locked normally.

That said, I want to insist that she stop doing this because I live there, I pay half the rent, I need to be able to access my own apartment, especially if she's doing this while she's asleep/her phone is off.  I almost needed to drive home early last night and would have run into this exact problem, except in the middle of the night, when our neighbors would have absolutely been asleep and been bothered by me pounding at the door.

What I suspect her argument will be: it makes her feel safe, and normally it's not a problem anyway.  In complete fairness to her, she had a rough breakup a couple of months ago and her ex has sent her some harassing text messages.  That said 1) he's never shown up here or threatened to show up here, 2) he never had a key to our apartment, 3) there's already two locks on the door, 4) our apartment building also requires a key and shuts automatically, 5) we're on the third floor and our fire escape is inaccessible from outside the property.  Plus, it sounds like she's been doing this the whole time we've lived together, not just recently (even though our neighborhood is pretty safe).

1332,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! So I live in an older 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other girls.  Last winter, one of the girls kept raising the heat to 75+, even at night claiming she was too cold. The fact that our gas bill went up close to $200 a month did not phase her or my other roommate, but it pissed me off.  I tried to have multiple conversations with her about how I cannot sleep with the apartment that hot, that I kept waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, and I could not sleep throughout the night.  She just kept on rambling about how it was HER apartment and she refused to be uncomfortable in HER apartment despite the fact that she was making me uncomfortable and affecting my sleep. She would not consider putting on extra clothes, using more blankets, getting a space heater, or a heating blanket.  She would yell at me every time I lowered the temperature even to 72 (which is still pretty warm). As a result, I slept with just a sheet and closed my vents, but the heat still warmed up my room and kept me up.  I finally asked the landlord for a programmable thermostat so they could have the apartment warm while we were actually home and awake but then dropped to 68 at 11pm and 65 while we were at work. This helped at first, but then she kept overriding the programming and setting the temperature to 75 or hotter when she thought I wasn't paying attention, but every night she did that, I woke up sweating.  I am the first to get up in the morning and would verify on the thermostat on days I didn't wake up.  Obviously I'm going to have the same issue in the upcoming months.  WIBTA if I told her if she keeps putting the heat at a ridiculous temperature and refusing to  get extra blankets or a space heater for her room, that I would be leaving my window open a crack? What if I requested to renegotiate the gas bill to 25%, 25%, 50% as she's the one who wants all the heat?

1335,Not the A-hole,"Hey!

A bit of context. I live on the ground floor of a 4 story building which means my flat has a small open patio facing the comunity‚Äôs garden. As I understand it, the garden is communal but the patios are private for each ground floor flat (I emailed my landlord just now to check if it‚Äôs the case). My other ground floor neighbours have some plants and patio furniture on theirs but since I just moved a year ago I still haven‚Äôt gotten any furniture (I want plants as well but they all die on me). Since my flat is the corner one, my patio goes around my front door, the second bedroom (my and SO‚Äôs office since we both work from home) window and the bathroom window.

So a couple of months ago I started hearing people outside my bathroom window having a gossip session. While it was uncomfortable to go to the bathroom while I could hear a convo just like they were talking to me, I let it go thinking it was a one time thing. It kept happening and I decided to sneak a peak of who exactly was out there and I saw a girl and a boy (maybe 18?), the boy‚Äôs leg was in a cast and he had crutches. I didn‚Äôt recognise either of them but, again, I‚Äôm pretty new in the building and haven‚Äôt met many neighbours. Me and SO talked and decided maybe since the boy was injured they couldn‚Äôt get to the park two blocks away and decided to let it go for the time being. 

Come last month, I‚Äôve seen the same girl with other perfectly healthy people sitting in my patio, smoking and eating and chatting. Every time they hear our door they get up and leave, also when they see us come in the building. They‚Äôve never said hello or anything. Last week I overheard the cleaning lady complaining about how messy we are and that she always has to pick up trash from our patio. Today I got out to let my cat walk around the garden and I found a half eaten yogurt rotting in the sun (I live in a semi-tropical climate so it was pretty gross). It was the last straw for me and I want to put a note in the elevator asking the neighbours to keep to the comunal areas and their own flats and stop littering on other people‚Äôs properties. I‚Äôm not good with confrontation so I prefer to start with a note instead of having to confront them face to face. WIBTA?",74,557,0.95

1337,Everyone Sucks,"So I'm a university student. I'm the only one of my friend group who currently lives alone (had a flatmate, he's currently doing a year abroad) so I'm usually the go to host for parties. Honestly, I like it that way. I really do enjoy hosting. Now, the rule at my parties is generally BYOB but I'll provide food. However I have what I call the Orphaned Booze Shelf, which is where drink that gets left behind and goes unclaimed ends up and that's fair game to everyone. I also usually grab an extra six pack of beers, just in case.

Now, I hosted a party recently and shortly prior to this I'd been gifted some really nice beer from my older brother's boyfriend. I won't bore you with a long ass anecdote, but basically brother's BF is from Denmark and I went over there with the two of them last yeark and fell in love with this one Danish beer. Very difficult and expensive to get in the UK, but bros BF managed to find some and snagged me a case. For the party I also went to the supermarket and picked up a crate of Coors bc I figured that's a fairly safe choice for everyone. 

So the party happens. Friend of mine brings her boyfriend who I don't particularly care for because I think he's condescending and snobby but I can tolerate him for her sake. This dude has a habit of showing up to parties empty handed but whatever, we have the OBS and that for this exact reason. I made sure to say to him when he arrived with no booze of his own ""so help yourself to anything from the shelf, and there's some Coors in the fridge that's fair game too."" He says thanks, party's going great, we're all having a super fun time. Then I go to grab another of my beers and noticed there seemed to be more missing than I thought I'd drunk. I was baffled but thought whatever, I'm a bit tipsy, maybe I've had more than I thought. But no. Again, next time I come back, there are even more missing. I basically turned around and spotted right away that my friend's bf had one in his hand. 

I went up to him and said ""what the fuck mate"" and he sort of held his hands up and said ""you said the beer was fair game."" I pretty angrily told him that, no, I said the *Coors* was fair game, the Danish beer is mine and it's kinda special. He insisted I said the *beer* was fair game (I'm like 99% sure I said Coors specifically) and that he didn't see what the big deal was cause he knows I like Coors too anyway. Plus he'd seen me giving other people sips of the Danish beer so I clearly wasn't that bothered about it. I was drunk and annoyed and basically told him to get the fuck out and that he isn't coming to any of my parties in future. He left, my friend went after him really upset. Tbh I feel most bad about upsetting her. Still people have told me it was awkward and uncomfortable for me to go off on him like that and that I should have done it privately.

1343,Everyone Sucks,"For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. 

I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. 

Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. 

Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",11882,26791,0.81
1344,Not the A-hole," 

For some background, I'm a high school kid who's played piano for approximately 11 years now. Right now I practice 1-2 hours twice a day. As a child I never minded whoever heard me practicing and I've never struggled with issues regarding perfectionism or not wanting others to hear my mistakes.

My mom always sits very close to me, or at least in the same room, whenever I practice. This is usually for at least an hour. I've never particularly liked being watched while I practice, although by no means does this imply that I'm against constructive advice.

I think I should say here that although I'm perfectly capable of practicing with other people present, I have a strong preference not to. My mom has been watching me practice every day for about the last year, since I changed teachers and decided that music is probably a prospective pathway for me to follow into the tertiary world.

I have not liked being watched since the beginning, but decided not to say anything since I felt that since my mom and I are very close and generally have a great relationship that it was worth tolerating.

*The dilemma is this: my mom insists that she absolutely must watch me practice.*

I talked to her about it, thinking the issue might be because she wants to ensure that I don't use my phone or procrastinate, but she says that it isn't the reason she watches me. I asked her why and she said she just wanted to watch and that there was no reason. She also said that since it was her and my dad who owned the house and also my piano, she had an absolute right to be wherever she wanted in the house at any time and that I had no right to privacy.

I got quite frustrated with this and became very angry as I felt I was making a reasonable request, and this turned into my mom and I arguing about legal rights to privacy. I attacked my mom for always using finances and my status as a minor to shut down my points, as well as pointing out that it was technically my dad who paid for the house and the piano to begin with. My mom got extremely upset with these points, and looking at it now, I regret saying these things because I didn't intend them as disrespect but instead to counter the fact that I had no rights, as a financially dependent child, to insist my mom go somewhere else while I was practicing.

1346,Not the A-hole,"It‚Äôs obviously common to borrow stuff off the people you live with but I don‚Äôt always trust my mum to give stuff back or even return it without it being broken. Now I have a box of about 20 lipsticks... and last week my mum asked me to borrow a lipstick, not a big thing right? Except she took my favourite one that I wear daily going to work, I sometimes wear going out and its my boyfriends favourite lipstick on me, so I pretty much wear this one every day and I didn‚Äôt say anything when she picked that one cos i figured she was only going to borrow it for the night out. 

I waited to see if she would offer it back or return it and she hasn‚Äôt, I kinda forgot about it until today. This morning I made us a cup of tea before she goes to work and take the cups into her bedroom. I see my lipstick hanging out her make up bag and take it back and sit down on the sofa with my tea. 

My mum comes in and sees the lipstick on my lap and this is how the conversation goes - making me feel like a right AH...

Mum: oh you‚Äôre taking it back are you?

Me: well yeah, it‚Äôs my lipstick

Mum: can I not just keep this one?

Me: not really mum, it‚Äôs my favourite lipstick

Mum: *starts laughing* no it‚Äôs not, you didn‚Äôt even know it was in that box until I pulled it out.

(For context, this happened once - she borrowed an eyeliner I had been looking for and didn‚Äôt realise it was in the box til she took it out) 

Me: What? Even if that was true that doesn‚Äôt mean you can just assume you can keep it, I wear that lipstick every day and it‚Äôs Zaks (my boyfriend) favourite one on me *sips tea*

She continues to laugh then goes on to asking me to tell her where I got it from so that she can get one etc when I remembered that I got it from Superdrug or whatever for cheap cos they were no longer selling that brand. 

So I thought I could find it online for her and she walks back into the room whilst I‚Äôm looking online and I said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find the exact one and-‚Äú she cut me off laughing and says ‚Äúwow this is really bothering you isn‚Äôt it, it‚Äôs a lipstick!‚Äù which just annoyed me even more, cos it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs something as small as that. I just responded ‚Äúyeah, actually it is - cos you can‚Äôt seem to grasp the concept that just because I‚Äôm your daughter, everything I buy isn‚Äôt automatically yours‚Äù which may have seemed a bit harsh but this has happened more than once.

I would understand if it was a household rule, but they still have sweets in the house and everyone else is allowed to eat except for me. When I try to eat some they get mad at me. 

I get that it‚Äôs ‚Äòtheir house, their rules‚Äô or whatever. But if it‚Äôs for health reasons shouldn‚Äôt everyone stop eating junk food not just me? My parents ngl are heavy + my brother is on the wrestling team. So I feel like it‚Äôs a double standard of sorts.

I feel very frustrated with this and snapped at my brother because he was exaggerating eating ice cream. Then I raised my voice saying the rule was dumb and went to my room. I was grounded which I expected since I raised my voice, but everyday I feel more and more upset because i‚Äôm surrounded by food I can‚Äôt eat.

1349,Not the A-hole,"Me (18) and my gf (24) have been arguing on and off for months now about social media. When we first started dating I was never really active on social media, only ones where I remained completely anonymous, like tumblr etc. 

And then when we started dating she encouraged me to try my hand at other platforms, snapchat I loved, but I was pretty open about not liking facebook or instagram, and asked her not to be upset if I didnt enjoy them. Now as time goes on these platforms really just end up stressing me out. I'm a very anxious person, which is why I decided to stay anonymous online, and now I feel so exposed and naked and I was just genuinely super uncomfortable with the whole thing. Now heres where things start going wrong, and I'll admit I'm at fault in a big way.

I tell her I dont enjoy fb or insta, but that snap is fun, expecting her to be supportive and allow me my privacy, but instead she gets very mopey and spends the rest of the day in slump, only coming out of it when I agree to try again. I KNOW I should have stood my ground and told her that it made me uncomfortable, but both me and her are so depressed and anxious, I decided I'd do my best to appease her. Then she starts pushing me to get into more communities on tumblr and fb, be more active, talk more about myself, and it's all stressing me out super bad, and tonight it all came to a head with a pretty bad fight. 

I thought I did a good job explaining to her why social media makes me so uncomfortable and that I'd rather lay low than make myself so seen. She blew up at me and I blew up back and now it's just awful. She said it's fine and to just delete my other social media account but she did it in a very throwing-her-hands-up-in-frustration-sighing-very-loudly-and-really-only-conceding-to-make-me-feel-guilty way, like a parent who asks their child to do a chore and when they kids throws a tantrum they say ""fine! I guess we'll just live in a pig sty then!"" And stomp off. The difference being, I feel like I'm completely within my rights to not enjoy this and want to stop.

I know I was wrong by not being firm, but does she really have a right to be so mad at me for not forcing myself to do something that makes me uncomfortable? Should she accept that I'm not the type of person who enjoys social media, or am I the asshole?

EDIT: She has two reasons she wants me on social media, firstly, so she feels thought of throughout the day, and secondly so people know she isnt single. I've tried to fix both of these by suggesting other ways I can make her feel thought of (which she doesnt accept) and by asking her to put that she isnt single in her bio (which she has done (she did always have it in her bio, but she just put it as our anniversary date with some hearts by it, which I told her most people wouldnt understand, so she changed it to be more clear))

UPDATE: I tried talking to her about it today, and when I told her that it's had a considerable negative impact on my happiness, she said that me not being on social media has the same negative impact on her, so I have to choose between mine or her happiness",32,28,0.82

1355,Asshole,"On Thursday, I (35M) had planned a stay at home Saturday with my GF (33F).

On Friday afternoon, my boss asked me if I was able to take care of an extra project that same Saturday at the office. It was going to be overtime and significant extra earnings for only a couple hours.  It's a business casual office.

I talked to GF later on Friday and told her I wanted to take advantage of the offer, but I felt guilty about our plans. I asked if she would be up for coming into my office with me to hang out while i worked, 2hrs tops, and then have our Saturday.  

She was reluctant at first, she just wanted to relax, but I told her I was so into the idea of having her at the office with me, I would openly bribe her with a $150 Ikea gift card that I've had lying around (she has previously asked if I could ""donate"" it as she is redoing her living room (live separately).  She immediately agrees on the additional condition of a morning coffee as well. I'm totally fine with the stipulation. I told her to rest up and I would pick her up in the morning.

I left Saturday to pick her up and texted my boss I was headed in to the office shortly (there's an alarm thing so I thought it appropriate to give a heads up) my boss wrote back thank you and that they were going to stop in as well to pick up some files.

I arrived at GFs place and she comes out to the car in casual clothes. Flip flops, baggy sweat pants, one of my t-shirts.  It was supposed to be casual hang out Saturday and couch attire is the norm for those, but I remember feeling shock and little anxiety.

GF gets in the car and I said, I swear, 
""Hey, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you earlier, but is there something a little less casual you could wear? I just found out my boss might stop by while we are there, I know this isn't cool of me to spring on you, but I want them to have a good first impression of you."" 

She just looked at me and said ""No. You asked me to join you and this is what I want to wear today.""

""I said ok, but could you do this for me? Even yoga pants or one of your gym outfits? I'm worried about what my boss might think. Even just your shirt?""

""I'm not changing, you are barely dressed up either, so you can start driving or I am getting out"" [(I was in shoes, shorts, t shirt, and a zip up hoodie, I'd describe it as walking the dog clothes?)](https://storage.googleapis.com/lulu-fanatics/product/35456/1280/lululemon-best-coast-hoodie-online-only-heathered-black-1966-214652.jpg)

I hesitated, and before I could say anything else she got out and went back in her house.

I have never asked her to change her appearance before and believe me, I will never make this mistake again, but I am I really the asshole?

TL/DR. Invited GF to office on Saturday (closed) to hang out while I worked overtime, she wanted to wear her pajamas, and I asked her to change to something less casual as the boss was going to stop by. I'm currently in the dog house.

1356,Asshole,"In July I was at camp with another 1400 kids (10th graders). At the camp there were clear rules about smoking, drinking and f*cking (all are forbidden from doing these. If you're caught 3 times you go home). 

At the day before last, a girl told me and my friends that she's going to smoke with some friends and if we want to join them. We said no. After she went to smoke we talked about how wrong this is and said that we should tell an adult about this (they were smoking weed).  I didn't knew if they meant it or not so I told an adult. Apparently this was the third time she was caught smoking so they sent her home. I had no way of knowing how many time she was caught or if she was caught at all.

The kid draws some really interesting pictures.. majority of them include blood, dead bodies, naked people, and people getting murdered by monsters... They scold him for drawing that stuff but I had just heard about his drawings through my lady.

Last weekend they had a cookout and invited me.. We get there and my girl introduces me to everyone I haven‚Äôt met yet and then she asks where the kid is.. Her sister says he is in his room, so my gf and I go and say hi to him.. We walk into his room and it is filled with these interesting drawing on the floor and walls... I enjoyed them a lot, so I asked him if I could join him. He had a surprise look on his face and said that I could join him... I started drawing pictures inspired by his drawings.. he asked if i like to draw scary stuff and I said yes. 

So,15 minutes later, I‚Äôm 3 pictures in. And by this time I had giving him one of my drawing to keep and he had giving me a couple of his drawing to take home with me.. 

Then, his mom comes in his room and instantly apologized and said she felt embarrassed for his draws, which bugged me a lot because he was listening.. I told her it was interesting and that I used to draw similar stuff as a kid. (Which is not a lie, I think we all drew crazy stuff as kids) She told me not to encourage him and I said that someone needed to.. (I spoke without thinking)

We went outside and she called me out in front of everyone saying that I said she was a bad parent and that I was drawing disturbing stuff with her son. Majority of the family agreed that I shouldn‚Äôt have encouraged him. My lady and her uncle were on my side and said he is just a kid, and it‚Äôs a phase... I had to leave early because I got slightly heated and the kid was watching us argue through the window. ( ugh I hate that I argued with his folks in front of him but it‚Äôs over now) She also asked if I was rich so I could pay his bail money because I encouraged him to be a murderer.

1361,Not the A-hole,"Im 17, a senior in high school, and as the username implies, I work at McDonald's.

My father is a very prideful person, and doesn't want his son doing anything short of miracles even at my age. He was mildly uncomfortable with my last job at Dairy Queen, but when he learned that I got hired at McDonald's (which was a last resort, as I'm somewhat prideful myself) he became very upset.

He insisted that if I'm working here, I need to have two applications in elsewhere to ""move up"" at all times. I disagreed, because I've been taught by people much more successful than he that job hopping looks bad on a resume. I also need the job to generate savings for when I move out of state next year after high school, and McDonald's is the only job around that can give me enough hours to generate that kind of savings.

McDonald's is also treating me *way* better than my last job. It's an improvement in every regard, and I quite like it here.

Over the phone, my dad eventually said something to the extent of ""either do what I ask (have 2 applications in to move up) or cut me off as a father.""

I didn't announce that I'd call it at any point, but I grew increasingly cold and dismissive to him after that. I referenced what he said to him later on and he made the excuse that he was drunk (which he was, but not very) but never apologized or admitted he was wrong. He still texted me talking about how I'm wasting my time, I'm worth more than that, etc. He even went as far as to try to bribe me to quit with two-weeks pay. I don't doubt he'd spend money like that, but the idea that he tried to bribe me revolts me.

He stopped texting about 2 weeks ago, and I haven't reached out. I haven't officially cut him off in any regard, but I've certainly lost a lot of respect for him. I'm just rethinking if that's really necessary or just an overreaction on my part. Would abandoning contact be worth it here? Would I be an asshole if I left him to himself to pursue my own life?

1364,Not the A-hole,"Apologies for the length of this.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. We also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told us he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

I immediately decided to cut him out of my life. I dont want that kind of person around my children. I have a son now too, who will never meet my dad as long as I have any say over it.

Two years later and I havent spoken to him once, but certain family members (including my sister) have started talking to him again and seem to be slowly letting him back into their lives. Even my mum seems to be softening up over it. I will never forgive him for what he did to my family.

1367,Not the A-hole,"I've been close friends with the groom of this wedding party for about five years now, I have known the bride for about two years and am on good terms with, but not nearly as close. They asked me to be a bride's maid, and I accepted.

FWIW, I would understand their anger more if they had wasted money on me being in the wedding. I did pay for my own dress, shoes and bouquet. 

Yesterday, we were supposed to have an all-day bachelorette party. However, the bride changed plans last minute, saying we were going to go to dinner and then back to her place after for a special surprise. This surprise was a 'lingerie party'. For those of you who don't know what that is, a 'lingerie party' is when an MLM like Pure Romance tries to make a sales pitch. They get you a little tipsy, try to sell you overpriced lingerie, sex toys, and other things, and then try to rope you into becoming a consultant. The bride announced that she was officially a consultant, and with the help of her friend (the consultant who was with her) she was going to use the money she would make to help her and the groom buy a house together. She told us that after they went through their presentation, that her friend would stick around to help answer whatever questions we have.

I have very, very little tolerance for MLMs. I feel completely taken advantage of by being forced to stomach some scam because there was an obligation to be there. I gave their presentation about five minutes before I went to grab my purse and go. The bride asked me where I was going, and I told her I was going to leave because I didn't feel comfortable and would see her next week. The consultant cracked a joke saying I must be a virgin, and I told her to fuck off. The bride got mad and said if the toys and things really bothered me that much I could wait in the other room until they were done, but I should be nicer. So I told the bride that it wasn't the toys that was the issue, it was the fact she was trying to get everyone to buy into a complete scam. This really set her off, and she started talking about how it WASN'T a scam, she was just trying to raise money to buy a house, and if I wasn't going to support her working with this company, or purchasing anything that night, then I wasn't supporting the groom either and I was just a fake friend. She didn't want anyone with that bad attitude ruining the wedding, and only wanted those who truly supported her to be there. So, I told her if that was how she felt, then I wouldn't be in the wedding. Then I left.

I called to talk to the groom right after this happened, and he's upset I won't be there, but he understands why I'm quitting the wedding party. He also was unaware that she was involved in an MLM and upset because she used part of the honeymoon fund to buy the kit.

1368,Not the A-hole,"Yeah, I know the title makes me seem like the asshole already, but please just hear me out.

Yesterday was the wedding of one of my buddies from college. There were a bunch of guys from our class so I (25M) was looking forward to having a reunion with my boys. It was beautiful venue and everyone was having a blast. I was dancing with some guys since I went stag (my girlfriend is out of country for a conference and couldn't make it). When slow songs would come on, I would retire and go sit back at a table and have a drink. All was great. However, then I noticed that a girl was sitting alone at the table next to mine and I recognized that she was the date of another guy, ""Brian"", who I was friends with in college.

Now, I wouldn't have approached, but I saw that she was crying so after awhile I went over and sat down next to her to ask if she was okay. She was very embarrassed and told me that she was fine but that she was just upset because Brian and her had gotten into an argument during dinner (she did not specify over what) and that now he was upset at her and wasn't talking to her. She told me she was really looking forward to this evening and now she felt so sad and hurt. I asked her if she knew where Brian was and she said no and that he left some time ago and she could not find him. Then she made an off-handed comment that was something like, ""Ugh, I love this song. I really wanted to dance to this tonight."" Then she started crying again and I felt really terrible. It was a bit impulsive, but I asked if she wanted to dance with me and she said sure so we went and danced. It was a slow song, but I kept my distance. She was still crying and put her cheek on my shoulder. It was a bit awkward for me, but since she was so upset I just let her cry it out.

After about maybe two or three minutes, I get a hand on my shoulder and it's Brian. He says, ""Dude?! What are you doing??"" She immediately lets go of me and I think he realized that she was crying so he asked her what's wrong. She burst into tears again and he took her away after that. After like twenty minutes, Brian found me with a couple of other guys and took me aside to tell me that I totally disrespected him by ""taking advantage of his girlfriend's emotional state."" I told him exactly what happened and he seemed reluctant to believe me and continued to tell me that I was being a dick and that what I did was not okay. He left angrily and I went back to the guys I was with and told them what happened. To my surprise, all of them said that although they could see my point of view, it was still a bit of an asshole move and they said if that ever happened, to just mind my own shit. Welp okay.

I told my girlfriend what happened and she said she thought it was fine, but it's literally only us who think that lol. This morning I sent an apology over to Brian just to try to clear the air since he is (or was??) one of friends and he left me on read. :/",86,55,0.88

I‚Äôve been best friends with ‚ÄúLaura‚Äù for over 20 years now - we lived in the same neighbourhood growing up and were inseparable even until now, so our families are very close. We often have joint thanksgiving/Christmas/birthday dinners and I would always join them on family vacations and vice versa. Her parents have always been extremely kind to me and I‚Äôm thankful for them. 

A few days ago, one of my classmates told me about a girl she knew that paid her whole tuition by getting a sugar daddy. She showed me the website and, being a broke college student, curiosity got the best of me so I made a profile that same night. A day later, I started browsing the site and  ran into Laura‚Äôs father profile almost immediately. It was 100% him, he didn‚Äôt blur his face or anything. 

I was pretty shocked but what got to me was his bio that mentioned that he was currently married and wanted something super discreet, and his age preference was between 18-21 (he‚Äôs 67 years old, not sure if it matters when it comes to sugar daddies but) and the whole thing just gave me the creeps. I immediately deleted my profile but took some screenshots before. 

I told myself that if I was Laura, I‚Äôd want to know. Her mom was practically a second mother to me and it broke my heart to think this was happening behind her back.

So about a month ago my family went to a bbq at my grand parents house. My grandparents four kids and their children (my cousins) were all there.

At one point towards the end of the day one of my uncles started asking about some school stuff as I was leaving to go to college soon. Me being excited I started rattling off a bunch of stuff about it for a while. This kind of drew a crowd and a lot of the rest of my family came over to listen.

At some point though my cousin Lauren left the room. She was found a little while later by my grandma crying. 

Lauren is the same age as me and should have graduated the same year as me. She was unable to though because she had a lot of trouble with school.

As we were all crowding around the desert table filling our plates my grandma walked back into the kitchen with Lauren and I did notice she was a little red eyed, but I didn‚Äôt know why. I realize now that she was probably trying to change the conversation by bringing up dessert.

After we all got our desert though I continued on where we were with the school stuff. Very soon after Lauren and her parents had to leave. 

A few days afterward my mom got to talking with her sister about the whole thing and how upset Lauren. My mom sat down with me and talked about how all the talk made Lauren feel bad and it would be nice if I apologized for making her feel bad. 

I said I would, but now a month later I still haven‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt really seen her since and just didn‚Äôt feel like calling her about it. We‚Äôre all meeting up next weekend for my grandpas 80th next weekend and honestly I still don‚Äôt really feel like I should have to apologize.",66,223,0.94

1374,Asshole,"I have a 3 year old but this story isn't about her. I will say, though, that for her, we have a time out system when she misbehaves where we put her in our dining room which is baby gated off.

Three nights ago I was babysitting for my friend. She has an 8 year old autistic son. I was only babysitting for two hours and it was rough. I have a new puppy who isn't acclimated to people (especially children) yet, so I keep her in a cage in my kitchen when we have company over.

The boy I was babysitting kept pestering the dog. Throwing a ball at the cage so it'll bounce off, sticking his fingers in her cage, shaking the cage, etc. I told the boy that it wasn't nice to tease the dog like this and she's nervous around children, and to please leave her alone. But he would persist. My puppy would yelp really loud scratch at the cage to get out, much to his amusement.

Our main floor has no doors at all, so it's not like I could have closed the dog off somewhere. I have carpets on my second floor and I couldn't bring the cage up there. Despite my attempts to keep the boy with me so we can play or watch television, his attention was strictly on teasing the dog. 

No amount of bribing with candy or toys or promises of playing so and so game would get him away, so I kept him in the ""time out zone"". First for five minutes (usually with our daughter we do a minute per years of age), then I let him out to see what happens, and he went right back to the dog, so I called it quits and he remained in time out for the rest of my babysitting session, about 50 minutes or so. I was in the adjacent room so I could see him, it's not like I left him there alone to his own devices. He had toys and etc.

My friend called me a monster for ""caging her son up"" when I tried to explain the situation as I have here. Was I though? Was I the asshole here? I have zero experience with autistic children, but he was a wild one for sure.",326,414,0.92

We were lab partners the entire year and I did he lab reports and assignments all for her.  I'm pretty studious so she got A's on her assignments.  On the final she asked if she could sit next to me and make it easy to copy.  I resisted at first but she said she had something special for me after the test and I agreed.

Well she copied and after she said she was just kidding about something special and that her use of me was done.  I emailed the professor about the cheating on the final exam, but not about the labs or anything.  I told him the truth that I let her cheat.  He failed both of us on the exam, which was worth 20 percent of our grade so she got a D in the class instead of a B and I got a C instead of an A.  She sent me a profanity littered text insulting me and saying she needed a C in this class cause it was a core major class and her parents we're going to kill her and that this cheating was going to be on her academic record forever.

Adam is a big fan of bugs, it's literally all he talks about so naturally when I found this book about bugs I decided to buy it as his birthday gift. I went to his birthday party and he very clearly liked the gift. I did notice that it was a bit different from everything else he was getting, most were games, electronics and expensive looking toys. 

Today I received a text from my sister saying that she wished I had put more thought and care when picking my gift for Adam, especially since I had given Peter a really good gift on his birthday. I asked her if Adam was upset with the gift and she said he wasn't but she didn't want him to feel like there were favorites between him and his brother, so she wanted me to be more mindful of this. I agreed with her on this sentiment but I explained to her that I used the same reasoning while picking both presents, Peter really wanted a switch game which I got for him because I know he likes playing games. Adam is really invested on his bugs so I gave him a book for him to learn more about them.

1384,No A-holes here,"So I got married in May. Each of us have a child from a previous relationship, both are teenagers. Both have mental health issues. We have a modest two bedroom apartment. Wife and I share the small room, the kids share the master bedroom which is fairly big.

My daughter is very extroverted. Hers is introverted. There have been some conflicts, but nothing major, mostly space and privacy issues, ""her stuff is on my side"", that kind of thing. But her daughter is very insistent that she have her own room. Mine doesn't seem to care that much. 

Wife has brought it up numerous times, but after reviewing our options, I always say no. Because the only alternative would be for wife and I to give up our room and convert the living room to a sleeping area for us. To me this has serious ramifications for us, as now *we* have no space for ourselves. I personally think its a terrible idea because now we can't have people over if we want in a common space and it seems like we are squatting in the place we pay the bills for. 

So while I am empathetic about everyone's needs, I still really can't do it. Has become a point of contention as her daughter keeps coming to her with strife. Wife is depressed.  I feel we have gone to great lengths to make her daughter feel like she has privacy, even buying her a canopy bed with blackout curtains.

I also work from home and the area of the main room is also my office. I can't sleep 3 feet from where I work.

My take... Basically accept that this is what we have to work with because we can't afford to move. And work out your issues.

I never wanted it to be a big deal and I mostly ignored some of the hateful comments I got. 

I never wanted and still do not want to be part of the Pride movement. I just want to be able to live my life with my boyfriend. 

My older brother is currently overseas and has a son Aaron, who is 13, with his wife. When my brother is away I kind of step up and help out with Aaron when I can.

I picked up Aaron from school on Friday and he seemed more quiet than usual. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he needed to talk to me. 

He the proceeded to come out to me and told me that I was his ‚Äúrole model‚Äù and that I‚Äôm the only one who knows that he‚Äôs gay. 

I got uncomfortable but thanked Aaron for telling me and made an excuse about having to get to work.

I just have no interest in being a ‚Äúgay role model‚Äù for any kid. It‚Äôs not something I ever wanted. Maybe this makes me selfish, but I came out for myself, not to be part of a movement. 

He texted me later that night thanking me for ‚Äúbeing so cool about it.‚Äù 

I took some time and sent him the following message: 

‚ÄúThank you for telling me Aaron. While I understand why you would tell me, I don‚Äôt think I am the right person to support you through this.  Please go see your guidance counsellor at school or talk to The Trevor Project or a group like that. I am not entirely comfortable being a role model for you and I think you should look elsewhere for some support.‚Äù

I never received a response from him and when I talked to his mom today, she told me that he was upset all weekend but obviously she had no idea why he was so upset. 

I don‚Äôt think that I am the asshole generally in this situation as I never asked to be a role model and I don‚Äôt think I am required to take that on, but I don‚Äôt know if my message was a little to harsh with him.

1387,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) like to go for a run in the morning before I go to work. I usually set out around 5:00 AM so I can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. Well depending on the time of year, I'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

Well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. I'm identifiable because I have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

This was on that Nextdoor app so I chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! And got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. Some people told me to go to a gym, why don't I run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. I told them I had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. I'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! And then said that I love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""Yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

Anyway I've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that I should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. I don't enjoy running on a treadmill. Never have, never will. Besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when I can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? Seems like a no-brainer, right?

My best friend has suggested I just head out later, but I won't have enough time for the rest of my routine (shower, breakfast, etc) if I do that.

&#x200B;

ETA: Tried to grab all the INFO questions. 

1 - There are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. The only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. I pass this park already. There are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - I don't run the same exact path every day. No matter which street I run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. I have 5 or 6 different routes I'll take. I don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - I don't have a car, so I can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - Again, I'm not getting a gym membership. My budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - I can't run later in the morning. I have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). If I don't leave for the bus at 7:45, I will not get to work on time.

1389,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: I‚Äôm in charge of household finances and the utilities are in my name. I fucked up the math for the first time. My roommate is giving me the cold shoulder for it, so I don‚Äôt want to have the utilities in my name anymore.

I‚Äôve (22F) lived with my boyfriend (24M), D, and his friend (24M), V, since December when we all decided to move in together. 

I had the best credit score at the time and they were both extremely reluctant to have the utilities in their name. I agreed to put all of it in my name, but with the understanding that they would pay me back. They would always ask what they owed after I posted the bills on the fridge and reimburse me a few days after its due date. 

It was tough for me to keep up with the math and budget myself, but I did my best. A few times I had to take out payday loans to cover them to keep the lights on, but it was overall ok. I‚Äôm just more careful to have emergency money now when someone‚Äôs short, including myself.

Our lease for our old place went up in June. I proposed to D the idea of he and I finding a studio, but he was opposed because he didn‚Äôt want V to feel abandoned. V just moved to our town and doesn‚Äôt really have anyone but my boyfriend, so I kept my eye out for an apartment everyone would want.

A month before we were set to be homeless, neither of them had even tried come up with a new place for us to live, and I had found a few to tour. If I hadn‚Äôt, we would‚Äôve probably ended up in a complete dump or living out of our cars. We signed a joint lease and moved on with our lives.

It was really overwhelming for me between moving fees and the new rates and old bills. The first month was expensive, around $950 to move in. When both of them came to ask me what they owed this month, I sent a group message out that said the total owed was ~$700 a person per month after my calculations. I ended up overcharging both of them by about $125 and ended up budgeting extra myself, factoring in deposits and fees from the month before on complete accident.

V blocked me after we figured out I did the math wrong. I found out he thought I was trying to steal his money. I immediately lost my cool and told D I want to find a new roommate or I want to move out. I‚Äôm also not planning on renewing any of the service contracts in my name once they are up. I‚Äôm tired of putting my ass on the line for people who turn around and say I‚Äôm a thief. 

D just wants us all to get along, but he hasn‚Äôt really done much to defend me. He thinks I‚Äôm majorly overreacting. 

I haven‚Äôt ever tried to cheat anyone. As a matter of fact, I feel a little cheated here. 

Sorry to be long-winded.

AITA here? Am I overreacting by threatening to not renew the contracts and move out?

Edit for info: We found out about the miscalculation when we all went in to pay our expenses to our landlord with money orders and discovered we were overpaying.",52,147,0.94
1390,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 10 months old. I play ukulele, and have since I was a kid, and my wife and I figured out pretty early on that hearing me play ukulele and sing actually calms her down a lot. Most of the songs I know are really old (all of them are older than me) and they get boring after a while so I learnt to play some more modern stuff, too, but in the same sort of light upbeat ukulele style, and about half of them are totally serious songs that it's okay to sing to a baby to more adult oriented jokey songs for my wife and I to laugh at. My repertoire now ranges from Let's Go Fly A Kite to Just the Way You Are to Thong Song.

I just found this youtube channel of this guy who plays ukulele and sings old songs but also writes some of his own and his own songs tend to be jokey, tongue in cheek ones. On mobile so can't link but he has this one song called ""No more fucks to give"", which includes lyrics such as ""I've tried to go fuck shopping but there's no fucks left to buy"" and ""I've rallied my fuck army but it's been fucking defeated"". He also has a ""family friendly version"" where he changes the ""fucks"" to sound effects like a car horn or change drawer.

Kids are meant to start picking up words around 6 to 10 months old, but it's still a fun jokey song so I sang it to her, and changed the ""fucks"" to ""effs"" (""No effs left to give"", ""I've tried to go eff shopping but there's no effs left to buy"", ""I've rallied my eff army but it's been effing defeated"").

My wife overheard and she thought it was funny, and she filmed a small clip of it (about 10 seconds, roughly 2 lines) and with my permission she put it on facebook, along with a caption joking about my censoring. Of course the adults who she's friends with knew what the ""effs"" were replacing and we got a mix of people who found it funny and people who couldn't believe I'd talk like that in front of a baby, but I really did just use ""eff"", ""effs"", ""effing"" but people are really mad at me. My wife took it down within about an hour of posting because so many people were mad at me.

We still think it's funny but agree maybe no more facebook videos for a while. Or this song. Which is a shame because my daughter seemed to like it.

I live in Indiana and she lives in Orlando, Florida. Her original plan for the wedding was to have it in a big mansion in Orlando. She offered to let me and my significant other stay in the mansion for the wedding weekend so I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for a hotel on top of the flight. All in, I would have had to pay for my dress ($200), the flight ($200), and my hair and makeup ($200). To me, $600 is reasonable for a wedding and I had no problem with that.

TODAY I get a text from her out of the blue saying that she and her fianc√©e have decided to move their wedding to an island in the Caribbean. To get to the island the shortest flight is 24 hours (a series of short flights with about 3 layovers) and the cheapest flight I could find is $900. On top of the $900, I now would have to pay for 3 nights in the hotel ($600), the dress ($200), hair and makeup ($200). So instead of $600, it‚Äôs $1900, and that is just for me not to mention my S.O.

The wedding is in 4 months so it‚Äôs a VERY last minute change. Plus I am a teacher, so I don‚Äôt really have ‚Äúvacation time‚Äù outside of summer and holidays. I was planning on taking my ONE personal day of the year for the Monday, making it a long weekend.

To me, paying $1900 for 24 hours (half of Friday, half of Saturday, and all day Monday I would be spending trying to get there and back) is NOT worth it. Plus, as I mentioned, I‚Äôm a teacher and I don‚Äôt just have $1900 laying around to throw at a weekend getaway. 

I told my mom the situation and she thinks I‚Äôm a major asshole because ‚ÄúI committed to being a maid of honor so I committed to the responsibilities that comes with it.‚Äù To me, I committed to $600 and using the one personal day I have per year. If the huge destination thing would have been the plan from the beginning I would NOT have said yes. I feel terrible but it‚Äôs really not feasible for me.

So, I usually shower in the morning before getting dressed, but on days I have a workout class or a hike in the morning, I wait until AFTER working out to shower. This is probably only once a week or so - I'm no athlete. I still obviously brush my teeth, etc, before leaving the house.¬†


My argument for this is that taking two showers within a couple hours is terrible for your hair and skin. ¬†Also, why would you shower right BEFORE getting dirty and stinky?

I have a desk job, so I'm not getting particularly dirty throughout the day.

1397,No A-holes here,"This happened about a week ago but my girlfriend found out last night and I just want to know some other opinions on this. 

Last Friday night my friends and I went out, but grabbed dinner first at a restaurant some of them used to work at. Our waitress was a mutual friend and knew a lot of us and I only know her in passing because I never worked there but since my buddies did we just kind of know each other through that. It was a pretty uneventful dinner and we were grabbing our checks when I noticed she had left her number on my bill. 

So I told my friends and one of my friends said that she had told him she had a crush on me but is shocked she left the number because she is very shy and insecure. So, with the absolute most innocent of intentions, sent this exact text to her that night. ""Hey (her name), its (my name) from your table tonight. I am very flattered and appeciate you leaving me your number but I just wanted to reach out and let you know I have a girlfriend! You seem like a great girl and i'm sure we will be seeing each other around but I did want to just let you know about that. Have a great night!""

She responded back saying ""I completely understand and thank you for letting me know. You seem like a great guy too and wish the best for you. Maybe I paths will cross in the future :).""

That was it. That was last Friday and not a single thing was said between us since then. However, last night, I had some friends over for game night and somewhere in the conversation she came up and without even trying to hide it I talked about what had happened that night in front of my girlfriend because its not a big deal to me. She seemed put off but otherwise fine until everyone left and we got into a full on argument with her saying I broke her trust and texted another girl without telling her. I told her it was strictly to let her know that I did have a gf because I would be seeing her around anyway since we have mutual friends but my girlfriend is saying ""You only wanted to text her so she would have your number"" and other crazy accusations but in reality I just wanted to let the girl know so when we see each other it wouldnt be awkward.

1398,Not the A-hole,"I work in an investigative position for the Federal Government.  It's a small office that has about 8 full time investigators assigned to different cases.  All of my co-workers are in the 48-56 range,  I'm 32.

Through the last couple of years I've figured out how to automate about %60 of my job.  All the routine paper work we have to file can be done through Excel or a MS word template with drop down boxes.  Further more, unless I go to court I don't need to print anything, ever.  Which means I print all my docs as individual PDFs, then combine them in PDF Editor.

I've tried to show my coworkers how to do this, but they insist it's too complicated.  Even simple stuff like combining pages in a PDF editor they refuse to learn.  They still insist on printing everything after they have typed it out by hand, then scanning the paper docs back in to the computer.  The only thing I'm not able to make more efficient is interviewing people and making arrests.

A few months ago we were finally issued lap tops with hot spots that connect to a VPN, enabling us to work out in the field.  Because of this I no longer have any need to be in the office.  I wake up, login, do all my paper work, then head out to the field.  While it is not specifically against the rules(I checked with our version of Internal Affairs) there is no policy that says we are allowed to do it either.  Due to the fact that I have no distractions, or people asking me dumb questions I've effectively doubled the amount of cases I'm able to close.  Since all of our cases are tracked in a database I'm on track for employee of the year, which my supervisor announced to everybody.

This has bred resentment amongst all my coworkers.  Mainly, because they have been complaining that they are overworked.

Being tall was a major self-confidence issue growing up, I always towered over all the boys in my classes and was teased a lot for my height. Members of my family would always tell me that I'd scare all the boys off being so tall and that I'd be lucky to find someone to settle down with.

I just know that if I wear heels someone will make a rude comment about how I'm taller than my fiance and it will just make me sad.  I also bet that if I wear flats that comments might still be made. I don't want to let them still get to me but I also don't want what is supposed to be one of the best days of our lives to be tainted by people being a dick.

So reddit, would I be TA if I asked him to wear lifts in his shoes so he'd be a bit taller than me on our wedding day, with the hopes people will stfu about how tall I am?",106,147,0.84

My girlfriend of four years does not have (nor has she ever had) a drivers license. When we first met four years ago she expressed a desire to get her license and would always ask me questions about driving while I drove us both to work. I was happy to answer these questions she had about driving and to take her to work because it seemed she had a genuine intention to get her license in the near future. On several occasions we would even go out at night and I would let her drive my car around empty parking lots (kinda reckless of me, I know) and she seemed to take to it well and learn quickly. Soon after she enrolled in online drivers ed and ended up getting her learner's permit about a year after we had first started dating.

It was at this point when things started to change and driving seemed to become much less of a priority for her. She quit the job she was working at the time (which was right down the street from where I worked) and got two new jobs, one full-time and one part-time, that were significantly further from where I was working. While she did start taking public transit to and from work most of the time, there were still many instances where I would need to pick her up and drive her home due to the fact that she would often get out after midnight and often could not catch the last bus.

It was during this time where my girlfriend completely stopped even mentioning getting her license. During the one year period where she had her learner's permit she did not drive a single time. I would constantly try to motivate her to take some behind the wheel classes or offer to let her drive my car but she always refused. It is at this time the constant driving that I need to do for both of us starts to take its toll on me and I become more persistent on bring this up. Her response to this is usually that I do not need to drive her places and that she is fine with taking Uber/Lyft and public transit. Any attempts to prod further usually end with her getting silent and visibly annoyed at me.

This is basically where we are at currently. My girlfriend and I had a big argument yesterday about this issue (it had probably been months since I last brought it up) that ended with her sort of shutting down when I mentioned that if we were to have kids it would be vital that she know how to drive just in case there was some sort of emergency. Normally, I would say that whether someone chooses to drive or not is totally up to them, but when we first started dating she made it clear she was going to learn and I feel like it isn't fair to me that she either suddenly had a change of heart or had no intention of learning in the first place.

I would be interested to hear everybody's thoughts on the situation. If I am the asshole, please let me know and I would be happy to reassess my point of view. Thank you.",121,212,0.92

From the UK, My family had planned a day trip to visit the biggest Hindu temple outside of India in London,UK (we are not Hindu but this temple allows guests to come and learn about their beliefs etc) 

My step daughter (8) had gone to a party the day before and had a unicorn face painted across her cheek. 

She usually has her bath in the evenings so her dad agreed that she could have a bath when we returned home from our visit to the temple, meaning she had yesterday‚Äôs unicorn still painted across her face. 

I told her that she had to at least was her face as it would be disrespectful to enter the temple with face paint still on. She cried her eyes out as she wanted to keep the face paint on; my partner (her father) says I was being the arsehole by making her take it off and it was fine to go to the temple like that as she was just a child.

I (F36), have been married to my husband (M40), for 9 years now. When I first met him about 12 years ago, he was on the chubbier side, but I wouldn't say he was massively overweight. He stayed near enough that way for a long time.

About a year ago, he began going to the gym frequently and focused on his weight tremendously. The effects became apparent quickly. He transformed his body and became pretty fit. Of course, I supported him and tried my best to help him throughout his journey.

Yesterday, we were cuddling in bed and I made what I thought was a 'harmless' comment. I jokingly told him that cuddling was better back then before his weight loss because he was squishier. I didn't mean any harm towards him. However, I could instantly tell he didn't like it and he left to the bathroom quickly. After he returned he said he was tired of cuddling and to 'leave him alone'.

1415,Not the A-hole,"I have a son aged 1 and we regularly see my girlfriend‚Äôs best mate who I‚Äôll name Jane and her daughter who‚Äôll name Megan. Megan is going through her rebellious stage but I‚Äôve been really impressed at how Jane has been handling her naughty episodes.

Now Megan is into pushing at the moment and she‚Äôs been told off every time it has happened in front of me by her mother. My son has the tendency to get up in her face a lil more than he should. For example I‚Äôve watched Jane tell my son not to touch Megan‚Äôs face a couple of times and if I was in her shoes I would have done the same but she‚Äôs been right next to them every time it‚Äôs occurred.

They were both at my house and I had the two kids in front of me in the front room, whilst my girlfriend and Jane were chatting round the corner in the kitchen. Megan pushes my son to the ground (not very aggressively) and the very British words that came out of my mouth were ‚ÄúOi, we don‚Äôt do that‚Äù. The ‚ÄúOi‚Äù may have came out louder than I would have preferred but in the moment I just wanted to get Megan‚Äôs attention.
If Jane was in the room at the time and saw it I‚Äôd have let her deal with it like I usually do. 

After Jane heard what‚Äôd happened she came round the corner and asked if Megan has pushed my son again, which I replied yes. Jane instantly pulled Megan to the side and said ‚Äúlook, [me] has had to tell you off, you‚Äôre embarrassing me‚Äù and then said they were going to go home.

‚ÄúHey, I just wanted to message about yesterday as it's been bothering me. I think it's obvious that Megan is going through a phase at the moment and she's having a hard time listening etc. But I just want to say that although I completely understand that it must be frustrating seeing a two year old pushing [my son] but she is just two and still a toddler and I don't know if you even realised but I didnt appreciate how you told Meghan off. I've told her off every time she's needed to be and not just standing there pretending she isn't misbehaving. I wont let anyone speak to her in that way, not even her own dad. She doesn't have men in her life except her uncle's and her two cousins and I don't want her thinking that a man can raise their voice to her. I'm her mum and I do the telling off in my eyes.

I should add that Megan hasn‚Äôt had any contact with her father but AITA in this situation? I might have been a little more louder than intended but I was surprised. I‚Äôd expect her to tell my son off if the situation was reversed or if it were my girlfriend in the room with them when the incident happened.

1416,Not the A-hole,"I'm 17F and I joined the US Naval Sea Cadets about a year ago. Pretty much as soon as I joined, one of the other cadets (16M, we'll call him K) started spending a lot of time around me. At first, I attributed it to me being new and him not having a lot of friends but I soon realized it was something more than that. His behavior towards me has been making me feel uncomfortable for a while. Some of the things he's done are:
- sit/stand next to me at every possible opportunity
- try to convince me multiple times to hang out with him outside of the Sea Cadets
- make me feel bad because I didn't tell him about my spam account on Instagram
- ask me out as soon as he realized I was single (I said no)
- invade my boundaries to the point where other people in the Sea Cadets asked me if anything was going on
...
There are more examples but I can't think of them right now, and I try to politely shy away from him without outright telling him to go away. I don't want to be rude because we are friends after all. 

Anyways this week he asked me to homecoming at his school despite the fact that I already said no to him before AND we live about 40 minutes away from each other so it would be majorly inconvenient. I told him ""no"" for the second time, which he seemed to accept. However, we had an all-day event yesterday for the Sea Cadets and his behavior was making me seriously uncomfortable. He made a crown for me out of paper (spending far too much time and effort on it) and posted a picture of me wearing it on his Instagram story without my permission. Later, when we went out to dinner as a group, he tried to get me to do a duet with him on karaoke and seemed annoyed when I declined. This would usually make me uncomfortable as it is but given the fact that he just asked me out makes it even worse. I started becoming annoyed and I'm worried I was too rude to him but he didn't see to understand that his actions weren't acceptable. Last night I sent him a long text telling him to respect my boundaries or else get lost, which he has not yet replied to.

I'm seriously thinking of reporting his behavior to our leaders in the Sea Cadets but it makes me feel like a giant asshole. He's been nothing but nice to me since I've met him and I feel like this would be a dick move to pull on him. I also feel like maybe I wasn't clear enough in expressing my discomfort with his actions and maybe he just didn't get the message.

1417,Not the A-hole,"I used to be very close with my dad, until a few years ago when he took up golf. He now plays it every evening and at weekends he plays golf both days and usually attends a golf related event in the evening so trying to see him is very difficult.

I told him a month ago that my plan for my birthday was an escape room in a local town, followed by a meal and then the cinema. My dad always boasts about how wealthy he is but he is also very particular with money so I said I would pay for everything other than the meal (¬£100+ in total). I only asked him for his time and as he had golf from 7:30-2 that day, that I would fit it around his golf.

He didn't come back with a response until I pushed him for a final answer so I could book the escape room as it was close to being fully booked. He did not think we could get to the escape room, meal and cinema in time and said that he would go to the escape room, then the meal and then call it a night. I begrudgingly agreed as I knew we had plenty of time to do all three, but didn't want an argument over my birthday. I booked the escape room at ¬£80 (which is most of my free income for the month) and agreed he would pick me and my boyfriend up at 4:30 to get to the escape room for 5:30.

As we are going out for a meal afterwards, I decided to do a bit of make up before going out so started getting ready at 3:30, giving myself an hour before my dad picked me up. He called me shortly after saying he was on the way. I asked if he was serious and he said yes because he wanted to get there on time. I said that its a 30 minute drive (it is closer to a 20 minute drive in total) and I was not ready. He then became irate and started shouting at me down the phone saying its only a bit of make up, it shouldn't take me longer than 10 minutes and that he would be here at 4:15. I, again begrudgingly agreed to this time but he cut me off saying ""You know what? fuck it get the fucking bus"" and then hung up.

It would have taken me and my partner over 2 hours to get to the escape room via the bus so we had to cancel the event as we would not be able to get there on time and even if he did change his mind, we did not want to spend an hour locked in a room with my dad being this angry. I lost the cost of the event and my dad became further irate and texted me saying ""Are you seriously going to give up ¬£80 because of a little make up?"". The rest of my family have taken my dads side and have said I am very selfish for cancelling the event because of my dads attitude and my nan told me that I should take abuse from my dad to avoid ruining the day. I feel that I was entitled to dress up nicely for my own birthday and do not think I should have to put up with my dad's abuse when it was him who was changing the plans at the last minute.

TLDR; I cancelled the event for my birthday, at my cost, because my dad was giving me copious amounts of verbal abuse due to not being willing to change the plans at last minute.

1419,Not the A-hole,"FINAL Update!!!

Sorry it's taken me so long to update, it's been a hectic last few days. So long story short, the boys refused to sign the lease and also refused to leave after the deadline I gave them was up. I had to get my uncle to come move them out. He's generally an asshole but in situations like this he's great to have on your side. He basically told the boys they could willingly leave and he'd use his truck to help them move or we'd call the cops to get them forcibly removed from the property and he'd help me take all their stuff to the dump. They realised he was serious when he started dragging out all their stuff and throwing it in his truck bed.

So they're gone, all of them. The youngest brother got guilt tripped into moving out with them. He's staying with a friend and I don't know where the others are because they're not talking to me. I haven't asked any of our friends or the youngest brother because I don't want to put them in the middle of our feuding.

I'm still going to stay in touch with the youngest brother as much as I can but I also dont want to create problems for him so it won't be the same as before where we were constantly together. I've lost a few friends over it but am happily suprised that most of them took my side once they heard the full story. Most of them are still friends with my ex as well but that's okay with me as long as they don't expect me to be around him. Of course me and my boyfriend are over. I'm heartbroken but I know it was for the best. Sadly I think I'm more upset about the loss of the rest of his family (especially his mom) than I am about our breakup. 

I'm staying with my mom for another couple days until I can get the locks changed. I have a couple girl friends who are going to be moving in but that won't happen until January when their lease is up. So until then I'll be dipping into my savings to pay the bills. 


Update #2

So last night was a disaster. I tried to have a calm logical discussion but they kept interrupting me and trying to guilt me into backing down. Finally the attorney told them to shut the hell up and laid out what was going to happen. He's big, intimidating, and much older than us so they listened to him. I'm so happy that I got him and the real estate agent to come with me because I was a crying mess and had a hard time talking. I'd told them what I wanted to happen beforehand so they basically just reiterated everything I'd said to them. They also both gave the boys a dressing down.

The youngest brother actually suprised my by apologising and then growing a backbone and standing up to his brothers when they tried to say I was wrong. My boyfriend was completely useless and just parroted whatever his other two brothers said at first. I think at one point he realised he was wrong because he stopped talking at all. The other two just kept saying how wrong I was and that I was being unfair by ambushing them all of a sudden. Only the youngest brother signed the lease. I told the other three they have till next Thursday (the house payment is due on Friday) to sign the lease and pay me their rent. In the lease I raised their rent to $650 (worth closer to $800) and listed certain responsibilities they had around the house. When the meeting started I'd told them we could negotiate but they didn't even try.
I ended up leaving the restaurant with the real estate agent who gave me a ride to my mom's house. I didn't think I could go home with them without caving.

I don't think they're going to sign the lease. But now I'm not sure I want them to after everything they said last night. The only one that even remotely respects me is the youngest brother. I think my relationship with my boyfriend is pretty much over. I'm still going to try to talk it out with the therapist away from his brothers but I really don't think it's going to work out. I think I'm in shock or something because I'm kind of just emotionally numb now. I feel like I should be crying or angry or something but there's nothing there.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATE!!!!!

Thanks so much to everyone who has replied! Your support and comments have helped clarify things for me. The general consensus seems to be dump my boyfriend and kick them all out. But I'm not yet willing to end such important relationships. I know I deserve better, but I want to give them a chance to fix things before I cut them off.

So I talked to my boyfriend and told him I'm really not happy with our relationship and unless things changed I no longer saw a future for us. I told him we needed to go see a therapist together. He wanted to work things out ""just between us"" but I knew ""us"" really meant me, him, AND his brothers. So I told him it was non-negotiable and if he refused to go then we just needed to go ahead and end things. He whined a bit but eventually folded when he realized I wasn't going to back down like I usually do. I found a therapist online and have set up an appointment for next week. I even put it in his phone with reminders for the day before and an hour before so he can't try to say he forgot.

I also told my boyfriend and his brothers I was taking them out for dinner tonight. Didn't tell them the purpose of the dinner is to discuss their rent and other responsibilities because I knew they'd just repeat the arguement if I didn't immediately tell them I was agreeing with them. I've recruited the support of a couple of my mom's friends. They're not our friends so they're be more impartial. One's a real estate agent and the others an attorney. I've explained the situation to them and they pretty much agree with all of you. They're mostly there so I don't lose my courage but they're also going to help us hash out a lease. The real estate agent is bringing examples of similar listings to show them they're getting a really good deal with me. I don't really think the attorney is necessary but he will be helpful in making the boys realise that a lease is a binding legal agreement not just a piece of paper to sign to momentarily placate me without them having to make any actual changes.

ORIGINAL POST
Two years ago I bought a house. I worked really hard to get good credit and save up enough for the down payment, plus a few repairs and all the furnishings. When I moved in, my boyfriend and his two brothers moved in with me. They were paying $500 each for their old apartment so I kept their rent the same because they're all in school, don't make much money, and I make enough to cover the difference. Recently their youngest brother finished high school and also moved in with us. I'm also charging him $500 a month. I lowered my own payments but not theirs and now they're all mad at me.
Mortgage plus utilities is about $3,300 a month. They pay $500 each and I was paying $1,800 but am now paying $1,300 a month since their youngest brother moved in with us.

They say it's only fair that they lower their rent too, but I dont really want to. They say that it's my house so I should automatically pay more but I've given them equal access to everything in the house and pay for all the repairs myself so I don't think that's right. They tried to say that I should be paying more because I make more than any of them. But if we were divining it up based on income two of the brothers would pay $594/mo, two would pay $297/mo, and I'd pay $1,518/mo. Now they want me to pay $1,500, and them to pay $600 and $300. I told them no, that me cooking all their meals and doing most of the housework makes up for that $200 a month I'm not paying. 

I know that they can all afford what I'm asking of them. I want to cut back on how much I work which would mean a lower income. Plus I'm trying to save up for my wedding which I'll be paying for entirely by myself, including all three rings. They don't seem to know how to save and I had to set up automatic deposit of their paychecks and automatic withdrawals for our bills just so they didn't spend everything on video games and junk food.

I think I'm right, but our friends and family are split over the issue. Some are on my side and even say I should be charging them more than I am. Some are on their side. And others say we're both wrong. So Reddit, who's the asshole here and what should we do about it?",416,996,0.95
1420,Not the A-hole,"Girlfriend lives at my place and rescued a ~~Husky~~ Shiba? type dog without asking me beforehand. I've been pet-free forever and I am allergic to dogs, cats and rabbits. This is known and the reason I said no to pets early on. But this dog was going to die and she saved it! Hallelujah!

For the past 3 weeks I've been hopped up on antihistamines, eyedrops and calamine lotion (for hives). I want to get rid of the dog, but legally can't as it's not registered to me. I feel like I've a never ending itchy flu and I'm in a foul mood. The insides of my ears are itchy.

My terms for if the dog is to be kept.

* She pays for anything that will reduce my allergies
* She solely pays for the dog. Food, vet, etc
* She is solely responsible for removing dog hair and cleaning after the dog
* No dog inside when I'm there (this one will be a losing battle forever)

She's highly opposed to this as we live together and should share the load. She also says it means that she'll end up doing almost all the cleaning of the house since ""dog hair gets everywhere"". At this point I'm saying it's her problem to fix as my solution is simple.

I hate this dog (its presence, it's actually friendly and trained) and I'm even thinking of just giving it away and telling her it ran away.

1422,Not the A-hole,"After typing this post, I was originally at 8000 letters so here is a super concise version of the story. I am happy to clear up any gaps or confusions on the information. I am a 20-year-old junior in college. My parents got divorced in 2017 and my relationship with my father has been strained since. He lives with his current wife and her daughter about an hour away from where my mother and sister live. My dad spends the majority of his time with them and will occasionally reach out to my sister and me to hang out, maybe every other month and holidays.

This weekend was his wedding and they were getting married in the mountains about 8.5 hours away from where I live. The place was massive and beautiful with about 6 bedrooms, each with multiple beds. Staying here was my dad, his 5 friends, his wife, one of her daughters that she has full custody over, and her family, about 6-8 people, so in total around 12-14 people. When I got there, there was broken chairs and doors, people were having drunk sex in the hot tub, and his wife's 14-year-old daughter was taking shots. My dad's wife was stressing over how much money this trip was going to cost and my dad was extremely drunk spouting how his company was paying for everything and money was no issue.

I asked him about the wedding and he said the house is where the ceremony was being held and everyone would be drinking and eating all day. I found out that my girlfriend, sister, and I would not be staying here but at the ‚Äúcheap mountain‚Äù as my dad put it, 30 minutes away with his wife‚Äôs mother, other two children that his wife has partial custody over, and their neighbor. Already we were really upset we wouldn‚Äôt be staying with them but it was 1 am and we were ready to sleep.

After arriving, there was a huge difference between our apartment we would be staying at and the private house everyone else was at. We went inside and were immediately burning up. It turned out that this apartment had no central ac or fans inside and we could not open the windows. We were also shocked to see her other two kids sleeping on the floor, especially her disabled child that cannot walk without the assistance of a walker.

My original plan was to stay the night and hang out the next day and leave that night, but when we laid down in our bedroom it was impossible to sleep with how hot it was. We were sitting in the room sweating so we decided to cut our losses and make the drive back home. I decided to send my dad a text saying how my sister and I felt like a second thought to his new family and how much it hurt us to come celebrate his new family and be excluded from them as well. I currently have my fathers number blocked until Monday when everyone will be home and sober so we can talk this over.

TLDR: My dad, his friends, his wife, her kid, her family stayed in a super nice house while my sister and I were put at the ""cheap mountain."" We drove home and texted my dad how disappointed we were.",21,86,0.92

Lily's favourite sport is basketball and she has one in her room which she takes out to play with her friends a lot. 

Sam came in and said they needed a ball to play. Lily was out watching a movie with her friends, and the only ball I could think of in the house was Lily's basketball, and I suggested that.

When Lily came home and found out they'd taken her ball, she was annoyed. She went and got it back, prompting an argument between Lily and Sam in the house. Sam said that I'd let him, and Lily shouted at me that I know they shouldn't be kicked and went to her room crying. 

My husband asked why Lily was in a bad mood and when I explained everything, and he agrees with Lily that it was wrong of my to give Sam her ball. While I shouldn't have forgotten that basketball's shouldn't be kicked, I should say that I had about a million things to deal with when Sam was pestering me about a ball so I said the first thing that came into my head.",31,81,0.89

1425,Everyone Sucks,"I'm in uni with my gf who I've been dating for a year. A couple of months ago she made out with another guy while sober multiple times, and hid it from me but eventually other people told me about it. We broke up but she was apologetic and remorseful, so I decided to give her another chance and try to move on.

Last night she mentioned going out with her friends and drinking. I told her how I was not comfortable with this given how we are still working on rebuilding trust in our relationship, and that l'm fine with you going out and having fun but getting drunk and going to parties where that guy you hooked up with will be there too will make me feel upset. I didn't want to give her an ultimatum so told her to do whatever she wants, but getting drunk and going out before we've fully worked through our issues and I have 100% trust with her would just work against all the progress we have made.

She said that she does not want a controlling boyfriend telling her what to do, and that she knows she is not going to hook up with anyone if she gets drunk so she should be able to do whatever she wants. She said that if I respected her I would be fine with her making these decisions and doing what she wanted. She did say I could go out with her if she wanted, but I have a lot of work so stayed in.

Ultimately she did get drunk and go out, I did feel weird about it and kept thinking what if she is with him again. I am upset with her, but not sure if my feelings are justified or if I am in the wrong here. So reddit, AITA?

tl;dr: girlfriend cheated on me, working on regaining trust, she wanted to get drunk and go to a party the guy she hooked up with was at, I was fine with her going out but didn't want her to get drunk.

Update: thanks for the responses, I understand how my actions made me the asshole. Honestly I don't think that I can get past this so I am just going to apologize for what I said and trying to stop her from drinking but also break up with her because I will never be fine with it and do not want to be in a miserable relationship.",46,32,0.84
1426,Not the A-hole,"OK so this is kinda complex, I'll make it short.  This acc is just for privacy reasons

-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. 

-I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23

-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. 

-Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. 

-Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty.

1431,Not the A-hole,"My sister has been staying with me for a few days, it's been fine, I like my sister. Problem is she has a habit of leaving her phone/laptop/anything really on the edge of the table, or any surface she puts it. Like 3/4 of her laptop are resting on the table and 1/4 is hanging over the edge, sometimes more that that. She's done this since we where kids and it hasn't caused much worse than a few broken glasses. 

When she came over I warned her about it, my cat likes parkour-ing through the house and jump from surface to surface, the table is no exception. (He's allowed on the table when we're not eating). He's thrown things off the table before if they're too close to the edge. 

Anyways, it happened. Cat jumped on the laptop and it fell on the ground, cracked the screen but still works. Now she wants me to pay for a replacement. I told her it's a hard no, I warned her about it but she still left it in a unsafe place. She went home and told our parents her side, they believe we should split it 50/50. 

I'm all for pet owners taking responsibility, but I also believe that if someone warns you not to do something it's your own responsibility at that point. But my parents and sister clearly don't agree. 

Sidenote: My sister is 20, I'm 23f. 

AITA? 

TLDR: I warned my sister not to leave things on the edge of the table because the cat might throw it off, it happened, she wants me to buy her a new laptop, I refused.

Edit: I wasn't home when it happened. Tables are fine to leave things on if they're not super close to the edges.

INFO: I leave my laptop on the table all the time, just not dangling over the edge. It's safe. My cat weighs like 3 pounds so he can't knock a laptop off the table unless it's not all the way on the table. My sister told me she left it on the table as well.

I know screen replacements exists, but my sister told me 'if I'm doing that I might as well buy a new laptop', I don't know why. It's not a Mac or touchscreen, I'm not 100% sure what it is.

I do have renters insurance, I don't think this is covered but I can look into. 

And lastly I'm trying to train my cat, I haven't had him long so there's lots of other things I found more important to teach first. And I know some people find it gross to let your cat on the table, but I don't eat at the table and it's not in the kitchen so I don't care much.",771,3316,0.96

So it's a bit of a long story, but to summarize, my friend was moving states and couldn't take their cat, so asked us to give him a home. He ended up being rather aggresive and my cats were real freaked out even after being given time to adjust (3 months). Eventually we decided we needed to rehome him. However, our friend got arrested before then and of course couldn't do anything about the cat. 


So, we found him a home with a nice family who just loved him, and keeps us updated on how he's doing, and we thought all is well. However, our friend got out of jail and is now pissed that we gave away his cat without talking to him about it. He cussed us out and said we better watch our backs. Our friends we talked to about it said it was kinda fucked to do that, too. So AITA for rehoming his cat while he was in jail?",57,42,0.87
1433,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory. I'm the middle child of 3 girls, but we were all raised in different households.  We were all born and raised in Houston, but my younger sister moved an hour away for college, and our older sister moved there as well to be with her gf. So all their family is in Houston, but they were both in the same city 10 minutes from each other until our younger sister moved to California when she graduated.

My nephew turned 1 this weekend. The day of the party my younger sister calls me at 10 am and says that I should head over for the party. I say I don't know the address. She says I should've just drove in that direction and called when I was in the city and they'd give me the directions. My older sister texts me the address. I ask when will the party start because my older sister is notorious for never starting anything on time. I was told the party would start when I get there since it'll just be me, my children, my sisters, her children, and my older sisters gf. We were going to Chuck E Cheese.

I feed my girls breakfast and we head out. We get there at 1. Nobody is dressed or ready and my older sister is getting her hair done. I hadn't eaten yet because I thought we would go when I got there. My sister says relax, we can have sister time that I always want. My little sister goes to sleep and my older sister is watching tv or talking with her gf while doing her hair. I'm hungry, but they keep saying we're going to go soon. Over time, my kids get hungry, so I say we're going to go home because I have no idea when we're going to go, and everytime I ask I'm told I'm rushing them. Finally at 5 we go. My older sisters gf gets 4 play cards with time for the kids, but doesn't let the kids hold them because they lose them. They also just get 2 medium pizzas for 5 adults and 5 children. So I get a medium pizza and a card with points because my youngest would waste the time. She is playing a game with my younger sister and my sister takes the tickets and puts them in the birthday boy pile. I say no, those are her tickets. So my sister grabs them and gives them to me and my sisters gf goes off saying I'm stealing tickets from the bday boy. I say no, they're her tickets. My older sister comes over and says ""well [gf] bought the cards, and it is customary to give your tickets to the birthday person at the end of the party."" That makes absolutely no sense to me because my children played the games, and when it comes time to cash in the tickets, they're going to want something. And, I bought the card my youngest was using so it is her tickets. I say whatever, give them all the tickets and the cards back and we leave. AITA?

1436,Asshole,"My brother-in-law Dan is a musician. He is one of the most well-known artists of his genre in our country, but that doesn‚Äôt translate to having a reliable source of income as his genre is new and very niche. Since he and my sister Mia (both in their late 20‚Äôs) started dating two years ago, Mia has been paying most of their bills from her salary working for our grandfather‚Äôs company and income from trust funds. 

My parents weren‚Äôt thrilled about Dan and Mia‚Äôs financial arrangement, but Mia said that she loves how passionate Dan is about music and how happy he is when he‚Äôs performing, and she doesn‚Äôt mind paying the bills if it means that Dan can focus on his craft. Mia is happy when Dan is happy, and for her that is enough. For my part I personally like Dan and know that he‚Äôs a good person who genuinely loves Mia ‚Äì he just happens to not make a lot of money.

Two months ago, Dan and Mia got married after finding out that Mia is pregnant, so now they‚Äôre responsible not only for themselves but for a child as well. My parents are excited to have their first grandchild but are concerned about Dan not having a job which will realistically allow him to take care of his family. And I have to say I agree. The expenses will only grow from hereon, and though we will always be there to help, it‚Äôs Dan and Mia who have foremost responsibility for their own child. 

I talked to Dan the other day and told him that now that he has a baby on the way, I think he should get a stable job for his family‚Äôs financial security. I asked him to think about working with me in my father‚Äôs business, and hopefully he can be a bigger part of our family‚Äôs business in the near future. I told him that this means he will have to put his music on hold, but sometimes the things we need to do have to take precedence over the things we want to do. Dan thanked me and said he will think about it. 

Mia called me that night and she was fuming. Dan talked to her about what I said, and he told her he was thinking about selling his instruments and equipment and quitting music altogether in favor of taking up my offer. Mia asked him if that‚Äôs what he really wants to do, and Dan said that it‚Äôs not but it is what he needs to do for their child. 

Mia told me that what I did was the equivalent of telling Dan that he and his career don‚Äôt amount to anything, and that was tremendously disrespectful. That she loved him because he was an artist who followed his heart and money wasn‚Äôt the most important thing to him, and now I was trying to turn him into another white-collar guy who thinks he needs to chase money.

1438,No A-holes here,"I share a fence with a neighbour. She's a single mum of 2 kids, who are very well behaved, non bratty children 99% of the time. The younger is an 11 year old boy, and the older is a 13 year old girl. She has lived here since her kids were babies, while my husband and I only moved here within the last year.

This morning the mum knocked on my door, and said she had a meeting with her lawyer, and asked if she could leave the kids here for an hour. I said sure (it's illegal to leave kids under 14 alone in the house where we live) but I warned her that as I have a 6 month old and my husband was out, I couldn't pay very close attention because of the baby. She assured me they'd be fine, and the kids asked if they could go play fetch with my dog in the garden. The baby started crying, and as she was napping before this I went to check on her, and told the kids I'd come make sure they were alright in 10 minutes.

Within 5 minutes I hear a loud crash. I went to check on them, still holding the baby, and an entire fence panel had come down. It looks like the girl fell into the panel. She's not fat but it's an old fence so the full force of her body going into it was probably the kiss of death for the old wood and the panel had first split where she'd caught it and then folded in half. I checked her over and she had a small scrape on the middle of her back (presumably where she first hit the fence) and another on her hand where she'd shielded herself from the fence. I put antiseptic on both scrapes to be safe (but there was no blood or cut so she probably didn't need it). There were no other injuries, and I sat down with them, the baby and some biscuits/juice in front of the TV until their mum got back, in order to prevent further issues. I also brought the dog in because there was a huge chunk of fence missing.

The broken fence panels are on the side I share with their mother, so I looked up the cost of paneling to replace it, as I spent a few years working for my uncle, a carpenter, so I could fix it up and not have to pay someone to do it. The cost of a single replacement panel that I could fit is ¬£19.99. The mum came to pick the kids up and I explained what had happened. She checked her daughter over and thanked me for looking after them. I then showed her the replacement panel I found and said if we could each put in ¬£10 I'd have my husband pick it up and we'd fit it in place of the old one.

The mum then says that there is no way she'll pay for a brand new fence panel, told me to just fix the old one (which I could do but it would be insanely unstable and dangerous to go near on either side) and said that as this happened on my watch it wasn't her responsibility to replace it, even though her kids broke it, as I was meant to be looking after them. It's only ¬£10, I didn't think that was such a big deal, but now I'm thinking I should have just sucked it up and left it alone.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am going to cover the cost of the fence and stop babysitting. I'll probably replace the whole thing because all of the panels are like the broken one - old, weak, generally in really bad shape. There's 7 panels on her side so the total cost will probably be about ¬£140, but she's not paying for it. The panels on the other side are fine as the neighbour on that side replaced them last year, shortly before we moved in.

Also the fence is technically on her property and is easily over a decade old. I've only lived in my house for less than a year, while she's lived next door for about 11 years. Really, she should have fixed the fence *years* ago. And she can afford it.",210,1535,0.96

He fears his son will not want to see him every weekend if he‚Äôs too tough on him, so he lets him get away with a lot. His son is 10 and demands that his dad buys him things, doesn‚Äôt say thank you, steals money from his wallet and laughs about it, jokingly says things to his dad like ‚Äústop it or I‚Äôll kill you‚Äù, etc.

Since I‚Äôve met this kid, I have gone out of my way for him frequently because it‚Äôs obvious to me from his behavior that he‚Äôs neglected at his mom‚Äôs house. I‚Äôve cooked all of his meals, taken him to places, and even tried to help him with his math. Every weekend that he comes over, he always acts out either by saying something inappropriate, not listening, or getting an attitude when he doesn‚Äôt get his way. His dad hasn‚Äôt disciplined him, and instead has appeased him every time. 

Yesterday, I thought it would be a good idea to take him to a festival that has live music, food trucks and art from local artists. Once we‚Äôre in the car, he‚Äôs asking where we‚Äôre going and I‚Äôm telling him it‚Äôs a surprise. He starts asking over and over again where we‚Äôre going until we get out of the car, starts pouting and gets an attitude because I told him to wait and see. His dad told him as we‚Äôre walking up, but he maintained the attitude towards me for a half hour until he decided he wanted ice cream. So we‚Äôre walking around and about every 5 minutes he asks to leave to go to the bookstore. He ends up enjoying himself, but maintains when asked that he didn‚Äôt have any fun and that he‚Äôd rather be home watching tv.

Once we get home, my boyfriend and I start cooking dinner and get him involved. He gets an attitude at first but ends up enjoying himself. By this time, I‚Äôd already expressed to my boyfriend that I was at my limit with the smack talking and attitudes. He didn‚Äôt address it and gave his son tasks to keep him involved. He continues to act out by putting half of a watermelon shell on his head and running around to the front of the house to ring the doorbell nonstop. 

As we‚Äôre eating, he‚Äôs talking smack and still acting out. I tell him that it‚Äôs free to be kind, follow directions and that not doing these things will cost him, as I don‚Äôt do nice things for kids that don‚Äôt deserve them. He gets an attitude and says he doesn‚Äôt care if I do nice things for him.

1442,Not the A-hole,"I'm adamant that I was not being an asshole. But my co worker told me that yeah, I was very rude. 

I went to a drive thru as Dunkin Donuts this morning. I -never- buy coffee from places like this or Starbucks, usually I just drink whatever is in the break room at the office or grabbing a bottle/can of something out of the office concession. I pulled into DD to get a sandwich and figured I might as well try something hot this morning.

I ask the guy at the speaker to give me a moment. There are NO people in line. None in front of me and none behind me and the lobby inside didnt seem busy. I can't figure out the menu though, I never ordered coffee like this. I dunno what a macchiato is. I don't know what a cappuchino is. What one do I order? Or do I just order coffee? I kinda give up and ask for a ""large coffee"" and he asks if I want flavor, cream, or sugar. I admit that I'm not sure. When I make my own coffee, I usually pour the from the pot then add a couple pumps of the coffee mate liquid flavored creamers and that's that. I tell him I want French Vanilla and Hazelnut flavor then ask his opinion on whether I should still get cream and/or sugar. He suggested I get cream as well. So I order a Large coffee with cream and french vanilla and hazelnut flavor. I pull around to the window and he hands me my coffee and my bagged sandwich and hashbrowns. Then takes my card before handing it back. I say thanks and go to drive off when I hear him say ""Seriously? No tip?"" When I looked back at him he looked to the girl at the counter inside and told her ""She didn't tip. No tip can you believe that?"" and I pulled off in embarrassment. I thought I did something wrong.

I was so ashamed. I don't carry any paper money or coins, I use my card for everything. So I didn't even have a way to tip EVEN IF I WANTED to. To be honest, I didn't think I was supposed to tip fast food. Much less drive thru. When he called me out for not tipping I got flustered. Got to work and ate my food while telling a co worker what happened. As I ate my hashbrowns, the bag was half full of soggy and cold hashbrowns, so I felt vindicated and reaffirmed that even if I DID have cash on me, I shouldn't had tipped.

My co worker says I'm an asshole because I asked for a moment to look at the menu (1-2 minutes TOPS) even if there were no other cars in line. Says I continued to be an asshole when I asked for his advice on my coffee then didn't tip. She said it'd have been fine if I knew what I wanted and ordered ""like a normal person"" but since I took their time up and asked for help I should have tipped 2-3$.

Thing is, if the game requires any tiny bit of thinking, puzzle solving or searching, he goes directly to YouTube. 

Now, it's obviously not a crime at all. I used guides too when I was his age and still do. But I used them *only* when I was stuck and had tried to figure it out for a while. He uses them for every-single-thing. 

Also, English is not our native language. I know many people (myself included) who were able to practice their English reading comprehension by being forced to play videogames in English.

I consider videogames an AWESOME tool to learn problem solving, decision making, critical thinking and many other great mental gymnastics. 

And here's where my problem with him resorting to YouTube 100% of the time lies. IMO he's not going to develop any of that because he's getting spoon fed the solutions all the time. He searches for Spanish-speaking YouTubers so he doesn't have to figure out what the game is asking him to do. And he's being shown how to solve every puzzle, where to find every item, how to kill every boss, etc.

The other problem is that he almost always comes in, very smug, showing off what item he got, what boss he defeated (yeah it takes hand-eye skills to do so, but part of the journey is figuring out *how* to kill them), etc. He even turns it into a competition like, checking to see if I already reached the point in the game he's on. If I have, he makes a frustrated gesture and if I haven't, he points it out constantly. He sometimes also points out things about the game that neither of us has found yet, ""I know how to get the super flashy sword from this boss, do you?"" 

Mostly at these times is where I have to minimize his smuggness by pointing out he only knows these things, defeated those bosses, or found those items because he saw it on YouTube instead of finding things on his own. He's obviously not practicing his reading comprehension or his English like many other people have before him. I insist on him using YouTube only as a final resource after trying to figure things out on his own and paying attention to what the characters say or the clues they give him.

I've even started to think and suggest that I should maybe take YouTube away from him since it's making him lazy. (There's a whole other clich√© parenting thread I could start by talking about how kids are stuck to YouTube nowadays but it's all been said before).

I know I probably sound like a cranky old man yelling at a cloud, but AITA here?

Edit: I may not have been clear on the smugness paragraph. It appears some of you think I'm jealous of my kid for getting the flashy sword before me or something. What I mean by pointing that out is that I try to point out to him how it'll be more rewarding if he figures it out on his own instead of looking it up on YouTube. When he does figure stuff out on his own I praise him. When he shows me something in the game that I didn't know and he discovered himself, I praise and thank him.",58,130,0.89

1448,Asshole,"So about a month ago i was talking to guy in work. Hes a pretty fit guy like myself and we were talking about gym routines. 

Id seem a picture of him on facebook and he has almost perfect physic and i was asking his secrets. 

He explained to me that it wasnt all him and showed me an app on his phone that he used to edit his pictures and give him that extra boost. The app was free so i downloaded it. 

It was pretty good and I showed my GF the pics and she thought they we pretty good too. Over the coming weeks i got a bit obsessed about editing pics of myself and then got bored with it, never shared a picture with anyone other then her and the guy in work. One day i was again  bored watching some program i eith the gf so started to play with it again. Edited myself, the cat and a few pictures of my gf. 

Even though she is also in good shape ( we gym or so oyher activity ever other day) I gave her a flatter stomach, pinched waste and bigger boobs. After a while id thought I'd done a good job and showed it to her, she was not impressed at all asked why id done it. I explained i was bored with the tv programme and wonder what she would look like with bigger boobs. 

She got  annoyed tunned of the programme and went upstairs to watch it. 

Am i the arsehole?

Edit.

Fristly i think my girlfriend is beautiful. This wasnt for me wanting to change her. I also did other pictures like long arms and making my cat super fat.

We spoke about 30 minutes later and i apologised as i never intended to upset her. We are cool and she knows i think shes beautiful.

I accept it was a bit tastless. I will stick to funny ones in future and only edit myself in ""serious"" edits.",1171,9499,0.85

The morning, we wake up, a nice Sunday, I eat, do a little bit of homework and boot up my PC.

I was playing Darwin Project for about 30 mins when my dad walked into the room, stared at me for about 5 seconds and walked out.
Then 2 mins later, he did it again, and that happened about 5 more times.

I asked him what he needed but he just left the room again. Then later I heard the sound of a wheelbarrow and wood going in it, but thought nothing of it since our neighbors also got firewood recently.

Hour later, I was browsing Reddit, and my dad comes in my room sweaty, and glares at me, then scolds me for not offering to help him.
I didn't even know he was stacking the firewood, and I think if he wanted me to help, he should've asked instead of staring at me and expecting me to read his mind.

1451,Not the A-hole,"Hello!

From birth to 14 years old, I attended a church of Pentecostal denomination per my father‚Äôs rules until my parents divorced (my mom did not make me continue to go).When I was ~12/13 I met my best friend in middle school, who is Jewish (reform). I went to temple with my friend almost every week from ~12/13 until I was 18 and she went away to college and beyond, listened to the sermons, participated in various holidays and traditions, and spent a few summers volunteering with their kids camp for community service hours. I always felt very welcome in the community and identified with many of their liberal values.

I am currently a University student. One of my best friends I met here at University two years ago and I connected instantly when we discovered that we both grew up in the Christian church, have since shed those beliefs, and both experienced a great deal of trauma related to our Christian upbringings. 

After shedding my Christian beliefs, I went through a period where I identified as a staunch atheist. In the past few months, I have decided that I cannot, with absolutely certainty, say that there is 100% no god (or whatever you want to call it, divine intervention, creator, I don‚Äôt know), simply because I am human and do not possess all the knowledge in the universe. So maybe I‚Äôm agnostic, I suppose.

This past week, I was talking with my University buddy and expressed to her how I no longer identify as an atheist per se, and that it has also been on my mind the idea of looking into finding a local Jewish temple to attend and get involved in. I told her how I felt such a great sense of community when I used to attend and was drawn to the fact that the particular temple I attended had great humanitarian values; the Rabbi often encouraged us to simply be good people to ourselves and others.

My University friend told me that she cannot support me doing that and that I am an asshole because it would be cultural appropriation. She said that people who attend temple are either ethnically Jewish or are religiously Jewish, and since I am not ethnically Jewish (which I agree ‚Äî 3% is quite marginal), nor am I a spiritual or religious person, that I should find a different community to connect with/find others with similar values if that is my goal. This response really surprised me and I have been trying to process it since. I am hoping to get some responses from some Jewish folk who can shed some light on this, as I have never heard of cultural appropriation being applied in a manner such as this and do not want to do something that could be offensive or intruding to others. 


TL;DR: went to temple growing up, am considering finding a local temple to get involved in again, friend says I am an asshole and would be culturally appropriating if I did so.",38,33,0.85

1454,No A-holes here,"Just for a quick preface, our sex life has had it's near constant ups and downs, mostly due to the fact that we have different needs/wants, and also her hormonal birth control giving her next to no sex drive (her words in the past). I initiate 99.9% of the time, which leaves me with the brunt of the rejections (which happens a lot). When it does line up, it's great, but that very rarely happens. 

The other day, due to a shortage, my wife's doctor gave her a similar, but different, birth control. She seemed surprised by this in the car, and I assumed maybe it was a mistake, so I asked ""should we turn around and go check?"", to which she said ""No"". I suggested she call the pharmacy and/or the doctor, but she said ""No, it's fine."" I then added ""Hey, maybe your libido will increase a bit,"" to which she said ""Yeah maybe"".

Last night, sex failed again. We gave each other space, and while I was on my own, I began to realize that the lack of sex and intimacy was becoming too much for me. I told her we needed to talk it through, and she decided to just go to bed. I got upset, and told her she can't just keep going to bed every time we have an argument about this, but she said ""the only way to reconcile this is to have sex, and I don't want to have sex with you right now, so there's no point."" 

I told her that it was selfish and unfair of her to just walk away from this every time, to which she shot up and snapped ""well it was selfish of you to suggest my libido might come back like I even take my birth control for you in the first place"" (side note: she takes it to stop her periods). She went on to say ""it was the first thing out of your mouth, like it usually is."" I reminded her of how I stopped the car and pulled over and suggested we go back to the doctor, as well as the fact that the libido was a concern of hers as well (which she said ""it hasn't been for some time, so I don't know why you'd assume that""). 

We're seeking couples counselling, but am I really the asshole here? I only brought it up because it was a shared concern of ours.

EDIT: I don't know if this helps but the context of the argument was the lack of intimacy made me feel unwanted, undesired, and that her accusations that all my concerns about her were solely for ""getting off"" (her words) made me feel gross and invalid, and that those things didn't seem to matter to her. The initial question about her libido felt fair because we had been actively trying to improve things the month prior.",144,123,0.91
1455,Not the A-hole,So my sister bought my then 10 yo  daughter a rabbit for ester with out asking me first.

I told my daughter that it is solely her responsibility to look after the rabbit and its cage but she would only do it ever once In  a while so it feel onto me to look after it most of the time. So one day I decided I have had enough of it and told my daughter that if she still dosnt care for it that I would give it away but she never listend so one day while she was at school i ended up giving the rabbit away to a lady who had a few rabbits at her home and told me it would be in good care and that she would try to tame it. So that day my daughter comes back from school she sees that the rabbit cage and the rabbit is gone and realises that I gave her rabbit away so she gets extremely upset and sad.

1461,Not the A-hole,"Note: We live north-west of Tuggerah Lake on the Central Coast (New South Wales, Australia), close to one of the most dangerous places to live in Australia

Long story short, I have lived in my house for 11 years (we bought the house in February 2008 and moved in November) and a new family just moved into the house down the street about 4 months ago. They have a 13 year old kid with (possibly severe?) Autism. Ever since they moved in, he has been out the front pretty much blowing his whistle all day, every day.

Some neighbours have already confronted the family asking them to shut up. The dad of the kid is well over 6ft tall and is very intimidating and the mother is pretty much a Karen. They won't stop and they won't back down.

So basically, they say ""No, because he has massive breakdowns, and I'm sure you would rather a whistle than a wailing kid"". But honestly, the older owners behind our house communicated by screaming before being evicted after 3 years, so I think we know which we would rather. 

We play music top volume to cover the sound (with permission from everyone else on and around the street) before the police are called by, yes that's right, the new family. We have told the police time and time again but apparently ""A whistle is a whistle, music can cause people to have heart attacks and stuff"", so the Police are very little help

So I was wondering, Would I be the Asshole if I told the family to shut it, got the neighbourhood together and file multiple noise complaints or to take the kids whistle altogether. This is driving me and everyone else nuts and we need help asap.

1466,Not the A-hole,"I've lived with my family for my entire life but around the time I hit high school I started realizing all my chores were bullshit. The bullshit part about my chores were how much of the mess around the house wasn't mine. Most of my time was spent in my room or at my computer because my family was highly judgmental. I basically got depression and anxieties by living with them. I avoided interacting with them as much as possible. I still do but I consider our relationship way more healthier given my mom, the main source of my stress, passed away. Different story.

&#x200B;

Because of my isolation, I basically never enter most rooms in the house. I also learned to clean after myself because that's what normal people do apparently? So everywhere I went in the house, my typical spots were cleaner. The living room, kitchen, hallways, and laundry room were always a disaster. My mom and my sister left all their belongings around the house despite having rooms. My brother is ironically a clean freak but he and my sister have a tendency to miss the trashcan despite it being right next to all the trash. My brother and sister's rooms are major disasters. Like, they have clothes, trash, and old food everywhere. In terms of cleaning up, they refuse to keep up with cleaning. They don't clean up after themselves or clean a little over a week. They instead wait until I do it or until they need to have someone over so it's gotta be done right fucking now. (I stopped doing dishes and it took them three weeks to do any.)

&#x200B;

Another point is that they kept buying pets. I love all my pets with all my heart but we have never had a normal amount of animals. We currently live in a single-wide manufactured house with 5 animals (7 before we released our turtles). I have agreed to zero of these. They do walk the dogs and take care of their food and boxes better than I do these days but I have let them do most of the work since they like having a permanent zoo. They like to leave all their clean laundry in baskets in the wrong rooms and with improperly trained pets they don't stay clean (read: piss).

&#x200B;

All of this was the main reason for me deciding to move out. I have enough to worry about with a full-time job, depression to stay on top, etc. It's also a burden on my mental health to constantly be living around someone else's mess and five animals. For the past month, I've basically been doing the bare minimum like they do. Have I been an asshole for all this time?",13,61,0.86

When Tony married his wife, before my now husband and I met, my husband (Larry) did a little ‚Äúprank‚Äù on Tony‚Äôs wedding night. Larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote ‚Äújust married‚Äù on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. Larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. I‚Äôve seen pictures of this myself, if I can find them, I will attach them in an edit. 

Flash forward to my husband and I‚Äôs wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed Tony did a ‚Äúprank‚Äù of his own. He covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. He also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. 

My husband and I were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. Tony didn‚Äôt see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. We drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. 

While we were cleaning, I called Tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset Larry and I and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. I also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn‚Äôt going to be cheap, to which Tony said, ‚Äúuse the money I gave you guys for your wedding present for that then.‚Äù Which angered me more and I hung up on him. I did not cuss at him nor did I yell. 

After we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, I got a very nasty call from Tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn‚Äôt take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. I didn‚Äôt say anything back, I just hung up. 

The next day, I wake up to texts from his family saying that I was too harsh on Tony, that Tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just ‚Äúgetting Larry back‚Äù for what happened at his wedding. Larry told me that he actually deleted texts that Tony sent me over night because he was ‚Äúembarrassed by what his brother said.‚Äù 

I refuse to talk to Tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. I apologized to Tony for perhaps being too harsh, which I admit, wasn‚Äôt a genuine apology.

[and here‚Äôs what he posted](https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qGLj8) 

So, I thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on Facebook but it‚Äôs just this one. That only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. Brother-in-law posted that ‚ÄúI [Tony] welcomed OP to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!‚Äù

Yeah, *I‚Äôm sorry, what?* I did **not** cuss him out nor did I insult him as my young daughter was around. He also added, ‚ÄúOP should get over herself as it wasn‚Äôt even that bad.‚Äù Yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. Only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. Everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that I cussed out *poor Tony*. 

I asked Larry what the deleted messages said and Larry told me the gist of it was, ‚ÄúOP and her daughter will never really be apart of this family.‚Äù And Larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this seems rude but I am very upset as Tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. Larry said that he‚Äôs going to take care of it from here and that if I get involved more, Tony is just going to make more lies up. 

Anyway, I appreciate everyone‚Äôs replies! A lot were very helpful, Larry and I are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. I‚Äôm still refusing to speak to Tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. Hopefully things work out soon! I don‚Äôt want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. Thanks again!

Edit: You can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. It might not be high-res, sorry. There is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm sorry, I did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, I should‚Äôve. I was still pretty fuming from everything else though, I didnt really think of it. I‚Äôm going to ask Larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",1720,13506,0.91
1480,Asshole,"Fianc√©e and I have been together for 4 years and we are madly in love. She‚Äôs wonderful, smart, funny, and honestly I think she‚Äôs my soulmate.

When we met fianc√©e had a puppy that she had rescued from a shelter. She was (and still is) very attached to this dog. We now live together and I share a home with the dog.

I‚Äôve never understood why people idolize dogs so much, and I personally really don‚Äôt like them. They‚Äôre dirty, needy, and all up in your face. It makes me cringe when she lets her dog ‚Äúgive kisses‚Äù or sleep in our bed. She takes this dog on hour long walks every single day, talks to it like it‚Äôs a human being, feeds it table scraps... 

I have tolerated the dog because I love my fianc√©e more than anything, but sometimes it drives me nuts. It loves to bark incessantly at every tiny thing, it requires attention 24/7 (literally HAS to be near my fianc√©e at all times), and it‚Äôs a pretty big dog (over 70 lbs). I am so tired of having dog hair on all of my clothes and having to lint roll myself before work everyday. I‚Äôm tired of coming home and having the dog run at me demanding my attention. I‚Äôm tired of having a dog right at my feet when I‚Äôm trying to cuddle my fianc√©e.

It all came to a head when my fianc√©e caught me on an anti-dog subreddit and questioned me about it. I told her I honestly loathe her dog and don‚Äôt like being around it, but tolerate it for her.

She is extremely upset. She said she doesn‚Äôt know how to feel about this and needs space to think about everything. She feels I‚Äôve deceived her (???) and is heartbroken that I‚Äôm not smitten with her dog.

To clarify I am not abusive or mean to the dog, I mostly just ignore it.

AITA in this situation? I feel like it‚Äôs totally fair for me to not like her dog, however she seems devastated and when I told some of my friends about the situation they agreed it was shitty of me. Imo a lot of people are biased because they DO like dogs so I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to get a different opinion.",721,749,0.85
1481,Not the A-hole,"I know title sounds bad but hear me out.

My Dad and I have never had the best relationship. He's never really been around, he has a job high up at some bank so he works super long hours and goes on lots of business trips. Siblings and I were basically raised only by my Mom, and I'm really close with her. We barely talk and when we do it's about how shit my grades are in school that I'll never amount to anything if I keep it up, I try to avoid being around him. 

As I got older (I'm 16 now), I started noticing my Dad's weird behaviour. I remember a few months ago he came home super late and I could smell a little perfume on him. I didn't really think much of it until he left his phone on the table one day and a text notification popped up saying ""last night was amazing, can't wait to see you again"" and a bunch of cringey ass emojis. I was pretty shook when I saw that message ngl. I told my Mom about what I saw and she didn't look surprised at all. She got pretty emotional which I felt bad about, and told me not to worry and that i should just worry about being a kid and let her take care of the rest, so I just let it go cause I didnt want to hurt her more.

So on to what happened. Last night we all went to a big dinner at my grandparents house. During dinner, my cousin was telling everyone that he had gotten a new job at some software company. My Dad took the opportunity to call me out and say I should follow after my cousin, and focus more in school. I just ignored him and kept eating. My Uncle agreed saying how hard it was to get through to young people nowawadays, and my Dad said it's because there was no respect and I never respected him. I was so tired of his shit and without thinking I said back, ""hard to respect you when you openly cheat on Mom and don't even try to hide it"".

Everyone went silent, and my Dad looked beyond pissed. He asked my Mom wtf I was talking about and told her that she had spoiled and ruined me. They started arguing and then after a couple minutes of everyone else trying to calm them down, my Mom told me and my siblings that we were leaving and told my Dad not to come home. When we got home my phone started blowing up. On the group chat I have with my cousins they said I was a massive dick for publicly airing private stuff. I also got a few texts/voicemails from my Uncles telling me I ruined my parents marriage and that I should stick my nose out of adult shit. I felt pretty guilty about what happened and apologized to my Mom. She said that she understood my frustration and I probably should have expressed it better privately but what's done is done. I've also gotten a few calls from my Dad but I've ignored all of them. He hasn't come home yet, probably staying at one of his mistresses houses. Fucker.

I still feel pretty bad about what I did, just wanted to get him off my back and was so frustrated with his hypocrisy. AITA?",509,3193,0.97
1482,No A-holes here,"I (M 14) have a thing with my ribs where the bottom part of my right rib cage sticks out from my chest. It doesn't really affect my health, but the doctor said the my bones were hardening because of puberty or something and it would be best to fix it now. After about a year and a half of waiting on the insurance company to help, my mom got the rib brace. I normally wear it when I'm at home because it's this big ring that goes around my torso and it'd be weird to have that on at school. Anyway, my mom got angry at me this afternoon for not wearing it when I go to sleep. I told her that I didn't wear it to bed because it becomes really uncomfortable and sometimes painful after wearing it for a while, and I was constantly losing sleep when I was wearing it. She said something like ""I'm so glad that I wasted $2000 on a rib brace so that you wouldn't use it"", and I got really mad, because I *was* using it and she was trying to force me to wear it to bed knowing that it would hurt and that I would lose sleep. After that, she locked my phone using a parental control app (makes it only able to send messages and call). This is a text conversation we had right after she locked my phone (typed because I cant get on reddit on my phone right now):    
    
Mom: So sad for you    
Me: ok    
Mom: Hope you have some good books to read    
Me: i do :)    
Mom: Lots and lots of books    
Me: i do :)
Mom: Good. You can plan to read them for the next week while your phone and laptop are locked up    
Me: ok

1483,Not the A-hole,"I just went to the cinema and ended up sitting next to a woman who I found very distracting and annoying throughout the film.

There were several things that she did that I find infuriating but am aware are to be expected if you go to the cinema or anywhere else you're watching the film with other people. She was crunching her popcorn loudly, and rustling it around in the box as she tried to pick up the last pieces. She'd taken her shoes off and was wearing pale socks and kicked her feet around whenever there was jaunty music in the film. (The cinema had foot rests, so this was very much in the line of vision.) 

She also giggled at every even vaguely amusing line in the film, and had a very loud, very high-pitched giggle. I feel bad for finding this annoying - I'm obviously glad she was enjoying the film, and laughing along is all part of the cinema experience - but this was at the tiniest little jokes ever, and I found it very distracting.

But as I say, I recognise that all those things are to be expected if you go to the cinema, and so I have to accept them if I choose to go to the cinema. I mention them because they meant that I was already quietly annoyed.

But in addition to those things, she also kept talking to the person she was with throughout the film. I would say she was talking in a quiet voice, but not a whisper. Some of the time I couldn't hear what she was saying, other times it was stuff like, ""Aww, I'm so glad X character got to do such-and-such!"" (One time was also, ""Fuck off!"" pretty loudly, but that was at the idea of a 39-year-old woman thinking she was ""barren"" so that one seems fair enough!) 

These frequent comments pulled my attention away from the film every time. I did my best to ignore this for most of the film, but near the end, during a particularly long bout of talking, I ended up turning to her and saying, ""Shhhhhhhh!"" Not the best way of communicating in hindsight, but at the time I was very annoyed, and was also trying not to disturb anyone else in the cinema. I wasn't even sure if she'd heard until the end, when she turned to me as she was leaving and said, ""It's not very nice to shush people."" I replied that it wasn't very nice to talk when other people were also trying to watch the film, and she said that she wasn't talking, she was having a conversation(?!) and was enjoying the film, and something along the lines that if I didn't want to sit with other people, I should sit somewhere else (?)

Now clearly shushing her was not the best approach to take, but I personally think that expecting other people to be quiet when watching a film in the cinema is entirely reasonable. However, she clearly disagrees. So Reddit, please can you tell me - AITA?

Tldr: The woman next to me in the cinema kept talking, and I shushed her.",41,37,0.91
1484,No A-holes here,"So my sister has a baby who is almost 2 years old. She relies on our mother to watch the baby a lot if she has an appointment or wants to go out with her husband.


I would understand having a date night every once in a while or asking our mom to watch the baby ahead of time, but instead she'll just come over and say ""Hey can you watch the baby while we go eat and see a movie."" 


She did this today and our mom was obviously very tired after getting off of work and kind of halfheartedly agreed while my sister said ""okay well if you're sure..."" while walking out the door.


I even chimed in saying that my mom seemed really tired and maybe they should just do it another night, but I was pretty much ignored. After they left my mom said she wished they would have given her some sort of warning.


This happens all the time. I'm going to say 2-3 days a week my mom is  stuck babysitting. My mom has told me to not bring it up with my sister, even though she wishes that they would give her a break.


Now I'm wondering, would I be TA if I told my sister she really needs to give my mom a break? I understand everyone needs help sometimes and my mom loves her grandchild, but my sister seems to be blind to how hard this is for our mom.

1485,Asshole,"A few months ago my sister in law Becca was looking for a place to live so she could move out of her parents house.  She's 23 and just started working a better paying job so she could afford to live with her boyfriend in an apartment.  Where we live a decent 1 bedroom apartment for them would cost between $800-1000 a month in rent.  My wife and I helped them budget and figured they could afford that but not much else.  Not because they don't make enough money, but that she and her boyfriend refuse to stop eating fast food at least once a day and go out drinking spending hundreds each weekend at bars.  Their choice to do this of course, but even with these problems they could afford a nice 1 bedroom.

Well after we find a couple of places for them to look my wife and I go on our merry way thinking we'd helped only to find out a few weeks later that Becca and bf got themselves an apartment on the other much nicer side of town that was going to cost $1400 a month.  Her parents, my wife, and I were all completely blindsided as they wanted to keep it a surprise.   They still had a chance to back out and I told them they should really consider doing so as they could not afford the extra several hundred a month it would cost them.  They told me they'd be fine because bf was a shoe in for a promotion at work in a few months.

Well today her family got together for dinner and Becca was complaining that bf didn't get the promotion because he'd missed too much work lately (he took points so he could stay home and play World of Warcraft for 12 hours a day) so they weren't getting that boost to monthly income they'd expected and were close to wiping out her savings because they were operating each month at a deficit.  At this point her father and my wife started asking her if she'd made lifestyle changes like less bar hopping and fast food in order to help and she started to lie and say yes but then broke down in tears and admitted she'd gone out for food twice that day already.

At this point, purely out of reflex, I blurted out an ""I fucking told you so goddamn"" before I could even stop myself.  My wife instantly kicked me under the table and apologized before excusing myself.  From what I can tell her father and brother agree with me and think what I said was appropriate, but her mother, Becca, my wife, and Becca's bf are all furious with me for kicking her while she's down.  I tried explaining it was a reflex and pointed out I instantly apologized but I'm the town asshole at the moment and wanted to see if you guys agreed or not with them.",528,3000,0.95

1488,Not enough info,"I know this is going to sound supper entitled but please read to the end before you make your decision. 

So I recently graduated college and I just started my first real job a few days ago. I live in an apartment that my parents are paying for (and I assumed would continue to) since I can‚Äôt actually afford it but they wanted me to have a bigger apartment for them to be able to visit me. I didn‚Äôt get much of a say in renting this apartment, just sorta went with what they picked because I thought they were going to help pay for it. 

I just had a phone call with my mother about my new job and she casually says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of you! It‚Äôs nice that you got such a nice job, now we won‚Äôt have to pay for the apartment anymore!‚Äù I thought she was joking but as the conversation went on it became very apparent that she wasn‚Äôt. Not only that, but she wasn‚Äôt going to pay for ANYTHING anymore, phone, insurance, nothing. I haven‚Äôt even gotten my first paycheck yet and she‚Äôs telling me she‚Äôs planning on canceling my car insurance this month! I always knew that I would have to be financially independent of my parents eventually but I had no idea they expected me to do it this quickly! 

Now I know I would be the asshole just for this alone, however the kicker is my parents continue to pay for all of my sisters bills and loans and she‚Äôs been out of college for 6 years. They let her live at home rent free for three years, have paid her student loan payments this whole time, give her a grocery allowance, and have her on all of their insurance except health which she gets through her job. 

When I asked why they‚Äôre paying for her and not me, my mother got extremely agitated and said that my sister isn‚Äôt making as much as I am and she needs the help (and I guess I don‚Äôt). However, I don‚Äôt actually make that much more than her and with all of the payments I‚Äôm about to have I‚Äôm actually going to end up with less money per month than she does. And they still expect me to pay for this giant apartment that I don‚Äôt want! My mom hasn‚Äôt answered my calls since and my dad says she‚Äôs upset with me and my ‚Äúgreedy attitude‚Äù.

1489,Asshole,"Throwaway because of reasons.

I have this cousin who was adopted by my uncle and his wife 15 years ago. She looks a lot like him, and she's the apple of his eye (she doesn't has the same relationship with her mom), but they haven't told her she's adopted.

I think is really unrealistic to assume that nobody will ever tell her she's adopted, and to let her do homework in which is necessary to draw a genealogy tree without explaining her first that she isn't related to any of us. 

She desperately tries to look for any kind of semblance between her and the rest of the family (almost all of us are dark haired, dark skinned, and dark eyed, while she's blonde, pale and with blue eyes), and it's... Sad. 

I'm tempted, since her parents have refused to ever tell her, and since she's on her last year of high school, to talk to her about universities and make her apply to the ones that I know ask for documents that would reveal that she's adopted.

WIBTA if I do this?

EDIT: I know I'm the asshole for wanting to circumvent my uncle and his wife... It's just that she has started to notice that there must be something (our family has a particular hereditary disease that concerns the joints, and she tries to overexert herself when doing sports because, and in her own words: ""we all have [that syndrome], that pain is normal"", and frankly, I don't believe that's healthy, she's gonna fuck up her knees)

Regarding the university, she wants to leave the country, and study overseas. Thing is: she's a minor, and there are a few visas (for our country, I don't know if this is a normal procedure) that require that minors have parent's permission and some ask for adoption certificate if there's one. I was worried for that. I wanted to push it with this hypothetical situation, but I now see that I was going through it the wrong way.

I will try to explain my uncle (again) that if she continues to wish to study abroad, it will be better that they try to explain things to her, or at least, that they convince her that the better course of action is that she stays in our country.

EDIT 2: I talked with my uncle's wife, and she says that she will never tell her. I told her that it was unfair with my cousin, but she (the mom) thinks that is not necessary to tell her, and that ""it's too late to tell her anyway"". After that she didn't want to keep talking about it. And I will do the same. She's my baby cousin, I love her, and that's all that matters. I just hope she never discovers the truth.",90,103,0.83
1490,Asshole,"I was at school and in the middle of class, when suddenly, I remembered that there was homework due today. I got up to show my teacher the work I had done and asked if I had done enough annotating in the book to get full credit.

The two people sitting next to me were super pissed off at me. All I had done was ask the teacher, and I think it was their fault for not actually doing the homework.

AITA? I don't think I did anything wrong and them not doing their homework was on them.

1491,Not the A-hole,"My friend (whom I‚Äôve known for a year) has a borderline abusive husband. He is not physically abusive, but does things like

* Telling her ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it, the door is right there (and points to the door)‚Äù when she voices a complaint. She works full time but doesn‚Äôt make enough money to support two children and her family lives in another country, so he knows she can‚Äôt go anywhere.
* She hasn‚Äôt had an orgasm from him in over 7 years. Their sex (which basically lasts 3min max) involves him getting what he wants and not caring about her needs.
* He spends too much time working and neglects their two children in the process. Dad never takes his daughters to the movies, to the park, or anything fun.
* Tells her she is a bad mom because their youngest daughter is whiney and makes too much noise. The child is 2.5yr old!

She has always justified this behavior by saying things like: 

* at least he provides for his wife and children financially
* it could be worse because he could be physically abusive
* he works long hours so fortunately I don‚Äôt have to see him a lot
* all relationships have problems and none are perfect

She started seeing a therapist two months ago but stopped going rather abruptly. She told me that the therapist told her ‚ÄúYou really need to leave your husband for the sake of your own sanity and your children. This behavior will not get better, it will get worse.‚Äù She told me that the therapist isn‚Äôt married and shouldn‚Äôt comment on whether a marriage is a good one or not. 

I‚Äôve always been rather diplomatic about her husband. She would complain to me about things he did or said and I would just say something like ‚Äúoh wow! I can‚Äôt believe he would say that to you.‚Äù But I would never tell her that she needed to leave him even though I thought it.

When I heard that she was stopping therapy because of the therapist's comment, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I immediately said ‚ÄúHonestly, your therapist was right. And anyone who heard the things you‚Äôve told me would give you the same advice as your therapist. They would tell you to run far far away. Your husband is emotionally abusive and doesn‚Äôt care about you or your children. Fortunately your children are young but when they get older I seriously fear for them. I also fear for your own mental health. You really need to take a step back and try to look at things subjectively and you‚Äôll realize that what your therapist and I am telling you are true.‚Äù

1492,Not the A-hole,"I'm a primary school teacher. When the kids are being loud and I can't be heard I say ""fingers on lips"" and put my index finger over my closed mouth until all the kids copy me, which every time results in total silence as everyone puts their fingers on their lips.

I'm also bi, and I haven't told my family before now, and tonight I introduced my girlfriend to my father, stepmum, and my younger brother. The dinner was at my place. My girlfriend was late so I said there was someone I wanted them to meet and they responded by asking me about this ""mystery man"". My girlfriend arrived shortly after, and there was immediate yelling at me, asking me when I was planning on telling them this and how could I do such a thing (they're very conservative and religious).

In my panicked state all I could come up with was ""fingers on lips!"" and put my fingers on my lips. My girlfriend copied. My brother, who is used to me doing this when we were little, also did it, but this was probably more of a reflex than anything. My stepmum didn't actually put her finger on her lips but she did trail off into a sort of confused silence, and when my dad realised he was the only voice in the room he stopped talking too.

After a couple seconds my brother realised what had happened and said ""fuck you for treating us like children"".

I replied ""it worked, didn't it?""

He told dad and stepmum that he wanted to leave, and they all filed out pretty quickly.

My brother then messaged me saying that I couldn't expect to say something like that and then not expect questions, and I shouldn't have used a trick I use on kids under 11 on a 17, 30 and 47 year old.

AITA?

Info: I sort of landed my girlfriend in it but it was accidental. The plan was to have the coming out conversation before she got home, but when she was late she said she'd be an hour late so I thought I had more time than I did, but then she got there and was only half an hour late. My girlfriend knew I was planning on coming out tonight, and she was the one who suggested that meeting her might help them come around. She said to text her if there was a problem, and if she didn't hear from me then she'd assume it went alright, show up and introduce herself. In hindsight we should have said that I'd text either way.

My girlfriend was the one who said that I should come out to them, and then have her meet them. I have a history of dating people who are bad for me or I should not be dating, to the extent that they regularly joke about me dating bad people, and actually made a joke before she arrived about ""what's wrong with this one"". She felt she could ""win them over"" in case they were worried I was dating someone who was bad for me, and thought if she could show them that she's a good person who loves me they'd take it better.

I didn't think it would go very well, and was pretty sure coming out to my conservative family would end badly, but as a friend of mine recently came out as trans to his family, who is even more conservative than mine, I had hope that they would be able to move past it.

EDIT: Can people please stop treating my girlfriend like she has no agency? She suggested she come, she thought she could help me with them  and wanted to be there for me, for emotional support if nothing else. At no point did I make any demands or otherwise force her to be there, she just wanted to be there for me. I warned her ahead of time how bad it could potentially get and she said that was all the more reason for her to be there so they didn't try anything.",421,2523,0.92

1494,Asshole,"My husband and I frequent this fast food sandwich restaurant. Let's call it New York Jeff's. I actually used to be an employee, so I knew the ins and outs. When they are busy, I take the ticket and write out the order for them. I've done this at least 30 times and have never had an issue, in fact, most of staff thank me for making it easier. 

Cut to today - my husband and I go and they are swamped. I grab the ticket as normal and write down my order. Then comes Condescending Lady (CL). She sees what I've done and says with the most condescending voice ""umm actually, we write out the tickets because we have a specific way that we do things. Alright? Thanks."" I was already off put by that, but then she proceeds to rewrite the ticket and [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/5EUrKmb) is the difference. Basically nothing. 

It put a sour taste in my mouth, but I let it go. I tell the cashier to charge me for the extra bacon I added, but not for the extra cheese since I took the cheese off the other sandwich. Once again, this is 100% above board and I know this. He said sure and cashed me out.

CL comes back over and asked if he charged me for the cheese. He says no, I step in to say how I basically swapped the cheese to the other sandwich, and she replies ""well you have to let me know so I can communicate that to the grill."" Now, that's BS. The grill already has the order marked for extra cheese, why does he care that I'm not getting charged for it? I tell CL that next time I'll tell the manager that, and she says ""I am the manager"" 

Now here's where I did get a bit sassy. I replied ""manager? WOW."" And then asked ""are you like the real manager, or the shift manager?"" 

With her scrunched up face, she says ""the real manager."" I say okay and let it be. I stood and watched as the hot sub was being made, and noticed they didn't put the extra meat party. When onions and peppers are removed, extra meat is added. I point it out to her asap so they can fix it before finishing the sub, and she says ""we don't add the meat if you add extras, and you added bacon."" 

I say ""so what you're saying is, I paid $1.75 to add bacon so I don't get the meat, but had I not paid anything, I would have gotten the meat for free?"" 

She then asks me in such a condescending manner ""umm, did you used to work here?"" And I inform her that yes, I did. She asks what I do now. I ALMOST say ""I have a real job,"" but I really didn't want to be rude, so I said ""I have a new job as a teacher."" She just said ""oh.""

By this point, the sub was finished so she had to remake it. She said how the grill chef was new and he didn't know. I used her old words against her and said ""well, as the manager, I thought you would have communicated that to him."" 

I asked the cashier quietly for her name, and he writes it on the back of my receipt.

She kept getting her family members to contact me/mutual friends to try and work things out. I couldn‚Äôt though... that was the one thing I said I would never take a partner back for. 

A month ago I was involved in a car accident (I‚Äôm fine, everyone‚Äôs fine and nobody suffered anything fatal fortunately. I had cuts and bruises along with broken ribs being the most severe. well... she had gotten wind of this because of a post on Facebook and came to visit me at the hospital (my mom said yeah without asking me). 

So... she came when a few of my family members were there. She was the last person I wanted to see (1 year since divorce). 

I became angry, telling her I thought I told her I never wanted to see her again and leave, because if this had happened to her I told her I would be nowhere to be found.  She was visibly distraught, leaving me a gift, a letter, and flowers as a result and just walking out after only being in there for a few minutes. Everyone knew she was coming except me I guess. 

My mom told me that wasn‚Äôt nice at all, and I should reconsider how I treat her even though we‚Äôre not together anymore. I said I didn‚Äôt care, and that I hated her. 

To this day I haven‚Äôt read her letter, and part of me wants to throw it out without reading it. But I did tell her I never wanted to see her again prior to this. I think she was selfish to not listen and to come and see me. My mom wants me to apologize to her and says I was rude and nasty.",434,2434,0.96
1497,Not the A-hole,"We created this account just to ask this question, both sides will be told-ish

Wife and I have been married for 15 years, we have been gifted with one daughter and two sons during this time, daughter who we‚Äôll call Kayla which is a fake name is 12, wife‚Äôs name is Kathrine (fake name) and I am called Tony (fake name) 

We recently got a phone call from Kaylas school to tell us she‚Äôs been picking on one of the ‚Äòless fortunate‚Äô children over the clothes they were wearing. Kayla herself is always wearing the best brands something I saw no issue in as her mother enjoyed buying them for her and our sons, when she got home she seemed smug which genuinely baffled me as we didn‚Äôt raise her like this? I‚Äôve told her that I‚Äôm not amused and if she‚Äôs going to use clothes and our money as a way to feel superior she won‚Äôt have it.

I‚Äôve told her she can go to the charity shop and pick up what she can to make do and then she can donate her clothes to the less fortunate as she likes to mock them, wife agreed in front of the daughter but as soon as our daughter was out of site she told me she thought it was a ‚Äúd-ck move‚Äù as she‚Äôs only a child. 

My side of things is that maybe we‚Äôve gone too lenient on her and we genuinely need to be concerned about this behaviour- aside from the punishment I want to get her therapy due to this as she clearly has emotional issues (from where? Idk but at least we‚Äôll be able to find out and help her)

Wife‚Äôs side is that all children lash out one way or another, grounding her is one thing but this‚Äôll completely ruin her self esteem and her social life at school, maybe we should find another suitable punishment but this isn‚Äôt suitable for a child discovering themselves

1498,Not the A-hole,"Update: thanks for the advice guys. I said fuck it and never went back. I'm not normally the type to do this but you guys helped give me the confidence to. I haven't felt this relieved since I started working there, it definitelyade me miserable. I got an interview on Tuesday for a new job. Wish me luck!!!


I work as a server at Cracker Barrel, and it is by far, the worst job I have ever had.

I transferred from a cracker barrel, which had nice managers that treated us well, to a new cracker barrel with really awful penny pinching ones about a month ago

For example, they yell at us for giving people jelly and butter and even biscuits unless they ask. These are things that are supposed to come complementary with the meal. They tell us to secretly not give them any bread because they probably won't notice. They tell us if we bring the bread to not give the customers butter or jelly. The customers always notice, and they in effect, get angry at us servers and tip us worse. 

This is just one example of the many unethical cheap practices they make us do. They also make us reuse biscuits sometimes which is just gross

On top of this, most of my managers have yet to even learn my name. They constantly refer to me as ""sweetie"" or ""kiddo"" (even though I am an adult) and write my name up as ""Rachel"" on the board (my name is not even close to Rachel).

Today was the final straw for me

A customer got angry with me because they said their eggs weren't done correctly and because the check was more expensive than they anticipated (they ordered an extra apple pie) They called the manager over to comp the check. The manager in turn came back to the kitchen and berated me telling me it is my fault the customers were angry and that I must not be ready to have a bigger section. He told me that I would only have two tables for the rest of the shift. 

I told him that it wasn't fair to restrict my section to be so small, and that it wasn't my fault the customers thought our prices were too expensive. He promptly sent me to the office and told the General manager lies about how customers have been complaining all morning about me (not true at all) and how I was making the store lose money and that I needed to be taken off of the floor.
I explained to the GM how that wasn't true, that the customers were angry about the prices and eggs not being cooked and I did everything I could have done to fix it.
She said that since I'm the server, I need to accept responsibility for everything, and that essentially, when a customer is angry no matter what it is my fault. She told me I would have to stay on only two tables and needed to work on being better before I could ""advance to more."" Being in the office so long caused my customers I already had to be angry about how I hadn't checked on them in a while. When I came back in I started to tear up from my anxiety and stress (I have pretty bad anxiety). My co-workers tried to comfort me and that in turn made my manager so angry he went back into the office and told the GM I was a distraction and needed to be sent home immediately.
I gave her my two weeks on the way out, but I am wondering, WIBTA if I just dont go back again?",35,34,0.93
1499,Asshole,"Throwaway, TLDR below

So I (28M) went to a coffee shop. One of the cute baristas there prepped the drink and handed it off to me. There weren't any customers on-line, while there were 2 or 3 other baristas further in the room doing prep work. I wanted to ask her out, so after she handed me the drink I led with something like ""Hey, can I ask you a question?"" She replies yes, and I continue, ""Do you have any plans tonight? There's a really great band playing tonight and I have an extra ticket"" and yadayada about the show, ending with ""so would you like to go?"" She has a nervous smile starting now.  She says no, that she's busy with an early work shift tomorrow. I pivot to ""oh okay, how about next week? There are some really good shows coming up as well?"" She continues with ""I dont know (or I can‚Äôt ‚Äì I don‚Äôt remember which), Im also really busy with classes.""

At this point, im getting the hint she's either deflecting because she really is busy or she actually isnt interested and doesnt want to say that flat out. I make it clear a third time, ""its cool of you're busy, then how about dinner at some point? If you want to think about it, maybe I can get your number and you can let me know if you are or aren‚Äôt interested? It's cool if you arent."" There's a silent pause (she kind of has an ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù open mouth, eyes to the side look on her face), and she looks over to her coworker a few feet away.

Female coworker probably wasn't listening and notices barista's gaze. Coworker asks what she needs. Barista replies ""he's asking for my #."" At this point, I know it's the clearest sign she isn't interested. Coworker looks at/through me and says, ""No. Have a nice day"" with a clearly pissed off face. Embarrassed at myself, I return with ""you too,"" and walk off.

I thought about asking her straight for her number instead of whether she'd like to see a show, but thought that'd be too weird and straightforward. Ofc rejection is always awkward for both parties, and I bet people probably try to ask her out all the time. Plus, it's her workplace so she can't just walk away and could be put in a spot where she'd likely have to interact with the same customers she rejects in the future. I'm not looking to make her uncomfortable, but I think that's what happened (perhaps pissing her coworker off more so). I think their perspective may be

""Learn to take a hint.""

To give some rationale on my part, the last girl I asked out/dated for a bit was a cashier and she wrote her number down for me on the spot while working with people on the line behind me.

TLDR - I ask barista out to a show, she says she's busy, I ask her what about a future show next week when she isn't, she says she also has classes, I ask for her number to buy her dinner and say she can let me know if she is or isnt interested, barista tells coworker what I asked, then female barista coworker tells me ""No. Have a nice day"" with a pissed off face.

1500,Asshole,"Title makes me sound like an asshole and I am pretty sure I am one. However, I still stand by my point which made me turn to Reddit.

Also, I guess it is more like would I be the asshole, since I don't need to pay til I am 18.

I have an older brother who is in his second year of uni. I am starting (hopefully!) next year. In these years he did not need to pay rent, groceries, anything. Mom even made homecooked meals for him, washed his clothes, loaned him money when necessary. Even though he made more money than her because he was very lucky with his job. We live in a country where if your parents aren't well of, you can get some money every month if you study. He gets around 300. The only thing he pays for is his phone bill, insurance, his motorcycle, gym membership, spotify and special foods (protein powder and such, things the rest in the house definitely would not eat.)

My mother however is not very happy with her current predicament. She does want him to pay some money every month. However, she never makes any steps to actually enforce it. They just have a conversation about it, he tells her he refuses to, she gets mad, everything is okay some hours later. She babies him.

The problem is, my mother just now confronted me with that I would need to pay rent when I start going to university. I retaliated with that my brother has not had to pay anything in these two years, why should I? She got really mad, told me she was disappointed in me, told me I knew how she hated that my brother did not pay anything and that she expected better from me. She told me that I was just like my brother, which hurt, because I have a really bad relationship with him. We haven't talked in months.

Honestly, I do feel for her. I know it is fair to pay rent and it is a dick move to refuse to. However, I really do not get why she is just enforcing it with me now and did not enforce it before? It just feels  like she is taking advantage of me not being an uncaring twat. 

So Reddit, AITA? Should I just pay rent and suck it up, or stay with my point of view?

Edit: I should just move out. My problem is not with paying rent but with how unfair the treatment is. It is not my responsibility to get my brother to pay rent by being used as leverage because I happen to be more helpful to my mother. Neither is it fair of me to live in a house for free while I am able to pay as an adult. Thank you reddit.",62,36,0.89
1501,Not the A-hole,"This happened a long time ago, but it recently came up in conversation which got me thinking about it again. 

I worked at a restaurant/coffee bar where I was a barista on weekdays and a server on weekends. On weekdays, I worked the bar and the floor by myself and made $12 an hour plus tips. At the end of the day I had to share a percentage of my tips (tip out) with the dishwasher. I didn‚Äôt mind, in fact sometimes I gave her a bit more because she was undocumented and the owners barely paid her. On weekends, I worked the floor with another server for $2.13 an hour plus tips while someone else handled the bar. The weekend barista worked for $9.25 an hour and got to keep any tips on to-go orders. At the end of the shift, we had to tip out both the dishwasher and the barista. I didn‚Äôt like that the barista made above minimum wage plus their own tips and we still had to tip them out, but I figured that‚Äôs just what you do. 

One day, boss decides he‚Äôs gonna give the weekend barista a section of tables that previously belonged to the servers. He justifies it by putting more tables out on the patio. Mind you, this is in the Southern summer heat, so no one is sitting on the patio. I was angry about it, to the point where I was being short with my coworkers. They confronted me about it, and I admitted I thought it was unfair that the weekend barista gets above minimum wage, to-go tips, and now parts of my section and I still have to share my tips with them. And it wasn‚Äôt a measly share, it was like 6%. I tried to convince the other server it was unfair as well‚Äîher input would carry weight because she was BFFs with the weekend barista and living with the boss. She didn‚Äôt agree. I finished my shift and went home with everyone looking at me funny. 

The next day, a Sunday brunch shift, the boss takes me outside and we talk about it. I tell him what I think. He responds with, ‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs making the drinks for your tables. You don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs worth money? Why are you talking about other peoples‚Äô money anyway?‚Äù I tell him, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not *my* tables, they‚Äôre your tables because you own the restaurant. And if you think she should make more money then you should pay her more. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a little fucked up that you‚Äôre making your employees pay each other for the work?‚Äù He told me that I just wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrestaurant person,‚Äù which I agreed with. So I quit right then, and about a month later I was working in the education department at a museum. 

Anyway, were they right? Should I have just sucked it up and did my job, or should I have made a stink about it? Was that normal restaurant operation?

My daughter just graduated college from a top ten in the nation university. She got a full ride so there is no debt there. She has a few thousand in debt from her credit card spending, but is taking care of that from her earnings at work. She hates her job and our hometown for various reasons, and wants to move across the country to work in a completely different field than what she studied for in college.

She has about 3,000 saved up and wants to move. She will be thousands of miles away. She wants us to cosign for her to have an apartment. She will be moving to this new city without any jobs lined up. She also is not 100% stable because has some mental illness issues that come into play(that she really hasn‚Äôt sought help for in any meaningful way).

She went to school with lots of people who are well off, and whose parents can afford to be on the hook for rent if things don‚Äôt work out for her. She doesn‚Äôt want to stay here and get a job until she has saved up some more money, plus she is convinced that she will never get an apartment without a cosigner because she has never lived on her own.

Just to add, the mental illness plays into it two ways. First, not having a hold on the illness and being unstable is one problem and the other is that she treats us horribly when she gets mad because she is in the throes of an episode and just tries to cut as deep as possible. From stuff like saying mom has a fat face to ‚ÄúI hope you die‚Äù and everything in between.

So, are her mom and I assholes for not wanting to cosign on her apartment because she is somehow 100% sure that she won‚Äôt need us, or is she being unreasonable by assuming we should take on financial the responsibility(well, the possibility of being financially responsible) of hers?",68,98,0.91
1503,Not enough info,"So my girlfriend (18) had to go to another city with a team of 6 (4F/2M) to work on a project where they present a project to a bunch of investors. As she reached the hotel, she told me that they would be divided into two rooms, each containing 1 double bed and 1 single bed. Since the rooms were for three, they decided to split into groups of 2F/1M as thats how the girls were comfortable. 
One of the girls she was sharing the room with was very adamant that she wanted the single bed, and my girlfriend decided to agree with her and take the double bed with the guy even though she's on her period. Well, she told me about it and I was a tad bit angry at her for agreeing with this arrangement. Idk why I'm worried about it, but this is what the entirety of the situation is.

1504,Not the A-hole,"I live in a small town on the coast of NC with my husband and kids. The town is about 300 years old and it has maintained historical buildings and traditions to promote tourism and historical interest. Our house is, IMO, quite beautiful. Google the Hamptons White House, it's almost identical to that house.

As it's a historical area there are numerous tours to see the old cemetary, jail, courthouse, various historical homes. Blackbeard once graced our town and his ship is actually sunken off the coast.

Our house is near the historical district but our neighborhood is new and our house is not part of the history. A couple days ago I let my kids go out and play in the sprinkler in the front yard while I cleaned and after a while I noticed people leaning on my fence with their phones put so I went out to investigate. They said they were walking the historical trail and my house was so pretty they wanted photos.

I pointed out that the historical path is three blocks up and those properties have large plaques denoting their historical value. They said they k ow but my house was just so nice they couldn't resist and they didnt want to pay for the tour. I pointed out my kids were very obviously playing and they were half-dressed in their swim suits and their photos had been taken, and that the house was obviously a private home. I added I wanted the photos deleted as I didnt want my kids photos going off with them when they're in their bathing suits. If we had been out in public it would have been different but this is my home behind a fence. I asked how they would have felt if I followed them home and did what they were doing. They argued with me for a few minutes.

They told me they wouldnt delete the photos and if I wanted privacy I should have built a taller fence. They kept taking photos so I went to go back inside but as I did I stopped and turned on the sprinklers next to the fence. They were soaked.

1509,Everyone Sucks,"My roommate and I are moving to a new place.

It has one master bedroom with a closet, one significantly smaller bedroom with no closet, one small living room, one den, a kitchen and a bathroom. And a creepy basement but that's beside the point. (it's really creepy)

The Den is in comparable size to the master bedroom, just without a closet. She agreed to let me convert it into a bedroom and she'd get the master bedroom. That leaves the smaller bedroom.

I don't really have a use for it. I don't own many things and I'm a neet in modern standards and prefer my room/solitude in the living room at times. Roommate has a lot of stuff as she lived by herself longer than I have and has accumulated more things.

She wants the smaller bedroom to convert into a studio for dancing, craft room for cosplay, storage and a place to put her boyfriend and his entertainment things. (Roommate's boyfriend does not live with us but visits daily.)

Edit: Before it was discussed that the smaller bedroom was going to be a storage room as well as an entertainment room for guests.

I'm okay with that, but I asked to pay less rent. She said no and her argument was by taking the Den, I took away from the common area usage and the rent should still be 50/50. My argument was I don't want to pay extra for space I'm not going to use ever and to split by square footage of the rooms. ie: Room space + common areas divided by half.

I just feel like I shouldn't pay equally for her extra room/boyfriend.

TLDR; Roommate wants extra room for a studio, I asked to split rent by square footage, she said no. AITA?  


Final Edit: I guess just to clear things up, I wrote the previous post emotionally and didn't concisely explain a lot of things I thought were minor details.  
1. Prior, when we first viewed the lower duplex, the smaller bedroom was going to be the shared storage room and an entertainment room. We agreed I would take the Den (same size as the master bedroom, just no closet) and the TV/entertainment stuff would be moved to the smaller bedroom as she has her boyfriend over daily. This was to declutter the living room and to also not compete in noise level as he plays youtube videos loudly/plays on his PS4. 

Now it seems like she wants it for private use. ie: the studio space/cosplay crafts room/place for her boyfriend's things/entertainment items/dance room. Which is why I had an issue. She's very strict about aesthetics, if I did try to use it for storage, there'd be a lot of rules in place. Had I known her stance changed before the final walkthrough, I wouldn't have signed the lease until we ironed it out again. (it was an edocument and she signed for me and then let me know. Not going to throw her to the police for this. She's still my friend at the end of the day and we were going to sign it eventually I guess. @\_@ )  
2. Roomie's bf does not live with us or contribute towards anything. Currently stays 9AM-9PM on weekdays at our current place but new place, he will not get keys to the new house. So looking more like 5PM-9PM weekdays. I feel like I pay for a third roommate and subsidize their relationship at times. He does not have a job and lives at his parent's.

3. Room Dimensions: Den and Master Bedroom are almost the same in square footage. Den does not have the ""walk-in"" closet like the master bedroom. The smallest bedroom is less than half the size of either room. No closet space. If you put a twin-sized bed in there, you'd take up about half the room.

We're moving in a day, I will be taking the Den. She has the Master Bedroom. The small bedroom has been discussed from going to private use to common use again. She hates the idea of splitting rent by private room use instead of 50/50 but once we have a better idea what we need and what that small bedroom's proper use will be, we'll continue from there. Other than that, the issue was mostly her boyfriend being there constantly that drove me up the wall and we're working on that aspect together.

1510,Not the A-hole,"I (23f) rent a small house with 3 of my friends, it was cheaper than renting an apartment with one roommate. We don't have a back yard but we have a small front yard where I plant flowers. 

Anyways, this happened about two months ago. My flowers got trampled a few times, they're quite cheap so I replaced them, but still unecessary work, not cool. My roommates said they saw a kid, maybe 13 years old walk his dog on our yard. I saw the kid once myself and I asked him not to, pointing out the ruined flowers, and giving him directions to a dog park around the corner. 

Well, it happened again. I warned him again. The third time it happened (while I was in the yard, it happened more often) I was spraying the flowers with a hose, and without really thinking it though I sprayed the kid too. 

I figured that probably makes me an asshole, but I'd rather know for sure. If it matters it was 40 degrees so he would have dried up within minutes, and I hit the front of his shirt, so I didn't ruin his phone or anything. (I figured that would make me even more of an asshole.)

I have 2 kids, twin boy and girl, age 12. They can't be in the same room without arguing. I moved us into a larger house several months ago so they could have separate rooms, which I really should have done sooner, if for no other reason than they are a preteen boy and girl and should each have their own space. The house we all loved and chose came in significantly under budget. I gave both kids a budget for decorating their new rooms, and let them choose what they wanted, figuring this would be a good lesson about finances. The only restriction I gave was no white carpets because of stains.

My daughter chose a dark grey carpet, simple black wooden furniture, and a medium blue paint for her walls. She decorated with movie posters and a basketball hoop on the back of her door.

My son wanted a black carpet, white metal furniture, and for his walls he chose a light pink colour, broken up with patches of blackboard paint. He decorated with photos.

My sister came by today. It's the first I've seen her in over a year, and the first time she's been to the new house. She doesn't live local and was staying with us for a week in the guest room. Aside from a hotel, there is nowhere else she can stay.

My sister has always wanted children, but is unable to have them. I suggested adoption but she doesn't want to, but still wants to be a parent. Because of this she has a tendency to try and parent my kids.

She arrived tonight and she'd been here for maybe an hour. We talked for a bit, and it was very awkward as we don't really like each other. Eventually the kids offered to give her a tour, and when they showed her their rooms, she initially assumed my son's room was my daughters, and vice versa. They corrected her and she said ""but that one is pink, and that one is blue"" and then turned on me and said that I couldn't allow my daughter to have a blue room, nor could I let my son have a pink room. I told her to chill the fuck out. She then said that them having these rooms would mess them up, and said I was a bad mother for forcing them to have the wrong rooms. My kids looked visibly upset.

I replied ""you are not a parent. I am. If you think your total lack of parenting experience means you know better than me you can grab your shit and leave.""

The second I said the thing about her not being a parent she burst into tears. She told me she had nowhere to go and I told her that there is a hotel a few blocks from here or she could head home. She left then sent me a message saying she was taken aback to begin with but thought she was doing the right thing, and it was hard for her to 1. see me with kids when she couldn't have them and 2. know how the kids were as she rarely sees them. She said she came here to see us and now she feels unwanted and unloved. She is getting a hotel room so she can see us in the morning.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: okay I know I shouldn't have said she wasn't a parent and I should have either said she wasn't *their* parent specifically or just focused on the colour thing but it was heat of the moment and when she called me a bad mother I just lashed out by pointing out that she isn't a mother. She didn't speak to me for a while after I got pregnant, and when she got back in touch she immediately started telling me how to parent. I don't mean to sound cruel but it frustrates me when she acts like she knows better than me in terms of parenting when she isn't one.

Every time she asks, I log it down as I find it quite racist to ask someone to change their name because they don't like it. I'm very close to pulling the trigger taking action against them but I wondering if that'd be a seen as an asshole move.",739,3968,0.96

1516,Not the A-hole,"My family has owned a green Quaker parrot for quite some time, like 9 years.He has been by my side for all this time, he used to be very active and move around a lot and we did our best to take care of him, but this week he looked sick, and started plucking out a lot of feathers, he had water and food and we let him out regularly.

Then he threw up on my blanket, and I realized that he was sick, so I called my mom to let her know that he was sick and we should take him to a vet. I have asked my parents to take him to the vet many times in the past, but my parents never wanted to, even when my siblings said we should.

Then she gets home, and sees that he is not feeling well, that he doesn‚Äôt move or anything of the sort. She  then says how he cannot go to the vet, that all he was ‚Äúfeeling a little bit under the weather and how we just need to put some cardboard under him.‚Äù, 

At that point, I went to my room and watched like 10 videos on how to tell if your bird is sick, and he was showing all the symptoms in said videos. Then my parents finally said they would take him to a vet tomorrow. They had a little transport cage in their room, where he could be placed inside with water and food, so taking him somewhere could be easy.

Tomorrow comes and I head off to school, but before I do, I checkup on my bird, and he doesn‚Äôt look any better then yesterday. But I leave anyway, I was bummed out the entire school day, cause I was worried about the bird.

I get home and realize that he hasn‚Äôt been taken to the vet, I look at him, and while he looks a little better, he is still clearly sick, sitting with puffed up feathers at the bottom of his cage, I go to my parents to figure out that they said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just monitor him, he looks fine.‚Äù 

At that point, I storm out of the room and into my room, doing that must have offended my parents because they didn‚Äôt talk to me the rest of the day and never said a word to me. I‚Äôm still pissed about they didn‚Äôt take him either.

AITA?

Edit: They went to a pet store and asked them what was wrong with him, they said he was molting, which is the reason why they said that they shouldn‚Äôt take him to a vet. I‚Äôm still worried, as he has gotten better, but still struggles to walk on one leg. They said how ‚Äúbirds throw up cause he probably ate something bad.‚Äù, But that logic still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

1519,Not the A-hole,"So, a couple of years ago I bought a conch from the Bahamas. I learned how to blow it but there weren‚Äôt many options available to actually use this skill so I started using it at my son‚Äôs weekend soccer games. He was either 5 or 6 at the time. I‚Äôd blow it lustily every time we scored a goal.  Historically we haven‚Äôt been very good so the opportunities were few and far between.  Both the kids and parents on our team seemed to enjoy it, but definitely the parents moreso.  Sometimes they have kids on multiple fields so the noise notified them that we‚Äôve scored (or to look up from their phones lol)

There was this one random game where our kids dominated last year and an opposing kid screamed at me ‚Äústop blowing that horn!‚Äù or something to that effect.  I felt remorseful and stopped for the rest of the game. Since then, I watch the opposing kids‚Äô reactions very carefully because I don‚Äôt want them to feel bad. However I want to celebrate my team and the kids and give props to kids who score late in the game as much as kids who score earlier.  It‚Äôs all in good fun!

Which brings us to today. I missed last game as I was out of town and all I heard at practice yesterday was ‚Äúwe missed the shell‚Äù and ‚Äúare you gonna be there tomorrow?‚Äù   So we‚Äôre up against a team that is CLEARLY outmatched. I‚Äôve seen us blow leads before but it‚Äôs not happening this time. The opposing team is young, small and inexperienced.  I‚Äôm doing my thing, blowing the horn. I‚Äôd say not for long periods of time just short bursts, in a matter-of-fact way. This woman with a baby strapped to her chest comes over and says into my ear ‚ÄúDo you think you should keep blowing that thing?  You have some fucking nerve!‚Äù and walked away. Classy thing was my 5-year-old daughter was right next to me and heard her but whatever.  I didn‚Äôt get a chance to say much as two moms on our team chastised her while she exited stage right. Then when we‚Äôd score, her husband would say ‚Äúblow the horn!‚Äù and they would both clap sarcastically. Truthfully, I would have been ok stopping but I didn‚Äôt want to give in to those tools.  Also parents on my side kept pushing me to keep blowing. The kids on the field all seemed fine which was my main concern. Eventually, I learned the other team only had 4 or 5 people while we had 10. The coaches gave the other team some of our players and I even blew the conch when one of our switched players scored for the other team. 

So AITA for continuing to blow the conch?  Should I just avoid blowing this in the future? I don‚Äôt want to distract from the kids‚Äô efforts.

Edit:  I will say two years ago, we were straight garbage.  We‚Äôd get creamed regularly and it was hard not to get angry as a parent. But we all  realized the kids didn‚Äôt care if they lost 10-0.  They were just happy to be out there. We didn‚Äôt want them to learn that bad behavior from us.  We all just kinda chilled out after that.  I guess that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs fun to celebrate it now.

Edit #2:  Despite being NTA, there were a number of people who felt otherwise. I don‚Äôt wish to distract from the actual kids and their effort. Honestly, it was a good form of entertainment when they sucked but now watching them do well is sufficient. Also I am taking the nickname ‚ÄúSuburban Poseidon‚Äù to my grave, so thanks for that!",44,41,0.83
1520,Not the A-hole,"Oof, the title sounds bad. Using a throwaway because my family is on reddit. English isn't my first language. 

I (18f) live alone with my mom. When growing up healthy eating wasn't something important to her, we mostly ate frozen foods, takeout foods, or fast foods. All we ever drank was soda and juices, after dinner and afternoon  snacks where chips or chocolate, maybe ice cream. I was obese by the time I was 10. I'm not sure how i didn't have scurvy, fresh fruits and veggies where never on the menu. 

I got bullied relentlessly for my weight, and had to deal with health problems that where completely avoidable. 

In high school biology they briefly talked about healthy eating, I researched the rest I wanted to know on the internet. Getting info was the easy part, actually eating healthy was way harder. Sugar is goddamn addictive. 

When I was 15/16 I started working on eating healthier, buying fruit at the grocery store myself, quitting soda, still eating those unhealthy foods with my mom for dinner, just half of what I normally ate. And by now I'm finally a healthy weight. My mom however went from obese to morbidly obese (she kept buying the same amount of food, but eating my portions too, I guess that's why). 

Well, when discussing my upcoming doctors appointment she said something along the lines of 'good that they're doing a checkup, you look sickly thin' and I just blew up. (I have a BMI of 24.2, so that's bullshit). 

I said a lot of unkind things, neglectful and lazy where among them, i think fat too but I don't quite remember, as well as that it felt like she was trying to kill her own child. She cried, we haven't spoken much since. 

I guess I resent my mom a bit for making me grow up like that, as a child you're completely depended on your parents and I felt failed by her. But what I said still feels very harsh. Especially since the reason we ate so bad was probably related to my mom's mental health. 

Was I the asshole here?

Edit: I've tried talking to her about healthier options quite a lot, it never really worked. This also wasn't the first time she made comments about my weight/'health'.

INFO: We're not eating this way because it's all we can afford, takeout is more expensive than pretty much any other food here.",37,85,0.93

Last December one of my employees asked me to watch his newborn daughter because he had to work and the babies mother is highly unfit, constantly abusing drugs and alcohol. Fast forward to now and I‚Äôve become the primary care taker of this little girl and have come to love her as my own. In the past few months Ive taken her to get her shots, bought clothes, bought diapers, formula etc. The mother almost never asks to see her and when she does she‚Äôll only keep her for 48 hours at most. Everytime I get her back she comes back filthy and tired and I suspect she‚Äôs neglected when shes with her biological mother. Yesterday we had a court room hearing for the custody if the child (the father and I have come to an agreement that if he gets full custody that he‚Äôll transfer legal guardianship to me). Well the mother neglected to show up and I felt horrible that she clearly wouldn‚Äôt even out up a fight for her child. So today I called her parole officer and under a fake name snitched on the mother and told the P.O. about her illicit drug use. Her P.O. assured me that he‚Äôd look into the situation immediately and if everything goes as planned she could be sent away for up to four years.

1525,Asshole,"So my parents are on holiday for the first time in years. I use this opportunity to have my girlfriend stay over.

Now my brother has met my girlfriend (once) when I treated him to good seats for his favourite artist earlier this year. They spoke a bit and seemed to get along fine, he never spoke about it afterwards. I realise now my brother hasn't done anything for my birthday, but I don't treat people for things in return.

First night my brother came home late. By which time me and my gf are already resting in bed in my second bedroom (upstairs to mine & next door to his, I don't use this bedroom because the 5G WiFi doesn't reach). I text him I'm sleeping in the room next door so he doesn't get scared, he asks me why but I don't need to give a response for sleeping in my other bed?

Second night. Me and my girlfriend make food and watch some Netflix on the dinner table. He texts me that he's home & I reply I know. He comes downstairs, walks into the kitchen awkwardly holding his t shirt to his mouth? Grabs his water bottle (turns out he grabbed my gf water bottle by mistake lmao) and goes back upstairs. I ignore the whole thing because in our daily life, with our parents there, he doesn't make any conversation with me.

We weren't making any loud music, we all had work the next day so none of us planned to stay up any later than we needed to.

While my gf is in the shower my brother texts me to ask my friend to go home as he's uncomfortable. I climb 2 flights of stairs to go to his room (which he never comes out of anyways). I ask him what's wrong and why he's uncomfortable. He responds he doesn't need to give a reason in his house (in my head I'm like hold up it's our dad's house and neither of us pay rent lol) and closes the door.

I go back downstairs and realise it's 11pm. As my gf lives on the other side of city I call my brother to explain this but he is so determined for her to leave that he said he'll pay for the uber. He even threatens to tell them to leave himself.

I tell my girlfriend and she is very mature about the situation & feels bad for making him uncomfortable. As we wait for the bus he sends the second text in the image.

A bit of context: We live in a Muslim household but only my mum prays 5 times a day. I haven't revealed my relationship to my family as my mother explicitly told me I can only marry someone who's a) from the same country as us and b) is Muslim (even though I'm not Muslim myself and I've said this to her).

I am 25 and my brother is 22.

My brother has always lived at home but has been on holiday once with friends.

I've had a few male friends stay over, with my mums permission & my family present. One even used my shower, which my brother never had a problem with.

Using a pump of face wash is a bit dramatic, especially as 1) she assumed everything in the shower room is mine (because it *is* my shower room) and 2) I purchased this for him on Amazon so it's not even a rare product.

1530,Not the A-hole,"Update: I told my friend everything and at first she left me on seen, but she later on replied and we worked everything out. Thanks to everybody who helped. 


So first off, this is my first ever post and I'm on mobile and english isn't my first language, so I apologize in advance. 

So, for some context. My friend (whom I will call Marie), came out to me as bisexual a few days before 9th grade ended (in my country, the 9th grade is the last year of elementary school, then you start first year of high school) and since she knows I'm ace and am very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, she felt safe enough to come out to me. Then she also said she has a crush on me. No big deal, she knows I'm straight and I assumed she wouldn't make any advances toward me.  

It's currently the 5th week of high school for us and while me and my other friend (who is also friends with Marie) have already made friends, Marie is EXTREMELY introverted and has always had problems with making friends, so she still doesn't have any. This leaves her with nobody to talk to, except me (she doesn't really talk to our other friend). 

 Another major, so to say ""bad"" thing about her, is that she often times has little meltdowns, or fits, where she (over Snapchat) sends rude stuff like: ""Ok fine, then ignore me and I won't have any friends till the day I die"" and she constantly sends me those ""I love you"" bitmojis that made me a little uncomfortable. And any time she sent me any texts saying, how she is going to be forever alone I always comforted her and said she won't, blah blah blah. It's gotten to the point I don't ever wanna talk to her again and I always have this sense of resposibility to talk to her, since (as far as she told me) I'm the only person she talks to. 

I wouldn't be that shocked if the majority of people who read this, said I'm the asshole, but I just wanna know, if I'm doing the right thing. I can't stand another minute talking to her, telling it will all be ok.

Edit: I told her how i felt about everything and she left me on seen. So... Yeah.",40,44,0.82

1532,Not the A-hole,"I've been dating my girlfriend for nearly six months and she noticed I hardly ever bring up my mom in conversation. I'm close to my Dad and we talk often. When she pointed this out, I told her that my mom can be close minded and old fashioned and I'm not that close to her.

She probed a little bit and I told her that I'm happy to be honest, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't be sharing this much this early in the relationship. She insisted. 

I told her how my mom is never happy with my relationships (a bit of a control freak) and she's not going to be happy that I'm dating a white girl without a graduate degree. And I said this from past experience and knowing that her peers are professors, and she's been very annoyed with me  dropping out of graduate school too, to pursue a start up.  

I told her that none of those things bother me, but I can't cut my mom off, so we'll cross that bridge if we get to it. 

She was upset that I condoned my  mom's views by not calling her  out on it, and got worried that this relationship wouldn't work out unless she could win my mother over. I told her honestly that yes, while it would be great and tough, it's not something that's necessary for me. She also thought that my way of talking about her and focusing on her education degrees is setting herself up for failure whenever I bring her up to my mom. That I should be focusing on other things and not give my mom the opportunity to start looking at the negatives. I just got annoyed at this point and told her that these aren't new thoughts and it's not like I've been trying to talk my mom out of these worldviews but beyond a point, I have just given up. I mean this is not my first rodeo with a relationship.

We're still adjusting to living together but I can honestly say that usually it is lovely. 

Anyway, I use a mooncup on my periods. It's a little silicon cup that you clean out at the end of it. (Btw, I would highly recommend them to the relevant 50% of the population) Like usual, after my period stopped, I put it in a some boiling water and soap in a mug (a little tea mug) on the the top shelf in the kitchen. Usually it'd be in there for 10 minutes odd till I clean it and put it back in its pouch thing with my toiletries. It wasn't in view, I had to climb on the worktop to put it there, as I know Bob wouldn't like to just happen over it (which I do get).

Well I forgot about it, and it sat up there while I was away for a week odd. He happened upon it a few days in, and said it was super gross and that now we can never use that cup again, saying how unhygienic it was and what if his friends drank out of it. I don't think its that bad, like yes of course I don't want to feed my period blood to your friends, but I will obviously clean the cup properly after.

My sister agrees with Bob. I still think worse things have happened. It's all over now and we have a good relationship, but I wanted some outside perspectives. Maybe its just a boy squeamish thing? But that doesn't really apply as he will soon be a doctor and has removed people's organs- I reckon that must be much worse!

1535,Not the A-hole,"I started dating my fianc√© almost two years ago. I love him completely, and know that I will be happy with him for the rest of my life. He is intelligent, ambitious, hilarious, supportive, and loves and cares about me. He is my best friend.

The first time I mentioned to my mother that we'd started dating, she seemed to not like him for a few reasons: our age gap is larger than most (difference is 7-8 years depending on the time of year), he's divorced (his marriage lasted a year), he comes from a non-denominational Christian family (my mother is Catholic and believes all other Christians are stupid), and is very vocal about his struggles with mental illness (OCD and depression among others) and even wrote a successful book about it.

She found all these things out by googling him, which I specifically asked her not to do, because I knew she would find those things and judge him before knowing him.

She refused to meet him for over a year after we started dating because she didn't ""want to meet guy after guy"" that I date (for the record, I've had one boyfriend before this. I am hardly a serial dater). When I finally got her to meet him, we all went out to dinner, and she wouldn't even look at him. She would answer any questions he asked her with one word. She didn't smile and didn't ask any questions in return.

Every time I've mentioned him, she immediately goes quiet and changes the subject. I told her his sister was having a baby and she just said ""Mmm."" I told her we were going for a weekend vacation and she said ""Okay."" I told her he'd proposed to me and she said ""Oh."" I asked her to be excited with me, to help me plan a wedding, but she refuses to ever bring it up herself. Every time we've spoken about it, it's because I brought it up, and she hardly says anything.

Over the past year and a half we've had multiple screaming matches over the phone with me crying and asking her to just give him a chance, try to like him, and see what I see in him. In response, she says I can't force her to be excited, that I never seem to be satisfied with who she is, that I need to let her be.

Two and a half months ago, I told her I needed her to ask about him every once in a while, and actually show interest in my relationship, otherwise I couldn't keep speaking to her and giving her only the details she wanted to hear. I said I couldn't censor the details of my life for her and she needed to care about all of them, or hear none of them at all. I left it up to her to contact me when she was ready to accept my fianc√©.

She told me she was sorry I had decided to give her an ultimatum, that I shouldn't be proud of it, and that she loves me.

We haven't spoken since then. While I think she's treating my fianc√© terribly, I'm not sure if I should've gone as far as I did, and I question if I'm in the wrong for not speaking to her.

1536,Not the A-hole,"So, I‚Äôve known Paul since I was maybe 13. We are both mid 20s now. 

Paul has always had trouble with mistaking relationships to be deeper than they are. He goes on a date with a girl, to him they‚Äôre already in a relationship. He can hang out with someone a few times and then think they‚Äôre his best friend. Paul and I made out at a party, at the age of 15. He still references it whenever we chat one on one, says he ‚Äúmisses what we had‚Äù and makes it sound as if we had some sort of long term relationship. 

I‚Äôve set him straight on that many times but it goes to show there‚Äôs something just generally off about how he perceives things vs reality. This has now spread to his relationships with friends and their children.

Whenever a friend of his has a child, he starts coming around more and tries making it seem as if they‚Äôre very close. He refers to himself as the child‚Äôs uncle, always offers to babysit and posts pics of the kid with captions like, ‚Äúlook how cute my niece is!‚Äù 

Paul is a school teacher of young children so I get that he gets along well with them and all that, but I just find it weird, other friends do too. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs just lonely and wishes he had a partner or children and maybe just wants to fill that void. 

Recently he‚Äôs been babysitting a friend‚Äôs kid (a girl maybe 7 or 8) and helping out the mother a lot; the father isn‚Äôt in the picture so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good for her. The problem they aren‚Äôt dating, this is just a casual friend he‚Äôs doing this with and he posts pictures of the kid referring to her as his daughter. 

The niece/nephew thing was strange, but calling another person‚Äôs kid your daughter is just weird.  I messaged Paul asking if the girl‚Äôs his kid (I know she‚Äôs not), and he said no but that the mom is fine with it and the girl even calls Paul her dad and considers him to be her new dad. 

I told Paul I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate or healthy for that girl to let her think he‚Äôs her new dad, unless for some reason he‚Äôs at the step where he‚Äôd be legally adopting her or is the long term partner of the girl‚Äôs mother, and not just a random friend helping out. He of course told me to fuck off. 

I think that‚Äôll end up very confusing for the girl when Paul isn‚Äôt around anymore, or if the mom gets married and she actually has a stepfather, situations like that.

Our other friend said they think it‚Äôs weird too but it‚Äôs not our right to say anything. Since I think it‚Äôs damaging to the child I feel like it was ok to voice my opinion. Am I right or AITA?

tl;dr My friend Paul always thinks relationships are deeper than they are, like he‚Äôll call a girl he‚Äôs gone on one date with his girlfriend. He calls his friends‚Äô kids his nieces/nephews and always offers to babysit. Recently he‚Äôs started calling a friend‚Äôs kid his daughter and she calls him dad; he babysits and does favors for the mom but they aren‚Äôt dating. I told him it‚Äôs not appropriate and he‚Äôs going to confuse the child. He told me to fuck off. AITA for voicing my opinion on this?

edit:  i should clarify that Paul only met this woman in recent months through another mutual friend, and just started offering her help with her kid all the time. I could see it being different had there been a long term close friendship beforehand",100,173,0.93

1538,Not the A-hole,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn‚Äôt lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he‚Äôd have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn‚Äôt want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she‚Äôs dumped him. I went on her fb page as we‚Äôre all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she‚Äôs upset it didn‚Äôt work out but these things happen, so we‚Äôre on good terms) and looks like she‚Äôs with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time.

My MIL, FIL and husband's uncle will be travelling through town and would like to stay with us a couple of nights on their way back home. This is not a trip specifically to see us, they will just be passing us on the way back home. I'm all for them coming to stay with us. We haven't seen them in a while. 

Here's the thing. We have two cats, and three weeks ago my husband brought home a 3 month old puppy. We are still in the process of house training, and he has accidents in the house on a daily basis still. Our cats are also still trying to get used to the puppy which isn't easy when he tries to play with them or chase them down the hall. We are making progress on all fronts but we still have some ways to go. 

Here is the real problem. My MIL wants to bring her dogs with her when she stays with us. I told my husband ""no way"" as our animal situation is chaotic right now. We don't have a fenced yard yet so that is not an option. MIL and FIL will already be taking up the guestroom which has been a safe space for the cats, and bringing two unfamiliar dogs to the situation seems like a huge recipe for disaster, and not the enjoyable time we would all like to have together. 

Now MIL is getting pissy and telling my husband (through text) ""I guess we won't be able to see each other then.""

Sometime throughout this transition she decided that when she moved, she was getting a puppy. I wasn‚Äôt asked for my opinion, so I didn‚Äôt give it, but I personally thought this was an awful idea for multiple reasons. The biggest reason I thought it wouldn‚Äôt work is because with her 2 jobs, she is sometimes out of the house for 12+ hours. 

After she got the puppy, she asked me if I would mind letting it out sometimes. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt mind if she was in a pinch and I was in the area. She has only had the puppy a week and has already asked me to go over to her house twice to hang out with the dog. When I went, she venmoed me $10. After the second time, I suggested she look into Rover if she needed someone and was going to pay me anyway. She told me she wanted me to do it because she trusted me. 

I live about 20 mins from her and my work is only about 10 mins from her new place, but this is not my puppy.

1547,Not enough info,"Might be a bit long so you have a bit more context. I have a group of friends of about ~10 guys - a few of them I've known since I was in college, and the rest I met ~3 years ago on my baseball team. We're all fairly close knit - we play sports together twice a week through the summers, enter in tournaments, often host holiday potlucks / events, go camping together, etc. In this group is a guy named Ryan. Ryan's a good guy at heart but I believe to be an alcoholic and a complete wildcard when drinking. He has an intellectual disability as well, so you can't reason with him (especially when he's drunk). Here's a few examples of how he is during social events / parties that involve alcohol:



* Drinks dangerous amounts of alcohol, will often bring a full 24 of beer and then some liquor as well incase the beer isn't enough.




* In ONE single night at my house he fell into my wall putting a hole in it, shattered a glass beer bottle on my tile floor (lucky it didn't break), **and** fell down my stairs. 




* During a camping trip he was bordering on too drunk to stand - he somehow injured himself and broke his toe



* Went drinking last Tuesday (I was not there, I only see Ryan if he's there with the group as I'm not particularly fond of him drunk, sober he's a good albeit slow guy) hit his head and gave himself a concussion



* On a separate camping trip he fell through my $100 beer pong table, breaking it. He also shattered my glass lantern




* Ends up crying almost every night he drinks. Sometimes in person, other times he'll record himself for an obscene amount of time and post it to Snapchat




It's hard because he's known some of the guys in our group of friends since he was a toddler. He just seems to be too much of a wildcard and completely irresponsible when drinking to have at my wedding. It's even tougher because when he's not drinking I really like him. He's a good-hearted guy who would never intentionally hurt someone. We play outfield in baseball together so we're quite close and talk quite a bit during the games.

Well recently she was thinking of buying a plane ticket and moving over there till she turned 18.

Well I was at her house yesterday till nearly around 1 am or so and I really thought Tommorow may be the last day.

1550,Asshole,"My sister in law has always been envious about my fitness. What she doesn't realize is how much effort it takes and how careful I am about eating. After a lot of bouts with eating disorders, now my body is a temple. And it shows.

The first year or  so we were in each other's lives, she was really passive-aggressive and snide. But I think something in her changed and she decided to get into shape herself. Naturally she reached out to me and I was glad! I'm much happier helping her out rather than being at the receiving end of so much passive aggression and envy.

The only problem is, in the past four months or so we've been trying to exercise and diet plan together, she's horrible and completely undisciplined. She skips exercises, comes up with flakiest of excuses, and just cannot control her binge eating. She thinks that 20 minutes on a cycle totally justifies a large fries slathered with so much BBQ sauce it makes me puke just thinking about it.

The other day, we finally went on a long run out. Long, I say, but it was only 2 miles. And guess what? She had like a third of a tub of ice cream to celebrate! I declined, of course.

What's starting to get me annoyed is how she talks about it. She says she's trying so hard and how naturally it comes to me and how great my genes must be and how much work it is for her. It's completely the opposite. I'm the one doing at least 2-3x the work she's putting in. The next time this comes up in front of friends or relatives, I'm this close to calling her out on it. WIBTA?

1551,No A-holes here,"Some background: my fiance and I each have 1 child (ages 12 and 5) from previous relationships. We both owned our own houses (I have a mortgage on mine, she inherited hers from her parents). Because her house is larger and in a better school district, when we decided to live together, my son and I moved into her house and I am selling my house at the end of the year (it needs too many repairs and any rent we got would barely cover the mortgage; I would rather just save the mortgage money myself).

When we decided we were going to get married and combine all of our financial things like bank accounts and stuff, I had her added to the deed to my house, and put her as the beneficiary to my $500,000 life insurance policy, so that she and our sons would not be unnecessarily burdened in case I died.

A few weeks ago, she had a health scare that thankfully turned out to not be very serious, and is much better now.

During that time, I started thinking about what would happen if she died and I had sold my house. With her house being in her name, I don't know what kind of claim I would have to be able to keep living here with our sons. I asked her about adding me to the deed, so that I could be assured of staying here and keeping our boys in their schools and with their friends. I told her that I am willing to take out a loan to buy equity from her, or that I could pay the entirety of the taxes each year (I already pay half). I am not looking for a ""free ride"".

She told me that her house is all she has to leave to her son, and wasn't going to add me to the deed. When I asked what I was supposed to do if she passed away, she told me that I would be fine, and I could just keep paying the taxes and bills until her son was old enough to live here on his own, at which time my son and I could either leave, or work something out with her son to stay, presumably paying rent or something.

That was the end of the conversation, it was not an argument or anything. I am not really happy with this though.

I would be paying taxes on a property that I will not own, and have the thought in the back of my mind that I and my son (who would be 12 when her son is 18 and presumably take ownership of the house, with the right to tell me to leave) would have to leave at any time.

1559,Not the A-hole,"I got a lodger 6 days ago. Before having her stay I made clear a lodger's agreement and list of written house rules.

Firstly, I was not looking to change nor control a person/lodger, rather I was looking for someone who is naturally a good fit for my home. For example, one of my house rules is ""no outdoor shoes worn inside"" and some people already practice this in their own homes, some don't. I prefer the former.

Anyway, I don't have locks on the internal doors other than the bathroom because I am trustworthy and want to live with someone who also is trustworthy.

What brings me here: I have a CCTV camera set up in the hallway which overlooks all doors. I've had this from when I was living alone and feel its non-intrusive and gives the house added security. I don't sit and watch it all day but it's useful for when I'm not home and have left the door unlocked for a delivery man etc.

My house rule regarding this camera are written clearly in the rules is: Do not touch it, turn it, obscure it's field of vision.

The lodger read and agreed to this, she was pushy and insisted she wanted to live here. That was a red flag because she probably didn't read.

Yesterday I went to a concert and told my lodger. While I was there, my camera notifications were going off like crazy but I paid no mind. Later, intuition told me to check the camera footage, the lodger had moved the camera so that it was no longer overlooking my bedroom door.

My personal papers (birth cert, passport, gov letters etc) were left in a messy pile by me BUT I do not recall leaving them all facing up so... conspicuously.

The camera was turned for over two hours then she turned it back. Earlier that day she asked me if it could view in the dark and I didn't think much of her question.

I feel as though I'm a fair landlord, I would NEVER snoop around a lodger's personal things and even ask/warn them if I need to enter their room for their benefit (such as measure their windows for curtains they've requested).

1563,Not the A-hole,"I (29F) gave my cousin (25F) a weekend citytrip to a big European city for her birthday. I told her she could pick between Amsterdam, Paris, or Cologne, whichever she thought would be the most fun, and I would take her there for a long weekend, all expenses paid. We live in Belgium, so those cities would be a relatively short train ride away.

She was really happy and enthusiastic, but instead of picking one of those cities, she immediately said: ‚ÄúOh, actually, I would really love to go to Istanbul (Turkey) or Olso (Norway), or ...(naming some other places that were definitely not just a train ride away)!‚Äù

I was kinda baffled at this response, because I thought I was already giving her quite a substantial gift, and she immediately demanded more/something different. (And it's not like this is something I gift her every year or something. This is and was meant to be a one off, to celebrate her 25th birthday.)

At that moment I was a bit too taken aback to say anything other than ‚ÄúWe'll see‚Äù.

The subject came up again a week later when my cousin enthusiastically messaged me with a link to a site with cheap deals for city trips to Istanbul etc, showing that it really did not have to be any more expensive. I tried to remind her that my offer had been for one of those three cities, but she said that she did not like being in such a big metropolitan city because of her anxiety. I told her that a city like Istanbul is hardly going to be peaceful and quiet, but she said that those other cities just didn't really interest her (even though she has never been to any of them).

Right now we're at a bit of an impasse, because she's not budging, and neither am I. I feel like she is being an asshole for being greedy, while at the same time wondering if I'm the asshole for sticking to the ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù rules of my own gift to her.

The thing is: I feel like I don't really have a good reason to deny her: The trips she named are not necessarily much more expensive. It's not like I would mind going to a different city. And maybe she is just being brutally honest in saying that she did not like my gift?

But at the same time I feel hurt that my gift (and I personally think it is a BIG gift) apparently isn't good enough. I spent time planning and researching the possible trips I offered her, and I feel like she is being greedy and inconsiderate.

WIBTA if I put my foot down and told her to stop demanding more than what I've offered her?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just for clarification, since it comes up a lot in the comments. My issue with my cousin choosing places like Istanbul is not necessarily just the price, because as I said, the trip itself doesn't have to be more expensive. One part of the problem is that Olso and Istanbul and Marrakech require flights. Just the hassle of travelling to and from the airport and having to be there 2 hrs in advance would eat up a lot of time of our trip. With a train you are immediately in the city centre and ready to go.

Secondly: Obviously I want my cousin to enjoy this gift. The point is for us to spend time together and have a good time and I honestly do not really mind in which city, which is why I gave her multiple options. I offered her these three options because I thought she would enjoy it: Over the last few years she's been on holiday to Dublin, Rome and Tokio and she loved those cities, so I thought this would fall into the category of something she'd enjoy. When she told me my three options were just not interesting to her, I suggested cities like Dijon, Frankfurt, Rotterdam etc, but she still said they just ""didn't interest her"".

I just don't see how she would not be able to enjoy herself in the cities I suggested, when she previously chose similar trips for her own holidays.",188,541,0.96

Edit: some comments are saying to add in more details to clarify the situation a little bit. 

When we moved in together it wasnt because we were all broke. We bought a large house with a finished basement including a full kitchen, master bedroom/bath, second room with attached bathroom, living area and office space. I called it the basement because technically that is what it is, but is the size of a large apartment.

When I got pregnant it set off baby mama drama like a nuke. Psycho bag decided that she didnt want my step-child around the new sibling and took us back to court. Lawyers cost $350/hour.

I'm directing an independent animated film which is MOSTLY a collaborative effort between me and several other graduates from my school/friends (leaving a lot of this vague as I don't want any of them finding this) we're at the stage where most everything is accounted for except for the voice acting. Specifically save for one character that is causing controversy. The character is a Native American and his heritage is integral to his character, so he can't exactly be changed. Now the person who designed him wants to invite a friend of ours to voice him. The issue is he's white and I don't want to hire a white person to voice an indigenous person without at the very least doing a casting call for an actual indigenous person.

&#x200B;

I'm catching flak now since as the film has mostly been ""staffed"" by people we all know they think me changing it for this is dumb. Anyone that is on my side doesn't want to get involved in the drama, so it looks like I'm the sole ""bad guy"" here. Am I?",36,97,0.92

So recently I needed to rent a car for my wife. We only have vehicle but living in the city it works for us 90% of the time. I am married with two small children. 

Since we only have the 1 car, I drop off and pick up all three of them for school, daycare and work daily. I also need to take the car as I am on the road for at least 3 hours a day for work. 

While I have been lucky enough to have the ability, it's really difficult to manage getting back in time each day make the pickups. This week there was no possible chance for me to do that so I elected to rent her a car to take over the kids transport.

The morning of picking up the rental I had a really tight timeframe as I had to pickup a colleague at the airport shortly after. At the rental agency they only had 2 cars left. A two door sports car and a mini van. While my wife waited in the other car I had to make the executive decision. With two kids needing car seats it seemed really inconvenient for her to have to use the 2dr. I thought the best choice would be the mini van. 

I pulled out of the lot with the van asked my wife to jump in the driver's seat of the other car and pull up next to me in a nearby lot to switch the car seats over. When she did this she she was driving too fast up over the driveway bump and spilt the two cups of coffee all over the front inside of the vehicle. She pulled up next to me and was furious.  already. Not about the coffee but that I apparently made her drive my car which she didn't know how to do. It's an automatic midsize car. She definitely knows how to drive. No apology, just took my keys and threw them on the ground smashing my key fob. 

Being in a huge rush I had to move on. But she then tells me she refuses to drive the van because it's too big. Leaving me with two cars to deal with that I just paid for and no time to sort this all out. She wants to no walk to work, 3 blocks away and leave me hanging. Also no plan to pick up the kids which we supposed to be her job today. She eventually took the van, and I barley made it on time but it's been an ongoing issue ever since.

I understand she had some nerves about driving the van because it's bigger than expected but it's not an 18 wheeler and it would only be for 2 days and less than 5 mile trips. I feel like I make a ton of accommodations to take care of everyone and really needed her to suck it up this time. Does my not letting her anxiety outweigh the family need make me TA?",39,136,0.94
1577,No A-holes here,"Some friends and I went to a restaurant. 

The service was good at first, we were seated a few minutes before our reservation. 

When we were ordering though we had to repeat ourselves a few times and she didn‚Äôt even take one person‚Äôs order, we had to call her back over. 

She forgot to bring my drink and I asked for a relatively simple alteration (please leave the mayonnaise off my sandwich) and when it came it had mayonnaise. 

So at the end of the meal we got separate checks and I didn‚Äôt tip. 

My friend noticed I didn‚Äôt tip and I said the service wasn‚Äôt good so I wasn‚Äôt tipping. They all said ‚Äúyah but that‚Äôs her living, she got the food here, she replaces your sandwich, leave like 5 or 10%.‚Äù 

I said no way was I paying extra for the experience I‚Äôd just had. They said it was embarrassing to go out with me if I wasn‚Äôt going to tip and I said why would I tip for this? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm dining and dashing. I‚Äôm paying my bill. Tipping is optional. 

Then one said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be such an asshole, you know you can afford to tip‚Äù and I stood my ground but I don‚Äôt know. I saw the waitress‚Äôs disappointed face when she was picking up our checks and now I wonder if I‚Äòm an asshole?",171,76,0.83

1579,No A-holes here,"I'm 30 years old, I work in a technical field within the medical industry, it's something that takes years to really acquire proficiency in and it's one of those jobs where you can say ""I'm better at this than 99.9% of all humanity.""

Recently however, I've been growing disenchanted with it. I'm good at it, and I think with it has come a level of monotony. Pair that with the limited opportunity for advancement and I just don't see this as much more than a way to pay bills now. So I've been considering a career change, which is natural for someone at my age and with my experience I think, but as I've looked through the listings and all that I've started to realize that very little of what I'm qualified for now actually interests me in the slightest.

Here's where the issue starts. I've been in a relationship with a fantastic woman for 6 years now.  I can't stress to you enough how amazing she is and how much I love her. She's a few years younger than me and now that she finished college has been thinking a lot about marriage and children, As in, she would like to have both in the immediate future.

I recently shared with her my feelings on my career prospects and she would absolutely support my choice to switch jobs, should I choose to.

I brought a different idea to her though, one that I can't shake out of my head since it came to me and I think it's something I really want to do. I think I want a career in a *completely* different field. One I would have to go back to college for. I know how difficult this would be to do at this stage, I'd be very busy, make less money as I attend classes, and on an individual level my future would be completely up in the air. I don't take that lightly but I earnestly believe this choice would lead to a more fulfilling life. Currently I'm depressed, exhausted, over stressed, and just god damn *tired* doing what I do now.

So I brought this to her, and she nearly cried. She said that while she would never tell me not to pursue what would make me happy, going back to school would significantly delay what she wants(marriage and a family), and that doing so would in a way be prioritizing myself over her and our future. I never gave an indication of this desire earlier in our relationship and she has essentially invested 6 years into a relationship under a drastically different assumed plan(she didn't say this exactly, but the intimation is that she would have wasted the years we've spent together). 

I understand exactly what she means, but I'm terrified that if I don't do this, I'll be 40, hate my job, and wish every day that I made the choice to change career paths. Would I be selfish to willingly withhold something she very very much wants for several years while I pursue something for my own gain?

Update: Thank you everyone for your help, it honestly means a lot to me. I've tried to read all of your comments and consider them as much as I can, and while I disagree with some to greater or lesser degrees, I've heard some things from you all that I didn't anticipate and I think will help my partner and I navigate the potential choices ahead. So I just wanted to say thanks.",114,183,0.95
1580,Not the A-hole,"I know I could have handled the entire situation better, but I don't know how much of an asshole I am.

I've been dating Kira for 2 months now.  I get home late sometimes, so on nights where she comes over and I wont be home til late it makes sense for her to just pick up food.  Most times I'm not home late so we go out together, or we cook something, but 3 times now I just cash app her $20 and she picks up some fast food because its too late to do that stuff.

The first time we did this, she told me where she wanted to pick up food, so I texted her what I wanted from there, then sent her $20.  My order was only $7 so I definitely gave her enough to cover whatever she wanted as well.  She can keep the change, buy herself a coffee in the morning on me...or whatever else.  She came home with the wrong order for me.  It was still something I liked (I ordered a burger, she brought home a chicken sandwich) so it wasn't a big deal.  She said they must have messed up the order.  She definitely told them a burger.  OK, no problem, shit happens.

Few weeks later, same shit.  This time a different fast food restaurant.  I texted her my order, sent her more than enough money to buy both of our food, and she came home with the wrong order for me.  Except this time, I don't like the food I was given.  Its not something I order from this restaurant.  I don't like the wet burrito platos from Del Taco, and she got me the chicken verde wet burrito plato.  I don't like green sauce, either.  I asked for a epic cali steak n guac.  Its a completely different type of burrito.  I said what the hell?  You're 0 for 2 on the take out orders, are you doing this on purpose?  She insists it was a lapse in judgement.  I ordered a burrito, and they have a new(ish) chicken verde burrito, so she thought I might like to try it.  I assured her I don't wanna try any new burritos.  Please just get what I ask for, or else whats the point in me even asking?  She told me she would.

Now tonight, SAME SHIT.  Back at Del Taco, I order another epic cali steak n guac, this time she brings back a carne asada wet burrito plato.  Now I'm mad.  I had a rough day and I was looking forward to my burrito.  I DONT LIKE WET BURRITOS.  When I saw that on the table, I laughed.  I thought she was joking.  OK, jokes over, wheres my real burrito?  It was no joke.  She thought I didn't like the other one just because of the green sauce, so she got me one with red sauce.

Thats fucked.  I picked up the dish and threw it in the trash.  I told her if I cant trust her to get a basic ass food order right I don't know how I trust her as a SO in a relationship, then I left and got my burrito.  She's still in bed crying.  I'm going to go in and talk to her in a bit, but I'm still too frustrated.  Honestly.  Why would you keep buying someone the wrong thing? This is on purpose, right?  

Edit:   Kira is usually low on cash, so she always uses coupons when we eat out and she pays.  There is a lingering feeling in the back of my mind that she is just buying me whatever she has a coupon for, that way she can pocket more of the $20 I give her.  Sounds like an unfair and maybe far-fetched assumption so I didn't mention it initially, but others said I should.",1899,7527,0.96

So onto the story, the boss informed me that he wanted to speak to her, so if I could inform her that would be great. 

Knocked first, and opened the door and she looked like a mess. Visibly upset, eyes as red as I‚Äôve seen. She had been crying. Once I got it in, I said I‚Äôm sorry, bad time? Just letting you know boss wants to speak with you. 

I wanted to leave, but my conscience told me to ask her what‚Äôs wrong and if she wanted to talk about it. Well basically she found out her husband had been cheating on her, and she was going to get a divorce. 

I felt bad, so I gave her a pep talk, said she‚Äôs great and she didn‚Äôt need him, she‚Äôs got a lot going for her and she‚Äôs good at what she does. She thanked me, I could tell she was still upset though and hurting and taking it as hard as you could. 

at that point, I felt like I was in too deep to not help. So I got her an inexpensive gift, and a card. I mean, she is probably the closest person to me at my job, and I felt bad. So I gave her a gift a few days later. 

It was a sweatshirt for the football team we both like (she mentioned wanting one) so I got it for her, my buddy owns a place that sells stuff like that and gave me a deal. 

She loved it, and said thank you and gave me a big hug. 

I told my wife I got her it for her.... and she blew up. ‚ÄúHow could you ever give a gift to a woman who isn‚Äôt your wife or apart of your family, you‚Äôre married, its not your fucking job to be giving gifts to women you know because you‚Äôre married‚Äù

I asked if anyone was with her and she said no. I had my father come over and watch tv, basically come over Incase the kids woke up then went to the hospital.

1589,No A-holes here,"Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit because I'm kind of concerned about my roommate. She's a freshman and at the beginning of the year, I thought she was really quiet and she was in the room a lot (she plays video games and watches Netflix, primarily), but I thought she was otherwise fairly typical. However, I recently found out that she switched all her classes to online versions of the class and that she's been eating frozen meals instead of going to the dining halls. I was recently sick for a couple of days (so just went to classes that had tests for an hour/1.5 hour) and then went straight back to my dorm. I don't think she left the dorm the entire time.

I was going to give her more time, but she began to freak out, demand I let her live for free for ""at least"" 30 days, and call me names like ""fucking bitch"" repeatedly. She also told me she thought I was crazy and was very emotionally and verbally abusive. 

I called my property manager, who I have a good relationship with, and the manager suggested I give her a 24-hour notice. She was not a tenant, just a permitted occupant, and so it was easy and not illegal to do this.

She did not respond, and I was worried about my own safety, because she told me she was going to make the move ""as difficult for me as possible."" She then left the house and told me that she was going to have her dog take a big poop in the yard.

So I moved her stuff out into the living room, as it would be easier for her to move. I put her dishes in bubble wrap in boxes and her clothes in her suitcases/containers. I moved the stuff in the bathroom into boxes, too. I didn't go through any of it. 

Her father flew in from far away to move her stuff out, and he was enraged that I'd touched her stuff. She was enraged too, and began slamming a lot of doors and huffing (I was in my room.) They did not get everything out, and I did a civil standby today with police to make sure that I was safe.

I have been feeling awful about moving her stuff, and I wish I had not. Many of my friends told me I should have probably left it alone. However, another one said that, because she was so abusive towards me, it makes sense that I'd want to get her out as soon as possible.

1593,Not the A-hole,"I am a department manager and project manager for an engineering firm. I hired Tom a year ago. During the offer stage, Tom revealed to me that he had a sick child and that he needed one week in additional vacation. He told me that his daughter suffered from an acute illness four years ago and required an organ transplant and she successfully completed the surgery in 2016, but her health has been touch and go. I was impressed by his resume and skills and I made a case to offer him an additional one week vacation (total of five weeks per year).

During the year of his employment, Tom started taking sick days here and there. Then, it in addition to the odd sick day, he required an increasing amount of accommodations, including: leaving early to be home for the plumber; arriving late due to weather conditions; taking a longer lunch to visit the doctor; leaving at 2 pm on a Friday to pick up building material for a renovation project. The accommodations were so frequent that I proposed that he work from home 50% of the time so that he could manage his work- life balance.

Once I supplied him with the laptop, monitors and other equipment, Tom's illnesses did not decrease and during the year he took a full three weeks' worth of sick days. In addition, instead of working from home 50%, he started staying home on days that he was supposed to have been in the office (for group meetings and training).

While Tom was not under any obligation to share his health concerns with me, he did reveal that he was having heart palpitations. The medical information did not add up. One day he revealed to me that he suffered from heart palpitations that as per his doctors, put him at risk of a heart attack. But he also signed up for a full marathon, that required him to work from home for a full week due to torn muscles.

Reading in between the lines it appeared to me that Tom was suffering from anxiety due to his daughter's illness a few years prior. While I also learned that his daughter's illness was very serious, she was in fact in very stable condition and he never did require the additional week of vacation to care for her.

I tried to have a heart-to-heart with me saying that he needed to take control of his health but his behavior continued. The rest of the team had to constantly pick up where he left off. Tom often missed team meetings and client meetings while working from home and that meant that others had to work overtime.

His absence issue made it difficult for me to manage him and I ended up firing him. I fired without cause and I provided him with three weeks severance as per my company policy. I didn't feel I had any recourse because I could not compel someone who was calling him sick to show up. My friends who I confided in thought I was the asshole because I was not a mental health ally and my company does not have a cap of sick days. Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

\*\*\* 

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not qualified to diagnose anxiety but Tom did share with me (overshare at times) that he felt on edge all the time about his daughter's heart transplant failing or requiring a new transplant. She also has limitations on types of physical activity but does attend school full time. She will require another heart transplant in the next few years and Tom has shared with me that he is anxious about making her next few years the best he can because the first transplant almost didn't happen and recovery was so difficult.

I don't know what it's like to have a critically ill child but I am assuming that there's long-lasting effects on mental health and maybe he didn't have the coping skills.

1597,Asshole,"OK, so obviously I will describe the scenario in a biased view, just keep that in mind.

I was working for this company for several years, where there was a policy to give a part of company profit to the workers who worked there for at least two years. We were a few months away until the date when the bonus was usually paid and it was a good year financially, but at this time I had decided to swap jobs due to boring work assignments. Because I didn't want to miss out on the bonus, which was over $2000 last year, I stayed few months longer. When we were closing in to the payout date I had already signed up for a new job, at this time we had gotten no information if there were to be a bonus payment or not. I had no information on the bonus and we had passed the usual payout date, and I also had a three month notice period which couldn't overlap with the new job. Because of this I gave my notice the day before the winter holidays. The next day we got information about the bonus, and I learned I wouldn't get it.

Now this pissed me off quite a lot, and still does, as the bonus was based on previous efforts not future ones. I thought missing out for being one day off was petty and unfair, but my whining in email to the CEO (he decided on the bonuses) didn't help. I couldn't get over this, at first my plan was to do PR and morale damage to make up for it, but eventually came to my senses as that would have been unprofessional and potentially hurt me in the future. I decided to get the bonus myself instead.

While pettily working at half capacity over the next three months I would add half an hour or an hour every day to my time report, after a detailed calculation which would yield same amount of pay as the missed bonus. I'm not proud of this, it's actually the part which piss me off most about the bonus, as honesty is what I live by. I didn't even really need or care about the money, it was more about being treated unjustly. I realize they had no obligation to pay the bonus, and in the eyes of the law I'm wrong, but AITA here? Obviously I ask here with a throwaway as I will probably never tell anyone this in real life...

tl;dr; I quit my job one day too early, didn't get $2500 bonus, reported inflated time to make up for it, AITA?",31,57,0.87

1603,Not the A-hole,"This literally just happened and I'm still kinda ticked. For context, I'm an early 30s woman who lives with my boyfriend. I'm frequently home during the day while he's at work. The neighbours in question are backyard neighbours, so the back of their backyard runs along the side of our backyard. I hope that makes sense. 

Soo I was just getting ready to take a shower, was undressed under my housecoat and grabbing a towel from the linen closet when I heard knocking at my door, followed a minute later by the doorbell. I wasn't expecting anyone, and in my current state of undress I didn't feel comfortable answering the door, so I ignored it. 

I was about to head to the bathroom when I saw a couple people coming down the driveway. Halfway down the drive we have a gate that we keep shut, latched and locked whenever we're home. It's over 5 feet tall and super awkward to unlatch/unlock from the outside. So I watch their figures through the closed curtains walking up and down the drive a couple times until they give up and leave. 

I got dressed then because I was like, Wtf is going on? Not five minutes have gone by, when I open my front door and see no one, no cars. But I see the front gate was left opened. I go over to close it, because we keep all gates closed so that our dog can roam freely, and see that the back gate is still closed. 

So I head back inside when I hear a far-off *Helloooo?*. I've got pretty sensitive anxiety and it just spiked at this point. I head to the back door and see someone standing there. It took me a moment to figure out it was my neighbor. He was very jovial, told me he was trying to get a hold of me because they had the cable guy over and he wanted access to my backyard. I was like, ""Fine, whatever. Bye."" But he kept asking if something was wrong, and kept pressing me when I tried to go back inside. 

My dog ran out and with the gates being open I called him back inside, and my neighbour continued to press me if there was anything wrong. I snapped and said, ""Yes! I was getting in the shower and then there were people running all around the house. I didn't know what was going on.""

He got really offended and reiterated that they weren't *in* my house. I said, ""No, just letting yourself through a locked gate and coming to the back door instead of waiting at the front door and ringing the bell again."" I closed the door and he let himself back out the gate, and the cable guy never even came in the backyard. 

I'm feeling a bit jerky but also like, no. His wife came and left after ringing the bell. He then took it upon himself to come back, not even attempt to go to the front door, but let himself into the closed yard when I'm home by myself and hadn't answered at the front door? I'll take my judgement, either way. If I was wrong I'll bake some humble pie.",111,310,0.95

1615,Everyone Sucks,"So I guess I‚Äôve had WhatsApp on my phone for a while but totally forgot I even had the app. About a month ago I noticed a notification pop up for it, opened the app and there was a video message from some random guy. He obviously had the wrong number cause he was addressing a woman (I‚Äôm a dude). He went on for like 5 minutes, but it was really sweet - he really loves this woman and will do anything to be with her, will give up everything, and so on. I felt a little bad watching it  cause it was so personal, but I was curious ‚Äì you know you would have watched it too. My thought was that I should let him know he‚Äôs got the wrong number or username or whatever, but I was driving and just thought I‚Äôd deal with it later. Ok, so I forgot about it and later that night I check my phone and I have like 6 more messages from the dude and they are all these personal, lovestruck messages - the guys no Casanova but it‚Äôs charming and I‚Äôm sure any woman would appreciate his flattery. But I‚Äôm hanging with some friends and I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with this weird ass situation then, so I let it be and thought maybe he‚Äôd realize the number was wrong.

Nope. Three more messages the next morning, and he‚Äôs still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I‚Äôm like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they‚Äôve been viewed and now if I tell him it‚Äôs the wrong number he‚Äôll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn‚Äôt bother to tell him it was the wrong number. I was probably overthinking all of this, so I did decided to do nothing and hope he just figures out he‚Äôs got the wrong girl (guy).

Fast forward a month - I‚Äôm still getting messages from said dude, and now I feel like I absolutely can‚Äôt break the guy's heart that all his love has been for naught and yeah, I knew he had the wrong number all along. But his messages now are super sad: ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you call me?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave a done something wrong?‚Äù

AITA for letting this go on? I didn‚Äôt get us into this mess, and he seems not to conceive that apparently the only channel of communication he has with the love of his life, WhatsApp, is not effective. But I also don‚Äôt want to embarrass him and me, while making myself out as a douchebag. I guess I could just block him too. IDK, I feel like ITA in all of these situations...

TL;DR: Dude keeps sending me love messages thinking I‚Äôm someone else. I let it go on so long now it‚Äôll be really akward for both of us if I tell him he‚Äôs got the wrong number. Tell him, ignore it, or block him? I think ITA either way.",23,29,0.96

1619,UPDATE,"Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. 

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

1623,Everyone Sucks,"I'm on the mobile app. So I apologize for the text format.

So I've been living with my brother over a year now and I am moving out soon but me (22F) and him (19M) do not eat the same food. Before his girlfriend moved in he barely brought groceries and would eat out all the time but when he would get the midnight Munchies or after he got high he would go into the cupboards and look for my food to eat it. I tried offering solutions by cooking more for us or if he would slip me $20 extra I would even get his groceries for him. None of that worked so I restored it keeping certain food in my bedroom locked up and also keeping very healthy food in the fridge. Sometimes that would not have worked so then I would make him pay me money back for what he ate of my food. 

Now that his girlfriend lives with us, they buy groceries and I buy my own. The deal was not to eat each others food including friends that came over so I as a respectful human being and made sure all my friends know whether I'm there or not what food to eat if they get hungry because well they shouldn't eat my brothers food if they are not friends. My brother's friends in the past of ate my food and I've also made note of that pointed out so I thought this would change a little bit with his girlfriend living with us.

I went away this past weekend and well when I got back I noticed half my food was gone and my stuff was dranked. It pissed off and I yelled at them both because the food I buy a little more expensive while they buy Great Value food (Walmart). Their excuse was while we were asleep and we did not watch our friends to not eat your food and they brushed it off and did not care. I asked for the money worth and they didn't even respond. 

So I'm in control of the utilities and thought about raising their portion more to get my money back or just slowly take their food out randomly and waste the same amount? I know this seems petty, I'm just frustrated.",24,28,0.97

1626,Not the A-hole,"I realize the answer to the question is usually instant YTA but I think this might be an exception.

Everyone's 1st question will be ""are you a medical professional""? My answer to that is complicated. I am not a medical doctor and am not licensed to prescribe meds. However, I am a medical researcher at a top 10 medical school in the US. My specialty is actually in drug development. My knowledge is different than that of a medical Dr (deeper in some areas and more shallow in others). I've taken many of the MD classes and actually taught a few of them. Hopefully I've conveyed that while I'm not a medical doctor, I am certainly not giving my wife medical advice after reading webMD for a day.

My wife already takes 3 mental health meds, 1 being a controlled substance. This is great. These meds help her with her diagnosed issues. Today my wife was prescribed another controlled substance, a very addictive one, which is used to treat a condition that she does NOT have! She is not diagnosed with this condition and I see no evidence of her having symptoms of it. I am incredibly sketched out by this doctor for prescribing her this! Additional concerns: 

1) She has taken this med before recreationally. After taking it 3 consecutive days, she showed odd behavior - got unreasonably angry that she couldn't take it again. (her doc does not know this)

2) There is a history of addiction to this type of drug in her family. Her uncle died from an overdose of a different, more intense drug of this type (her doc does know this!). 

Given all of this, I strongly advised by wife against taking this medicine. I told her that if chooses to take the med, that I will only support that decision if she gets a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist... I very highly doubt another psych would agree to her taking this medicine. 

I think I'm in the right here but I know its generally bad to tell someone to not follow the advice of a medical doctor. Am AITA here?",109,267,0.94

1635,Everyone Sucks,"For a bit of backstory, I‚Äôll start there first.
I‚Äôve been working on a book for around 9 months by now, and before all of this I was best friends with a girl named Maggie.  I shared everything with her, from secrets to school documents.  She was relatively strong in English so I entrusted her with editing my school stories and essays (we were friends for around 2 years at this point).  
Fast forward a few months (around February) and we make plans to hang out.  I go out with my mom, thinking there‚Äôs time before we come back, but we end up getting home around 3pm, 3 hours after we intended.  I pulled my phone out of my coat pocket (3 layer parka, it gets really cold in canada) and see I have 7 missed calls and texts from Maggie.  I message her to apologize, but she leaves me on read.  
Monday comes around and I check my novel, and all of it, I mean *all of it* is gone.  I had 10k words, and she deleted all of it.  Obviously, I was pissed, and sent her a message (we went to different schools) asking her why she did it.  She apologized, and we ended all contact that day.  Now, fall back to last week.  I log on to finish a science paper and realize I still have access to her story (she wrote this one for fun, while I intended to publish mine), and realize her word count.  12786.  I himed and hawed for a solid 5 minutes before pressing I Alt-A and deleting it all.  Now, I know it sounds kinda extreme, but here‚Äôs a few things she‚Äôs done to me;
- Constantly put down my cosplays, which I always worked really hard on
- Caused my ED by telling me I was fat on multiple occasions 
- Manipulated me into thinking I was the root of all her problems 
- Harrased me at a convention by yelling gay slurs at me (I‚Äôm a lesbian)
- Stole MY HARD EARNED MONEY
- Broke my computer
- Harassed my friends by calling them names, stealing from them and ruining their work

So, Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: I couldn‚Äôt back up my story because I used Office365 on my school account.  We aren‚Äôt friends anymore either.  I believe she is the root of my ED as she would constantly compare my weight to hers, tell me that I shouldn‚Äôt eat what I was eating and was always talking about how little she ate, which made me feel terrible because I used to look up to her.  I didn‚Äôt ghost her, either.  We had made plans, but I never gave the OK for her to come over to my place.  Also, whenever I told her I didn‚Äôt want to friends anymore, she would threaten to tell everyone the secrets I told her.  That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt leave.  Thanks!

1636,Not the A-hole,"Fianc√© (F32) was having trouble with her 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee. After a series of failed repairs, we decided it was best for her to look for a new car. She had been having trouble with it for years.

She asked me (M30) for help. We did our own  hunting to narrow down options. I found reliable small SUVs in our area. I found serviceable Hondas and Toyotas in the $10,000-$13,000 range. They had low miles on them and were in good shape, likely to last a long time.

We presented our lists. Her list consisted entirely of Jeeps, starting around $22,000 up to $30,000. She said that they were ""so ugly"" and that she wouldn't drive them. She was also upset by the price range. She insisted that she didn't want to buy a ""piece of shit"" and that she could afford to get a ""nicer"" vehicle.

I protested her choices and said I didn't understand why she would pick out Jeeps after the trouble she had with her Grand Cherokee. She said that she ""just likes"" Jeeps and that is what she wants to buy. I mentioned the reliability issues but she blamed them on the car being old.

I asked her to write down a list of ""must-haves"":

* must be a Jeep Cherokee; preferably Grand Cherokee
* must be black
* must have a V6
* cannot be a ""fake"" Jeep like a Latitude or Compass
* less than 40k miles

She refused to test drive anything if it didn't match ALL of her needs. She was being stubborn.

A week later, she goes out to lunch with her mom. She came home and said she went to test drive a Jeep and ""fell in love"". It was $27,000. I told her we couldn't afford it and she said she planned to put $8k down. I explained that $19k was a lot to finance.

She called the dealership later and it sold. But there was a 2015 Jeep Cherokee that she wanted to try out that was less expensive. I went with her and she decided that was the car she wanted. I tried to talk her out of it but I acquiesced and she bought it.

Since December 2018, she has had problems with it. The first issues happened within her warranty. However, she has had problems since the warranty has lapsed and it's cost her some money to repair. She has been a victim of the ""Service Shifter"" light going on. Apparently, lots of people have had this problem. I told her she should contact the dealership to take a look at it, and asked her to give me her VIN so I can see if there has been any recalls.

She said that she ""no longer feels safe"" driving the car and wants a new car. I told her she was overreacting and that we would get it fixed and keep it on the road since it has 50k miles on it. She told me she was ""done"" with this Cherokee.

She emailed me a bunch of links to cars she ""wants to look at"" and **THEY'RE ALL JEEP FUCKING CHEROKEES.**

I replied by telling her that I don't want to be a part of this search, or the buying process if it's going to be the same as last time. I told her that if she insists on buying another Jeep, I will not be a part of it.

Am I the asshole for not supporting her?",237,692,0.96

1638,Asshole,"I belong to a local gym in my city. It‚Äôs one of the biggest gyms in the area so the parking lot is huge; they even have a security guard in a golf cart that circles around during their hours of operation. The parking lot has the front of row dedicated to handicapped parking only (20 spots) and off to the side of the building they have a section for ‚Äúfamilies with children‚Äù spots (8 spots). Both areas park along the sidewalk so you don‚Äôt have to cross the parking lot. Past the FwC (Families with Children) spots‚Äîbut still along the side walk‚Äîthere are additional spots that aren‚Äôt allocated towards any specific person. 

I take my little one to the gym with me every morning because they offer childcare while I exercise; we arrive there as soon as the childcare opens, the same time everyday. Usually, I try to park in the FwC spots because I don‚Äôt like crossing the parking lot with an infant, but if they‚Äôre all full I‚Äôll just park past them in the additional spots along the sidewalk. The drivers in my area are awful and there‚Äôs tons of accidents; I‚Äôve personal been hit by a person backing out of a parking spot because they didn‚Äôt look in their mirrors before pulling out (I was on foot). 

One morning I noticed an older woman parking in one of the FwC spots without a child. She had a handicapped tag hanging from her mirror and I noticed all of the handicapped spots were occupied. I personally don‚Äôt think just because her dedicated spot was taken that she is entitled to take someone else‚Äôs spot, but she‚Äôs handicapped and I don‚Äôt know why she may need to park closer to the door so I let it go. I‚Äôve seen this woman park in the FwC area every day for the past month or so and I‚Äôve also seen other parents have to park elsewhere with multiple children in tow. 

Today, I see her park there again and go inside. I‚Äôm not too far behind her, but I stop into the childcare area to drop off my baby. I get into the gym and start my workout and see that woman on the treadmill walking at a brisk pace. She stayed on that treadmill for the ENTIRE HOUR I was there! So she doesn‚Äôt truly need a closer spot at all, she‚Äôs just being entitled. This made me so annoyed that she continues to park in a place that someone else needs just because she feels entitled to do so; it also annoys me that the security guard isn‚Äôt telling her to move. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs not the only person to use those spots, but she‚Äôs the one person I notice everyday abuse them. 


Would I be an asshole to mention her parking there to the staff or even the security guard? I‚Äôd never confront her personally (although I‚Äôve been tempted) as it is not my job to enforce their rules, but I want her to stop using those spots.


ETA: 20 minutes after posting and I‚Äôve been dubbed YTA, and I completely agree. For the past month, I‚Äôve let it go that she parks there because it‚Äôs not an inconvenience to me personally, as I‚Äôve previously mentioned I just park elsewhere. I assumed she needed to be a few spots closer to the entrance. I guess what got me today was watching her briskly walk on the treadmill for an hour, which kinda indicates to me that she can probably park two spots over out of the FwC spots. I don‚Äôt want to be a tattle-tail or snitch, and I don‚Äôt want to point the finger directly at her‚Äî I‚Äôm sure other people park there too without children. I really wanted to complain to the staff that the guard isn‚Äôt enforcing the parking signs, but a commenter suggested I put in a request for the gym to offer more spots for disabled and FwC which is a much better solution for both parties.




ETA2: TBH, I‚Äôd probably never say anything about this situation. I‚Äôd never confront her or the staff about it. I‚Äôd just continue to park wherever and go on about my day. The thought of snitching came into my head and I know it‚Äôs an asshole move, but I needed it to be reinforced by others that it‚Äôs the asshole move so I can shut down those thoughts. Thanks to everyone for helping me. :)


CLOSING THOUGHTS: Thank you to everyone that helped me through this mental judgement I had today. I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about disabled people and actually looked into my local laws. I would be 100% in the wrong to complain to the gym about her parking in any spot, even if it inconveniences abled parents like myself. I also now know I need to learn to have more compassion for others to set a better example for my child and to also have a better outlook on life. 

Also, because people were curious, I live in Florida where everyone retires so everywhere you go there‚Äôs plenty of disabled parking spots.",171,191,0.8
1639,Asshole,"GF, who lives with me, texts me at 4pm yesterday and reminds me that when I pick up my son, to make sure I get the ice pack(s) that go with his lunch box. His mother always keeps things I buy, and we're on like the 4th ice pack for him. It annoys me, but they're like .97 cents at Wal-Mart so I don't let it bother me too much. I work hard all day and it's usually a 10-15 minute ordeal getting my son ready to leave his mother's house. He's six, with high functioning Aspergers. Sometimes it's just not easy getting him ready to come to my house. 

&#x200B;

Soon as I get over to his mom's house, my son snatches my phone away to talk to my GF and her daughter...  then runs to the bathroom and locks the door. I forget all about the ice pack and work on getting in the bathroom before he decides it's funny to pee on the phone with them on Facetime or show them his privates.  I get home, my GF makes a few snarky comments about me forgetting. Which I always forget things, so I guess it's deserved.

&#x200B;

I figure I'll just zip-lock bag a couple of bags of ice for his lunch box, and that'll have to suffice until I remember to get his back, or go buy more. I wasn't going to use her daughter's (seven) ice packs because I didn't want to forget those too and her daughter go without. ( I normally make her daughter's school lunch in the morning, so I know where we keep her ice packs. She didn't go to school this week because she's been sick. So she didn't need them.) 

&#x200B;

I open the freezer to get ice for the zip lock bags, and I see that my GF has taken her daughter's ice packs out and hidden them. This bothers me a lot. I feel like she didn't care if my son went without something just because of my mistake. I should have remembered, but we're supposed to treat our kids as equals I don't feel like she would ever let her daughter go without because of a mistake I made. 

&#x200B;

So I waited till she texted me to let me know she was awake and I asked if she hid the ice packs. I told her I wasn't even going to use them, but it hurts my feelings that she doesn't care enough about my son that she would make an effort to hide something that he could have used. 

&#x200B;

This. Set. Her. Off. Full rage of how it's completely my fault to forget that regardless of her hiding her daughter's ice packs, it's me letting my son go without because of my negligence. Reminding me how hard a time I can have with him in the mornings getting him ready for school and how I'm always forgetting something and it doesn't seem like I can handle my own son. 

&#x200B;

So I told her to stop and think about how she's acting because I was only trying to communicate how that made me feel to see she hid them. She reiterates that she's pissed off at me for suggesting she doesn't care about my son, and again, how everything is completely my fault.

1640,No A-holes here,"My mom and dad got a divorce when I was like 8 and my dad wanted nothing to do with either of us so I haven't seen him since. Until I was about 10 it was me and my mom living in a 2 bedroom apartment.  When I was 11 tho my mom and this guy really hit it off and had serious talks of engagement, I was happy my mom was so happy but a little part of me was kinda scared for how this guy would act around me.  He has a daughter 1 year older than me (so that made her 12).  They were both pretty nice, me and the girl didn't hit it off right away, we didn't have a lot in common and would bicker sometimes.  My mom and her dad were great at stopped that before it went to far tho.  Her step dad was/is really really nice to me and I am happy my mom found love again.  When I was 12 they got married and within the next month we all moved in together.  I wasn't looking forward to moving in cause I didn't really like them, I just kinda tolerated them.  

When we all moved in, it was nice to have an actual house for once and I know my mom was happy.  Don't get me wrong both are great people, and I came to really like them both and other than small disputes and arguments with my step sister there never was any conflicts, I just didn't really consider either family and more like roommates.  I think she felt the same way and when I turned 14 and she was 15 we really just started to ignore each other, sure we talked but it was so sporadic and in between I felt like I was living with a stranger.  We are both very sociable people and leave the house a lot, and every time we did my mom or her dad would say to us ""why don't you have your BROTHER tag along"" or ""how come you never invite your SISTER with you?"" it gets very annoying.  I am now 17 and she is 18, she has like a month left before she moves to college.  I am happy for her but I don't feel anything and don't feel a need to hang out with her.  This happened last sunday, I was gonna go over to my friends house and yet again my mom said ""why don't you invite your sister?"" at this point I just had it and told her ""I don't consider her family and she doesn't consider ME family, I don't hate her but I have no interest in getting close with her"".  My mom seemed kinda sad by that and left, I ended up going to my friends place.  Me and my mom have yet to speak again about this, I feel bad but I feel like it needed to be said.

He turned to drugs and alcohol and began harassing and abusing my mother, eventually leading to her getting a restraining order. About a year after that, my mother met her now husband. When my step dad decided he wanted to adopt me, my bio dad agreed to give up his parental rights as long as my mom no longer pursued him for back pay in child support, and so long as he was allowed to send me gifts every now and again. I never received so much as a birthday card, and did not hear from him my entire childhood.

My biological dad is a stranger, and the only memories I have of him aren't good ones. I made it clear to him I'm just fine without him and don't want to set myself up for anymore hurt by letting him back into my life.

He and a few people on his side of the family have been trying to guilt trip me into trying to build a relationship with him since he doesn't know how much time he has left. I have no desire to do that, but also can't help feeling like maybe I'm being too harsh.

1642,Not the A-hole,"Long story (gonna try to make it short)

2 years ago I cosigned a lease with 4 friends (student housing) and the lease was for 2 years. At the time I was dating one of my roommates and that relationship ended at the end of last school year. The lease agreement says we have to pay rent in postdated cheques 12 at a time which we all agreed to. Since my landlord didn't want to deposit 5 cheques, she asked for only one and everyone else pays to the roommate paying the landlord. Since she's chinese and doesnt speak very good english, i volunteered to be the main person she contacts (im chinese and everyone else in the house is white). So for the past year I've been paying the landlord and everyone else has been paying me. This year, my ex decided that he didn't want to pay me in post dated cheques because he no longer trusts me. I've asked multiple times since this is how everyone else pays the rent and itll be more complicated that he's just deciding he wants to pay his own way. I already gave the landlord all the cheques for the whole year for the rent for the whole house. Now it's almost october and i've texted him asking for rent cheques again and he completely ignored me. WIBTA if i asked for all my cheques back from the landlord, subtracted his amount, rewrote them and made him figure out his own way to pay rent to the landlord directly without telling him? he's barely talking to me and I'm ok paying for everyone else since they're cooperating but I don't want to be responsible for chasing my ex for rent anymore",41,88,0.9

1644,Not the A-hole,"Okay to start im a 18yo male. Currently im in university following a programming course. We have to make weekly assignments which will count to your final mark. These assignments are graded on your outcome, and whether you follow the style of the uni (4 spaces etc). These assignments have to be made in pairs.

So i paired up with someone, and during the first assignment i got the problem to work, and he immidiately started to complain that it could be more efficient. Now enter 2-3 hours of more coding because our code had to be more efficient. (Efficiency is NOT in the rubric and wont be taken into account).

Enter week 2, we went through this more smoothly, but this week we got the results and we made a small mistake, no biggy, we have an 8.5/10. He now wants to talk to the professor, and send emails (while our code just doesnt work). I said no and got kind of annoyed, people have better things to do you know.

Enter week 4, we have to make something which prints the output of our program, im done after 15 mins (for which he was still reading the assignment and talking on facebook) and he looks at my code and says, ""it can be more efficient"". I say okay sure, but it works and we are not graded on efficiency. Anyways i give him 15 mins (i wanted to take a short break anyways) where he makes code  on my laptop. After 15 minutes his code is still a mess which wont work, and i want to continue with the difficult part of the assignment. So i tell him we should take my code and just continue. He says no, so i get annoyed since he is using my laptop, i woulnt mind him doing it on his laptop while i continue. So i tell him that im going to use my code, and send his code to him. I will admit this was in a bitchy tone aftet going back and forth for 5 minutes. After that he spend 4 hours sitting doing something on his code (which still isnt finished after 4 hours) and he was also using facebook. He wont talk properly to me even when i engage with him, to ask how he is doing with his thing. 

Just before he leaves i tell him he can finish the last bit of code 1/4 of the project. He says yes and leaves.

1645,Not the A-hole,"Hello, this just happened last nigh, and I want some input. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done anything bad, but I‚Äôve been wrong about that before so I‚Äôd like your unrelenting input. 

I work 70-90 hours a week. I have one full time job as an assistant manager for a small but very profitable grocery store, and a part time job working the front desk of a hotel overnight about 3 nights a week. My schedule is killing me, I never get anything resembling decent sleep as many days I close the store down, which means getting to work at noon and going until 11, sometimes without a chance to even eat, and then immediately drive to my other job, work until 7, go home, take of the dog and baby until my wife wakes up, usually around 10/10:30. I then hop in the shower get about an hour of sleep and do it all over again. 

On the nights I don‚Äôt work at the hotel, I have the job of waking up with the baby when she gets hungry/needs a change in the middle of the night, that way my wife can have a few nights off. She‚Äôs a photographer so she can work and stay home with the baby at the same time, though when I get an afternoon off, I‚Äôm more than happy to take the baby off her hands so she can work or relax or whatever she‚Äôd like to do. We split chores evenly. 

Last night I ended up at work until after midnight and got home around 1 o‚Äôclock. Wife and dog were already asleep and the baby was just waking up. I quickly made her a bottle, changed her diaper and fed her. The previous 2 night I worked at the hotel so I was running on roughly 1.5 hours of sleep. After feeding and burping the baby was still up so I walked her around a bit. That wasn‚Äôt working and she was still awake and fussy any time I stopped moving. So I set her in her bouncing chair so she could get some energy out. While waiting for to tucker herself out I ended up passing out on the couch in my work clothes. 

I was awakened by my wife at 7, yelling at me for falling asleep out there with the baby, would was also snoozing away at that moment. She called me ‚Äúworst father‚Äù and ‚Äúdumbest father‚Äù and stormed off. I certainly didn‚Äôt mean to fall asleep out there, it just happened by accident, but she wouldn‚Äôt hear it. So, Reddit, AITA?

Edit/update: Just received a voicemail from my wife apologizing for the words she said. She reiterated her worry for the baby‚Äôs welfare but admitted that she crossed a line with how she said it.

I was positive obviously. He swore he didn‚Äôt have it before so I figured it must have been from my ex, who I dated 6 months prior.

1649,Asshole,"I work in a 14 story building. There was a fire alarm that was clearly not a test (multiple people said smoke was coming out of the 1st floor). I went down the stairwell and held open the door on the ground floor door. Someone on their way down said there was a man on the 6th floor in a wheel chair. I dropped my backpack against the door along with a OneWheel and went up to the 6th floor. The guy was totally calm and had a coworker (that was incapable of carrying him) with him, so we just held there while I called 911. 911 said they'd send up a fire fighter. Instead, a security guard came up, who in his own words was ""completely out of shape"". He would not be capable of carrying the man if that became necessary. Fortunately, the Fire Fighters took care of the problem and the alarm stopped without us needing to leave, but almost everyone else in the building had evacuated at this point. I went back down to the ground floor to grab my bag and board. When I went around to the elevators there was a long line. I was stopped by the manager of the building and he scolded me for propping the door open. I explained there was a stream of people coming down the stairs and I only left because I needed to check on the guy on 6. He said they'd ""seen my backpack in a door way before"". wft? I started in this building a week ago, how many fires have you had? He said ""you need to realize you can't leave a backpack in a stairwell"".

1650,Not the A-hole,"To start things off, I don‚Äôt think his emotional support dog is legit. I don‚Äôt know the process for getting one or what the requirements are so I could be wrong but from my understanding all he did was fill out a form online, print a certificate and bought a ESA vest from Amazon. He brings his dog with him everywhere but it‚Äôs not trained at all. It barks at people, pisses everywhere and barely listens to any command. When he brings it over his dog pisses on my floor even after being outside, gets slobber all over the floor after drinking, barks/lunges at the tv, barks when there‚Äôs a noise outside (I live in San Francisco, noise is non stop), he‚Äôs pooped a couple times but that‚Äôs a rare occurrence thankfully and when we order food he shares his food with the dog and gets crumbs all over. 

I tried to be understanding that he needs the dog but the more I‚Äôm around it the more I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs no way this dog could be legitimately certified as a support animal. He claims his doctor certified he could get one and as I said I could be wrong since I don‚Äôt know the process for getting one or registering one but his dog is not behaved enough in my opinion. I told him we can hang out but he can‚Äôt bring that dog with him, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs inside or left outside. Cars and people are constantly going by so the barking is very annoying. He got pissed off and pulled up something on his phone trying to say he‚Äôs allowed to bring the dog wherever he wants, it‚Äôs not safe for him to be without his dog and everything under the sun. I told him tough luck, that dog is not welcomed on my property under any circumstances. 

An hour later he sends me a picture of a letter supposedly from his doctor certifying he needs a support animal and outlining how support animals work. I said I don‚Äôt care what his doctor said or what the ESA website says, that dog is not coming in my house until he at the very least potty trains it.

I‚Äôm a junior in high school and still live with them, and this is the most sad/mad I‚Äôve ever been at them. The anger started at the beginning of the year when my parents made the deal with me that if I get a job, then they‚Äôll get me a car. As the summer went on details began to smudge as they bent their own promise. It started as anything economical and under $30,000. I was ecstatic, thinking I would get a super nice car and I was happy. Them bending their own rules being that they gradually told me I had to pay for all repairs, which was fine, and all my gas, which is also fine, then the insurance, that crossed the line a little bit in terms of a promise but I was willing to compromise at half, and then it became that I could get a $20,000 car, and I had to pay half, and then it went down to $10,000 with me paying half as well, and now it‚Äôs at $0. I was furious with how they were changing the rules, and told them it was unfair, to which their reply was: ‚Äúour house, our rules‚Äù.

So I spent the good part of 2 hours cleaning, and when I was finally done, she told me she wouldn‚Äôt buy them since my grandmother helped.

Again, I was mad, so I asked her if I could upgrade too, since my phone is actually damaged, to which she replied I could have her free upgrade (which opens in 3 months right around Christmas) and said it would be a good Christmas gift. The way our phone plan works is the free upgrade covers the initial cost of the phone, and the upgrade only increases the plan $4 a month. AITA for being mad at my mom?

1654,Not the A-hole,"for some background my moms birthday was in early september and my dads gift to her was them going on a trip for a weekend... they planned for this weekend (which already irritated me a bit because we had plans to tour a college which both of them knew about long before this) they planned for my grandpa and his girlfriend to come down for the weekend and keep an eye on us because i have three young siblings. We‚Äôre pretty self sufficient except my youngest sister who‚Äôs 4 so i thought I would pretty much be able to go about my normal activities, but two days ago my dad was talking to me and revealed that he expected me to help beyond the normal level i was expecting. He‚Äôs expecting me to play with her, keep her entertained, put her to bed, and basically forfeit all plans for the weekend. This probably doesn‚Äôt seem like that big of a deal but i‚Äôm a senior in high school and have a part time job that keeps me out of the house from 7 in the morning to 6 at night. Add in that I have a pretty standard amount of homework and i‚Äôm also expected to walk the dogs 2 miles every day and you can see that the weekend is really my only free time and the only thing keeping me from burning out. i expressed this to my mom in what i thought was a calm, reasonable way and she completely guilt tripped me saying that what i‚Äôm complaining about is what she does every day and she never gets to go on vacation. I point out that she isn‚Äôt going to school, doesn‚Äôt work, and all of us are in school. I get that she does a lot of work and i‚Äôm very grateful to her but she really underplays how stressful school can be, basically invalidating all of my complaints. The way i see it she chose to have kids. i love my siblings but personally i‚Äôve never wanted children of my own so why should i be expected to basically parent one of them for the weekend. I feel like i help out an appropriate amount: i babysit for appointments or errands for free and get payed for babysitting on date nights. On top of all of this i‚Äôm sick (nothing bad just a cold but i still don‚Äôt feel great) i feel a bit bad and i do think my parents should be able to go out for a weekend but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs at all fair to push this onto me?? so aita or nah

Update: for those saying that high school isn‚Äôt that hard and should be able to handle it- not everyone is the same. People‚Äôs situations are different. I suffer from depression and anxiety along with ADHD and i absolutely love school and have always enjoyed it but it‚Äôs incredibly overwhelming. I was also hospitalized twice through the last two years so it‚Äôs an adjustment that i‚Äôm still working through along with therapy twice a week. Every school week feels like a sprint and the weekend is when i finally get to rest. i‚Äôm not trying to use my situation as an excuse but to the commenter who said they‚Äôre taking AP classes along with marching band and i should be able to handle it- you need to understand that just because you‚Äôre able to handle something doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is. You need to think beyond yourself and understand that not everyone is able to take on the amount that you are. I think it‚Äôs incredible that you‚Äôre able to manage so much and I wish you luck

My wife recently gave birth to twins. She got released 5 weeks ago. We just began to have sex again. Its definitely different for both of us. She still has all of these hormones, and she is cranky because she does take care of our children a bit more.

 
Flash Forward to yesterday. After having sex, she starts to doubt herself. Saying that she's not good enough. That I could go for someone better. I comfort her, and then this culminates to me calling her a MILF. I said ""Hey, I have a thing for MILFS"". She then started to cry and left to the guest bedroom. 
 
I decided not to bother her. Around midnight, the twins wake up, and I go check on them. After I'm done with them, I go check on n my wife. She calls me an asshole for calling her a MILF. I apologize again. Today morning she said that again.

She ended up giving it all to her friend who was newly married. I didn't find out until last week when it was my birthday and I asked her if she'd put it on for me again. I was a little hurt because a) it was an expensive gift, relatively speaking, and b) I don't know about anyone else, but it's kind of weird to give that to someone, right? It's something intimate between my wife and I and it just gave me the heebies, to be frank, that another woman was now wearing it.

Maybe it's a faux-pas but I asked her friend to return it to me so I could get rid of it. I explained the situation as I have here and was immediately blocked on Facebook. She told mutual friends who all think I'm some sexual deviant asking for a woman's unmentionables.

She‚Äôs been acting kind of weird all night, but not really drunk, more just awkward. She‚Äôd had about 4 shots and was seemingly sober when she came to me and said that she was acting weird because she could blame it on the alcohol and I didn‚Äôt really mind the statement since she wasn‚Äôt really whoring herself out for attention or anything, just being goofy.

She gets served a full glass of vodka but finished maybe a third and starts getting emotional. I laugh (mostly because I‚Äôve had some to drink and I knew she would be embarrassed the next day). She starts crying and just letting loose so much about her life. She‚Äôs frustrated about a lot of things like her grandparents health and a crush she has. She was also stressed because she thought I was mad at her (I wasn‚Äôt, just sick at texting and getting back to people if they don‚Äôt really attempt to talk to me).

It gets to the point where we take her for a drive around town so she could get some fresh air and she begins to break down HEAVY. She‚Äôs sobbing and venting about things but quickly starts talking about how much the people in the car mean to her. 

It‚Äôs just my other friend Lily and her boyfriend Rob, but she starts talking about how Lily is such a good friend to her and how Rob (who she‚Äôd met for the first time an hour earlier) was one of her good friends and how she hoped he wanted to be her friend. The part where I got unnerved was she said nothing about me.

I know that might sound selfish and conceited but I‚Äôve always agreed with ‚Äúdrunk words are sober thoughts‚Äù and I guess it just made me think that my friendship with her didn‚Äôt really matter that much to her. I was in the backseat with her and with her during the party, watching out for her and making sure she was fine. I was crying with her in the car when she was breaking down because I truly felt for her situation and I felt horribly, while Lily and Rob were laughing at her.

I have gradually gotten sick of accomodating for her as last time I took her somewhere she told me she'd be 15 mins, turned out to be closer to 1hr - resulting in me having being late for work. We had a small argument which resulted in me telling her I would not drive her around anymore as it wasn't my responsibility.

Tonight she approached me at 8pm asking me to drive her to a local restaurant - I refused. My parents then paid for her to Uber to the restaurant (even though she works part time and has the money) as they'd been drinking and were unable to drive. They said I was lazy and rude not to take her as it's my responsibility to ""do good"" for others where I can.

I believe its not their responsibility to taxi my 18y/o sister around - let alone mine. They feel that they're obliged to take her wherever she needs to go, and when they're unavailable that obligation falls to me. They said I wasn't busy doing anything important (I was playing video games) but I personally feel like that is irrelevant .

1674,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster. Had to make an alt, for reasons.

**Background**: My GF and I are in our 40's. Both of us have had plenty of sex, relationships and life experiences before we met each other. We've been together for a year and during that time have traveled around the world and have had an exquisite romance. Although at the moment I'm having doubts.

**Situation**: Ever since the beginning of our relationship I have always felt I have had to share her with her boss. We talk(ed) about him a lot because you know, work. He's a megalomaniac. I have always felt he singles her out unnecessarily in the office, and out.

Witnessing their arguments and conversations, I often commented to her about how they seemed like an old married couple, but she would dismiss this and play it down. Being the ""mature"" confident man I am, I tried to respect her privacy. But something always bugged me about them.

A few months ago we got into an argument and I blurted out ""Did you sleep with me to get back at your boss""? Her reaction was completely unexpected. She gasped and seemed like she didn't know what to say. After 30mins, she just apologized about the original disagreement, but didn't address what I said. Things were fine. Until yesterday.

**Climax**: Last night we were having another conversation about work, and after we hung up the phone, she texted me saying we probably shouldn't talk about work anymore. She said I was too negative towards her boss. I tried to explain that I was just being honest about how I thought her boss was treating her; talking negatively about her to other managers and undermining her authority. This escalated into her defending him more and more, and finally I couldn't take it anymore so I again blurted out, ""**So tell me the truth, have you** ***f\*\*\*\*\*d*** **him**?"" After a brief pause she finally ""**Yes! I did!**""

So I finally had my answer! I knew it all along! I proved to myself that I wasn't just crazy with jealousy, I wasn't imagining shit, I wasn't stupid, or was I?

This of course led the conversation/argument into a different dimension. My most basic instincts(?) came out and I needed *details*.

Did you love him? No? Just casual? Were you in a relationship? No? Then why? Because, why not??? How long ago? 5 years? How many times? Was it to get ahead at work? Maybe? Was he good? I'm better? Suuuuure. I'm sure you can fill in rest.

**Conclusion**: She says she was trying to protect me by not telling me she slept with him, even though I had asked her a few times before. She knew I had been toiling over this issue for a while.  I feel betrayed that she didn't tell me sooner. It wasn't and isn't a deal breaker, what's the past is in the past; I'm no saint. But AITA for feeling that she betrayed me?",143,151,0.92

The kids are 8 (M) and 9 (M) years old. 2 days ago the maid locked on of the kids in a room because he was not behaving well. In my opinion that is unacceptable. That should not be how you treat kids even in punishment. Later that day the maid threw the towel, aka quit. Now they don't have anyone to look after the kids. The next day the mother asked me to babysit the kids in a week or so for about 4 hours. I (17M) have done some babysitting in the past but always with kids that behaved and were easy to handle. But these two kids were a little different. They were trouble makers and I don't want to spend my Friday evening looking after screaming kids.

1679,Everyone Sucks,"My wife (29F) and I (31M) are both in school. We usually work on our homework in the evenings after our kids are in bed. We each have our own desks that are situated across the main floor from each other. This semester my wife is in two classes that require a lot of writing, and she often wants me to proof read her stuff and verify cohesion and adherence to the rubric etc, I have an upper division math class and a programming class.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For the record, I don't have any problem reading and commenting on her stuff, the problem we are having is HOW she wants me to do it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She wants me to get up from my desk, and sit at her computer to read her stuff. Personally I find this arrangement super annoying because she could just send it to me via email and let me read it at my desk. If she sent it to me it would be less disruptive to my work flow, not to mention I have a larger more accommodating screen (because I am not on a laptop), and I am often already comfortable in my chair. It is also hard for me to change gears from math, to English, and then  jump back into math (or programming).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tonight she asked me to read her paper, and I asked her to send it to me. She refused and insisted that I just come over and read it. I asked why she can't just send it to me and she said ""It's only two paragraphs, why can't you just come read it?"". I explained that I would rather read it at my computer. She said I was just being stubborn and didn't understand why I wouldn't help her. I told her that I was perfectly willing to read her stuff, but felt that if she wanted my help it seemed reasonable to at least let me help her on my terms. She stated that forcing her to email the stuff to me was ""getting everything my way"", to which I replied ""isn't that exactly what forcing me to sit at your desk is? It is you asking for my help and only accepting it if I do it under your exact instructions. I don't see why I have to disrupt all of my stuff and relocate just so you can get some feedback, to me that expectation is far more selfish than asking that you just email me what you have."" She said ""if you want to read it at your desk so badly why don't you come over and send it to yourself.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This went on for a bit and she kept returning to ""you don't have a good reason not to come to my desk,"" and I kept saying ""I don't think you have a very good reason to not just email me your paper, even if it is 2 paragraphs. If you want my help meet me half way!"" She threw he hands up and said ""fine I guess you just won't help me and I will fail the class."" I thought this was childish, and said ""if you are going to act like this about it then,  I guess I won't help you anymore unless your attitude changes.""

&#x200B;

Edit: since it would not let me post more than 3000 characters, I had to whittle it down a bit. Basically this is not the first time we have had this conversation. She insists that the only way for me to help her is to sit at her desk to do it. Also worth noting is that on the occasions when I do sit at her desk to read, she gets up to do something else to kill time until I'm done reading.


Second edit: there are lots of comments suggesting google docs or a network folder. To her these are the same as emailing so they are probably out of the question even if they are good ideas. Additionally, this is not an issue of me being lazy and unwilling to move, I do that frequently. That stance is, at very least, an over simplification of what is happening. I dont know why this escalated the way it did and I know it is stupid and childish but she seems to be set in her demand that I stop what I am doing, get up, and sit in her chair to read her stuff.",575,1438,0.96

1681,Not the A-hole,"So, me and my fianc√© lived together for the past 5 years and we were engaged for 3 months before she got an amazing job offer in another country. It was temporary (6 months with possible 2 extra).
We have a ton of stuff together, including car, furniture and a cat (hers).

Two months into her job she started finding a bunch of excuses and saying I didn‚Äôt care about her and was jealous that she went. She broke up with me out of nowhere a few weeks later saying she wanted to go out with other people over there.

So fast forward 5 months. We talked every now and then but nothing much. The deadline of her day back was approaching so I started to make plans to move out. I have been living in our place with all of her stuff and it feels weird, feels like I am just waiting for her.

So I am planning to get everything in order... give back her stuff (or store it), transfer the car and give her the cat, etc.
Howeveeeeeeeeeer... she got another 8-month extension on the contract, so she is staying there. And the place she is at doesn‚Äôt allow cats.

Her health and the baby's health were excellent during checkins so in came flowing the gifts which was her idea. She made a list, gave it to family, and we all went to town.

We bought her a crib ($1200) and some baby clothes (about $200) in preparation. She also received other gifts from other family members.

She decided to terminate the pregnancy because her boyfriend left her after an argument. He's not involved with her anymore. This is her exact reasoning and politics aside, she doesn't even need a reason. Free country, etc. But...

We told her to return the baby items to us and she refused, saying she'll use them one day. Sure, but we can just get it back for you then. This is holding our money hostage. She still refused so we asked to be reimbursed at which she also refused.

Trying to defuse the situation, we then said that this is her birthday and Christmas present for the year and she was none too happy. Knowing we're now dealing with a brat, we let it be and aren't associating with her for now.

This caused a cacophony of chaos in the family with many upset with her and many supporting her. Never upset because she had the termination, but because she requested all of these things when she wasn't 100% sure she'd keep the pregnancy.

1686,Asshole,"Hello, first time poster and my grammar is terrible.

Now then, this was about a year ago; I was a college sophomore with a freshman roommate. We got along, okay. We didn't hate each other but we were barely friends as we had different interests. Anyway I have a refrigerator/microwave  set in our dorm room. It doesn't come with the dorm room so it's mine technically but I barely use it, so I told my roommate he could use it.

&#x200B;

Anyway onto the story; me and my roommate (who I shall refer to C) are just relaxing, I'm relaxing on my bed playing a phone game while he's doing something else. I see him get up and get a cup of macaroni to microwave.  Now due to being a little bit of a neat freak, and annoyed when people don't cover their food I told him if he microwaves anything with an exposed top to cover it, since I don't want to be cleaning out dried up food stains month later. As he puts in his little cup I can see the macaroni, uncovered, and no napkin or anything in sight.

Me: Hey do you mind covering that up? I don't want it to splatter.

C: It's fine, there's a line inside so it doesn't spill over.

I reach over and hold onto the microwave door so he can't close it(the whole set was right next to my bed and in arms reach)

Me: Even if that's the case, I'd really appreciate if you'd cover up your food man.

C: I said it's fine. 

He tries to press the door close but I' able to keep it open with one hand. I turn to face him as he starts to raise his voice.

C: Could you please move your hand?"" He asks, while also trying to pry my fingers off.

Me: Could you please cover your food? A simple napkin will suffice, I'm not asking you to get the holy grail.

C: Move your hand, NOW."" At this point I'm using both hands as he equally tries to force the door close and pry my fingers off.

Me: Only when you cover your food, I'm not asking much, cover your food or you can use the public microwave."" I say, sitting up and raising my voice as well. After a minute of me stopping him he pulls the door open and takes out his food. He then walks over to his side of the room and THROWS his uncooked food into the trash with a loud BANG. Tiny pieces of hardened macaroni fly all over the room as I fully sit up. 

Me: Jesus man are you seriously going to throw a temper tantrum?"" I ask as he just goes to his bed gibing me the silent treatment. ""I say 'cover your food' and you wanna loose it, are you even going to clean up all the macaroni you scattered?"" Again silence as I sigh, and brush all the macaroni bits to his side of the room.

For a bit of clarification I‚Äôve been doing all my work outside of the room, with the exception of the night I posted this, when I ended up in the bathroom typing up my essay on my phone, and I looked over the roommate contract. None of her rules are in our agreement. I‚Äôve been as understanding as possible, I bought her a sleep mask today, and one of those nice ones too, so she doesn‚Äôt have anything to complain about, and things came to a head when i asked to set up a meeting with the RA tomorrow so we can work this out. I‚Äôll keep you posted!",26,81,0.94

1690,Asshole,"So I'm just texting my friends. She is of course drunk at the moment and she says she wants to go out and ""get around."" I told her she should really get on birth control first so she could at least do it SAFELY because none of us need to be having babies while we're still living at home with our families working minimum wage part time jobs through college. She, in her drunk mind, thinks the most awesome comeback is ""Condoms are a thing ya know?"" I drop her a little fact that when used *perfectly* condoms are 98% effective, but humans aren't perfectly so actually they're only 85% effective and that I'd really suggest she go for the arm implant as its effectiveness doesn't get messed up by antibiotics or grape fruit like the pills can be. I only mentioned this because I know she isn't on birth control but was sexually active in the past.

She immediately gets all defensive saying ""I don't do birth control and don't plan on it."" I'm really taken aback because while she's sassy I've never seen her get defensive even while drunk she's more happy go lucky. And I go ""Whoa there, okay, may I ask why?"" And she simply goes ""Bc I don't"" now obviously it probably wasn't the wisest to ask why because clearly it's her choice in the end but this just really waved a whole load of red flags. I know for a fact theres nothing health wise preventing her from using birth control. The reason why I feel suspicious is because she is OBSESSED with babies, she thinks babies are like the absolute greatest thing EVER. Her life goal is to eventually get married to whichever guy she likes and have a load of kids with him in some house down south. What concerns me is her baby rabies is gonna override her common sense and she'll end up baby trapping some poor sap. So AITA for feeling suspicious about her not being on birth control?",142,151,0.79
1691,Not the A-hole,"My dad's side of the family is Mormon, and while my dad is somewhat ok with me leaving the church, my aunts and uncles are definitely not ok with it.

My dad's family is Mormon and Polynesian, so there's 50 cousins, at the very least, in the state and since I have been doing well for myself and my family and have recently bought a really nice house we had my cousin's birthday party at my place yesterday. Throughout the day I heard my aunts and uncles saying *""they only have this nice house because Satan has them in his grasp""* and *""this house is only temporal, but her sadness from leaving the gospel will be eternal""* and I will be honest these little digs may have added to what I did.

So before we ate the food my SO made my aunt, who is the fahu (oldest sister on my dad's side and should receive the highest levels of respect and obedience), decided that after I told everyone thanks for coming to celebrate my cousin's birthday and to enjoy the food she would give a speech and turn the eating into a little family home evening. Meaning there would be an opening prayer, a hymn, a lesson (which so happened to be on Joseph Smith and his first vision, one of the reasons I left their church), and a closing prayer.

I didn't mind her doing this, I kind of expected it, but then she asked me to say the closing prayer. She's knows that I am no longer a member and don't believe in God. I said that she wouldn't like the prayer I would give and should ask someone else to do it. She pressed on and on about me saying the prayer and I finally said ""This is my house and I'd like to ask uncle\_\_\_ to bless the food and give the closing prayer.""

My favorite uncle told her to let it go and that he would bless the food. The rest of the night was kind of awkward and ended earlier than usual. I have been getting texts from my cousins saying I was a dick and there's been a lot of passive aggressive FB posts.

I feel like I should've just said the prayer since my fahu was the one to ask, and since I don't believe what's the harm in praying? But on the other hand its my house, and I wouldn't go to her place and demand her to pray to Hekate and I already let her give her lesson on her gospel. I would usually ask my fellow exmormons but I feel like thet would be bias on the subject. So AITA?

1692,Not the A-hole,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually typing this but here it goes

So I (27 F)have been with my SO (26 M) for three years and I have an 8 year old from a previous relationship. We currently live together and my son lives with us and visits his dad pretty much every weekend and on breaks. I make significantly less money than my SO but I do the majority of the chores with the exception of cooking. Since he makes more money he pays more in rent, pays for groceries, and most of the mutually shared bills.


SO meal preps all of our food for the week, including my sons. So he only cooks once per week. (Idk if it‚Äôs relevant)


The issue is today after work I got home with my son and saw that SO had orders a pizza that was in his office. I wasn‚Äôt hungry but I told my son to go get some for dinner. Apparently SO told my son no so he came and told me that he wasn‚Äôt allowed to have any. I honestly thought he was joking so I went and got him two pieces of the half eaten pizza.

To make a long story short SO was mad because he didn‚Äôt want to share with my son. He says it‚Äôs wrong to call him selfish for not wanting share when he does a lot of selfless things like pay more money for bills, take my son to practice when I work, study with my son, etc. I understand he does these things but I couldn‚Äôt imagine telling a kid no he can‚Äôt have a piece of pizza for no real reason.

TLDR:
SO didn‚Äôt want to share his pizza with my son and I called him selfish for it. AITA for calling him selfish for that?

Edit: 

Apparently some people are thinking that because he makes more than me that I‚Äôm some kind of gold digger. To clarify we both work full time and go to school part time. And I work an extra 12 hours on Sundays. 

SO regularly gets treats for himself that no one else gets to have. Him having things for himself was never an issue.

The reason he does all of the cooking is because he enjoys cooking. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy it and I work on Sundays from 6a-6p. 

Doing the housework is way more than just vacuuming once per week. (I feel sorry for your wives if that‚Äôs what you guys really think but I digress) He really only does chores when he feels like it. 99% of the time I don‚Äôt mind this because he does pay for more of the shared costs even though I work more hours.

No he is not my sons bio dad and I‚Äôm aware he could leave at any time. However imo step parents still play an important role in a kids life. Maybe that‚Äôs not true anymore? If he decides that he doesn‚Äôt want to be a step parent anymore then that‚Äôs his decision. I would be heartbroken but I would be perfectly able to take care of my son just like I did before.

Edit 2: He doesn‚Äôt pay for ‚Äúeverything‚Äù I still pay a little under half. I‚Äôd guess around 40%. And he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanage‚Äù the bills I do. I keep track of every bill and make sure it gets paid on time. 

If I‚Äôm TA then so be it but he is in no way this poor under appreciated man who slaves away for a kid that isn‚Äôt his and an entitled SO like some of you are making him out to be.

Edit 3: INFO the pizza was a large. I gave my son two slices of the pizza which was about half gone when we got home. I got off work and took my son straight to the urgent care so I got home way later than normal. I (wrongly) assumed that because he‚Äôd already eaten over half of a large pizza it would be okay for him to share. 

I understand I‚Äôm TA for making that assumption and not asking but I was just operating under the same assumptions that he and I both had for the last three years.",1751,2110,0.89
1693,Everyone Sucks,"So without context (or even with), you might think I'm the asshole but hear me out. This happened several months ago.

So I was leaving school in my first car I've bought for myself and it was one of my dream cars. I lowered it because the car looks better like that, in my opinion, and everyone does it to this car. I was waiting for my turn to turn to the exit lane in my school parking lot, so I was stationary. I was situated behind a Chevy Silverado that was at least like 3 feet taller than my car's stock height. I am stationary for about a minute. Next thing you know, the truck previously mentioned backs up into me very quickly and smacks my car HARD.

I was mad as hell. My car is now ruined and the only damage on his car is my paint he cleared with his bumper. I get out and it's an old man. He rolls down his window and tells me ""I didn't see you."" I responded with a ""No damn shit buddy."" Then he proceeds to yell at me for a cool 3 minutes about how it's my fault that this accident occurred.

This guy finally stopped talking and I told him that it's time to sell his car, and put himself in a retirement home. He got really upset, and his granddaughter who is a classmate of mine started talking about how I made her grandpa cry. He wasn't crying when I saw him. The dude made ME cry for crying out loud. Not by his actions, but just the fact that my car I only enjoyed for a few months was now a goner.  I was known as an asshole for the remainder of the school year and it was hard for me to do group projects in one of my classes.

What do you guys think? AITA?

He didn't want to hear it of course so steps out. So I'm now in the room alone with mom and mom starts talking to me.  Apparently, the GF made comments to BF's sister a few weeks prior that she was fed up with waiting (they have been together for 8 years) and that if he hadn't proposed to her within 6 months, she was going to leave him.  Mom wants me to talk to BF as he would actually listen to me.  Later that night, I talk to BF's sister in private and she confirms what mom said.  She gives me details on when and where they talked.

1702,Not the A-hole,"A final conclusion needs to be made tonight. The whole family is involved in this decision and I'm getting flack from everyone for my choices.

My sister is 21. She doesn't have a license and my parents have taught her sporadically how to drive since April. She claims she's pretty good. My parents are apprehensive but don't seem to be showing anymore initiative to actually teach her more than once a month. She has a car but it's not registered and still needs to pass inspection. She is in community college and has a job that takes her to different places everyday.  For the past month and a half I have taken her to all her events.

I got a job offer this week but it starts in a month so we are all scrambling to find a solution so my sister doesn't have to quit/drop out. She found a slot tomorrow and Saturday to take her driver's exam. The next slots are not until November.

WIBTA for saying that my sister can't use my car for the driver's test? 

My reasoning:

- My sister doesn't know how to parallel park which is harder to do if she doesn't have the backup camera like she has practices with and in a larger vehicle. She says she can learn in a 2hr driving lesson tomorrow with a teacher she is going to pay. Correct me if I'm wrong....but I don't think that's realistic. She's never even driven on the highway.

- My car is old. If she crashes it, insurance will just cut me a check for a couple hundred rather than fix the problem like they might on my mom's new bmw.

- My sister has never driven it or anything like an SUV before. My car drives like a truck vs a newer car with all the sensors and bells and whistles that will tell her if she is about to hit something. 

I want to ask her to wait until the November test. And I personally teach my sister in my SUV and spend the next month helping her learn what she needs to. But that's not the best option. If my mom doesn't budge and let my sister use the BMW (which my sister has actually practiced in) then my sister would have to drop out. I obviously don't want that to happen but if she crashes my car, I will have to get a car payment on a low salary when I'm already saving to move out in 9 months. 

My mother won't budge on letting my sister use her car and won't explain why. So literally everything is on me.


EDIT: My sister's first lesson with a driving instructor will be tomorrow. All of her knowledge comes from my parents. She has some money to pay for an instructor but not much. 


EDIT 2: Just found out that paying extra to use the instructors car is a thing! Thanks Reddit. Unfortunately then people just told us it needs to be scheduled 3 weeks in advance.

About 2 weeks ago the owners hired a former chef and friend as the manager after the previous one left. Bad things had been heard about him before he started and he wasn't liked amoung general staff. I take my work very seriously, we have a lot of part time working students that just come in and get paid really. I'm a strong believer of doing what you're paid for and ensuring you are helping the business; therefore the manager and I got alone well. 

About a week ago the manager asked for my drug dealers number outside of work.
As a politically-modern student who has tried some of the more harmless drugs I didn't see an issue with this.

A week on now and he has been fired for missing work repeatedly (called in sick but everyone knows he was on a coke binge).

Co workers and friends have called me an arsehole and out of line (they (as well as me) are covering for him now) for giving him the number.

1714,Asshole,"My husband and I had our first son this year! Named him William. To choose his name we each wrote a list of our top 10 and then checked to see if any matched. William is a family name on both sides and sounds really good with our last name. It was the only shared name between our lists, so Will it is.

Of note: I have an ex named Will. We dated for a short time, slept together for a long time. I did NOT name my son after Will - I have always liked that name, it has family value, etc.

Fast forward to last weekend. An old friend of mine visited and one night she drunkenly started telling stories. She got into a tale about the time Will and I were banging on the porch couch and somehow fell into the inner workings and got lodged there with him inside me and we had to yell for help to be pulled out of the couch, bare asses and all. Great story, but obviously not an ideal choice with my husband as the audience. He got quiet, and shortly after we put my friend to bed. I thought the story rubbed him the wrong way but the first thing he said to me was, ""Will?"" I hadn't even registered that she used his name, but she did and my husband was pretty disturbed that our son shared a name with a man I'd slept with and that I never thought to mention it. We don't talk much at all about our exes so it wasn't strange to me that Will's name never came up, but to my husband he feels like I intentionally hid it.

I assured him that to me it is a non-issue. I never ever think of ex-Will when I interact with baby Will. My husband has been quiet this whole week and I feel really badly that this is weighing on him, but I do not necessarily think I am in the wrong. Internet, give me some perspective please. AITA?

 Edit: Thanks for the judgments yall. I know that if the tables were reversed I would be put off too, but I would not think he is an asshole for it IF the name was repeated multiple times over in our immediate family and the ex was a distant memory (as opposed to an ex-wife or something).

1717,Asshole,"Hi aita! I hope this fits here because im getting frustrated tbh. To preface i am a dog walker, any dogs mentioned in this post are NOT mine and i see some dogs as often as once every 2 weeks - i say this so people dont say to 'train the dog', i dont see any often enough for it to be feasible.

Short and sweet: people get upset with me when the dogs i walk pee on their grass. And its not like a dozen dogs worth of pee, its usually when i have 1 dog with me and 1 dog urinates on their lawn. The dog/s are always leashed with a standard 6ft leash and they dont pee on porches/gardens/etc, the dogs pee on the light post on the 'public property but you are mandated via by-law to care for' portion of their yard (picture a house with a sidewalk - im referring to the side that has the fire hydrants, light posts, etc.). 

Dogs pee on posts/hydrants/fences. Outside is where dogs go to the bathroom, its how people train their dog: 'potty outside not in'. When people give me grief of a dog peeing on the light post/hydrant im not rude but i dont say 'of course ill tell the dog he may no longer bathroom here!' I say, 'Ill try my best, but I cant make promises as this isnt my dog and theyve been trained to bathroom outside'.

To be clear - if it was a flower bed id gently pull them away but people are getting their panties in a twist over grass and metal poles. Im frustrated and annoyed by people stopping me and giving me grief to downright yelling at me because a dog did something theyve been trained to do and have been doing for YEARS. 

AITA for not saying ill keep the dogs from peeing on their yard?


ETA - I am female (saw a lot of 'he' and while i aint picky it happened enough that i thought it worth mentioning). I keep dogs from peeing in gardens by either keeping them out completely and walking them on the sidewalk or walking by em faster so the dogs dont have time to stop. However if a dog needs to pee, theyll huck the brakes on regardless of my speed and i wont move or else poor Fido will face plant while peeing and... thats just awkward and not a fun mess to clean. Schools are private property so i cannot walk dogs there during school hours or after school as many have daycares, others are hotspots for kids to hang out and its unsafe to allow dogs to run amuck when little kids are around. I dont have permission to drive dogs to the local dog park, nor can i walk them there due to it being off a road that goes 80km/hr.

I think that covers all the bases for comments. If/when I get another complaint, Ill offer to the complainer that Ill talk to the owner about having them purchase something that makes the dog's urine not burn the grass since grass burn seems to be the big thing, not so much as the pee itself.",118,27,0.77

1719,Not the A-hole,"A little background: my mother-in-law passed away just over 2 years ago. I was extremely lucky in that I had a wonderful relationship with her. I loved her very much, she loved me, and I miss her terribly. It was a very difficult time for my husband and sister-in-law, they were a very close family, so it's something they are still dealing with. 

My father-in-law got remarried very quickly, and he has now been married to his new wife for a year. She is...okay. She's nice enough, tries to be friendly with all of us, but she has a personality that just doesn't mesh well, and she has a habit of stepping on toes. She has tried way too hard to step into a ""mother"" role to my husband and SIL, and ""grandmother"" role to my SIL's kids, while they are still grieving the loss of their mom, so it has rubbed everyone the wrong way. There are a lot of other little things, like moving into their childhood home and getting rid of all photos of their mom without offering them to the kids, that have put a strain on that relationship. 

The other element at play here is that ever since he got remarried, my FIL has been very disengaged from our lives when he was once super involved. He doesn't call, doesn't make much effort to see his grandkids, and spends much more time with his new wife's kids and her grandkids. For the record, I don't think step-MIL is actively trying to push FIL to spend less time with us, it just seems that she dictates how they spend their time and he just goes along with it, so this is on him. This has been especially difficult on my SIL, who is tremendously hurt at how little her dad seems to care about her kids.

This all leads me to the holidays. The holidays have been very tough since my MIL passed away. Especially since step-MIL takes them VERY seriously. She's quite religious (Christian) while my husband, SIL, and I are all agnostic Jews. SIL's husband is agnostic as well. 

My husband and I are planning to spend the holidays out of state with my family this year. My mom suggested inviting my SIL and her family to join us, since she is aware of the circumstances and how difficult it would be for SIL to spend the holidays with step-MIL, especially without my husband and I there. I think it's a great idea, but WIBTA for not inviting my FIL and step-MIL? Step-MIL's kids and grandkids will be with her ex-husband this year, so part of me feels bad about potentially making them spend the holidays without anyone, but I've seen how difficult these past 2 years have been for my SIL and I want to help give her a fun, stress-free holiday.

1727,Not the A-hole,"My dad is divorcing his wife ""Nicole"". Nicole and her adult kids are nice enough, but we never had much of a relationship. I always thought of Nicole more as my dad's wife, not as my stepmother, because she wasn't involved in raising me and didn't do any mothering. After my dad told me they were getting divorced, I assumed I would never see Nicole or her kids ever again.

I was surprised when Nicole said she and her kids would love to have me visit them. Nicole said I could stay with her, and suggested next time I have a long weekend off of work.

This came out of nowhere for me, we never really had a relationship of our own, I really visited to see my dad and didn't have much to do with Nicole or her kids. I would actually be willing to still visit once in awhile, except that it's a four hour plane ride to where they all live. I used to make the trip because I wanted to see my dad, but he's moving back to the area where I and the rest of his family live, so I don't have a reason to make that trip anymore. It's not a very interesting place, so I can't imagine I'd end up near there for work or vacation. If I'm going to make a big trip like that, I'd rather it be for my actual family, not my dad's ex and her kids.

I'm not talking about cutting them off, I don't mind keeping in touch. And if they ever came close to where I live I'd be happy to meet up. It's just traveling to them in person that I really don't want to do. AITA if I never go visit them again? They're nice people, but visiting is a lot of effort.",14,50,0.93
1728,Asshole,"Me (26F) and my best friend (25M), we'll call him Brian, have been friends for 3.5 years now. We are in a PhD program together and have the same adviser, so we spend a fair bit of time together and are quite close. I consider him one of my best friends in grad school and I'm sure he would also consider me as such. 

I often throw house parties, that in which Brian enjoys coming to. For my birthday this year, I have decided to throw a PowerPoint party where everyone makes and presents silly 3-minute PowerPoint presentations. Attendees will also have to wear Skype interview attire (business on top, whatever on bottom). Drinking games will ensue. This will be the first themed party thrown while we've been in grad school, so this is not a typical thing. 

I have invited about 15 people or so, but I am not sure who all will come, nor do I know if everyone will partake in the theme. I would be very embarrassed if no one decided to partake, so I expect my good friends to bite the bullet and drunkenly present at my party. The invitation said, ""Making a presentation is required. Did I mention you should make a presentation? Please make a presentation."" In other words, I was attempting to jokingly obligate people into participating. In casual conversation, I explained to Brian that this phrase was written somewhat as a joke. Upon hearing this, he decided that he would not participate and would not present. I think he had intents to participate when he thought it was ""required,"" but once he felt there was an out, he took it and won't change his mind.

Although Brian can be quite guy, everyone at this party will be a fellow grad students that in which he has presented in front of numerous times for classes. Presenting in this environment should not put him under any undue stress, especially considering that we've known and presented in front of these people for years now. And it's a 3-minute joke presentation. Not a big deal. 

Moreover, I have always gone above and beyond for Brian's birthdays. The past two years I have planned and orchestrated his parties for him, spending a fair bit of money on food, cabs, drinks, etc. Given how I have treated his birthdays in the past, the level of our friendship, and the low stakes nature of the request, I do not feel out of line being mad at him for refusing to participate. So, people of Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit update: The party went great! Brian came and watched and everyone had a freaking blast. The joke is on some of you all for saying how crummy the idea was... I did my presentation on this post and all the lame comments I had to sift through.",128,74,0.8
1729,Not the A-hole,"I' cut all ties with my parents and siblings about 3yrs ago. One of my older sisters was a few months pregnant with her fourth child at the time. Because there was no contact, I was not informed when the baby, a girl, was born and actually only found out about 3 months after because I happened to run into an old friend of my sister's and she told me.

It hurt of course, especially since I was really close to her other kids before I cut ties, but I dealt with it.

About 2 months ago something bad happened in my family and I was contacted and asked to come 'home'. I wasn't too thrilled, but realized I would probably regret not going later on if things turned for the worst, so I went and spent about a 2 weeks with my family. You'd think the family crisis would be the bad part here, but it wasn't.....the worst part of it all was that every single person there was acting like the last couple of years did not happen and we were all part of a big, happy family. I dcided to play along as it was not the time and place for such honesty and crap, but I tried to keep my distance as much as possible. My sister also kept pushing my niece towards me, telling me stories, showing me pictures and telling the girl to go and play with her big uncle. I did, as the little one's not to blame for anything, but I kept my distance and tried to move her towards someone else asap every time she came towards me, as I did not feel like bonding with a little kid that would not be part of my life after the crisis was dealt with.

Now the crisis is pretty much behind us and I went back home about 6 weeks ago and got a message 2 days ago from my sister, first real message since getting home, asking if I'd be able to babysit the tiny niece for a day. Which is something I used to do for her older kids all the time. I told her no and after she kept pushing me I honestly told her I did not want to bond with her for the reason previously mentioned and she blew up! Told me I was an a'hole for not wanting to spend time with the girl and that I did not deserve being her uncle.

My friends, most of them from the last 3yrs, are all saying she's acting like a bitch and that she shouldn't have just assumed I was on board pretending nothing happened and that I shouldn't feel guilty, but I do, so I'm asking for advice.

AITA here?

EDIT: People were asking why I cut ties......... I don't want to share too much about it as it's had quite a big impact on my life and well-being and I don't like thinking about it, but I have a few family members with narcissistic traits and let's just say that the entire year before I made that decision I was their 'victim' of choice. Even after trying for months to let my entire family know how it made me feel, I was told nothing was going on and to basically just get over it, so I decided I was done with them.

EDIT2: Apparently I'm too vaque about my reasons for cutting ties. While growing up every single decision I was allowed to make was heavily manipulated, any friends I ever had were pretty much chased away from our house, so the only friends I had were the ones I kept a secret and kept away from my home. Even after turning 18, every single decision I made that was not discussed and approved beforehand or just not what my familiy agreed to, major or not, was reason to harrass me about it until I complied to whatever they wanted For example, they wanted me to change my major as they did not agree with my choice of medical specialty as 'it is not a field for men to work in' and 'there are many other medical specialties that come with more money and a better reputation', all my friends are basically crap (met most of my friends in college and during internships and pretty much all of them have higher education, respectable jobs and are really nice people all around) and was getting too old to be without a wife halfway through my 20's.

1731,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôve always been very close with my mother. The ‚Äúmama‚Äôs boy‚Äù jokes were real when I was a kid. But she‚Äôs always been a big part of my life since my father passed away when I was too young to really remember him. I‚Äôve even given my daughter (7F) my mother‚Äôs name as her middle name. My mother is definitely a little overprotective though, and it‚Äôs not always easy to deal when she gets like that.

Last weekend, my wife and I threw a final BBQ of the summer in my backyard. We invited some neighbors, some work friends and their kids, my wife‚Äôs parents and my mother. The kids were running around and the adults were passing a few beers and chatting while my wife and I took turns at the grill (off topic but this woman is way better at handling a grill than I am. What a keeper).

At one point, I was at the grill and was trying to get a burger off the side that got stuck. Not sure how that happened but I‚Äôm trying to shove my spatula underneath this thing, hoping it won‚Äôt fall apart. My mom sees my struggling and comes over.

Mom: ‚ÄúHun, you should be careful, that grill is hot.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine mom, I got it.‚Äù

Mom: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to get hurt.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, mom. I can handle it.‚Äù

Mom: ‚ÄúNo you can‚Äôt, just let me do it.‚Äù

She tries to grab the spatula out of my hand and I tell her that the grill is hot and she can‚Äôt just grab things out of my hand like that. She tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt speak to my mother like that, so I yank the spatula out of her hand and tell her, quiet enough so I don‚Äôt make a scene, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a grown-ass adult and I don‚Äôt need my mother to dote on me. I can handle it myself. Go do something else.‚Äù My mother just makes a face and goes inside. She doesn‚Äôt talk to me the rest of the party.

The next day, I felt bad. I think I was TA, so I called up my mother and apologized. I told her that I shouldn‚Äôt have raised my voice, especially in front of other party guests and that I was sorry if I embarrassed her. She accepted my apology and I took her out to lunch with my daughter as well and we had a great time.

My wife thinks I‚Äôm NTA and I shouldn‚Äôt have needed to apologize. She says that my mother was treating me like a child in front of everyone and that my reaction was justified. I think my verdict is YTA because I could have handled that much better than let my temper get to me.

So Reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to mention that my mother also apologized, it wasn't just me. And also, my mother and my wife have a great relationship as well. I didn't mean to make it seem otherwise.

Edit 2: Another clarification, I apologized for possibly embarrassing her at a party, not for what I told her. Mother apologized for ""getting in the way."" And no, this isn't something that happens often. She does often ask to help me and my wife with even simple tasks when she visits (like she helps make dinner when she visits for holidays and she wanted to help clear up the backyard a little bit before the BBQ. I never let her do anything that might be too much for her), but she does not often just snatch things out of my hand.",90,421,0.93
1732,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR, my boss keeps calling me when I'm home with pneumonia and calls me irresponsible for not having someone who can do my job in my absence. I'm tired of getting these messages and want to block his number but I'm not sure if that would be an asshole move. 

I work in tech QA where I have 3 bosses and manage 4 people. One of my bosses, let's call him R, joined the project 4 months ago and, to his credit, has a very hard job in release management (making sure everything gets out on time). R works a lot of overtime, and he expects me and my coworkers in QA to do the same. I have stated to R numerous times I cant work overtime but I will be available to him from 10 to 6 Monday to Friday. My other 2 bosses are fine with this arrangement, but R regularly calls and texts me on weekends, late at night, on days I have taken PTO, etc., and complains when I dont respond.

This week, I caught pneumonia so I havent been working. I told all 3 of my bosses that I would be out until I felt better (we have a pretty generous sick day policy), and the other 2 were fine with it. R, however, has called me 4 times in 2 days and texted me 15+ times asking for me to do ""quick tasks"" to meet a deadline we have on Friday. These ""quick tasks"" are things where I'm the only one who knows how to do them, but are not small asks. 

In response, R has called my management concerning and irresponsible since I dont have a backfill that can function efficiently in my absence. Everyone on my team is very new (started in the last month and a half), and they dont have system permissions to do what I do, but R does. The person who used to have Rs position used to be my backfill, but left the company on bad terms. So I have said I can complete these items when I return, or if it cant wait, this is how you can teach yourself how to do them. R said he didnt have time, and it was my team's responsibility, not his.

I feel like I'm being harassed for taking sick time and not being at work, and I want to set some boundaries that aren't being respected otherwise. But we do have a pretty hard deadline on Friday, and I get that R is in a tough position trying to get everything in order, and theres outstanding things that were my responsibility that aren't finished. 

So, WIBTA if I blocked R's phone number and stated that R can email me or message me on the company's messaging system during work hours, but when I am not in the office, I will be unreachable, understanding that he cannot contact me in an emergency situation?",49,184,0.95
1733,Not the A-hole,"A little context for this. My husband passed away 5 years ago when my daughter was almost 2. We did our best to muddle through and family and friends pulled together during the tough time. My delightful in-laws decided that this was the time for them to be demanding of our time and took offence when we wouldn‚Äôt go to them (I couldn‚Äôt drive and it was an epic bus journey to get to them).

Since then I have gone between defining myself as different sexual identities as I have grown up and been attracted to other people and genders besides female. When I came out my mother told me she did not think it was a good idea for me to disclose my sexual identity to her parents (my grandparents) because of their deep religious views and open homophobia. At the time I was hurt but I have come to understand her reasoning as it would probably just cause unnecessary drama in the family that could easily be avoided.

To make a long story short, my girlfriend and I broke up and got back together a month later (last week)

I‚Äôm a waiter at a restaurant, and was talking to one of my coworkers romantically for a week two weeks after we broke up, but told her I didn‚Äôt want anything serious out of it since I might get back together with my ex (we were kind of talking at the time, not really).

Before I know it, we‚Äôre back together and I tell my coworker that I did. She was upset about it and threw a fit calling me an asshole and whatnot although I was honest with her from the start.

Right next door to us is a couple who aren't married and are going through a rough patch.  They own their home and have two young children together.   Well, the guy in question has just always sort of rubbed me the wrong way.  He never did any one thing in particular, I just would never have a beer with the guy. 

Cut to yesterday.  My wife was walking in from work (I was not there) and the neighbor was outside getting his mail.  As she walking in, he shouts over ""Hey beautiful! How's it going?! Now, saying she is beautiful in certain contexts is fine. After my wife told me this, I told her that this is not acceptable on any level, but she didn't seem to think anything was wrong.

I listed the following reasons:

-My in-laws are paying for the wedding, I don‚Äôt want to spend more of their money.
-I can‚Äôt even invite some of my closest friends because of the size of the wedding, why should his girlfriend be prioritized over my closest friends who I call family.
-it‚Äôs disrespectful to my mom who has lived alone and has not fully recovered from their divorce about 2 years ago. So this would cause a lot of drama and upset my mom, who has done nothing but support me, even when she had nothing.

The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it‚Äôs their only daughter‚Äôs wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest ‚Äî his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn‚Äôt have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he ‚Äúproposed‚Äù (something I didn‚Äôt see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren‚Äôt trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable revealing my health issues.

1746,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for my formatting, I‚Äôm new to Reddit and on mobile. 

 I recently came upon a facebook post in a group for buying and selling things in my local area. The post was giving away 2 kittens (sisters,who were found as strays) for free. The current owner said they would prefer to keep the two together since they had a good bond. Understandable. Heres where things get interesting.

I messaged the owner telling her that if she was unable to find a home that could accept both cats, I‚Äôd be more than happy to take one. I would have loved to take both but I currently already have another kitten and my housing agreement only allows for 2 pets. She immediately answered sounding very excited giving me a description of the two cats and even scheduling a day to come to my place to introduce them to my cat and find the best fit for my home. The day came and she arrived with the cats. At first our cat did not really like the new kittens and was very scared and slightly hostile. We proposed the idea of them giving us a blanket that the kitten has slept on and letting us give it to our cat to adjust her to the scent, but the owner said ‚ÄúI think it should be fine, why don‚Äôt you take the cat and give it a trial run‚Äù. I agreed but my wife was somewhat on the fence, and made her skepticism well known. The owner really seemed to want us to take one of the cats and said that one of the kittens (the one we did not take) was less playful and appreciated her alone time, and sometimes her sister would bully her when she was trying to rest. This made the owner believe that separation wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing.

 We took the cat in and in the following days the new cat and our old cat have grown to like each-other and me and my wife have grown very fond of our new friend. At the end of the week the owner messaged us asking how the trial went and we replied ‚Äúgreat they cats are really bonding and we love having her. we‚Äôve decided to keep her‚Äù. The owner replied with a guilt trip saying that she found a home that could take both cats and would like ours back, saying our cats sister has been acting different and is now lonely. I think this is ridiculous and she isn‚Äôt being fair to myself and my wife so we have decided not to give the kitten back. So reddit, Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: A few people have mentioned the ‚Äútrial run‚Äù, just to add clarification, the trial run was a trial for us to determine if the kitten was a good fit for us and our current cat. It was never stated that the old owner would recall the cat upon finding a different home.

EDIT 2: Thanks to the advice of another redditor I‚Äôll add this. When we replied to the original post we said that we would love to take the cat IF a home that could take them both could not be found.

Now, I no longer feel the same about cosmetic surgery. Since we‚Äôve started dating, he‚Äôs occasionally made these half-jokes about how ‚Äúif you ever want a boob job, I‚Äôll happily pay for it‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to get skinny before I marry you‚Äù and the like.

Last week, I asked him if he was still serious about paying for cosmetic surgery, especially since he was going to be making so much now, and he said yes‚Äîrather enthusiastically. I told him that I would feel much more comfortable with a breast lift and a reduction back to a B-cup, as well as a tummy-tuck to get back to the figure I had before I started birth control.

He told me that he would pay for a lift, and an enhancement if I wanted it, but he wouldn‚Äôt pay for a reduction or a tummy-tuck. When I asked him why, and reminded him of what he used to say to me about cosmetic surgery and confidence, he told me that he didn‚Äôt want my breasts any smaller, and that people who got cosmetic surgery as a form of weight loss were lazy and unmotivated.

I got angry and called him shallow, and said that he knew I‚Äôd tried time and time again to lose the weight and it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I told him that there wasn‚Äôt any difference between an enhancement and a reduction as long as the woman felt comfortable and confident. I reminded him that he said he would pay for his ex‚Äôs reduction, and he said that that was because she was having back issues, something that I‚Äôm not having with my D-cups. He left for class in a huff, and now I‚Äôm alone at our apartment, feeling guilty and too entitled. AITA?",463,374,0.77

It got a laugh from him and another friend sitting by but the teacher was not amused. She was standing next to him (I said this at a normal voice level, I was almost right next to the food) She said that we need to talk after class. I go to her after class, and she said that by saying that I was discriminating against students of color. I asked her if any students of color had heard my comment and she said no. She proceeded to tell me about how discriminatory and disrespectful it was of me to say that, and I said nothing because I don‚Äôt want to be on her bad side because she controls my grade. I don‚Äôt know how my comment was discriminatory to people of color, and how it makes me an asshole to have said that.",518,839,0.94

1753,Asshole,"Some background info: 

About a year ago my friend and her partner got a puppy together, they already have a cat. Jim had always wanted a Staffordshire terrier, so he and Lisa (not real names) got the puppy and Jim immediately loved it unconditionally. Unfortunately though, Jim usually works night shifts and therefore a lot of the responsibility fell on Lisa to look after the puppy. As most people know, puppies are hard work. They require a lot of care and attention as dogs in general are not as self-sufficient as cats tend to be. Lisa began to become resentful of the puppy as she couldn‚Äôt handle the stress of looking after it alone. Which I fully supported, Jim was supposed to be helping 50/50 with this dog but was hardly there to help or when he was he was sleeping due to his working pattern. I really did feel bad for Lisa but she tried hard to make it work because she knew how happy the dog was making Jim. She spoke to him about it and it was became the root cause of a few arguments between them. 

&#x200B;

 After about 8 months of ‚Äòsticking it out‚Äô and ‚Äòit‚Äôll get easier‚Äô she gave Jim an ultimatum. Me or the Dog. Well, ultimatums don‚Äôt usually work at the best of times and Jim had developed such an attachment to this dog that she was essentially asking him to cut off his own foot. It was a really hard decision for him but he ultimately chose to save their 5 year relationship(!!!) so the puppy went to Jim‚Äôs mum who had more free time to properly look after it. 

&#x200B;

Cut to last week. 

&#x200B;

Lisa was showing me pictures of cute kittens, among the oooh‚Äôs and aww‚Äôs and high pitched squealing I tend to do when I see cute kitties, I asked why she was showing me these. She has been looking at getting another cat speculating that her current cat is lonely and needs a companion. I was appalled that she would even consider getting another cat after making Jim get rid of a beloved pet. She didn‚Äôt really ask for my opinion but I told her it was an awful idea and bluntly said she was being selfish and insensitive and not to do it. We had a mini argument and she‚Äôs been a bit stand-offish with me since. 

&#x200B;

I‚Äôve asked a few of my friends and some think I‚Äôm TA for getting involved while others agree with what I said. What‚Äôs your verdict of the situation?

Edit - general consensus is that I am indeed TA, i was being very single minded. I‚Äôll dig my heels out and go apologise for being so rude and inconsiderate! Thank you all for your fair judgements and taking the time to read.

So he had months to pack up his things and make sure he had everything together. Even after he moved out he needed to keep his things at my place for a few more months, which was frustrating but fine. He finally came to pick up his things and then moved about 45 min away. A few months later I found his SSC in my things and offered to mail it to him (and pay the shipping fee), drive it to him or find a time where he could come and pick it up. 

For months we‚Äôve been going back and forth about this SSC. My ex is a procrastinator so I‚Äôve tried many times to get this to him as fast as possible because I knew he needed it for the new job he started. He either never got back to me or was resistant to give me his address. This isn‚Äôt exactly relevant, but so that you understand my frustrations, his new gf is the girl he cheated on me with, and always had over while he was still living with me despite me asking him to keep her away from my home. 

Finally I reached a breaking point and blocked his number and threw away his SSC. It gave me so much relief after months of feeling a little bad for him not having it, and frustrated that he made it my problem. I felt like there would never be any resolution and he would just kept messaging me every other month to ask me to send it to him again and then not responding. 

I blocked him and threw it away weeks ago and he messaged me this morning, from a new number, asking for probably the 10th time if I could mail it to him. I told him that he needs to get a new one and to stop contacting me. He got super upset and said a few choice words, I blocked his new number, but AITA?",396,1913,0.96
1761,Not the A-hole,"I'm married with a 3 year old. Every morning when she wakes up (around 7am) I mostly take care of her until I leave for work. I feed her breakfast, get her dressed, etc. All of this is so my wife can sleep in until about 8 when I leave for work. We have my daughter enrolled in preschool, which she attends Mon-Fri, 9:30 to 1:30. My wife is a SAHM.

Now, every day when I get home (around 5:30pm) I like to workout. My routine is usually to get home, change into workout clothes, chit-chat for a few minutes and then workout in my garage for no more than an hour (an hour at absolute most). This usually makes it 6:30-7ish when I'm done.

Yesterday I had a fight with my wife. She was ~~whining~~ upset about how she waits SO LONG for me to get home, and then she has another 2 hours (her words) left to go before I'm helping out. I got a little upset at her comment because we are paying for my daughter to go to school, which gives my wife 4 hours a day to do whatever she wants.

AITA for suggesting I should get to workout after work?

For what it's worth, I have offered to try morning workouts if she can take care of our daughter in the morning (she didn't like this option), but I'm not willing to workout at 8pm or later because that makes it difficult for me to fall asleep.

1763,Not the A-hole,"So some context is needed before I start. 

Sandra only has one daughter Bess who lives with our Nan in another city. Bess has been dating Nathan for around two years now and in that time my sister and my brother can both count on one hand the times that they've met him.

Last year my sister got married in a small wedding. Both her and my BIL have larger families so the guests were only family with a few close friends /family friends also invited. Because of this both my sister and BIL decided that no one would have plus ones.

Six months before the wedding the invites were sent out and Sandra was not happy. My sister had sent an invite to Sandra, her husband John, and Bess but didn't invite Nathan as my sister had barely met him and there is a no plus one rule. Sandra flipped and began ringing around other relatives to see if anyone had been given a plus one. She wasn't happy that our uncles girlfriend, who we have met many times and has put in a great effort to get to know us since being with our uncle. 

Sandra decided not to speak to my sister and instead went over her head to our dad and called him while he was at work. She accused my sister of bullying Bess by not inviting Nathan and was trying to force my dad to get an invite for him from my sister. When Sandra was told nobody had plus ones she again kicked off about other 'plus ones' to which my sister told her that they had known them a lot longer and had met up with them on numerous occasions. Sandra didn't talk to my sister after that, failed to rsvp and booked a holiday for the same day, before threatening to not allow my Nan to attend the wedding. Our other Aunt was able to convince her to let her bring up our Nan and she really enjoyed the day. 

Fast forward to January this year when my brother send out his own invites. As a result of his new baby the wedding budget is very modest and so the day will be extremely intimate so no plus ones.

My brother invited Sandra, John and Bess but no Nathan. Sandra again kicked off. She once again rang my dad at work and accused him of allowing his children to tear the family apart. Sandra threatened my dad that if Nathan wasn't invited he would never hear or see either Sandra or his mother again. She keeps accusing my siblings of bullying Bess and lying about how many times they've met Nathan.

The rsvp date passed and no reply so they don't have a space at the wedding now and Sandra kicked off again and is again threatening to stop our Nan from being able to attend the wedding.  

The wedding is now two weeks away and Sandra is starting to kick up a fuss again and my brother is too stressed to deal with it.

Would I be the asshole if I confronted Sandra about her behaviour towards my dad and brother and arranged a way for our Nan to attend the day without Sandra stopping her from going and at the risk of ""tearing the family apart?""",14,41,0.91

1765,Not the A-hole,"(new account as I don't want my main one attached to this)

A woman that I (28f) went to school with recently lost her battle with cancer. Her name was Lucy and she made my life hell for years. I heard across the grapevine that she had cancer a while back but didn't find out what had happened until the tributes started pouring in on social media. Everyone talking about how smart and pretty and successful she was and how she was robbed of a bright future. I remember someone different. I remember someone who convinced me I was unloveable and repulsive and made sure I was completely alone and friendless at school, and she never showed any regret for it. The school wasn't able to do much because she was very smart and was treated very leniently. She continued to bother me even after we left school while I lived in the same area. 

I was contacted out of the blue yesterday by Katie, a girl I went to school with. She was part of Lucy's gang but to be fair was one of the less nasty ones. She said that everyone who loved Lucy is putting together a video tribute for her, getting people to film themselves saying a few words for her. She asked if I would be willing to say something. I responded that she seemed to have forgotten how Lucy and Katie herself treated me, and that if I record anything it will be me reminding everyone how vile she was and how I'm better off with her gone. 

She did not respond but an hour or so later my phone exploded. Katie had screenshotted it and sent it around to her friends and Lucy's family. Everyone is sharing it around. Lucy's parents and boyfriend have been calling me all kinds of names on social media and said their daughter is worth a hundred of me, and her school friends have all started saying all the things they used to call me at school. Even my friends have been texting me and saying that I was overly harsh. My mum called me and we had a long conversation and she encouraged me to remove all social media which I have done, but she also said I was out of line, and that whatever Lucy did in the past she didn't deserve to die.

1770,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. Generally, I would consider myself a healthy person. My boyfriend is the same, usually. However, he sometimes has spells where he doesn't eat properly, and just generally doesn't take very good care of himself. This obviously affects his health and leads to headaches and stomach cramps and a bunch of other stuff. 

At first, I was sympathetic. Then after the first dozen times, I was understanding but not so sympathetic. Now, I am just a bit impatient and frustrated. How I treat him makes no difference. Up until yesterday, I had kept quiet about how much it affects me because of how sensitive of an issue it is (he believes it's an eating disorder, and I don't feel it to be my place to comment on how someones mental place is my issue). However, I have had so many plans cancelled, and trips ruined, and actually had friends and family complain at me and fall out with me over the fact that I have to stay in and cancel plans due to him not being well. 

So, yesterday we had a gig booked. I paid for the tickets for us both, and it was all planned for us to go. In the morning, he was complaining of a headache, and as soon as he said it, I knew he would cancel on me, but I kept my hopes up. We planned to set off at 19:00. He got home from work, and was still complaining, to which I was suggesting things for him to try and he was snapping back that he had tried everything, so I dropped it. At 18:30, he went upstairs to use the bathroom, and came back down at 19:15. By this point, I was certain we weren't going, but I said ""do you know what time it is?"" and he just said ""yes"". He then went back upstairs and didn't come back down, so I just went to bed at 20:30. He got into bed not long after, and didn't say a word to me. He got up this morning and still didn't say anything. So I said ""are you not going to say anything about last night?"" and he said ""not much to say, I was ill, not much to be done about that"". We had a debate back and forth of me saying he could've at least told me, and he said I just went and got into bed so he didn't think anything needed to be said. Upset, I then said ""I don't think you realise how much you not looking after yourself affects me"" and he blew up, telling me I have no idea what it's like being him and having to deal with being ill all the time and calling me a twat and whatnot. I pointed out that from my perspective, it all looks preventable and it always seems to be me missing out on things, as we never cancel his plans, always mine. He ended up just storming out and going to work.

I now don't know how to feel. Was I an arsehole for pointing out that it affects me? Or was I justified and should've said it better? Or was it fine how I said it?

1775,Not the A-hole,"TL:DR - We are Scottish but don‚Äôt want a traditional Scottish wedding (kilts, bagpipes, ceilidh). Mum and sister insisting their partners wear kilts and make me feel like an asshole for not wanting people to wear them. 

I recently got engaged (about a month ago) and we have already started planning and looking into venues/suppliers etc. 

We live in Scotland and in a traditional Scottish wedding the men wear kilts, there is ceilidh dancing at the reception and there is a piper on bagpipes that plays when guests arriving, entrance at reception for bride and groom etc. 

When discussing our wedding, my fianc√© and I both agreed we wanted a relaxed and small wedding. No fancy food, just a nice BBQ, dancing and DIY type decor. We are both proud of our heritage, but tbh we are not fans of kilts, bagpipes or ceilidh dancing (it reminds me of being forced to learn the dances in PE in school!). So we decided on a non-traditional wedding with no kilts, no bagpipes and no ceilidh as these things are also very formal and does not go with the relaxed vibe we are going for. 

Everyone we have spoken to about this so far are happy with the idea. Except my mum and sister. My sister went off on me last night, saying her partner is unhappy about the ‚Äòno kilts‚Äô and has said that he doesn‚Äôt want to buy a new suit for the wedding (he doesn‚Äôt fit into the one he has anymore), and has spent a fortune on his kilt so he will be wearing it. She made me feel like a complete asshole about not wanting a traditional wedding, saying ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt dictate what our guests should wear‚Äô, but everyone else is happy not to wear a kilt! I‚Äôm not even asking him to buy a brand new, expensive suit, you can buy or hire for less than ¬£100 and he doesn‚Äôt even need to wear a full three piece suit - a shirt, tie and some chinos would be perfect. My wedding is roughly two years away, surely I‚Äôm giving enough notice to either fit into the suit he‚Äôs got, or be able to get and alternative. I mean, people buy new outfits for weddings all the time, right?

My sister also has a baby boy, who will be 2 and a half on our wedding day. He is a page boy and she tried to insist that he wear a kilt on the day but I put my foot down as he is in the wedding party so I am buying his suit anyways (a tiny navy tweed suit so still Scottish).

My sister and mum are also saying my stepdad is in the same boat and doesn‚Äôt fit into his suit and will be upset if he can‚Äôt wear his kilt. He is in the wedding party so I am happy to buy a suit for him if they are going to make a fuss about it. 

My mum also said that ‚Äònoone will dance at the wedding unless there is a ceilidh.‚Äô I told her the people have weddings in Scotland and all over the world without ceilidh music and everyone still dance no bother!

We just want a relaxed wedding and traditional ones are so stuffy and formal. Are we assholes?

1780,Not the A-hole,"English is not my first language. 

I (20f) still live at home with both my parents, I'm looking into moving out ASAP but looking for roommates and a place to live has been a bit of a struggle. 

When I turned 18 my parents told me I could either A) move out, B) pay my share of the rent (so 1/3 including utilities), or C) do all the household chores to 'earn my keep'. I was struggling with my mental and physical health so C was the only option possible. 

So for almost two years I did 95% of the chores, it wasn't always easy to combine with school, work and therapy but it worked. And my health slowly got a bit better. 

Now I do make enough to pay my share of the rent, so I asked my parents what we where going to do about the chores now. In my mind it was fair for everyone to do 1/3 of the chores. They where confused and assumed I would keep doing them. 

I told them absolutely not, the deal was to either run the household, pay rent, or move out. And since I'm now paying rent all the responsibility shouldn't fall on just me. 

They've refused to talk about it since, I've tried without luck to bring it up again. So I decided to stop doing chores, then we'd have to talk about it. It's only been a week, but without anyone doing groceries, cooking, and keeping the bathroom clean the tension is high. We still haven't talked about it, but they have been angry. 

I don't really know what's normal to expect from parents at this point. Most of my friends don't pay rent, the ones who do live more like roommates then parents/kids. Only a few of my friends have moved out. 

AITA here? I felt justified, a deals a deal. But it might not be worth it, I do want to keep the peace.

INFO: I tried talking to them several times before deciding to stop doing chores. And they rent the house, they didn't buy it. I don't know if that's relevant. 

Sidenote, they brought up paying rent the moment I started working more.

MORE INFO: I go to college and get some money from the government (I don't know how to explain it in english lol) and pay for the rest myself.

ANOTHER INFO: I go to college, I don't work full time. I pay for my own health insurance, therapy, phone bill, and tuition (and now rent, plus groceries for most days) so I'm still saving up to move out. But yes, it's high on my priority list.

Paying rent was my parents idea the moment I started working more, so I don't think doing chores and not paying rent is an option.

MORE INFO: Yes, I'm very aware when I move out I'll have to pay rent as well as do chores, that's not the issue here.",621,3677,0.96

She initially asked if I had a boyfriend or husband that could help. But I‚Äôm a nurse and I‚Äôm pretty used to helping with things like that so I told her I could try. 

I assisted my neighbor and got the her mother up. She turned out to be fine.

1787,Not the A-hole,"My best friend of 8 years is getting married to a woman in the Deep South. She is dead set on the ceremony being at a plantation near her hometown, as is tradition in her family. The plantation owners had slaves, way back when. My best friend has always said he‚Äôd like me to be the best man, but hasn‚Äôt explicitly asked me in awhile. I‚Äôd always say, ‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

Putting my own feelings about plantations aside, my girlfriend of 2 years is South Sudanese. By her words, she is the ‚Äúkind of black that still bothers some white people.‚Äù Whenever we‚Äôve gone to the South, she feels as though people stare and treat her differently. I told her where the wedding is, and while she‚Äôd never say she doesn‚Äôt want to go, I know her well enough to know she would be super uncomfortable. The plantation would make it worse.

AITA if I don‚Äôt go to my best friend‚Äôs wedding? Am I still the asshole if I go and *don‚Äôt* take my girlfriend of two years

Edit:
I talked to my girlfriend about her thoughts on the manner. They were pretty much what I thought: she admitted she thinks it is an inappropriate place for a wedding, and she still dislikes this particular area of the South we‚Äôd be going to. She, as I expected, still said she‚Äôd go with me if I went.",1086,1072,0.91
1788,Not the A-hole,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we‚Äôd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn‚Äôt find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he‚Äôs not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He‚Äôs an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It‚Äôs been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he‚Äôs busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it‚Äôs been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn‚Äôt stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn‚Äôt matter. Any time we‚Äôd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I‚Äôd ask him how classes or friends were and he‚Äôd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn‚Äôt even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he‚Äôd do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris‚Äô because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. I told him this ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you are going to do this. That‚Äôs really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I‚Äôm no longer your Father and I don‚Äôt want to be involved in your life.‚Äù 

He hung up on me. I didn‚Äôt even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn‚Äôt respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he‚Äôs 22).

My family told me I‚Äôm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it‚Äôs reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn‚Äôt speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn‚Äôt contact me. I didn‚Äôt contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he‚Äôs been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son‚Äôs inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this ‚ÄúAdam, you haven‚Äôt been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. That‚Äôs the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I‚Äôm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.‚Äù Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex‚Äôs affair. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the real reason he‚Äôs so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",4437,28379,0.89

So it‚Äôs my birthday in a few weeks. I am turning 16. So instead of a party, my sisters asked if I wanted to go to 6 flags. I was like sure. Because I prefer that to a party. So this is where the problem comes in. I wanted to go to 6 flags with me, my brother, and both my sisters. 

My sister randomly told me she invited her boyfriend and his brother. Keep in mind I‚Äôve met him a few times, and talked to him a little. If they came it would just be awkward for no reason. I just want to relax and enjoy my birthday. So I told them this and my sister said we would go to another place with Just us siblings. I was mad that she didn‚Äôt tell me that she was inviting him, and was frustrated that I didn‚Äôt have any control over what I‚Äôm doing for my birthday. I was mad but couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I was also glad that we could spend time together later. 

So a few days after this. My sister randomly tells me that her boyfriend invited his cousins. I haven‚Äôt met these two people in my life, I don‚Äôt even know what they look like. I tell her no they can‚Äôt come. I don‚Äôt want them to come because it will make it even more awkward. We are going to celebrate my birthday, but at this point it feels like she is doing to for herself. I also hate the fact that she decided all of this without even telling me. She is now telling me how I‚Äôm being immature and she can not invite her boyfriend to events (they have been seeing each other for 5 months)

So reddit AMITA

I didn't want her to go, but I wanted to support her because I know this is her dream. Because she is out living her dream, she has very little time for me. I totally get that, I wouldn't want her to be cooped up in her room only thinking of me to begin with.

&#x200B;

However, this makes it very hard because I feel every time we talk, she is always busy. I feel she doesn't make almost any time for me unless it's convenient for her. (She falls asleep better when on the phone with me). We had a night set that would be planned date nights, but she has already missed the 2nd planned one saying that the days just blend together and she forgot. I offered to come and visit her in her country for a week, but she did not seem excited at all about it, which makes me really upset because if I am going to spend 3k+ to go visit her, I want her to be excited to see me.

&#x200B;

Because I feel lonely and neglected, I feel during our calls I can get a little upset. I am often unsure of sharing my emotions with her though because I don't want this to make it about me. This trip is about her and her dreams. But I feel sometimes my emotion slips through and she becomes sad and feels like she is a bad girlfriend to me and it can ruin her day.

1801,Not the A-hole," I'm a college student living in an apartment with 4 other girls. One is a transfer student who we'll call Mia (she‚Äôs our only random). Yesterday, I had a 4 text message long conversation with her, which resulted in her being completely moved out by the end of the day. I'm posting here because although from my perspective, Mia is completely irrational and nothing I did warranted her reaction, I showed my RA roommate the text conversation that started it, and she said she sees both sides and we're both in the wrong.

Early on I knew to steer clear Mia. She ambushed me while moving and she gave both me and my parents bad vibes. The only ‚Äúnegative-ish‚Äù interactions we‚Äôve had are:

1. I made excuses to not go to her ‚Äúroommate dinners,‚Äù but she pretended she forgot I‚Äôd told her no 4 times.

2. She overfilled the freezer and it couldn't close afterwards, much less fit anyone else's food. I sent a text in the group chat not calling her out directly, asking if we could be more conscientious with fridge space.

3. We had a meeting where I asked if we could all make sure we're cleaning up after ourselves a better, referencing the fact that someone had spilled ice cream on the couch and just left it there. I don't know if it was her.

4. Mia seemed to be under the impression that all 5 of us were supposed to be bffs, and I kept to myself and didn't go out of my way to ever interact with her. I never explicitly said anything of it to her, but I never joined my roommates when they hung out there, which I could tell bothered her.

5. The final straw. She'd had been in the bathroom for about half an hour. At 7:50, I knocked on the door any say something along the lines of ""Hey, I have an 8 AM too. Could I get in there quick,"" since I had to pee. Mia sends me a text later saying, ""It was so rude of you to knock on the door while you knew I was in there. I haven't showered in 3 days because everyone else is always in there and Tuesday mornings are the only time I can, and it was so rude for you to rush me like that."" I explain that it wasn't a personal attack and I just really needed to pee. My housemate last year and I used knocking to signal that we were waiting, so I didn't see it as rude. She says it's still rude and she brings up her lack of showering again. I repeated to her that I wasn‚Äôt attacking her and all I was trying to do was pee. I said I felt like she was projecting her frustrations with her lack of showering (although Mia‚Äôs always home and no one else has ever had issue getting their daily shower in) and that she should text the group chat to ask for a shower schedule if she's having issues rather than blowing up on me.

I come home to find out that she's moved out because of our texts. I thought ""there must be more to this,"" but I asked my RA roommate, and she said that I was THE reason she moved. As I mentioned, I keep to myself, and we‚Äôve only has those 5 ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù

1803,Not the A-hole,"So quickly covering the basics. Both my GF and I work morning shifts. I'm full-time and she is part-time and there is only one day a week where our schedules overlap. So we need someone to watch our 4yo son during the time of 11:30am on  Wednesday to 6pm on thursdays. We allow his grandparents to watch him during this time but tonight we got a call that i may or may not of overreacted too. 


We are just chilling watching Netflix and we get a call from the grandma informing us that our son is no longer in their supervision for roughly 90 minutes. Apparently they allowed him to go with his cousins (age range of 4-14) on to a random church bus to a random church that they didn't even know where it was. 


I guess this is a regular thing my son's cousins do every Wednesday night. A local church has a little activity hour where they sing, play, storytime, snack time, ect. 


Now back to the call. We basically get a call that the grandparents allowed my son to board a random church bus to a church they didnt even know the location of. All they knew was one word which was ""Union"". This in my mind creates trust issues because we trust them to keep an eye on our son all the time. 


Now I sort of was overcome by anger. How could you allow your grandson to just go wherever and not know his exact whereabouts. They never even asked the parents permission to allow this. What if something happened. This church didnt have my son's information or anything. Seriously what if? 


I busted ass to go get him. Searched for The church I thought was it and we straight to it. The workers there were confused. At first they didnt even know who I was talking about. They didnt know who i was either. They wouldnt let me take my son (security reasons) so I had to let him ride the bus back to the grandparents house (which tbh was something I was wanting to avoid because I didn't want to start an arguement for the simple fact I am tired and not wanting to deal with this level of BS) 


But alas, the grandparents had their voice to speak in the matter. They feel like we dont trust them like we should. Saying other things like "" You're only upset because he went to church"" and ""A Little God wont  the kid"" and "" I Don't know why you're so upset, he had fun"" 


On the drive back home both my gf and I felt indifferent. Our son really did enjoy the church activities. It was a really nice church and everyone seemed really nice. I had no beef with them was nothing but nice with them and the same towards me. My only problem was with the grandparents.

It was so fucking uncomfortable and awkward, so I blurted, ""Dude, your breath is fucking *horrible*. I've tried telling you nicely and in private, but you keep not fixing it. Have a goddamn breath mint, and we'll all sit closer at the table. Don't want a breath mint? Then don't bitch when we don't want to sit near you sometimes.""

He got furious that I said this in front of everyone and left the group for that evening, saying that he'd never felt more humiliated in his life at a gaming group and that I didn't have to be so harsh. One of my players was grateful at my outburst (since him leaving meant they didn't have to smell his breath any more) but felt that I could have been way nicer about it & probably went overboard. One of my players thought my behavior was absolutely appalling and felt that I should have rode out the bad night, talked to everyone first, and then come up with a politer plan where we could all have had a gentle sit-down with him about the problem. One of my players 100% supported me and said that if he didn't want to get chewed out, maybe he should have listened when he got feedback before. We've all known each other a while, and I think my swearword-laden outburst may have torpedo'd my friendship with the bad-breath player, in all honesty. He said he isn't coming back to the game night. 

I kind of don't think he deserved any more polite approaches; I feel like he was an asshole to me for brushing me off when I was nice, so I feel justified in how I handled this even though I suspect it probably does make me the asshole. AITA?",34,33,0.85
1812,Not the A-hole,"This was like 12 years ago but these kind of things stick with me forever.  I actually lost my job shortly after this and the belief was that it was tied to this incident. Perhaps I'm looking for peace of mind, perhaps I'm looking to be put in my place here.

I used to stock groceries for a major chain.  We'd come in after closing time and stock overnight.  Everybody would get 1 to 2 aisles.  Some aisles (like baking goods) with heavier items would be given to pairs.  I was bounced around a lot - I'd do frozen because I have a high tolerance for cold (I wore fingerless gloves handling ice cream because..im an idiot - not important). 

One co-worker I'd get paired with was a dude with a hearing disability.  Sometimes he'd get paired with a second person and sometimes he'd get a really easy aisle like greeting cards.  

One night he got placed with me on baking goods, lots of 20kg bags of sugar, flour, etc.  He had a tendency to fuck off and do his own thing. I'd constantly have to ask when I get a new pallet if anybody had seen him.  Sometimes he'd be taking an unannounced break. Sometimes he'd be in another aisle entirely rearranging things that were already stocked.  About 8 hours in I got fed up. He had unpacked about 3 cases of product all night while I was doing a ton of heavy lifting and hadnt taken even my standard lunch break because our boss was a dick and I wanted to make sure the job was done before I could relax.  I lost my shit at my supervisor.

(paraphrased, its been a while)

S: Why's there still 3 pallets to unload?

Me: I have no help.  This is a two man job. Why does (coworker) even work here if he doesn't stock shelves? 

S: You know he's deaf right?

Me: I don't care. Does deaf mean he can't open boxes? Last I checked you don't need to hear to put cocoa powder \*here\* (I slammed a tin on the shelf)  I get paid the same as he does but I'm doing 10x the work. This is bullshit.  I haven't even had a break tonight.

The rest of the night he was moved to a different aisle (i think he was putting binge items at the cashiers tils) and I was ""punished"" by working baking alone.  I barely got everything stocked - but my shifts started to reduce.  I was there for about another two weeks before a (seemingly) unrelated incident where a boss tried to grief me for not doing enough work (solo'ing another two man aisle), proceeded to unload a single pallet by himself to ""prove a point"" - to which I told him ""I'm supposed to be impressed it took you twice as long to do half what I do"" before walking out. 

But back to the point - am i the asshole for being insensitive to his disability or am I right to be upset, albeit hostile, that he was getting a free pass for something unrelated while I was dogged with extra workload.",46,105,0.95

1814,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years, 2 month ago we found out she was pregnant. It was an accident so we both were in a bit of a shock but we decided that we wanted the baby. Still, my girlfriend would always make comments about having second thoughts or feeling uncertain. Last week while I was at work I got a call from her saying that she was at the hospital, she started bleeding at her work and her colleagues took her to the ER. She had miscarried and wanted me to go pick her up. For some reason the first thing that came to my mind was that she had done something to miscarry but since she was pretty shaken I decided to keep quiet. Fast forward to this week, the thought wouldn't get out of my head and I decided to ask her if there was something she wanted to tell me about the miscarriage. She started crying and called me an idiot, that she wanted the baby as much as I did and that it was hurtful to say that she had something to do with it, especially because she wanted to have control over it and keep the baby but I was accusing her of killing it instead. I apologised but I feel like if she did have something to do with it then I had the right as the father to know and the only way I could figure out was if I asked her about it.

Edit: I accept my judgement as the asshole and I will apologise to my girlfriend many more times. To clarify, I have no proof or anything that would make me question the truth of her story. I did it out of a feeling and the fact that she had shown uncertainty but thinking better about it now I see that even I had those moments myself and I should not have used her moments against her like this. To everyone that replied to this thread that had to go through something similar, I'm sorry and I apologise if my words brought out any hurtful memories.",226,913,0.91

1816,Everyone Sucks,"My (25M) roommate's (26M) two year anniversary was Monday and he wanted to celebrate with his girlfriend at our apartment Friday night. Last night he asked if I could spend the night somewhere else, so they could have the place to themselves. I told him that I was not comfortable doing that as I did not have anywhere else to go. He then asked again saying it was important, and be really helpful. I said I wouldn't stay out for the whole night but could do one of the two following things.

1. I leave the apartment from 5-10 to get dinner and see a movie, if he would pay for it. I told him that it would be about $30. 
2. I'll stay in my room from 5:30-11 and won't leave it. I would need to pick up dinner, so I would need extra time. If he wanted me in there earlier, he could grab my order on his way home from work. 

He said that both of those were unreasonable and that he leaves the apartment a lot, so I should return the favor. I'll admit I'm more introverted and work from home, so I only leave the apartment 2 or 3 times a week. However, I normally hang out in my room and don't hang out with them if they are here. 

I always thought you should give a gift, or treat someone if they were doing a favor for you. When i talked about it with some friends they were mostly on my side, but when I mentioned it to a couple of coworkers today they thought I should be nice and just go out for a bit. So AITA?",55,51,0.9

1818,No A-holes here,"I am the DM (the narrator) of a weekly campaign I host at my house. I work 3 days a week as my older brothers caretaker. He is wheelchair bound and has a few mental deficiencies due to over 40 brain surgeries. I have DM'ed smaller campaigns for him and the few friends we share, so he knows how to play.

When this campaign started, I would go to work and tell him about how the session went, what happened, and how I plan to have next session go. He would always be interested and usually comment afterwards about how he wished he could be there. The few times I have gone into detail about why that wouldn't be a good idea he has understood. I've told him that it's mostly roleplaying, not alot of combat (which is the exact opposite of what he is used to), I already have 4 people, which is the ideal size for a group, and it would mean he has to sleep over every Saturday, because we play until 12am and he lives 30 minutes away. 

Well, recently I told him about a big session he's been waiting to hear the outcome on. One of the things that happened was a players dad, who has experience in roleplaying games, sat in on the session to see what it was like and if he would like to join. He is very interested, and I would be happy to have him. When my brother heard this, he again brought up how he wants to play, and I said, ""I don't want to host you every weekend.""

I didn't phrase that very nicely, but he moved on and I ended work that day on an good note. The next time I talked to my mother, she brought it up.

Me = Me 
M = Mom

M: ""so you dont want your brother to come down to play D&D on fridays""

Me: ""I play Saturdays. I dont want to have him sleep over every weekend and I doubt he would too""

M: ""He wants to because he wants to be involved in D&D. How late do you play?""

Me: ""Until midnight""

M: ""So he could stay and we set up a time for me to get him? Or you to bring him home. Since you could count the time""

Me: ""I dont want to spend a day I reserve for friends and relaxation working with my brother""


And she has yet to respond. Her reference to me being able to ""count the time"" refers to my job as his caretaker. I could technically get paid because he is there.

I would like to know everyone's opinions on this. AITA?

A few more details:
My mother constantly tries to get me to do more than I should as a caretaker. She's almost always late home from work. I work 12 hours days pretty often. It's not a hard job, but its tiring. I feed all of her animals during the week, and she has a small farm. She even asked me to clean the gutters.

My brother is always on his phone, even when we play D&D. I will repeat myself more often than not and have to reexplain things constantly because he is not paying attention while we play. 

There isn't really room for him. Theres barely enough room for 4 people. I plan to have my players father join, and that's only possible if he sits in my computer chair and uses a dinner tray as a surface.",180,707,0.97

1824,Not the A-hole,"So, I'm pregnant and we find out the gender in 2 weeks ish. My partner and I basically already had our heart set on a boy name and a girl name. We agree on a few girl names but we literally only agree on one boy name. It also happens to be my mums maiden name, which is one of those names that could be used as a first name or last name, and is a good, classic name (think 'Elliott' or something similar).

We didnt pick it because it was my mums maiden name but I thought that she would think that it was sweet to have her family name continuing. When I told her that we loved that name, she said ""oh god no, I hate that name!"".

Her reasoning is that when she was a kid, there was a popular brand of a particular item of clothing with that name, so kids would tease her about it. As far as Im aware that brand doesnt exist anymore, and it is 100% not a weird name or one that would be picked on (which is part of the reason why I really like it).

So, WIBTA if I used it anyway? Obviously I dont want her to feel 'triggered' every time she sees her grandkid but Im pretty sure that she would forget about it pretty soon once she actually saw the kid and wasnt, like, only thinking about some random kids that teased her 40 years ago",35,63,0.89

The teacher sent me a link for a restaurant that would accommodate her and said I could get the food from there instead.

I said I couldn‚Äôt do that for the whole class but I could get the kid whatever she wanted from there alongside the other food.

1828,Everyone Sucks,"My sister Ruth and I have children around the same age. Her daughter Nicole is two years older than my son Jack. 

Jack did fairly well in school but not amazingly. He was always well behaved and was never in any trouble. Unfortunately not long after leaving school a friend of his (NOT Jack himself) got involved in something very serious, and Jack agreed to help. The result was both Jack and his friend being arrested and sent to prison. They both served over two years but are out now. 

Jack accepts that what happened was nobody's fault but his own. He's never tried to blame me or my husband for it and has taken responsibility. He has made efforts to get himself into work including getting himself professional qualifications for construction and maintenance work. Unfortunately Jack's conviction (possession of a firearm) is treated as extremely serious in the UK and as a result most companies won't even consider him, and the only employment he can get is for temporary agencies, which is OK, but it means he can spend days or even weeks out of work at times. He is constantly sending out job applications but either hearing nothing or getting rejected. 

Nicole is the total opposite. Very clever, academically gifted, pretty and successful. She's a corporate lawyer, and Ruth is always going on about how proud she is which she has the right to do. 

When Nicole was a teenager Ruth used to tell me about how her and her husband Owen were called into the school because Nicole had been bullying other girls. She didn't think much of it and thought it was harmless and nothing serious, but it was serious enough that they had to fight to stop her being expelled at least once, and Ruth still insisted that Nicole was not in the wrong. 

The reason I say this is that when I mention that Jack is currently out of work and how difficult he's finding it, Ruth shows no sympathy. She says that he made his bed and she doesn't feel sorry for him. She also called us bad parents who raised a criminal. I was fuming and shouted over the phone that Nicole wouldn't be where she was if they hadn't gone out of their way to protect her from the consequences. Ruth became very angry and said that you can't compare ''harmless teasing'' to what Jack did. 

I told Ruth that she was the bad parent. Jack faced the consequences for his actions and is making every effort to do better. I also told her Nicole didn't earn her success since she wouldn't have managed it if the school had succeeded in kicking her out. Ruth slammed the phone down, and when I told my hubby he thought while I had a point, it was better left unsaid. I disagree. She has been rubbing her daughter's unearned success in our faces for too long and I don't think it's wrong to point out her hypocrisy.",108,245,0.92

She got married about 3 years ago and during that time decided she was a alcoholic , No one in my family really understood this as she never really drank but we were very supportive and she started going to group and still does . Some time during group therapy she discovered she was gay, like a switch was flipped and all of a sudden gay culture is her life . she asked for a divorce got new gay friends , shaved one side of her head started wearing flannel shirts the whole shebang .  Again everyone was very supportive my mom thinks she is going through a mid life crisis but has kept that idea to herself so all she has seen and heard is absolute support. She started dating one girl (the rebound ) it lasted about 3 weeks now this second girl moved in with her after about a week of dating and seems like a huge leech on her side . On a side note she posted picture of her and her girlfriend and her 3 year old son in bed sleeping and she got in fight with people on facebook who said if they were two males who posted that picture it would be creepy witch i kinda of agree with because at this point they had only been dating for about 7 weeks . So anyway  i watch her boy for her every other weekend and he use to come with all these toys but now he only shows up with a little mermaid doll for some reason and she is always posting pictures of him in rainbow clothing and he is wearing skirts and dresses and he was never interested in this stuff before but she posts these pictures of him telling everyone he is obsessed with the little mermaid and dresses and he is so ""blended""  so i told her ""you know its ok to let him be a boy you dont have to treat him like hes a gay accessory"" She blew up on me saying it was his choice to dress like that and play with the toys he brings over ( i highly doubt that ) most of my family is on her side but my father and mother were happy someone said something .

When they do, I want to make it clear that I will not come unless my boyfriend comes too, because I want at least one person on my side so I don't get ganged up on. That's more or less the phrasing I plan to use.

So. Context. Last time I went home for a day, for my dad's birthday. We went to my aunts for dinner and my dad and my brother basically ganged up on me, with my brother constantly arguing gross racist shit and screaming in my ear with dad riling him up and encouraging him. They even mocked my brother's own girlfriend (a Southeast Asian woman) after she called to wish dad a happy birthday.

When my mam told him to leave me alone, dad said he was allowed to do what he liked because it was his birthday. After about two hours of this I ended up bursting into tears, partially from a sensory meltdown, at the dinner table and had to leave the table for a while before I could come back. When I came back, my dad patted my hand and said ""it's all good now"" so I know he's just swept this under the rug and won't change.

I love my aunts and I want to be able to visit them without the fear of this repeating, and I don't want to scapegoat my boyfriend either. I just don't want to be ganged up on like that again, I kept bursting into tears randomly for days afterwards.

My boyfriend doesn't give a fuck about my parent's opinion, he already didn't like them because of stuff I told him before this and his own interactions, but I feel incredibly guilty for ruining the relationship they could have had, especially since they respect him more than me, and I don't want to make it worse.

ETA: I forgot to add that my boyfriend works long hours and is fairly antisocial on his days off, so it'd usually be a no anyways. I'm just scared of making it seem like it's a no because of him rather than a no because *I* can't trust them to treat me decently if I don't have backup.",25,39,0.8
1840,Asshole,"I've been with my husband for 10 years, and he's known the entire time how badly I want to own a dog.  2 years ago I actually fostered a series of dogs to ""try out"" dog ownership for him and we got a few crazy dogs, but also a few cute ones that he seemed to enjoy (with some eye rolling). I had to stop because we moved.

Last week I told him I want to go to the shelter to pick out a dog to adopt. He told me he should get some say in it. It turns out he doesn't mean helping pick out *which* dog (which I would encourage!) -- it means whether or not I get a dog at all. He doesn't want us to have a dog because even if I do all the work, the dog will be hanging around in the common areas of our house, affecting him. He's afraid it will affect our social life because I might come home early to take care of it.  He's worried he might have to do some dog care if I get sick, or if he's alone in the house with it. Finally, he said ""You can have a dog when we have kids"".  He wants kids, but I don't. He says that's because our social life will change anyway when we have kids, but I feel it's manipulative.

Having a dog seems like a pretty reasonable life decision to me. I also make plenty of money and can afford doggy daycare, plus dog walkers anytime I want.

I feel this is ultimately my decision. He's not allergic, just, in my opinion, being selfish.  

AITA for getting a dog even if he doesn't want one?

1841,Not the A-hole,"This one happened ~6 years ago but I still think about it from time to time.

I was hired for my first job (a contract position) at a convention for my hobby. I was thrilled to work at a huge-name company with great benefits making cool things, and grateful to this manager for having taken a chance on me. After 6 months I was upgraded from contractor to full-time employee and moved from the large team I started at to an intimate team of 6 people, working directly under my manager as the only non-remote employee in our dept.

Our team worked crazy hours, got little sleep, and were threatened with being disbanded for months. We became very close under those adverse circumstances. Eventually we got out of the danger zone and were able to bring more members to the team, which was nice. The dynamic remained close and we continued to put in long hours. One night I was there at 2am with my manager, and we were drinking since it was after hours in a very alcohol-friendly company, and she confessed that she really liked me. She asked me to break up with my girlfriend and date her instead, semi-jokingly. I laughed it off and said I couldn't do that, but felt disquieted. 

The next day I was wary since I had no idea she felt that way up until then, and started to question if maybe I'd been hired for my appearance and not my work (the person I was hired to replace was my boss's ex (I later found out), and VERY similar in looks to me). My manager asked if I was okay and I said yes but decided to be distant, which changed the vibe. She crossed the line imo when she scheduled a 1:1 during work hours to ask if ""we were cool"" and to talk about interpersonal things. After that I felt her watching me constantly, she'd leave work the same time to talk to me in the parking lot, and would try to corner me to check in on things when I was by myself... eventually I asked a male friend to warn me when she was around because I was so stressed. Our coworkers noticed and I didn't want to tell them about everything so I brushed their questions off, but it was obvious I was avoiding her. The exec of the 10 person team also pulled me aside and asked if I was being harassed but I said no... this situation was made more complicated by the fact that she was trans, and I identified as such as well at the time but did not present. I didn't want to seem transphobic OR have to out myself if that came up. Our big boss was a very Baby Boomer kind of guy who made fun of minorities casually and I didn't want to disclose info to him in particular, although I'm sure he would have done something fair about it. Eventually the team began eating and spending time together without her and after 3 months of being shunned, she quit. 

In hindsight I feel like I contributed to bullying, BUT I also feel like she crossed a huge line with someone she had a lot of professional leverage over, and that I had no choice but to actively avoid her or expose both of us to some overpersonal corporate questions.",18,38,0.85

1843,Not the A-hole,"I'll start with I (26m) am divorcing my soon to be ex (26f) who we will call Becca. We were together for 3 years and dated for close to a year beforehand. We have 2 boys together (1 & 2) and she has a 4 y/o daughter who we will call Gabby, from a previous marriage that was over almost as soon as it started.

Things that need to be known beforehand

* We are divorcing because she cheated on me, we went to therapy, 2 weeks later cheated on me. While confronting her the second time she had an elaborate plan on how to handle divorcing. She thought this through, and despite saying things were getting better, she was just trying to see how long I'd pay her way through school before I caught her again.
* Another factor is she is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and has been extremely (and successfully) manipulative to me, friends, and family for financial gain, and validation.
* I have had an incident with the law in the past that is years and years old way before we got together, she knows about it, knows it's old news and not relevant to our lives today in any way. During arguments post-divorce she mentions she could say X and the police would believe her because of my past situation. Which is really messed up, since obviously none of that would be true and is ancient history.

I basically raised Gabby since she was 6 months old. However, when it comes to parenting I take the back seat because Becca won't let me parent my way when it's with her. She essentially is playing favorites or thinks that I'm treating her differently when I'm not (she's just older where my boys are too young to parent the same way). I've struggled with this for 4 years - it won't get better after a divorce. I haven't been able to make any real decisions that disagreed with Becca concerning Gabby and how to raise her.

Now, Becca asked me well what about Gabby? I answered I don't think it'd be wise for me to continue co-parenting because of Becca's manipulative track record, that it seems she is just trying to use me as child care so she can go party at night also called ""homework"", to use me to pay for half of Gabby's expenses, I feel like she'd use Gabby against me somehow in the future when it fits her agenda. I also mentioned she has 2 active parents and I just feel like I supervise. I did however offer to have her spend one weekend out of the month with the boys to still see me and when she becomes older she can make decisions on how we might proceed with a relationship. Becca blew up on me calling me an asshole, saying I'm abandoning my child. I disagree since I wasn't the one who chose any of this and was willing to work on OUR relationship before her cheating a second time and actively tried to work on our roles as parents since I've struggled with that as is. I never wanted to put kids in the cross-hairs of divorce, but I just feel like I need to step out as a parental figure and make this as simple as possible.

1845,Not the A-hole," 

Background - I have been friends with this dude for 13 years now, we met back in college. we were in each other's weddings, I was at the birth of both kids, and almost every Sunday for the past two years, my wife and I go over to their place to hang, have lunch, and play with their kids, ages 5 and 2.

Anyway, my wife (J) posted on facebook about a month ago about the something she disappoved of, and my friend's wife (S) went off because it was something she supported wholeheartedly. Lots of nasty comments on facebook, both on the post and in chats.

J and I are rather upset about this since we could have talked about it at any of the Sunday lunches, not had a blow up on a public forum.

J and I figure its time to talk, try to clear the air, and try to discuss how we can communicate better to avoid future blow ups. As we are feeling vulnerable and this is a serious conversation, we want to have it at a neutral location and requested they leave their kids behind so as to limit distractions. (I should mention this is taking place over text in a group chat since that's how we normally communicated)

This did not go over well. Every suggestion we made was met with questions and push back. Why the talk, why neutral location, why no kids? Multiple times throughout the texts saying how inconvenient it all is for them. Finally decided to discuss it later. 

S has since unfriended us on facebook and we haven't received a single text from them in 3 weeks.

I just...I worry that we made too strict of demands for the talk. I feel like our request was reasonable, but now that things have ended...I'm conflicted. Are we the assholes? Should we have sent more messages, reached out more, just met at their place despite our misgivings? Why was the onus completely on us to do these things though?",50,264,0.92
1846,Asshole,"When I was a teen you could say I was a rebel. When I was my son's age (15) I was already going to parties of my older friends, drank alcohol and barely passed classes.

I dont want to make excuses but my parents never cared about my education, my mother dropped out of High School and my father believed ""men learn more from life than from any book"" and that ""a diploma is just a piece of paper good for wiping your ass""

Only thanks to a good amount of luck, hard work (after life kicked me in the ass) and my FIL giving me a chance to be a part of the family business I fortunately ended up fine.

Now, me and my wife give a lot of attention to our sons education. Usually there was no bigger issues but recently some of his privileges got taken away because of a bad grade. Standard thing in our household so there wasnt even backtalk, he expected as much.

Until he went back from my parents and they told him all about my teenage antics. He accused me of hypocrisy, how compared to my history he could be a straight C student and still be better than I was back then so how can I treat him like a prisoner, was very upset and never said so explicitly but he definitely views me as a huge ass.

Usually I dont take tantrums to heart, god knows even adults can say things they dont mean then, but it got me thinking. I ask him to maintain only As and Bs (preferably As), I dont jail him for less but I do take away entertainment and technology and my wife tutors him until he gets the subject which sometimes cause him to sit with her for hours studying. But he isnt a bad student, most subjects come easy to him and he often gets As without much effort outside of school. But I also know he is 100% right, even if he only got Cs he would still be a much better student than I ever was not to mention he gets way less freedom than I did. I imagine I would be mad too, were I in his shoes.

I guess what Im asking is, AITA for expecting him to excel in school when I was barely passing?",52,36,0.89

My gf on the other hand is a lot like my mother and believes a 5 min shower is what everyone should do. If shes in our apartment when I shower, I'll get the knock on the door to hurry up and finish after about 15 min. 

Due to our schedules, I usually shower in the morning while shes at work so she doesnt see how long I take. Today i went on a run while she was still here and had to shower right after. I made it a 15 min shower for her sake, even though I prefer 30 - 45 min showers. (Well within my rights since I pay for the water all myself). 

Since i felt shorted, hours later while shes still at work, I decided to hop in to relax for another 15 - 20 min. Sadly, she happened to come home early this day. She asked why I was in the shower again. 

I lied and played dumb and said that I forgot i had taken a shower earlier since it's not my normal routine. I really dont think she bought it but she let it go. Was I an asshole for lying about it?

1849,Asshole,"So today I came home from college (Britain, so American High School, I think). The second I walk through the door my mum tells me that her grandma's sister has died. ""Your great aunt Wyn died and the funeral will probably be soon."" My first thoughts were 'Who?' and 'Why is she telling me this?' I have actually never heard this name before or met this person besides the one time I found out today I had met her when I was still extremely young and unable to walk for myself. This turned into a slight argument as, for some reason, she wanted me to go this funeral, despite knowing I am a really awkward person at funeral's for people I've met more than once, let along a funeral for someone I've met only once and have no idea who is part of the family.   The argument ends with her trying to guilt-trip me by outright just saying ""Fine, I'll go on my own."" in a really sulky way.  


Her only arguments for me going were that I'd be going out of 'respect' and support for her, despite that she has never once mentioned this great aunt to me even though she supposedly played a massive hand in raising her as my grandmother, and that it's one of the few times we'll see the much larger branch of the family where it's likely to be a few hundred of us, about 10 of which I have seen more than once but still at most 10 times, maybe not even that. To me, it would feel like gatecrashing the funeral for someone else's family and that, even though I am part of the family, no one would want me there since I do not know nor did I know the person who died. I don't know how much this takes precedence over everything else but it felt like it had to reiterated a lot - I have never met this person besides the one time she met me when I was either 1 or 2 years old and the name has never been mentioned to me before now, at least not to my recollection.

Kirsty was and is devastated and hasn't been doing much except crying in her room and going out clubbing with her friends.

Given that she has no chance of getting back into her career, I've been encouraging her to try to find some entry level work like retail/shop work or something like that.

1852,No A-holes here,"My wife has always wanted to be an author.  We met at university where we initially bonded over being in a totally alien environment: we both come from poor families and ended up attending Oxbridge  ‚Äî both of us first in our families to attend any university.

Upon graduation, given the lack of a safety net / financial support from her family, she needed to earn money and got a job in consultancy. However, she has never stopped writing for enjoyment: she often wakes up at 5am to write before work. Furthermore, she hates her job: it seems to be a terrible mix of (a) high stress, (b) low impact work and (c) difficult personalities.

I work in finance and fortunately earn more than enough for the both of us (low 7 figures) and think she should quit her job and follow her passion: even if she doesn‚Äôt become an author, she clearly hates what she is doing and we don‚Äôt need her salary, worst case scenario is that she ends up trying out a huge range of opportunities.

I suppose part of my frustration lies in that I feel that if you have a safety net (which my wife now has), you almost have a moral obligation to take risks. There are so many people working jobs they hate just to make ends meet that you‚Äôre squandering an opportunity others would kill for.

When I bring this up to my wife, she always replies with ‚Äúyeah maybe‚Äù but nothing ever happens ‚Äî even though she complains every week about how much she hates her job. These conversations are making me increasingly frustrated but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm expecting too much from her or not.

1856,Not the A-hole,"Sounds obvious, but my roommate keeps making remarks about it and I'm sensitive. I'm 23F if that makes a difference

I have a pretty small room, but my bed is pretty big - it's a queen size that takes up about half the room's space. I don't have a lot of stuff, but what I do have takes up the rest of the space in the room, so I don't have any other furniture except a dresser. I'm making plans to move out, so I've been packing the stuff I need to take with me in the car, in the duffel bags like clothes, my most important documents, photo albums, etc. Stuff I don't want to lose basically, very important to me so I don't want them elsewhere. I can't take them out of my room because my mom will throw my shit away. 

enter my roommate - he moved in a few months ago, and I told him I would stuff all my stuff in the closet to make room for his bed to put a bed in here, or a couch, or something for him to sleep on. He got too lazy (his words) and his old roommates threw his bed out because he left it there for ages and didn't bring it with him, so he's been sleeping in my bed (there's nothing I can do about this, I really REALLY am not comfortable with the arrangement at all but my mom's word is pretty much law and she told me to deal with it. I didn't even want a roommate but conceded) 

so, two people in a queen size bed. big enough for us, yeah. Now that I've started packing stuff though, my duffel bags need to go SOMEWHERE and they're too big to fit on the dresser (small dresser) and James' (not real name) stuff is on top of it anyway, and there is seriously no other furniture in the room to put them on, nor floor space after James added his stuff to the pile of stuff in here. So what I ended up doing was putting the large one at the head of the bed where my head goes, and the smaller one going lengthwise like a third body in the bed. they don't encroach past ""my"" half of the bed, I snuggle the one going lengthwise and have barely any room in the bed, only way it works is because I'm 5ft tall and fit there. 

My roommate keeps making comments about them, like ""when are you going to move out? I'm tired of sleeping with your duffel bags"" and ""if you didn't have so much shit we wouldn't have to sleep with duffel bags"". 

My take on it is, they're on my side and I gave him the chance to bring his bed in here. I offered to get rid of my bed so we could get two twin beds, but he said he likes the queen bed too much. I also want a barrier between us now because he accidentally starts snuggling me in the middle of the night sometimes and I hate it. (I'm not concerned past that though, he's very very gay). This is also my bed, I didn't ask him to move in with us and sleep in it. He even complains that they're there when I'm not sleeping in the bed, where there's MORE room??

I have recently switched to a vegan diet due to environmental and ethical reasons. All my close friends know this.

We usually go for a fancy dinner from time to time as an event (approximately 4 times a year), with one of my close group of friends (we're 5).

Recently a dinner of such was being planned. All 5 of them know that I eat vegan. I have kindly asked if we could pick a place where I could order a regular dish, but I did not require a strictly vegan restaurant, as it's their decision what they decide to eat. We live in a capital city in western europe, meaning there are plenty of such places.

However, my friends have mocked me for my decision to not eat animal products and have chosen a place without a single vegan option, joking along ""it won't hurt once in a while"", ""just half a year ago we were in a steakhouse with you"", ""give up your trendy diet and eat like a normal person"" etc. I said that it's rude to not respect my choices and that it's also insensitive due to the fact that they can eat vegan food with no issues, but I don't want to eat non-vegan food. Besides, there are places that offer both options and I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant to eat grilled veggies and plain rice.

They have decided to run the event anyway and organized it in a restaurant that had ONE vegetarian option and no vegan option - meat included in all dishes. I think this is really disrespectful and if it was meant as a joke, it's a very bad one.

Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster. Also, sorry if the grammar is a trainwreck. Trying to not make this terribly long.

Backstory: I (F22) have had anxiety and depression since highschool and developed anorexia when I was in college. Growing up my mom always said she was ""body positive"" and that she wanted us to not care about how we looked. However for as long as I can remember she made fun of larger people. Whenever we would see someone larger in public she would talk about them and poke fun (not to their faces) Every. Single. Time. She tied weight to equal intelligence, worthiness, attractiveness,  ect. She would even tease my sister about having a ""big"" butt when she was 15 at 5'2"" and 110lbs. My mom always made comments on the food that I ate, prompting me to never eat in from of her (starting in HS). Everything totalled in me being extremely self conscious of my weight. I truly believed (and still kind of do) that weight equals self worth.

Never told anyone about my ED for a long time until about a year ago. I reached out to friends and teachers for help and they were absolutely amazing, from that I have been able to better cope. I also talked with my mom. I asked her on at least 3 occasions to let me start going to therapy and every single time she has shot me down. She has had mental health problems in the past, which she got through without therapy and her reasoning is that I too should be able to manage without. She thinks that it's all scam and she doesn't want to waste our insurance and money on it. I've only just graduated and haven't found a job yet so paying for therapy myself isn't an option. 

Recently we were having a conversation about my ED and she kept saying how she always loved me and has no idea where this is coming from. That she never commented on my weight and she always encouraged us (children) to love ourselves ect. Basically gassing herself up as this perfect mother. I was pretty silent and didn't say anything back and the conversation pretty much ended. 

So reddit: WIBTA if the next time my mom brings it up I let her know what's really the truth. That she is the reason I have such an unhealthy relationship with food and weight. That she's the reason my sister also developed anorexia around my age. That she's not the totally amazing mother she's making herself out of be? 

Truth is that I love my mom, but this resentment has been building inside of me for so long.

1862,Everyone Sucks," Me \[33F\] and my bf \[32M\] have been together 2 years. When we met he was living with his parents\*, and I was new to the area with a 1-bed apartment. I work an office job, regular 9-6 + occasional weekends for deadlines. He‚Äôs a freelance arts teacher, part-time hours, and they can be at a different school every day. His salary's not 100% stable, but on average I make about 3x his wage. The rent on my place eats about a third of my salary.

He's such a sweet, creative guy and I fell for him from the first date - we're inseparable and he's been staying at my place 5 nights a week basically from the day we hooked up. 2 mornings a week he teaches at schools near his parents' place, and so those days he sleeps back with his folks otherwise he'd have to get up like an hour earlier if he stayed over with me. It sucks 'cos I want to go to sleep next to him every night, but nobody wants to get up at 5am, so I don't feel emotionally abandoned or anything by this.

But: in these 2 years he hasn't contributed a cent of rent. He contributes ""in kind"" a bit - cooks maybe a couple of meals a week (I can't cook, we dine out for the rest), does the washing up (though not very well, grr). Meanwhile, he pays rent to his parents for those 2 nights a week, whereas he's in my apartment 5 nights a week. So, the other day we had That Conversation: I said that I want us to live together officially, I want us to be a household, and that means him making reliable contributions. I don't need his money to make rent, but, I guess... I want his commitment, his investment? Idk if that makes sense. If we split the rent 50/50 that would be 1/2 of his salary going to rent, 1/6th of my salary going to rent.

I thought this was entirely reasonable - romantic, even, we were finally going to have Our Home, not just My Home!

Well. Nope. I got a lot of pushback. ""I'm so poor compared to you, it's not fair that you're asking for 50/50 when you make so much and I make so little""; ""I'd still have to send money to my parents\*, they're my parents, I can't just cut their income stream without warning""; ""If I have to pay rent I'll have no savings or security!""; ""If I do this, you'll pay for us whenever we go out to eat right? I won't be able to afford to go to restaurants or movies with you otherwise""; ""You'd be lonely if I didn't come over, I‚Äôm doing you a favor""

I was astonished. I was crying by the end of the conversation. I don't feel like I'm asking for something unreasonable. I'm not asking him to start contributing to my saving-to-buy-a-house fund that I hope he'll live in with me one day, I'm just asking for an equal split of the month-by-month, fundamental price of keeping a roof over both our heads. AITA?

- she would rarely eat the food we cooked instead shed eat my friends food i had to replace (she never offered to pay for her own food unless it was fast food) 
- she would use up all my gas money when i had to take her to visit her friends. despite having $200 pocket cash and watching me struggle with money
- she ended up putting $5.00 in gas but yelled at me as she did so. this was about one fifth what she actually used. i didnt complain
- she promised my friends 15 year old sister shed take her for ice cream. when the time came to do it she refused saying ‚Äòi thought she would have had money for this shit‚Äô she thought the 15 year old would be paying for them.
- i ended up paying for them to get ice cream so the kid wasnt upset
- i started having to clean up after her every night. food wrappers, plastic cups, dirty laundry. she sat in a chair with a blanket a dog pissed on for several hours and ruined the chair. 
- she starting saying rude things about me to the 15 year old who came to me upset because it made her uncomfortable. i just let it go to keep the peace
- she left one night and offered to get us food i agreed
- she later said she wouldnt be home for a long time 
- i told her id go get the food she could just pay it back on zelle and wed still very much appreciate it. (The kid needed dinner and to go to bed)
- she said i was using her for money and being disrespectful etc i told her that wasnt my intention the kid just needed to get to bed
- she began a long fit of name calling i found out she was at my estranged families house
- i told her i couldnt do it anymore she needed to come get her things and go stay at their place
- i let her have the gifts , packed her stuff neatly and let her go
- she sent me a long text saying i needed to learn respect etc i had gained weight and looked like our dead father etc never speak to her or the rest of the family again

I recently got back on good terms with my mother and weve gotten better. im glad to have her in my life. she knew none of this and said my sister only told her i took all her money. shes angry i wont talk to my sister because apparently she feels very isolated from her siblings

I want to thank everyone and him for their opinion. Theres nothing wrong with seeing different perspectives. I know i can learn a little from both.

1866,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few months back, but it came up again Sunday night.

My brothers both in their 30s(I am too) were dropped off at my house.  They were at my Dad's house eating dinner or something.  My Dad had to go into his job for two hours for something.

Well my kids were playing downstairs.  My wife's parents were over.

I was in my office updating some files from work.

Well my brother goes out on the front porch and lights up blunt, and starts smoking.  Weed is legal in our state now, but wasn't when it happened.

I smell it, get upset, and tell him he has to leave.  My other brother says I am overreacting, and I use to break rules when I was a kid.  I tell him to hit the road too if he has a problem with my behavior/decision.

So both of my brothers were kicked out of the house around 9-10PM and they live 15 miles away, they started walking somewhere My dad retrieved them from a Mcdonalds a couple miles away..

My Dad isn't mad at me, he is on my side.

This came up again, because my Dad wants me to have Thanksgiving dinner at my house this year.  I said sure, but my brothers need to apologize, or they can eat at the kids table in the other room. My Dad says the apology request is reasonable, but if they refuse just say they aren't welcomed. Don't make them eat dinner with the kids.

Because of my Dad's health, I don't want to completely ice them out, but I want them to know I want an apology.

AITA for demanding an apology, or else, at thanksgiving dinner, I am going to have them sit at the kids table, in another room.

*edit*\* kicked my brother out because he tried to act like it wasn't a big deal, he said ""it's this city"" the police don't care, they have real crime.

Second, he has been unemployed for 2 years and stays in a reduced rent unit(by about $300/month) of a building myself and my Dad own (at Dad's request).

Lastly,he has a small child at home too. Which means he probably is getting high and not working.

I can admit I was frustrated with him I had to take a 1/2 day off of work to let some workers in the building, because he said he was busy 2 weeks prior. But he has no job. So that's why the short fuse.

My other brother getting thrown out was because he said I should be more considerate of my other brothers situation. That brother has mental health issues and my Dad pays his rent. I told him him I'm listening to someone I have to buy toiletpaper and toothpaste for. And if he thinks I'm wrong he can go too. I'm not debating acceptable behavior with grown adults in my house around my kids and wife.

&#x200B;

\*\*edit\*\*

FYI - The kids table thing is about, my brothers coming into my home, eating and celebrating a day of thanks and unity. If they can't apologize, I don't want to sit there faking like everything is okay, an argument can happen tensions will be high. So instead of that, they can sit somewhere else. I'll sit at the kids table for all I care. I don't want this issue pestering before an apology can be made. Humiliating them wasn't the idea, it was non-contact if they refused to apologize.",118,350,0.92
1867,Asshole,"Two friends (Chris and Tom) and I bought tickets to go to a convention this weekend around six months ago as soon as tickets went live. We were all excited to go during the summer months and it was talked about quite a bit. Chris offered his car so we could drive to the convention and save money by not having to rent a car or pay for tickets.

After the start of the semester, my friend Chris started hunting for jobs. He got a position as an part-time EMT and my other friend T, and I were obviously very excited for him. The job however, has an orientation that is the same weekend as our convention. Chris decided to bail on the commitment we made 6 months ago to go to his job orientation. Now we have no way to get to our convention unless we spend money to rent a car, which is a big unexpected expense. Chris offered to pay half of our rental car fee but as our friend we want him there with us too. 

The reason I am upset is because there is another job orientation in a month that he could attend, but he is afraid of the possibility that the company will revoke the job offer if he decides to postpone the orientation by a month. To this I said to contact the company and former employees to see if it was something they might do but he has yet to do so. 

AITA for being upset that he backed out on a commitment we made half a year ago? The commitment is more important to me than the money.",41,33,0.79

My little brother is 11, we have two PS4s in the same room, our internet is pretty crappy that if someone uses their phone in the room, it would occasionally make the online games we play lag. Also if someone ever was downloading/updating something in the house, it would make everyone lag.

My little brother was playing fortnite and he was lagging a lot, when I went to check my PS4 I was updating RDR2 which is one of my favourite games. It said it approximately took about 10 mins but my little brother wants me to stop it instantly, I said no, because it only took 10 mins and also he could play an offline game. He has frequently updated games when I'm playing an online game so I switch to offline games. When things don't turn to his favour he would tell my parents and there is a 99% chance that they will be on his side since he was the one who was complaining first and he did that, but this time my parents weren't on his side and when that happens, he starts crying about it. It's annoying when he doesn't have any independence to deal with situations like this, he could have easily played an offline game but he didn't. After the update finished he was very salty at me, he likes to hold grudges when those kind of situations happen like this.

1875,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I had been dating for around 4 months and it came time for him to go back to school in the city. I made weekend trips on the bus to go down and see him and some weekends I would arrive earlier than others so he gave me the password to his computer so I could play games/watch videos or whatever while he was in class.

His Google Chrome homepage showed the frequently visited websites while showing a little thumbnail of the website. This time something caught my eye, it was a One Drive page and by the looks of the thumbnail there were nude women on it. I was curious so I clicked and was brought to a folder filled of pictures of his ex girlfriend. All the ones I initially saw were old, I knew this because she was from my hometown. I was rather upset, mainly because a few months prior I found out he had been going out to lunch/dinner with this girl when he would tell me he was hanging out with friends. He told me he wasn't lying because she is just a friend so I let it go. I kept looking and came across more recent photos. I could tell they were recent since she had just gotten a tattoo and dyed her hair which were both visible in the pictures.

I was hurt to find out he was lying about them being just friends and I was almost certain this was the end of our relationship. He always talked bad about his ex's, breakups never seemed like they were his fault and his ex's were ""crazy bitches"" or whatever. This is not something I wanted him telling his friends about me, mainly because we live in a small town so our friend groups overlap and word gets around quickly.

I reached out to his best friend, who at the time was seeing one of my close friend, and approached him in a way which seemed like I needed advice. I made the conversation seem like I was reaching out to him because he knew my ex long before I was in the picture and therefore would be able to tell me if this was characteristic of him. Honestly, I just wanted to show him pictures/proof that he had been cheating on me so if our relationship ended he couldn't try to spin the truth to make me look bad. 

Looking back on it now I can't help but feel like a petty asshole for exposing him to his best friend (who eventually told all of his friends). It really wasn't a problem that concerned them therefore I had no reason bringing it up to them. I just did it to cover my ass in-case he tried to make it seem like I was a crazy jealous girlfriend who didn't want him being friends with an ex. I wanted to get my side out before he had a chance to possibly spin the truth which I was just making assumptions about him doing in the first place. I believe he is for sure an asshole for what he did but am I also one for bringing his friends into this for selfish reasons?

Edit: For clarification I did NOT show his friend the girls nudes. I sent him a photo of the folder name which was titled ‚Äú(ex‚Äôs name) nudes‚Äù. My apologies should have mentioned what I meant by pictures given the context.",342,2998,0.96

1878,Not the A-hole,"I'm off work for several months due to an injury. My friends and I decided to start a book club while I'm off, which meets at my house weekly (I'm centrally located and have mobility issues atm). 
One of my friends (we'll call her Samantha) has a 13-year-old, an incredibly sweet boy we'll call John. She asked if she'd be able to bring him along once in awhile when her husband isn't available to watch him. John has Autism and it isn't safe to leave him alone at home. I told her of course, he's welcome here at any time. I did ask, however, that she give me a heads up beforehand if John is coming. I have two rescue dogs that are inexplicably terrified of children. They've never growled or snapped at a child but I do fear what they would do if cornered, so when family and friends bring their children over, my dogs go to my bedroom with the door closed, where they can relax.
Samantha has started to bring John to each book club meeting, and the last three times hasn't bothered to let me know that he'll be joining us. The first time he came over, I asked him if he'd like to stay in the living room with us, but Samantha said he was ""Fine to just explore the house"". I should have spoken up then and there but was worried about offending her or John. 
Whenever John comes over, his mother does tell him to stay out of my kitchen, as he has a big sweet tooth and his parents are trying to get him to eat healthy. However, several times I've gone into the kitchen to get more coffee and found him eating (once, half a box of cupcakes that I had bought for my nieces who would be visiting the next day).
I'm asking this now, because at our last meeting, I got up to use the bathroom and found John trying to open the door to my bedroom (where my dogs were). His mother is very aware that I do not want my dogs let out when any child is in my home. She's talked to John about not going near my closed bedroom door. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about what could have happened and am thinking about disbanding the book club rather than offend my friend. I did quietly mention it to her when I returned to the living room and she briefly got up to tell John to find something to do. But she made no effort to ensure he was staying entertained. I do try to put out things for him to do while he's here, like video games and my laptop.

1880,Asshole,"So I've got into the habit of going to the gym 2-4 times a week in the morning before work. To stave off getting really hungry at the gym, I'll have a meal replacement drink while I work out and I normally have my protein shake after as well.
Problem is that means having 2 bottles at the gym with me and having to drink them both within 1.5 hours (I add milk to my protein shake to increase my calorie/protein intake) and I end up feeling really gross and full.
I've got a new bottle that has a container cup that screws to the bottom that I can put the protein powder in and mix with milk and water later.

1881,Asshole,"I had my youngest daughters open house last night.  My ex wife brought her boyfriend.  I have no problem with the guy as I've known him for a very long time and he is a former neighbor of our old martial home.  I told her that it was uncalled for to have him there.
The reason that i said this to her was I feel that the open house and the schooling is about our girls.  Having to walk around the school with them and having her introduce to the teachers that this is her boyfriend made me very uncomfortable.  I put my best foot forward and tried to not let it get to me but it did.  That's why i said what i did.  I feel that she should be able to put an hour aside, for the sake of our girls, to have just their mom and dad there.  Since the divorce (2 years ago) we have only had 2 instances where it was my girls, ex wife and I.  I don't like being around her considering how things ended between us. I put that aside though for the sake of my girls.  I think it is very important to show my girls that their dad and mom can be there for them when needed.  
She justified him being there by saying that he lives with her and is a part of their life.  I do not dispute that and have accepted it.  He coaches all my daughters extra curricular activities, therefore he is always around. 
The reason i'm posting is that my eldest daughter's open house is tonight and i don't want him there.  She even texted me later that evening.  She wondered why i said what i did.  She also acknowledge the awkwardness for the both of us.  Having her admit that, makes it seem like i'm right that he shouldn't be there.  So reddit AMIA?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses. It's helping see things a different light.  I do admit that this was more about how i was feeling.  I'm very active in my girls lives and was a stay-at-home dad until the divorce and i have 50/50 custody.  The other thing is I too am in a committed relationship.  I've talked to my eldest about bringing my girlfriend around to her softball games and other activities (not open house).  She started crying and told me that she didn't want her mom to feel uncomfortable.  Therefore i haven't brought her to anything and attend her events by myself to please my daughter.

I am pretty independent, except for the fact that my parents are contributing the equivalent of 230 dollars a month for my rent (in reality this means that i can afford to have a car) (this will become relevant later)  


My sister has two kids aged 4 and 1. They are generally nice, but i don't really want to interact with them beyond the bare minimum. Yesterday around 6pm my sister called me, and asked me to watch her kids for the night. Apparantly her husbands parents (my sisters in-laws) had been in a nasty car crash, and they suspected that her FIL had some sort of head/spine injury (idk the details), so they had been taken to the ER in an ambulance.   


I told my sister i couldn't watch the kids. She asked me why, and i told her that i had to go to the gym, and work tomorrow, which was the truth. My sister lives 30 minutes away, so if i had to watch the kids i would need to drive over there, and have a really long commute for work. If i had to drop off the kids at daycare i might even be late for work, either way it would be really disrupting for my schedule.  I also didn't want to miss going to the gym. I know that it's a pretty minor thing, but routine is very important to me, since i am a pretty busy guy, and i had been looking forward to getting a good workout in.   


Anyways, my sister got pretty mad. She is usually pretty chill, but when i told her i couldn't watch her kids she just said ""are you for real"". She told me it was an emergency, and that she really needed help, but i still told her no. Then she said ""you are fucking unbelieveable"" and hung up.   


Tbh. i felt a little bad, but on the other hand her kids is not my responsibility. However, this morning i woke up to some pretty pissed of messages from my parents. They live about 5 hours away, so they couldn't watch the kids, and apparantly my sister ended up bringing them to the ER. My mother sent me a long text saying that they had raised me better than this, and that they thought we were the kind of family that helps each other out. She also wrote that they will no longer be contributing any money to my expenses.  They didn't even bother calling me to hear my side of the story.

Then a week later I invite her to go see IT and asked her if I should pre book the tickets, she said yes. Then the day of the movie she texts me again telling me she's still too ill.

She then went to go see it with her sisters a few days later, which really got under my skin. 

So on the third week a few days after telling her she's been acting a bit dismissive lately (she mentions she was at the walk in and got antibiotics and apologises) we make plans for her to come over.

Then once again she sends me a text the day of saying she's too ill to come over. I told her she could come over and lay on the sofa with me and I'll make some thing to eat but she said there is no point to her moving from one sofa to another.

This pissed me off so I told her to suit herself and decided to ghost her for a few hours. After a while she asked me if I was pissed and I admitted I was. This began an argument about how I don't consider how she was feeling over these past few weeks and how I shouldnt feel as though I was being neglected.

1910,No A-holes here,"Background:

I was married for 12 years to my ex. She's never been diagnosed with a mental illness, but only because she's always refused to talk to anyone about it, I asked/ pleaded, but no dice. She had a noticeable anxiety issue when I married her, but being young and dumb, I assumed my unconditional love would fix it. 

I was wrong, and her mental health gradually got worse over our marriage, especially after significant life events like a stillborn child. She self-medicated by getting more and more religious.

She'd always believed in homeschooling and our marriage ended because I realised that it was doing a disservice to our children and wanted them to at least try school - it ended because by that point, homeschooling had become a directive from God for her. 

Anyway, after the separation, she spiralled, to the point that I ended up with full custody of our five kids. I've had then fulltime for just over a year. They haven't seen her since as she left the country afterwards and so has never used her supervised access. 

Scenario:

In a wide ranging discussion with my two oldest boys (11 and 14), the separation came up and Master 11 said ""I'm glad you got full custody, Mum was cuckoo"", rather sneeringly.

I told him (after telling him not to talk about his Mum in that tone) ""Your Mum has mental health issues, but that's okay, nearly everyone will have a challenge like that in our lives, but the problem was your Mum didn't treat it. There's lots of support that help people with mental health issues to heal and live good lives""

I feel like TA because I felt like I was trash talking his Mum. I've done my absolute best to avoid that, and this felt like that. 

It felt like my only other option was to shut down the conversation, because trying to deny she has mental health issues wouldn't fly, my children have experienced her behaviour and formed their own opinions. 

And I was worried that he'll develop a poor attitude towards people with mental health challenges based on his Mum, so I wanted to explain that a) they're reasonably common and b) usually treatable. 

So yeah was ITA? And if anyone has advice on how they'd approach it, please hit me with it :)",20,42,0.86

My dad avoids her for this reason, making sure never to be on he same floor as her at the same time. 

I(18) have three younger siblings, two of which are sisters who cannot remember my parents being together(ages 10 and 13). Whenever anything goes wrong, my mom blames my dad, regardless of whether or not the issue has anything to do with him. She‚Äôs late to pick someone up? It‚Äôs because my dad is a lazy asshole who doesnt do any work. Things like that. She constantly berates him and portrays him as a horrible human being to my sisters, who are easily impressionable and have picked up my moms habit of blaming everything that goes wrong and every personality fault they have on my dad. I can tell it nearly kills him to know that they have been conditioned by my mom to believe that he doesn‚Äôt love them. He doesn‚Äôt argue with her criticisms of him though(unless it is ever suggested he cares less about us than she does) and typically just takes the abuse.

A few weeks ago my 13 year old sister made an offhanded comment about my dad going on dates with other women while they were together  ‚Äúbreaking mom‚Äôs heart‚Äù while the 10 year old was also in the room. While my dad believes that my parents marriage should not be discussed with my younger sisters, my mom had heavily insinuated over the years that he cheated on her. My dad, not wanting to further involve them, stayed out of it. But I was pretty pissed about the way my dad is treated and so I took the opportunity to inform them that it was my mom who cheated on my dad and that while it is true he went on dates with other women, this came after my mom informed him she wanted a divorce. My mom is pissed at me and my dad said that I should have stayed out of it. AITA for telling them anyways?

It didn't matter if it was something you poured your heart and soul into , or a handful of dirt , she'd despise it all the same.

1916,No A-holes here,"Just to quickly explain our finances, my husband and I have our salaries deposited into a joint checking account, then we each get a weekly ‚Äòallowance‚Äô into our own personal checking accounts. This money is total blow money, to use however we like. Neither of us have ever paid bills etc with our own money. We live comfortably but in an expensive city, so on the frugal side. 

I tend to save my money for vacations. I‚Äôll eat breakfast at home and take lunch to work, not buy a lot of ‚Äòfun‚Äô stuff, then go on a couple of vacations a year. My husband spends all of his money on breakfast lunch and coffee every day, and buying video games. I‚Äôm TOTALLY fine with this. I choose to sacrifice those things to go on vacations alone or with my girlfriends. I also took him to the Bahamas for his birthday in June, paid for 100% from my spending money. I go abroad about twice a year. 

We live across country from our hometown in SC. Since we‚Äôve been married I‚Äôve always said I‚Äôm happy to go home for Christmas every second year, and we‚Äôve done this for the last four years. We went back for Christmas last year. When we go home for Christmas we pay for it from the main account. It tends to make the budget a little tight for the last quarter of the year since flights are expensive from San Francisco to Charleston, especially over the holidays, and we end up doing a lot while home, like going out for meals multiple times a day with different people. 

My husband has recently started mentioning that he wants to go home for Christmas this year even though we went last year, and asked if we could move things around in the budget to make that happen. 

I don‚Äôt want to go. I don‚Äôt consider going home a vacation or a break at all. It‚Äôs very emotionally draining, it‚Äôs physically draining since we need to catch up with at least a dozen friends and family members in a short amount of time. We stay with his parents, and I have to sleep on the floor on a spare mattress because they only have a twin from when he was still single living at home, and they still have his younger siblings in the house. I just don‚Äôt consider this a holiday. Additionally, it takes away from my PTO that I would prefer to use on an actual vacation that I enjoy. 

So I told my husband that if he wants to go home for holidays separate from our ‚Äòdesignated‚Äô years, he needs to pay for it from his own spending money. I pointed out that I‚Äôd paid for him to go to the Bahamas, and that it makes me feel like I‚Äôm sacrificing doubly by having to make room in the joint budget to go on a trip that I don‚Äôt even enjoy and that leaves me emotionally and physically drained. 

He said I was being unreasonable, and it was my choice to not buy food out to go on vacation. I just think that if he wants to go so badly, he should pay for it since this isn‚Äôt something I enjoy doing.

1921,Not the A-hole,"Hi, this is a first post for me so sorry if i fuck anything up. 

I'm currently in grade 11 (16 years old) and go to a public school that has a highly regarded theatre and film program. During the summer the film program did a summer camp of what was essentially a shortened version of the fall afterschool student film program and I participated. 

How it works is basically all the people who want to write and direct during the first couple of days do pitches for projects and then afterwards theres voting/ the director getting a crew together. During the summer program I gave a pitch for a comedy film of a guy who gets denied heaven because the secretary is a petty bitch, its one scene, one room, basically very simple. 
The film doesn't get picked but i'm not too pissed because i can always pitch again during the fall, plus I'll get more time to make it. 

The fall rolls around and i miss the first couple of days of the fall program due to doing a Shakespeare camp that went into the first coupke of weeks of school; doesn't really matter i can always pitch for the last day. My first day off of Shakespeare rolls around and i show up, this was a day where we figure out cameras not a pitch day. However, after it ends I'm walking home with a buddy and i mention the idea (that ive told them before) and tell them I'm serious about making it this time and that is when they inform me a boy in the grade 10 year (who was also in the summet program) has already pitched that idea almost word for word and there is rumblings of it probably being picked and getting a crew

This pissed me off, it pissed me off even more when I tell the film teacher (whom i told the idea to in late may) she said that even if I'm right (and she knows i was), she can't do much since it already has a crew and i need to get used to it ""cause that happens a lot."" 

I start getting basically and dated anythings that relates to my idea being originally bought up in late april, aswell as hand written accounts from parents and friends saying how much ive talked about this idea and start roaming the hallways telling people about how this kid has stolen my idea (btw this is what I did last week) and start posting receipts about it on social media.
Because if this all the junior kids who were working on this started getting harrased by other students online for stealing my idea and they decided to disband.

However a lot of people have come up and talked to me about how this was jealous and petty behavior and how I'm probably just trying too stop new kids from joining the film program so it remains a clique thing and how I'm denying a kid from making something great.
Now I'm very worried and confused so that's why im turning to you guys at reddit for help.

(EDIT: oop I should've mentioned in original post but i did have a partial script finished during the summer program which i made the first pitch, by the fall i had a partial second draft done. I haven't seen the kids first draft yet so I can't say if he copied any joke ideas)",36,55,0.93
1922,Not the A-hole,"Back story: For financial reasons, we currently share a car. She works from home so I drive it most days to work- system works pretty good, except we have very different driving styles. Trying to be impartial here- I am definitely a cautious/defensive driver. She likes to poke fun at me for driving like a grandma, and Im sure I often deserve the ridicule. 

She on the other hand is often careless and distracted. She will drive too fast, too close to other vehicles. Doesn't always check mirrors before changing lanes etc. As such she has gotten in 3 minor accidents in the last 2 years. One major accident the year before, and has gotten 2 tickets- one fairly serious speeding ticket and one minor parking ticket.

Accidents: Once by changing lanes directly into a motorcycle that she claims was in her blind spot (wasn't there- don't know if she checked her mirrors or not), once because she was tailgating on the highway and rear ended the car in front because she hadnt noticed the traffic building up (was there for that one...) and most recently this afternoon when she missed the opening and drove directly into the edge of our garage because she got distracted looking at something else and didnt slow down while pulling in. (Was in the car for that one too.)

Luckily none of these accidents have resulted in any injuries- just knocks and bumps to our poor car. She totaled her own car before we bought this one together- probably should have seen it as a red flag, but that was a bigger accident and i was just really glad she was ok. 

We just got done arguing because I responded by getting angry when she just drove (forward, fast, directly into) the wall of our garage. I didn't ask if she was ok. I didn't offer support or comfort- I just said ""Jesus, babe. Really?"" In a mean sarcastic voice, and then started fixing the track for the garage door because it got crushed.

She says I'm a dick because I didnt support her and that I should care more about her being ok than the ""stupid car"". She also says that im not in charge of her life and if I dont like the way she drives i should just drive myself.

I say Im tired of her driving like a 16 year old boy and she needs to start being more careful of our shit.  

I kind of see her point, I can't tell her how to live. But i feel like the current situation (shared car/shared garage) means we should be working together to keep our shit functioning. We cant afford a second car right now, and we sure as shit wont be able to afford one if she keeps fucking up the one functional vehicle we have.

Later in the night I started to get really worried about his ride situation, and when he finally texted me about it he told me his friend was puking and he felt bad leaving her. I didn‚Äôt even know he was meeting up with his coworker until she was puking outside the bar and he was taking care of her.

So here I was, out of town and having major anxiety. He assured me he was going to get her home and get home himself. Fine, I decide that I should try to get some sleep. At this point it‚Äôs like 2am.

The next morning, I find out that she was so drunk that he she passed out in his car and he couldn‚Äôt get her to tell him her address, so he brought her home with him. She slept on our couch and he has assured me numerous times that nothing happened, and I 90% believe him. 

Here‚Äôs what really bothers me: She had to work at 6am the following morning (a friday) and he says she showed up at the bar to meet him at 11. Why would she get so drunk?? She ended up oversleeping on our couch and left her client high and dry (she‚Äôs a direct support ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù). I‚Äôm also wondering why she would have put my boyfriend into such an awkward position. He tries to reassure me that they‚Äôre just friends and she asks him for advice about other guys, but that just makes me think that she‚Äôs lonely and she obviously sees how great of a guy my boyfriend is, so it‚Äôs the opposite of reassuring.

Now I‚Äôm super uncomfortable with their friendship and I feel like she crossed the line. If I had brought a guy home to sleep on our couch while my bf was out of town he would have flipped his lid about it. So i‚Äôve asked him to end their friendship, but he refuses. Am I wrong to even ask him? It‚Äôs been about a month now and he wants me to get over it and for things to go back to normal with her. I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm over-reacting or if he‚Äôs being a jerk.

tl;dr My boyfriend‚Äôs coworker got ridiculously wasted and had to sleep on our couch while I was out of town, now I want him to stop being friends with her because it gives me hella anxiety.

edit: based on some comments I just wanted to add a little info to maybe clarify a few things.

I have not demanded that he end his friendship, not have I given him an ultimatum. If he chose to continue his friendship, I would respect that, just as I would hope he would do the same for me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs controlling to express my discomfort with his choices and asking him to reconsider being friends with her, but to each their own I guess.

I do NOT have a problem with him helping his friend out. I would hope that‚Äôs obvious, but I can see why maybe it wasn‚Äôt. I am super glad he helped her and I think she‚Äôs lucky that my bf isn‚Äôt a creep, because that certainly could‚Äôve been very bad. I never EVER think people deserve to be r*ped, regardless of their choices.

I guess i‚Äôm a little surprised that a women in her mid-twenties would go to the bar to meet a coworker she barely knows and get that drunk. From what my bf said, she was concerned that since he had a ‚Äúhead start‚Äù on her, she said she wanted to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù so she downed drinks pretty quickly. I, too was concerned that maybe she had been roofied, but I think it was more of a case of chugging drinks too quickly.

As far as me not trusting my boyfriend to get home safely and ‚Äúblowing up his phone‚Äù, neither of those are true. We tend to keep in contact pretty regularly, especially if one of us is out of town. Honestly it‚Äôs usually my boyfriend who gets concerned if I‚Äôm not responding to his texts, so it just seemed weird that hours would pass without him saying anything at all. I DO trust my boyfriends judgement when he‚Äôs sober, but drinking can skew that (for anyone!) He doesn‚Äôt drink often and I was concerned he might drive tipsy. We live in a city where that‚Äôs, unfortunately, the norm (college town). He doesn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt ever used Uber, because he rarely drinks and usually has me as a ride.",102,83,0.88

1941,Not the A-hole," Last year, June 2018, we were asked to quote a client for a website rebuild for her small business. Her existing website needed completely rebuilding, and since she worked in a niche industry involving kids, her 'backend' CRM needed rebuilding as well as pretty much no off-the shelf solution existed that met all of the requirements she set out to us. Not a problem, we submitted a proposal and got the go-ahead.

This job turned out to be a nightmare, primarily due to the client taking days/weeks to respond to our requests for her input and feedback.

When the front-end was finally complete and ready to go live, and the back-end wasn't far off the same state, we let her know via a regular update email and got a sudden response: ""Oh yeah, could you pause the back-end development as I think I've found a subscription service that does everything I need.""

""Okay...?""

At that point we knew this was going to turn into a billing nightmare, so we tried to setup a meeting with the client to go through everything that had been done to date, front-end and back-end. Silence. For literally weeks after repeated emails/phone calls/texts.

Suddenly: ""Hi i NEED the front-end website to be live as soon as possible as I'm about to launch a huge marketing campaign and need it to look good!""

So fine, we make it live as we've at least got the written go-ahead. We respond letting her know along with a reminder that we've been trying to setup a meeting with her to discuss everything in detail etc. Silence again for a couple of weeks.

Fuck it, we have bills to pay and she is taking the piss by this point. I'm sending the invoice. The itemised invoice I sent consisted of the full quoted price for the front-end, and approximately 2/3 of the back-end (which wasn't made live.)

After weeks of silence:

""WHAT!?! I can't believe I'm being charged for something I didn't get! I'm shocked and disappointed. This had better be changed as I have recommended you to so many people (etc.)""

I reply with a copy of the original proposal, which included ""If you change your mind, that's not a problem but we'll need to quote for the additional requirements separately/deliver the work completed and invoice for the time spent on it so far."" Along with copies of invoices that we've been billed for work on her back-end, and a breakdown of our time. I also discounted her invoice by ¬£300.

I pretty much get the same response saying she's not happy with being billed for work that she doesn't benefit from, she doesn't feel she has to pay anything as she doesn't want the back-end completing anymore.

\- This is where we're at now -

I'm honestly seething, I really want to reply with: ""Yeah, well we never would have incurred those costs if you hadn't gone ahead with the job and then abandoned it 2/3 the way through!"" but I'm relying on Reddit for better judgement.",59,580,0.89
1942,Not the A-hole,"At my college there are study rooms with whiteboards for walls. The rooms cannot be reserved. First come basis.

1943,Not the A-hole,"While heading to my car at the packed airport parking, a guy waiting in his car near the lot entrance flagged me down and asked if I was leaving. He told me the lot was already full and that he had circled around several times looking for a spot with no luck. I told him I was leaving, but my car was parked at the very end of the lot on the opposite side. He offered to drive me and my luggage there but I told him that I could just cut across and meet him. I told him the aisle letter, space number, and the model and color of my car so he could meet me there. He thanked me and started driving to where my car was. 

Surprisingly, I got to the aisle where my car was before the guy who flagged me. I assume with all the other cars also looking for a spot, he was delayed. As I  continued walking to my car, a woman in a car already in my aisle started following me with her window open. I stopped and told her that I had already promised my spot to another guy who was already driving to meet me and that he would be here soon. 

She got upset with me and said that she had been waiting for a spot also and that she was already there. By this time, the guy has already pulled up next to where my car was and was waiting for me. I told the woman that he was here, pointing at his car, and I was going to give him the spot. She started shouting at me that the spot was hers and she wasn‚Äôt going to give it up. I ignored her and loaded my luggage. When I finished, I looked at her and said, ‚ÄúListen, I understand you‚Äôve been waiting but so has the other guy. He followed me to my spot and I mean to give it to him. I don‚Äôt have to be anywhere so I can wait as long as I need to, to either give him my spot or wait until he gets another one. It‚Äôs your time to waste.‚Äù

She got red faced and called me an asshole among other expletives. When she saw me leaning against my car though, she must have realized I was serious and finally decided to try her luck elsewhere.

1946,No A-holes here,"So my daughter (21) recently nervously came out to my wife and I as gay. We told her that we didn't care about her sexuality and that we accepted her no matter what. This week she said that she wanted to come out to my mother as well. I advised her against this because my mother is rather homophobic and I don't want their relationship to be ruined because she can't accept her. 

This upset my daughter and she accused me of trying to make her hide who she is. 

I explained that I'm not asking her to hide who she is but I am just letting her know what to expect if she comes out to her grandma. It's not like my mother is in very good health either. She has at best 2 years left and I would hate for my daughter and her not to spend time together because of her anti-gay sentiments. 

I told her that some people from her generation are just stubborn and set in their ways and it's easier to let them die with their views rather to try and change them and be put through heartbreak yourself. 

My daughter still thinks I'm ashamed of who she is and that I should side with her over my mother but the thing is I'm not taking a side. I don't think this is even something to take a side on. I obviously love my daughter but I love my mother too. I'm not going to just leave her out on the street for the next 2 years. I don't want my daughter's feelings to get hurt either because of what my mother says to her.

Last year (when LO was 3 months old) we spent Christmas Eve at my in law‚Äôs house, and then drove up to my parent‚Äôs house that night to spend Christmas Day with them. This year, my husband wants to spend Christmas with his family instead. I want to do the same thing we did last year.

The title probably sounds really silly. Hear me out.

I  am a 21 year old college student studying to become a practitioner in  the medical field. I am very busy with classes, studying,  extracurriculars, and work. My week is 7 days and I usually do not have a  day off in. My parents know this, as I live at home and have discussed  it with them many times.

Recently,  I had some blood work done that showed a slight thyroid abnormality but  the doctor decided not to treat it and recommended redoing bloodwork  when it was convenient for me to make sure everything was okay. I've  been working out when I can go for that blood work, and have a follow up  scheduled for December. Otherwise, I am perfectly healthy and function  normally day to day.

Flash forward  to last night. I come home and my parents are immediately (as soon as I  walked into the door) reprimanding me for not going back to the doctors  sooner (this conversation was out of the blue, as we were not  previously discussing). I told them I have a follow up made, and will be  making time to have bloodwork done soon. My dad got pretty infuriated  by this and it started an argument. It was late, I wanted to fit some  studying in before I went to sleep, and told him I didn't feel like talking about it much more and that we could discuss it the next day.

Today,  while I was in class, with no access to my phone, my parents begin frantically texting me to let me know they made a doctor's appointment for me, that I HAVE to go, and my mother reworked her schedule tomorrow to go with me and used her lunch period to call them.

My  parents did this without ever asking me or discussing with me if it was  possible with my schedule. In the past, my parents have issues  communicating with each other and have issues communicating with me. I  have tried working on this with them but they can be quite stubborn and  do not like to be wrong, especially my dad.

I  have two exams tomorrow at 9 am and 10 am respectively, which makes me unable to attend this 9:30am doctor's appointment. My  parents are extremely mad at me, which I don't this is fair considering  they did this without consulting me and asking if that time and day  works for me. I am fully capable of making my own appointments and  prefer to do so, and usually do. They haven't made an appointment for me  for anything since I was in high school.

I  appreciate their concern for my health, and love them dearly. I don't  want anyone to think that I don't appreciate their concern for me. I  always value their thoughts and options highly.

In my last birthday, dad came and gave me a pretty decent amount of money and we went shopping together. My brother ended up using all of the money for a toy and he never touched it again. My brother's birthday is a few months before my birthday and he also get gifts too.

I(30F) and \*Jake(30M) had been best friends since middle school.  There was never anything even remotely romantic between us. We would date different people throughout the years and always introduced our current SO's to each other. Sometimes SO's didn't like that fact that we had a best friend of the opposite sex but Jake and I agreed that we would be honest and tell them that if you had a problem with it, then that was their issue, we weren't going to stop being in each other's lives. SO's would come and go, but Jake and I remained close.

Fast forward to our adult lives. I meet my now husband who has no desire to meet Jake since he's a male. Jake is hurt by this since he knows this guy is important to me and wants to meet him, but, what can you do. As my then boyfriend and I start getting serious and discussing marriage, I tell him that Jake will absolutely be in my wedding party and it would be awkward if they didn't get to know each other. We argue but I don't budge.

Fast forward again and Jake has met his now wife. I never meet her because she lives in another state but I do talk to her on the phone once and everything is fine. Or so I thought.

I find out a few months after-the-fact that they got married. I asked him why he didn't tell me and he says it was immediate family only. My feelings are still hurt but I'm not family and weddings are expensive so I get it.

Then a mutual friend tells me it was a big 200 guest extravaganza. I'm confused, angry, and again, hurt. He now tells me that his wife didn't want me there because it would ""be weird."" I didn't argue with him. He was already married and my feelings were already hurt. He moves away to her state so I only text with him once a month, if that. I eventuality tell him that I don't think we should speak anymore - his alliance is to his wife and she obviously has an issue with me so I'm going to step away. He explains she doesn't have an issue with me or our friendship, she just didn't want me to come to the wedding. (Please tell me if that makes sense to you.)

More details if anyone cares:

Jake is attractive. Good looking, very physically fit. Think Chris Pine. He was actually a male stripper and he met his wife at a strip club. Was I ever attracted to Jake in a sexual/romantic way? No, but I can appreciate his appearance. 

Jake has never once tried anything with me. But there was one occasion when a mutual friend told me that Jake would ""marry me in a second."" I never put any thought into this as we had the discussion, as most female/male friends do ""if we're not married by 40, we marry each other."" But maybe I missed something?

About a year after filing for divorce, I told him I was gay. He kind of blew up and pretty much cut contact. It was 6 months before I heard from him at all (texted me saying Merry Christmas) and another five months before I actually talked to him. He called me for my birthday, said he was sorry for being so out of touch and wanted to plan that year's camping trip. 

Things more or less got back to normal after that. He apologized again but said he just really didn't want to talk about it. I accepted that and assumed he was still processing. When we were talking about 6 months later, I let it casually slip that I had started seeing somebody. He told me to stop and said again that he really didn't want to hear about it. He hung up not too long after that and it scared me enough to never bring up anything relating to my love life or being gay again. I didn't want to lose him again.

This was almost nine years ago now. I've been with my partner Harry for almost seven years.

My relationship with my son is fine. When I talk about my life, I just keep Harry out of it. I don't like dancing around like this and I wish we were closer but I've accepted that this is much better than having no relationship with my son. Harry doesn't love it either but he is supportive of how I'm handling it.

Brother in law says ""well then why couldn't he bring Harry?"" Then proceeds to explain who Harry is. Son storms out and blows up at me for not telling him and basically lying about my life for years.

It's been a lifelong struggle to have people pronounce my name properly.

I've been working a government job for 5ish years. In all that time no one has really bothered to learn to say my name correctly. They'll try and say my name but do it in such a condescending half-arsed effort it comes out like ""shubaduba my-shababaski"". When I try and correct them, they dismiss it and resume that butchery next time. After 2 years at the job I got frustrated. We're in a professional environment and they should make a professional effort to learn my name. I do the same, I always make an effort to try and pronounce a person's name as best I can to their satisfaction. So it got to the point every time people would try to say my name in that dismissive manner I'd report it to HR because it felt offensive.

One lady finally accrued 3ish years of my complaints (if I tried to correct her, she'd say things like ""it's just a name"" or ""close enough"") and with all the complaints she was let go for workplace bullying.

I don‚Äôt work with him directly and only meet him at lunch breaks but have noticed that he speaks to her with little to no respect, not exaggerating: ‚Äúwoman, go and buy me a sandwich‚Äùis his everyday go to line. When she politely asks him to do something for her he‚Äôd often reply ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you do it yourself‚Äù. He laughs in her face saying he‚Äôs got her wrapped around his finger and genuinely thinks that she should be the one doing things for him since she‚Äôs got an office job while he does manual labor. The lack of respect for his mother has been annoying me and others for quite some time but I just usually sat there in shock and listened. In his mind he‚Äôs cool and funny, he‚Äôs a gift from God gracing all of us with his presence. Very cocky and just an arrogant immature young man. She seems to be used to it and only sometimes asks him to be nicer, otherwise she treats it as a joke and says he doesn‚Äôt really mean things he says and he‚Äôs a good guy. 

Anyway, today he sent her to buy him lunch again and as always she rushed and got him what he wanted. It turned out to not be what he wanted though. So he theatrically rolled his eyes and started ‚ÄúI told you before not to get it from X shop because it‚Äôs shit‚Äù, she said they didn‚Äôt have any in Y shop. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve used your brain and rang me, can‚Äôt even get me what I specifically asked for‚Äù. That made me explode. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I got seriously annoyed and a bit out of control but I told him that I have never ever seen anyone disrespect their mother like this and treat them like their servant, that he should be thankful for all she‚Äôs doing for him since she‚Äôs running around him like crazy (she also raised him by herself), that he can move his lazy ass and do it all by himself, that he treats his mother like shit in front of everyone and never even though of how it made her feel and I won‚Äôt be putting up with it anymore‚Äù.  He asked me to chill to which I replied that I am not going to be told what to do by him and that this is a workplace for adults so he should start behaving like one. He laughed and said he‚Äôs going out to get some food, she didn‚Äôt really say much to that and left shortly after.  

And then 2 coworkers said I went too hard on him, that this is their business, that if she lets him treat her that way that‚Äôs her problem and I shouldn‚Äôt interfere in between a mother and the son. The atmosphere is shit, I‚Äôm feeling a bit guilty for stepping in but his behavior is wrong and so annoying to witness. AITA for saying what I think?

TLDR: coworker‚Äôs son shows zero respect to his mother that I also work with. I called him on it in front of everyone. People tell me I should‚Äôve kept my mouth shut as it‚Äôs not by place to say anything.




UPDATE:

I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt really have any breaking news that would deserve a what seems like a very anticipated update. 

I only got a moment with the mom when we were heading for our lunch. I apologized for my outburst to which she replied that he had it coming one day and I shouldn‚Äôt worry but I could tell that she didn‚Äôt really want to talk about it. She said that she realizes what opinion we all have of him but that he‚Äôs a good guy and he doesn‚Äôt mean half of what he says...
I had nothing and still have nothing to say to that. 

The son on the other hand went out for lunch and I haven‚Äôt really seen him. I‚Äôm hoping he got embarrassed. When it was just myself and other coworkers, all of them said that they agree with me but me pointing out at the elephant in the room wasn‚Äôt necessary. They found yesterday‚Äôs incident quite entertaining I guess. When I asked why they never said a word, they all said the same thing- not their business, it‚Äôs not going to change anything, etc. and then I used expert‚Äôs aka Reddit user‚Äôs advice and explained that this is a work environment, we are co workers regardless of our family ties and I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt tolerate another workmate talking to someone else like this and while I‚Äôm mostly offended because disrespecting own mother is a huge no no in my book, this situation should be treated as what it is- harassment at work. They all pretty much said that the son is just an asshole, he‚Äôs young and life will teach him a lesson etc. and I should just ignore it. I guess I don‚Äôt really have any back in this situation but if nothing changes I will go to HR even if I‚Äôll be an overreacting bitch in everyone‚Äôs eyes. Fuck that. 

Thank you to everyone that has commented, judged me and advised. If not you guys, I would feel very lonely with this but it‚Äôs heartwarming to know that there are people out there that care. Thank you.",191,1199,0.97

1961,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have been married for 2 years now and have recently decided to start having a kid. We decided we only want one child a long time ago. My wife, Eve, wants to give our child her last name. I don't want this.

You see her last name is really common, think something like Smith or Brown. Meanwhile my last name is unique. It's not strange by any means it's just unique. Eve has 2 different brothers with kids and all of them have her last name. Meanwhile I have no siblings aside from my late sister who died 10 years ago to cancer. I have no family that has my last name aside from my parents. Ever since I was 19 (currently 29) I've wanted to make sure my last name carries on with my future kids. I don't want my last name to die with me. 

I've told Eve this and she wants to give our child her last name. She wants to carry on the tradition in her family, meanwhile I have none. I told her I want my kid to have my last name, and she refuses to listen to me. She wants to make sure our kid has only her last name. I asked about doing a middle name or hyphenate our last names and she refuses. She also has a specific middle name that she's not budging on.

I refuse to let my family name die with me. I want to make sure it's carried on in some way. She also kept her last name once we got married because she didn't want to change, which is fine. But where I draw the line is giving our kid my last name. 

I'm fine with hyphenating it or even giving him/her it as a middle name but she refuses to listen to me. This is a hill I'm willing to die on. I don't want to back down on this because it means so much to me.

Am I being an asshole here for not backing down?",899,2926,0.96

1964,Not the A-hole,"I (25M) have a friend (27F). We met in college and studied abroad together and became relatively close. Since then though, I feel she‚Äôs really been spinning her wheels. Since returning to the US, she hasn‚Äôt had a job. She‚Äôs been living with her parents for the past few years and clinging to a long distance relationship with a guy we met abroad who we know is mentally/physically abusive to her. We had a couple other friends in our group but they just moved away a couple weeks ago, leaving just the two of us and my girlfriend. 

Last month my friend announced she was going to be doing a non-profit program at a local church. Essentially she is given a room to sleep and $100/month. She has really random volunteer hours and she left her car with her parents so she has no means of transportation. This has made it really difficult to invite her to things. If I want to hang out with her, it means I have to pick her up and drive her home afterwards. It also means we cannot do anything that costs money, so I just end up hosting at my tiny apartment with not much to do and I make her food and snacks etc. 

I invited her over this past weekend for one of these hangout sessions and she started crying and saying I never want to hang out anymore. We used to hang out a couple times per week but I‚Äôve only had her over twice in the past month. I told her that honestly, her choices after college have made it very difficult for me to hang out with her. I work a 9-5. When I‚Äôm not working I like to go out and do things with my girlfriend and sometimes that includes buying food or meeting up with people places etc. In my opinion, she is essentially living the life of a college freshman at the age of 27 and that puts a lot of pressure on our friendship. 

We argued for awhile about this until I finally told her I‚Äôd try to make more of an effort and took her home. But honestly, I think that us not hanging out as much is simply one of the consequences of her life decisions. AITA for feeling this way? Is it my responsibility as her friend to cater to her lifestyle to make this friendship work, or am I justified in not really wanting to do that?",29,48,0.89
1965,Not the A-hole,"My best friend since high school, we‚Äôll call he ‚ÄòKate‚Äô (F:26) was over at my apartment recently, and we had drinks and watched baseball. She got pretty drunk and I (M:25) didn‚Äôt have much to drink, so I was pretty sober. She confided in me that she had been cheating on her husband ‚ÄòChris‚Äô (M:26) for 2 months, since he‚Äôs been away on business trips and she‚Äôs been lonely. They‚Äôve been married for 2 years. She told me that she had stopped a few weeks ago and was going into therapy. While I don‚Äôt want to ruin a marriage or anything of the sort, I‚Äôm a firm believer that the person being cheated on needs to know.  I told her to tell him and she said that she didn‚Äôt want him to know, or else their marriage could fall apart. It‚Äôs been a  few days since, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I tell him? I don‚Äôt think Kate is a bad person, but this is really disgusting behavior to me and I‚Äôm very confused. Please give me a hand here Reddit.",63,47,0.87
1966,Not the A-hole,"My parents are conservative Christians. They have all the stereotypical views: abortion should be illegal, atheists are broken people who need Jesus, people who choose not to have kids are selfish, gay and trans people are mentally ill, you know the drill.

As a kid, I didn't know any better and would laugh along when they made derogatory comments like this. Now I'm an adult who is gay, atheist, and childfree by choice, so I guess the joke is on me?

The complication here is that outside of these shitty, judgmental opinions, my parents are pretty warm, generous people. They always encouraged me in my interests, even when I wanted to do dumb shit like get a degree in art. They give tons of money to charity and have never failed to help out someone in trouble.

They're also very good at keeping their views under wraps when a member of one of those groups is around. My friends who have met them think they're harmless sweet old folks.

Our relationship has suffered a lot since I moved out 15 years ago. When I came out to them, they literally got up and left the room without speaking. Since then, they have refrained from saying homophobic things in my presence, though they still post stuff on social media from time to time. They're always asking me to visit more and complaining that I don't tell them anything about my life.

From their point of view, it's not like they disowned me, and they're entitled to their religious views as long as they're not judging me to my face. And it's true, our visits are usually fine as long as I'm careful to keep the conversation on safe topics and redirect at the first sign of trouble.

From my point of view, it's pretty hard to visit and act like everything's fine and normal when I know for a fact that they look down on people like me.

I feel like they're just being polite and waiting for me to snap out of it and become the straight Christian daughter they always wanted. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and have to manage increased flareups before, during, and after visiting them.

This is the part that makes me think I'm the asshole. My siblings think that I'm being neurotic and should just get over it - they're not going to change their views, so I should try to appreciate my parents for who they are instead of getting upset about who they aren't.

Part of me agrees with them, if only because my parents are never going to change their views on gay people or atheists if they don't ever talk to any gay people or atheists, you know?

However, an equally big part of me thinks that ""didn't actually disown their kid when they came out"" is a pretty low bar, and maybe it would be good for both of us if I took a break from my family of birth.

So what say you, Reddit? AITA for wanting to cease contact with my parents for the bigoted crap they've said in the past, even though they don't say it to my face anymore?",60,172,0.9
1967,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway on mobile etc.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, living together for 4. When we first moved in, he told me he has terrible allergies to scents and then anything he uses or touches needs to be unscented, and that I can't put on perfume in the house or use heavily scented soaps/lotions etc. He also can't do any cleaning that involves cleaners other than unscented soap. 

I don't know why he didn't bring it up before we moved in together - considering he knew about my extensive collection of scented candles, perfume, and general love of things that smelled nice but okay. I'd put perfume on in my car, I stashed my candles away, I bought unscented products. For about a year. 

But then, I noticed something. He only reacted to things if he knew they were scented. eg. One time he accidentally bought a scented fabric softener that we both used for 3 weeks without noticing before I pointed it out to him. At which point, he started coughing, choking, complaining he couldn't breathe etc. 

This kind of thing kept repeating, until finally one day he went on a business trip for a week. Because he was gone I broke out one of my diffusers...and then I forgot about it. Two weeks after he came home, I remembered, quietly tidied it away and nothing. He didn't have an allergic reaction the entire time, he never mentioned it, never complained. 

I've tried to talk to him about this but he refuses to believe me. I have shown him evidence, multiple times, that he's completely fine with scents unless he \*knows\* it's scented. It's totally a placebo effect. But he refuses to believe me. Says that's not true. 

For the past 2.5 years or so, I've been using scented products. I light scented candles. I have a diffuser in the living room. He's had ZERO problems with his allergies. Literally, as long as he doesn't notice the diffuser or see me put on the perfume there is NO reaction. Nothing. 

And then today he noticed the diffuser. He immediately starting coughing, choking, asking if I was trying to kill him, complaining that he couldn't breath. When I told him it's been sitting there for at least six months without him having any problems, he said I've been gaslighting him, that this is fucked up.

1969,No A-holes here,"There is a local business in my community. This is the type of business where there are multiple competitors in the area. The past 8 months or so, I‚Äôve noticed an increased effort by this company to up their social media game in the form of giveaways, before/after pics, graphic media posts, etc. The problem I‚Äôve noticed is that they are almost so bad that they might repel customers; e.g., low quality font pics crudely downloaded from the internet, weirdly contrasted/lit photos that make both the before and after look equally terrible. 

I‚Äôd like to know if I WBTA if I said something to them? I am by no means a social media manager or graphic design, but I know poor quality when I see it. Would it come across as arrogant? I want this business to succeed, of course.",13,51,0.93
1970,Not the A-hole,"I am 5 months pregnant, coworker is 4 months pregnant, we work in a small team of 8 and often cover each other shifts, stay back when someone has appointments and generally help each other out. 
I have been really struggling with my pregnancy and have been careful to schedule appointments on my days off and to take as many precautions as I can to avoid impacting everyone else. 
Coworker, who is saying that she‚Äôs having a wonderful, enjoyable pregnancy, is showing up late, then going for a smoke and a coffee before starting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just running late, at OBGYN‚Äù quickly becomes and hour or more late, and isn‚Äôt being noted on her time sheets, so the person covering her isn‚Äôt getting paid for that time and it‚Äôs especially difficult for me when I‚Äôm already struggling physically to not know what time I‚Äôll be able to go home. 
I recently learned that other coworkers have been covering a significant part of her tasks, because they feel badly for her having to do it whilst pregnant- tasks that I‚Äôm still doing and have been doing with ease. 

Our manager is very accommodating and has made several offers to purchase alternative equipment and make changes in the workplace, that she has refused (as have I so far) because it‚Äôs easy to complete these tasks the way things are now. I know they are not aware that coworker simply isn‚Äôt doing those things, because our manager has asked me about it recently. 

WIBTA if I discussed this with management? Other staff are complaining to me about the additional workload. I‚Äôm also being expected to put in additional effort at a time that I have no extra energy to give. Trying to bring it up with coworker hasn‚Äôt made a difference, and other staff have already told me they‚Äôre too tired to help me when I‚Äôm struggling because they‚Äôre already helping her. 
I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm just being petty about everyone fussing over her, when I‚Äôve been working so hard to not impact the rest of the workplace.


Editing to add: The fact that she‚Äôs smoking is 
A) only relevant because it cuts into my time when I want to go home 
B) none of our business, whether we like it or not 
C) possibly because she may be cutting back slowly under doctors orders. I had to wean myself off medications because cold turkey would have significantly increased the risk of miscarriage. I‚Äôm not her doctor and you‚Äôre not either.",435,5522,0.96
1971,Not the A-hole,"I was at a table in my university's library.  There are no signs requiring no talking, but the common practice is that no one talks in the working areas.

I walked over and asked them to move their interview elsewhere because this a working area in the library.  They said there were no signs saying such.  I responded that no one else is talking despite the area being full, and to make matters worse, I could hear them from nearly 50 feet away.  They scoffed and left.

Edit: I should be clear about the set up of the library.  It‚Äôs two floors.  There are tables throughout the entire library on both floors.  There are study rooms upstairs that groups can reserve for group work.  There are no specific quiet areas except for the locked doctoral candidate writing room (which I am not).",39,29,0.85

1973,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend invited me out to her family‚Äôs ranch for the weekend. It is a working ranch with cattle, horses and chickens. They have a few dogs on the property. They call them work dogs. They also have three cats. The cats and dogs sleep outside. They don‚Äôt feed the cats. They aren‚Äôt allowed in the house. The dogs aren‚Äôt either. My girlfriend explained that they are less pets and more there to work. They dogs patrol the property at night for foxes and other animals that may eat the chickens and they help herd the cattle. They are also used for hunting. 

When it gets cold apparently the dogs have to sleep in the barn. One of the dogs just gave birth and has a liter of puppies and the puppies are required to stay in one of the barns with the horses. They don‚Äôt get to come in the house. The dogs haven‚Äôt been  seen by a vet. And my girlfriend‚Äôs mom told me one of the puppies wasn‚Äôt taking milk correctly. I asked what they planned to do and she said that it would likely just die. She shrugged and said sometimes they just don‚Äôt make it. 

The dogs also seem to only get fed once a day after the end of the day. I‚Äôve seen the workers swat the dogs away, yell at them for not moving too fast when equipment came through.
I didn‚Äôt see anyone pet one dog but my girlfriend said they do when they aren‚Äôt busy but the dogs are not the type who needs hugs all the time. 

She kept saying they were work dogs not pets. 

The cats are wild and apparently never see the vet. They said they were just there to run off any mice and other small things. 

The dogs look kind of thin (a lot thinner than my dog) and when I said something they laughed and said maybe my dog was just too fat. 

I don‚Äôt know how to process and I really think those dogs should be checked out. Maybe the cats too. Would I be the asshole if I reported it?",336,1044,0.92

Being completely honest, yes maybe she‚Äôs not very good looking, but I would never tell her that because it would really hurt her. But at the same time if she asks something like that I feel I should be honest and if I just lied to her face she would definitely tell.

1977,Not the A-hole,"So I've been using a local taxi service since high school. The lads that work there are great, fare's always cheap and they get out to you ASAP.

Trips within our town cost (usually) about ¬£5, but in the past year the cost rose to ¬£6. Heart-breaking, I know, but it's about the same for most other taxi services in town.

So I was picking up my little brother front school today and called for a taxi to take us home, a ¬£6 trip I've been making since school started back up again. 
A new guy picks us up today and he seems nice enough, however he goes a different route back to our place. A longer route.
I try not to think too hard on it as the fare is fixed at ¬£6 anyway, until he stops outside our place and asks for ¬£19!
He claims the way they calculate fares has changed (in the past 7 days apparently) and he's just following rules but I wasn't having any of it, paid the ¬£6 and left.

I got an angry text and call from the place for ""stiffing"" the cabbie but I wasn't made aware that anything had changed and would not have called them if I knew. There wasn't even a notification of the change on their site (and it still shows they do 'fixed rates'), and the cabbie only told me when he pulled up about such a massive change in price.

AITA? I honestly think it's false advertising and they didn't mention the change until the end of the ride on purpose. I feel justified in my response. Nowhere in me calling up to getting the cab did it say the prices had changed, which I think is their responsibility to inform customers, particularly ones who have been with the business for years.

EDIT: If this helps you guys understand, this guy was using a meter whilst driving for a cab company that has never used a meter before this week. I used them LAST WEEK and it was ¬£6. And then he purposefully wracked up the cost and hid the meter from me until the end of the ride. I really don't feel like I'm in the wrong for not paying over triple the price to a company that blatantly tried to deceive me.",257,1529,0.97

Two weeks ago I was at work when my girlfriend called me and told me her dog had to be put down. This didn't come as a surprise to me as its health had gotten worse and worse over the past weeks. I was very concerned for my girlfriend, however, as I knew how much she loved her dog, she sounded devastated on the phone. I tried to console her as best as I could and asked if there was anything I could do for her. She was so crushed that she basically only cried until she had to hang up to talk to the vet. I continued to text her afterwards to see how everything was going and check how she felt and told her that I would be coming over to her right after my shift had ended. She answered me swiftly but seemed to do fine as far as I could tell and considering the situation.

As parking opportunities are scarce at my job at the moment I had decided to take bus in the morning. After I finished work about 2 hours after our call, it took me about another hour to get to her place. She was devestated and we didn't speak much in the beginning. She was basically just sobbing in my arms. I just tried to comfort her as best as I could. In bed that day she told me that she was mad at me for not coming and helping her directly after she called. I claimed I came to her as fast as I could, said I was sorry and if there was anything I could do to make it up I would be willing to do so. She said she was not sure if there was anything I could do to make it up again. I didn't think too much of it as she was in a dark place and I didn't want to dissect every word she said on that day.

Two weeks have gone by. I tried to be there for her everyday, made sure I checked in on her regularly and be there whenever she needed me. She made it also clear, every day, that she felt that in the moment she needed me most I was not there for her. She got increasingly angry, aggressive and loud when talking about the incident. I told her every time I was sorry, tried to explain the situation from my point of view and told her nothing like that will ever happen again. But she didn't stop bringing it up, so yesterday I snapped. I told her that I feel terrible, because I made her feel that way and I know every person grieves differently but I had enough. I told her I dind't feel she communicated in any form that I should come to the vet. Additionally, there was no chance I would have made it on time under any circumstance and that I tried my best to get to her as fast as possible and be there for her. I was so angry that I left her place yesterday.

1983,Not the A-hole,"I‚Äôm in the middle of renovating a house that I bought. A few weeks back when I was early in, a friend who was doing some housework also, hired a tile cutter to use. 

Knowing that I was retiring the kitchen, and him having hired it for three days and only needing it for one, asked if I wanted to use it for the other two. I offered him money and he said it was cheap to hire and not to worry about it. 

Weeks pass with us trading tools back and forth to help each other along and I lend a power drill (I owned this and didn‚Äôt hire it) and he gave it back to me yesterday broken. I took it to a DIY place today and a repair on it will cost ¬£40. Not as bad as I thought and better than replacing it for well over ¬£100. 

I told my friend the cost and asked if that was fine before I go ahead with the repair and he says that he isn‚Äôt going to pay for it. That I‚Äôd saved money on the tile cutter last month and that if I broke his stuff he wouldn‚Äôt expect me to pay. But I would. And I also offered to pay for the tile cutter. He also brought up that he lent me money about 8 years ago (which I‚Äôd paid back before the end of the same week) and I should know he‚Äôs struggling with finances.

""Mom"" is the strong, sweet, wildly intelligent, silly woman who birthed and raised me and I can't make myself (in my eyes) disrespect her memory by giving away her title to anyone. I can't talk to my MIL about this. She will tell me it is obviously not disrespectful, period. Also, by now it's just WEIRD. We joke about how how I basically call my in-laws ""hey you,"" but that's as far as those conversations go. My in-laws and I do not communicate well about serious or awkward issues (I am bad at talking about my feelings, just like Mom was). We have a solid relationship, I just can't say Mom and Dad to people who ..aren't. But it's ONE WORD and it would make her so damn happy. I've been struggling with this for years. I say I love them, and I do. They say it too and I believe them. But it's awkward, it makes me and them uncomfortable. Also I'm honestly pissed that they never took a moment to look me in the eye and tell me they are here for me but never want to try to replace my parents. If that conversation had EVER happened this would all be different. Basically I'm openly hurting both of my in-laws' feelings every time we are together because the elephant is always in the room. I feel sick over it. I wish I could make myself say the words. Something always stops me.

I asked my siblings about this and they can't do it, either. They waited until they had children and started calling their in-laws Grandma/Nanna \[first name\]. We aren't having kids so that isn't an option. I've asked my friends and they gave suggestions like coming up with personal nicknames I can use that are special *but that involves having the conversation.*

**TL;DR**: My in-laws want very much for me to call them Mom & Dad and I can't out of respect for my deceased parents, but communicating this with them is weird for everyone and just never happened. So I literally call them nothing (first names would be weird, too). It's been five years.",230,729,0.95
1985,Asshole,"For reference, I live in a small apartment complex in a city with a good abundance of homeless people. We're not in the heart of downtown but we still have a few here or there. The building where I live has a lock on the main door and every apartment.

Around 7pm, I'm in the living room gaming and my girlfriend is in her room doing the same. All of a sudden I hear the door knob for the front door move and I assume one of our neighbors is drunk or just went to the wrong apartment. To be fair, our door barely has our apartment letter on it. Then it moves again and I hear the person try to push the door open a little but thankfully it is locked.

Our dog is getting worked up so I look through the peephole and can't really make out much except a person who's about to sit on the stairs going up. I open the door to see what they want and see an older woman standing there with a brown grocery bag. She didn't really look homeless but definitely didn't look like she belonged. I know most of the people that live in the complex are in the 20-30 year old range so I know this lady doesn't live here and I assume someone just let her in without knowing or the main door was left open or unlocked. 

When she sees me open the door, she slowly starts to open her bag and say thank you but I cut her off by saying, ""You can't be here. Leave."" And slam the door and lock it. I keep thinking about it and wonder if I could have handled it better but the only thing I knew about the whole thing was that someone was trying to come in to our apartment. I figured it may have been different if she knocked first but I'm not quite sure. Am I the asshole?",20,41,0.86
1986,Not the A-hole,"My wife is pregnant and due in a few months.  Her mother lives very close to us, about 5 streets away, and we rarely go over there now.  The reason being her mom and her husband smoke inside their house.  I've been over there a few times to help with computer issues and we typically have Thanksgiving there.  Even if they don't actively smoke while we are there we still walk out of that house reeking of smoke. 

We have brought the smoke smell up with my MIL and how this will be a problem for us when the baby comes.  She basically says the child may smell like smoke leaving their house but they would never smoke around the child.  That still is unacceptable to me because I have read that smoke residue is the carpet and furniture could potentially be harmful to small children especially.  Not only that but I simply don't think my infant child should smell like smoke.  

My wife is kind of on the same page as me but feels bad telling her mom that she can't have her granddaughter over.  I could maybe be okay with just going over there with the child during Thanksgiving because they do air the house out a bit but I would honestly still be pretty unhappy if the carseat, diaper bag, and other things that can't be easily washed smell like smoke after leaving.  

My MIL is more than welcome to come by our house anytime to see her granddaughter and do any babysitting at our house (the child will still smell like smoke because my MIL and her husband's clothes always smell like smoke).",65,230,0.96
1987,Not the A-hole,"Mandatory ""first post, long time lurker"". Sorry about the long post - just wanted to add some info.

I just got back after spending a long weekend with my parentals at their home. They raised me to be Christian, but I've been an atheist for the last 10 years. My parents know this and we've got this unsaid agreement that I won't blaspheme and they won't try to convert me.

My dad respects this and though my mom insists  I pray with them when we sit down for a meal, she tends to just leave me be as long as I'm respectful (which I ALWAYS try to be). However, my mom has started emailing me scripture. I've asked her not to do this. Repeatedly. Politely. She still does it, but now she just starts it with ""You don't have to read it if you don't want to"". After the last ""verse a day"" that she forwarded to me I told her that she is not respecting my religion (or lack of one) and that it upsets me. This time it was not just the fact that she sent me scripture but the message that she sent with it - That God tests us to make us stronger and that if we believe enough he will save children/women who are being hurt.

I live in South Africa and that last email from her was after news broke that a university student was brutally murdered in a post office close to where I live. Everyone around me and on social media was outraged. There were huge protests against gender violence. I was glad that people were standing up against these horrible things, but it did trigger my PTSD. I was feeling unsafe and I was having nightmares about how I was attacked etc by a man when I was in high school. Thus, when I replied to my mother's last email I was not as friendly as I usually am. I told her that starting the email with a disclaimer stating that it was my choice to read it didn't make it any less disrespectful. I told her that the message in her email angered me. And I told her that, next time, I will be sending her my favourite scripture which will include all the terrible things God has done (like killing babies etc).

Next followed one of my mother's infamous silent treatments. I didn't hear from her for 2 weeks. She ignored my calls. Then she just started talking to me again out of the blue. This all happened a few weeks ago.

Today my mom makes this comment how, though she has her moral values and religion, she won't ever force it on someone else. I then ask her why she is sending me scripture if she doesn't want to force her religion on me? She then goes on a tirade on how I'm a terrible child who sent her such a crass email at work that made her cry after she had such a terrible week and that she was trying to send me a positive message. I then told her that she could have avoided all this if she had not sent me scripture in the first place. She refuses to stop sending me these emails.

Was I TA in this situation? Should I just let her send me these emails so she doesn't get upset?",59,139,0.91

1989,Not the A-hole,"Edit 1: Wow, thank you all so much for you input. I will post an update in a day or so

Edit 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE DANK MEMES

The title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

My fiance and I are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, Summer 2021.

I make pretty good money for my age. In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the ""1%"" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

My fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

I am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

She has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

I shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

I told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

She blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.

I talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also.

1995,Everyone Sucks,"My ex and I broke up and I found out I was pregnant very early on, at about 4 wks gestation (so 2 weeks after the last time we had sex). Funny enough we actually agreed to ""not try, not prevent"", so it wasn't exactly unplanned. We wanted to have a baby. We broke up kind of suddenly and probably for stupid reasons but all in all, it was for the best. 

He was in denial after I told him for a while and never checked up on me, so two weeks later I asked him if he wanted to be involved in the baby's life or if I should just plan on being a single parent. He says ""of course"" he wants to be in the baby's life. He asked what I need from him. I say right now I just need some emotional support, ask me how I am from time to time, maybe come to the first ultrasound, that kind of thing. He agreed to all things.

However, whenever if bring anything up about my pregnancy and future logistics, he'd shut down completely. Not once did he ask me how I am. We talked daily about anything else but my pregnancy and any mention of it I'd get left on read. 

I quickly gave up and the last time I ever mentioned anything about it was at 7 weeks when I told him the day & time of my first ultrasound at 8 weeks (I've had an early miscarriage before so my doctor wanted to see me for blood tests and to date the pregnancy earlier than usual). I said I'd really like him there as I don't have anyone else around and that it would mean a lot. He just responded ""ok"". I didn't bring it up again, neither did he, and of course he didn't come. He didn't ask how it went. We literally have not discussed anything pregnancy related since I told him that. 

Well, I just found out yesterday at my 12 week appointment that I've miscarried. There is no heartbeat. I am absolutely brokenhearted, even though my ex has been distant, I did want this baby. 

I feel like telling him is going to stress me out too much. I can't stand to be left on read about this. If I could guarantee some real empathy from him, I'd tell him. But for now I feel like, since he's not checking up on me at all, he probably doesn't care to know. 

I told myself I'd tell him if/when he asks about things. Who knows when that will be, though? 

WIBTA if I don't tell him, and let him continue to think I'm pregnant until he asks how I am or asks anything about the pregnancy? I don't intend to lie to him at all. I just don't feel like I need to volunteer the information if he doesn't care enough to check in.",441,2077,0.96
1996,Everyone Sucks,"A guy in my class self published a book about a year ago. It's only available online, and I read a preview out of curiosity and it was really bad. Poorly written, barely legible, and the plot and characters were all over the place. There was also an entire paragraph on the shape of a woman's breasts. As it's self published, he's pushing sales himself, and he keeps nagging me to buy it.

It's ¬£11.99 for an online only copy, which is insanely expensive. The book is 150 pages. That's like 9p per page. He keeps messaging me privately and bringing it up in conversations and I keep saying ""yeah... I'll take a look later... sorry I forgot last time"". He has been asking me weekly, at least, for the last year if I will buy it and read it. This ranges from telling me in person (with no actual segue into it), that he wants me to read and buy it.

Yesterday he asked me again, and this time he linked me to the book and asked me to buy it then and there. I snapped. I said ""look, I've been trying to be nice for a year now, but I could not give less of a shit about this book. I read the preview and it's not something I have any interest in whatsoever, and I will not spend 12 quid of my money on this bullshit you keep peddling.""

He was very upset, but I am so beyond sick of him telling me to buy his book. I'm a student, while I'm not broke, I don't have ¬£11.99 to spend on a 150 page online novel about the shape of a woman's tits.

1997,Not the A-hole,"So, I just bought a house this last week, and every night (and every day) this same dog 2 houses away will bark himself to death, likely rest his voice for 1 hour, and then get back to it for the next 23. 

Its incredible, truly. I honestly don't know how he can still bark.

Regardless, my small dog is the inside, napping, let-me-outside once a day type. This new dog stresses him out bc he thinks we're always on fucking defcon 4.

I wish there was a correlation to the barking and some other factor but honestly, he probably has an issue of some kind.

When we dated, she continued to talk with this guy, pick him up from bars and take him to work because he has a breathalyzer. She never told me this friend was an ex FWB until a few weeks before we broke up because the person who set us up noticed them talking a lot and told her to tell me because they thought he might overstep.

4 weeks after we break up, we talk and agree to work on things, go slow to get back together. We broke up because she felt she was dating me for other people (her family/friends/coworkers all loved me) and didn't know if she was happy. I ask her to go to a wedding with me, she agrees but cancels the week before due to school (law student) and work. I'm ok with this, I go alone.

1999,Asshole,"Asking because I go back in for a follow-up appointment soon, and because I got made to *feel* like an asshole.

Last year, I was diagnosed as diabetic with an A1C of 6.1 (which is borderline). Didn‚Äôt take any of the meds, test my blood, or make lifestyle changes. Follow-up test came out as 5.7. The one after that? 5.8. These tests took place over the course of almost a year; as far as I‚Äôm concerned, that means the issue has resolved.

Now, I go to the doctor once a month for another condition. At my last appointment, they tried to take my A1C again. I declined. 

The reality is, I‚Äôm not worried about my alleged diabetes. At no point during any of this have I experienced any symptoms, and my numbers went down without me making *any* changes. And I told them that.

But apparently that was the wrong thing to do/say, because my doctor spent the rest of the appointment (all five minutes of it) giving me the cold shoulder and otherwise being icy when normally he‚Äôs very friendly. 

And it has me considering changing doctors because that kind of reaction is just not okay. I felt like crap after my appointment. But I go back in a week, so I have to ask:
