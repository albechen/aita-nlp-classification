0,Not the A-hole,"I have a house I rent, and some of my neighbors have complaints about the property and it's maintenance.

I rent partially because I don't have the time to do the maintenance and I wanted a lease that put the landlord in charge of all that. And that's what I found; my landlord is responsible for all maintenance and landscaping and such.

He lives a few states over and sends guys he knows for maintenance.

Anyway, some of my neighbors have used me as a scapegoat for things they don't like about the house. What's grown in the yard, how it's an eyesore, how the siding needs to be washed.

I've said that they can tell my landlord about it.

They've gotten mad saying that if I live somewhere I should take some pride in it and do the bare minimum to make it presentable. I said that I picked a place where someone else was in charge of landscaping and stuff for a reason, and they really ought to call him or write him a letter or something.

They've all been pretty mad at me and I feel like there just mad because they can't get in touch with the landlord and I'm an easy target because I'm right there.

AITA for not having any more time to listen to that stuff and just saying to call the landlord?",324,4097,0.97
1,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr: i have large breasts that have caused me nothing but back pain, and my boyfriend thinks im self centered for wanting a reduction. 

For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. 

Starting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.

So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and ""caving in"" to ""societal pressure"". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. 

So, Reddit, i just need to know. Am i the asshole for this??


EDIT: 😂😂😂 I was not born with large breasts, but they are a genetic thing that ive had since i was about 16!",1089,19436,0.9
2,Not the A-hole,"I got in trouble at school this fall, I'm a junior in high school. 

(Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)

As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.

Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.

It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.

I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.

I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.

So I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.

So now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.

I said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it.

4,Asshole,"I'll try to make this short. I'm (38m) and my wife (33f) have been married for 11 years. When we met I had a 7 year old cat that was my bff  I had since he was a kitten. He was literally my whole life as cheesy as that sounds. Well he lived to be 18 and I had to have him put to sleep last summer before the world shut down. The week after I just couldn't take it. I was so heartbroken and needed time alone I booked a trip to Mexico (we live in the USA) and went there for 5 days. I just needed some time alone. I didn't tell my wife until I got there. I acted like I was just going to work for the day, but went to the airport. When I got there I called her and told her where I was. She was really upset I didn't talk to her about my feelings. I just couldn't. I wanted to be alone. It's been almost a year and I still feel bad about it. We don't have kids BTW.

5,Not the A-hole,"I'm a senior broadcast producer, and our manager just announced that we would be welcoming a new team member next week. However, when I heard his name, I internally panicked because I used to work with him in my previous company.

I was then an associate producer, and he was a senior associate. His biggest problem was his attitude. He was by no means my boss, it just so happened that he has more experience than me, but we have the same duties. However, he always liked bossing around everyone without the ""senior"" title. He's always delegating duties that were initially assigned to him by our actual boss.

He's also gay, which I initially had no problems with. However, he flirted with a lot of guys in the office, even straight ones with girlfriends and wives. It got so intense to the point where he sent unsolicited dick pics to some of us and we threatened to report him to HR if he didn't stop, which he eventually did.

Lastly, he was the kind of obnoxious, overachieving, credit-grabbing person who would do anything to get his name above everyone else. To be fair, he's really good at his job, but it really irked everyone in the office because of his attitude. He was one of the reasons why I left that job.

Now, I'm planning on telling some of my friends in my current work about him. When I ""warn"" them though, I'm pretty sure that the news would travel fast with office gossip. It has been three years since we last encountered each other, but everything still feels \~fresh\~.

So, WIBTA if I told my current coworkers about this person we're about to work with?

EDIT: A lot of replies are saying he may have changed. I left the company in 2017. He just left last month. I talked to some of my friends who still work there if he's changed, and they're adamant that he didn't. They said that before he left, he's bragging about how this new job offered him a much higher salary.",151,1016,0.96
6,Not the A-hole,"I live in a private neighborhood built around a lake. Essentially, the lake is in the middle and a road runs in a circle around it with houses on the road. Everyone who buys a house here pays an HOA fee to help take care of the neighborhood. Fixing docks, stocking the lake with fish, clubhouse maintenance, etc. Not a big body of water, about 1.5 miles around. There are lots of signs, including a big one right when you drive in, saying that the neighborhood is private for members and guests only. 

In the past month, all homeowners have gotten letters from the HOA saying to be on the lookout for people who don't living coming to fish since a lot of public parks have been closed. If we see someone who doesn't live here and doesn't have lake tags signifying that they are a guest, we should tell them to leave or call the maintenance guy who will handle it. You can see where this is going.

A week ago I leave my house and see a pickup pulled up to the dock in front on my house. There is a guy (dad) and his two small kids there fishing. I have never seen them before, so I go up to them and strike up a conversation. I ask where they live and they say that they don't live here but heard about the lake from one of their friends who also doesn't live there. We talk for a few more minutes and I tell the dad (whispering so the kids don't hear) that this is a private neighborhood and that they technically aren't allowed to fish here if they aren't a member or guest. I then say that they must not have known that and tell them to finish fishing for a day. I even offered to give them lake tags if anyone else hasseles them about being there. The guy thanks me, says he didn't know, and continues fishing the next few hours that I could tell after I went back inside. 

Two days later, I am going for a walk around the lake and I see the same family fishing at another dock (not in front of my house). I ask the dad if he has tags and he says he doesn't, but that his kids want to fish and they aren't hurting anyone. I say I understand that, but the people that live here pay for the lake, the docks, and the fish in it and it isn't for just anyone to come here and use. We get into it and I tell him to leave. He refuses, calmly, and I tell him that our maintenance guy will be here in 10 minutes and he better find some tags in that time period or else he's getting dragged out. I get back to my house, call the maintenance guy, and I see the maintenance guy drive up to them from my window and presumably tell them to leave which they do. 

Am I the asshole here? On one hand, it is private property and I let them stay and finish the first day when I could have easily kicked them out. On the other hand, they weren't hurting anyone.

8,Everyone Sucks,"My husband (35M), daughter (1.5F), and I (38F) are invited to my husband’s cousin’s wedding. We were all planning to attend but the wedding date was moved from mid May to end of November. 

The problem is that I’m due with my second child in mid October. My husband and I both agree we won’t be bringing the newborn to a large crowded  event. I suggested I will stay home with the baby while he brings our toddler with him ( kid will be over 2yo by then). 

He said "" No way! This is my cousin’s wedding. I want to enjoy myself not babysit.”

This upset me for several reasons. First, the term “babysitting”. Hello, this is his own kid we’re talking about!

Second, the implication our kid will inconvenience him too much. I’ve had to take my kid with me on numerous occasions when it was not convenient. During maternity leave the first year of my daughter’s life I’ve had doctors appointments, dentist appointments, long waits at the hospital for blood tests, even a breast biopsy all while having no choice but to go alone and bring my baby along and I made it work. Now my husbands is acting like bringing the kid to a family event, where there will be his parents and numerous aunts that will want to play with our daughter, is too much to ask. My father in law is especially great with her and always insists on taking the little one of our hands.

Third, not only would I be alone with both toddler and baby if husband attends alone, but if he gets wasted like he’d like he will be sleeping it off all of next day. Effectively, I will be alone with both kids most of the weekend. To be fair, husband did offer to hire a baby sitter to help me out during the wedding but our go-to sitter is 17 and relies on her parents to drive her. I don’t feel like we can impose on them to be picking up their daughter in the middle of the night.

Fourth, his plan to party hard makes no sense. We went to a wedding when my first kid was two months old and we left before the main course. We were just too tired and sleep deprived (because newborn).

Lastly, I know many in my husband’s family will be disappointed if my daughter is a no-show, especially my father in law.

I think my husband is being selfish, he thinks he is justified. AITA?",598,1251,0.93
9,Not the A-hole,"My FH and I are planning our wedding for August 2021. We got engaged back in August 2019, and we wanted a longer engagement (which ended up being a blessing because of everything going on in the world right now). Anyway, as soon as I got engaged, I knew my FH and I wanted a small wedding party. I’m only having my sister as my MOH, and FH (future husband) is only having his best friend as his BM (best man). But I’ve noticed since my engagement that my sister is trying to make everything about her, and hardly seems happy about my planned nuptials. 

Some background: my sister is an attention whore. I can’t have a conversation with someone around her without her bringing the subject back to herself. My engagement hasn’t been any different. She’s mentioned multiple times since my engagement that she wants her current boyfriend to propose this year. I have no idea if this is something they’ve discussed, or if she’s trying to force him into doing it. She apparently thought it was going to happen on her birthday, but when it didn’t, she was really upset. She said that after he proposes this year (hypothetically), she wants to get married next summer (July 2021), a month before me. While I know I can’t control this, she keeps bringing it up when I mention something about my upcoming wedding, trying to make it all about her. 

Over Christmas, she came with me to see a venue I’d been dying to see. She made awful “joking” comments to me about how she’s going to get super drunk at my wedding and cause a scene and throw up on my dress. It was really just a strange comment to make when the bride is your sister. She’s also been reluctant to make an effort as a MOH. She blatantly told me “idk what to do as a MOH, so don’t be surprised if you don’t have a bridal shower or whatever”. I haven’t asked her for anything, either... I’m just expecting nothing from her at this point. I told her she can wear basically whatever she wants as the MOH, which lead her to tell me she wants to get a boob job this year and have a dress that “shows them off”. 

My FH and I have been together 7 years now, and have been waiting for the right time to get engaged and married. I’ve said to my mom that it’s unfair for her to keep bringing up her hypothetical wedding/engagement plans when things are supposed to be focused on me for once, but my mom keeps saying it would be a blessing if both of her daughters ended up getting married at the same time. Even when I brought up her awful comments, my mom keeps saying I need to learn to take a joke. 

Would I be an asshole to ask someone else to be my MOH? I want to enjoy this time with her and feel like I just can’t because of her jealousy that she’s not the one in the spotlight.",116,791,0.95
10,Asshole,"Throwaway for reasons. So a few weeks ago the new Animal Crossing came out. I bought it immediately. My best friend is an Animal Crossing super fan, but is pretty poor and didn’t have a switch. She has no cable or TV or anything, and I wanted to do something nice. I tell her if she can come up with half the money for a switch I would pay the rest, she would just have to buy the game. She told me she doesn’t have income right now, and any money she does get has to go to bills. Understandable. I decide to get her the switch anyway. I show up and surprise her and she immediately tells me she can not afford it. I tell her it’s a gift. She’s super thankful and said she has to refund a plane ticket she got for her birthday to visit her family, so she may be able to pay back some of it, but that it wouldn’t be much because she really needs the money for groceries and bills. I tell her not to worry about it but deep down I’m hoping she will pay me back.
Her mom gets her the game for a birthday gift, and she LOVES the game. She is somehow farther than I am, and she always lets me visit her island to trade things. Well a few days ago MY switch breaks. It’s not fixable. So I ask if she ever got that refund, and if I can have my half of the money. She says she did get the refund but used most of it on groceries. I’m kind of annoyed because she should have set aside some money like she said she would. Why say something you’re not gonna do? I thought about it for a while and decided to ask for the switch back. None of her money went into it, so it’s technically not hers. She was really bummed out, but was a good sport about it.
I personally don’t think I did anything wrong because I bought it, but my girlfriend is now telling me I’m a “dick” because we both have decent jobs and easily could have replaced the switch we had. She’s really upset with me, and says if I don’t give our friend the switch back that she’s gonna go buy her one herself. Which I think is stupid. AITA here???

UPDATE: I have just read all of your comments and cannot reply to them all. First of all my girlfriend stole the switch back and brought it back to our friend without me knowing. She’s barely talked to me, and personally I think the whole thing has been blown out of proportion.For everyone asking how I can’t POSSIBLY see that I’m TA  I was taught that when someone gives you an expensive gift you’re obligated to pay them back in some way, but I guess not everyone was raised that way. Also for everyone saying I shouldn’t buy things I can’t afford. I am not struggling. I could have easily bought another one but why would I when I JUST bought one and it’s perfectly fine? That makes no sense.",820,3004,0.86
11,Asshole,"I recently received a save the date, checked not attending, included a cheque for $1000 as a wedding gift and mailed back to sender. They were very offended I am not showing up. They basically gave me an ultimatum and told my to get my ass to that wedding, a line I believe they stole from the movie wedding crashers. 

For background, this is not the only event I don't attend. I don't attend any events, including birthdays, bar mitzvahs,  happy hours, harry potter film marathons, etc... I have attended 0 weddings in the last 15 years and have responded 'not attending' to roughly 5-6. So I don't know why they would be that surprised with my response. I don't understand why you would even include a not attending option if its mandatory. 

Everyone thinks I'm the asshole. I don't have a valid reason for not attending. I'm just not a social person. The reason I think I am not the asshole is because these people have known me for over 10 years. They should know my personality and what I'm like, figuring I have never once attended any of their other events they have thrown. 

Also for more background, when I was younger, I used to check that I would attend and then just not show up. This is incredibly rude and disrespectful. When I am became older, I just started being direct with people and straight up telling them I'm not coming. 

Part of me thinks I need to just be a regular human being and show  up to support while another part thinks they should just accept me the way I am. I wouldn't have a problem if I had a event and someone didn't show up. It wouldn't bother me and I wouldn't be offended.",1132,4653,0.94
12,Not the A-hole,"There is a lot here. I live with my wife of 6 years, and her 19 and 14 year old daughters. My kids live with their mom and they are irrelevant to the story. 

Before I met my wife, I bought a restored 67 corvette. I love the car and I enjoy going to car shows in the summer. My wife has never been a fan of it, she doesn’t see the point to it and constantly argues with me about how it takes up space in the garage. She has talked to me multiple times about selling it, and I have never budged. Financially, we are in a good position and do not need to sell the car. My wife basically sees it as a lump sum of cash that sits in the garage, when “ideally we could use the money for something that benefits the family”. My wife is obsessed with cleaning and not having “junk”, she sees the car as unneeded clutter. 

We have a 2 car garage, my wife tends to park in the garage next to my corvette. I park my daily car in the driveway along with my step daughters car. 

Last week, this fight about my corvette came to a head. My step daughters car got “broken into” and she ended up getting a purse with 200$ cash stolen. I quoted broken into because she left her car unlocked I later found out. But she was crying to my wife about wanting to park in the garage. My wife came to me and said we don’t have The space for the corvette and suggested that we sell it and extend our garage since we have the land for it. That way everyone’s cars can be parked safely inside. 

I refused and said it’s not my problem that step daughter didn’t lock her car. My wife thinks I’m being an asshole, I told her the car isn’t going anywhere and she can work out with her daughter who gets to park in the garage space amongst themselves. 

Aita?

EDIT: there is a reason my wife doesn’t love the car, though I think it’s a pretty reason. I bought car from my ex FIL. I do not have a relationship with my ex more than I need to (because we do have kids together). My ex FIL and ex BIL are car nuts and I still have a good relationship with them because of our love for cars. My wife does not love that I still talk to my ex’s family.",449,3212,0.97

14,Not the A-hole,"My dad makes a lot of promises, but never keeps them and just says “I never said that” or something similar to go back on it. A little while ago, he told me that if I did the dishes I could have my TV permissions back (they took away everything above a certain rating) so I did, but he said he didn’t remember making that promise.

Every time before I do what he wants, I clarify in the clearest way possible what our deal is. So last night, he said that if I took the dogs for a walk I could stay up an extra hour to watch the rest of a movie I was watching. I agreed, but turned on the record option on my phone.

So the conversation was basically ‘So, if I take the dogs for a walk, I can stay up an extra hour and watch my movie?’ And he (annoyed) said ‘YES. I already said that didn’t I?!’. So I went for a walk, came back and he told me to go to bed. I told him what he said and he said 'I would never agree to that’ and told me to ‘stop lying’ so I showed him the video.

He let me stay up, but he got mad and said I ‘invaded his privacy’ and that ‘I had no right to record him’. They now look through my phone and delete any photos or videos they don’t approve of. I don’t think I really did anything wrong, but the rest of my family says I should’ve just let it go and not made it a big deal. AITA for recording my dad?

EDIT: I love my family, and I really don’t think my dad is abusive. I think he is just bad at keeping his word. Thank you all for your support though. Anyways, I brung up possibly signing it on paper as many of you suggested, and he got annoyed that I brung it up again and walked away. I’ll talk to him again when he’s cooled off a bit more

EDIT 2: So, I haven’t talked to him yet, but a lot of you have been asking a few questions so I’ll answer the two most popular ones. First off, I’m 15. Secondly, I’ve never not done housework or chores when asked. For my whole life it’s been about bribes though, and I’m not really sure if there’s a reason or if he thinks it’s a good ‘motivation’, but it’s been going on for as long as I can remember - and as for just refusing, if I do I get punished.

16,Not the A-hole,"So, one of my best friends is pregnant. She's only told a select few people. Her best friends, some family and a few others who've asked her directly for various reasons (example: a friend wanting to know why she wouldn't drink when going out).

A friend of mine texted me yesterday telling me, ""\_\_\_\_\_ is pregnant"". To my knowledge, this person shouldn't have known yet, because the pregnant friend was waiting to announce. So I texted the pregnant friend and asked, ""Hey, did you tell \_\_\_\_\_?""

She told me no, and that she wanted to know who told her. So I fished with the other friend, and asked how she found out.

Turns out, my pregnant friend's best friend (and roommate) was the one who told this person. At this point, I know I'm in trouble. I have trouble lying. I'm incredibly bad at it. And now I either have to tell her who told, and start a storm, or lie and tell her something else (maybe that they didn't tell me who told them).

17,Not the A-hole,"My wife has wanted a vegetable garden in our backyard. Now that it's starting to warm up I thought I would try to tackle something this weekend. I did some research online, looked up some designs, and tried to show my wife to get her input. She would only give me short answers and told me just to make something nice and show her when I had a plan. I mapped out our backyard and did some measurements, started planting some flags so she had a frame of reference, and called her out to the backyard to talk to her. The entire time I was trying to show her the design and get her opinions she was either on her phone, playing with our dog, playing with our kids, or just being randomly inattentive (""oh I like the flowers the neighbors planted""). I got fed up and asked her if she wanted a garden or not. She said yes, what I have is fine (she didnt look) and went inside. This morning I went to the store and bought about $200 in tools and supplies (not even building materials to start yet) and when I get home she asks me why I spent so much. I told her I needed the stuff we had and asked her how much she thought we would spend. She told me no more than $500 and I told her that's extremely unrealistic (it's a 15x15 foot garden with fencing surrounding it, gravel paths, and above ground planter boxes). I told her we could have figured this out before I spent $200 if she hadn't blown me off. She told me she didn't and I told her I'm just going to cancel the project and not do it. Am I an asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify a few things I left out so people get a better idea. I started putting drawings and ideas together while she was at work. I sent her a few texts as I went, and she was was responding here and there. That part was fine.  We had talked about going over the design in detail when she got home so we could get a plan and she agreed. In the evening, she was sitting watching tv, not taking care of the kids or the dog. I went outside to start putting flags in the ground and figure out how the design could be incorporated. After I had the flags down I called her out on the balcony to make sure she  understood my drawing and how it would look in the yard. It was when she was on the balcony and I was trying to explain this to her that she was on her phone/playing with the dog/kids and such. I tried to get her attention several times so she could understand what I was explaining to her and what would go into it, and this is where most of my frustration came from. The tipping point was her complaining about the cost when if she had taken the time when I was trying to explain to her, she would have understood better how much the cost would have been. In the end I decided not to do it because she seemed very ambivalent about the project, not as a punishment for her getting mad.

Oh, and the things I bought were a wheel barrow, a shovel, a cultivator, a rake and some gloves. Nothing like wood/seeds/dirt etc.

&#x200B;

Second edit. A lot of people seem to be making some really wild exaggerations in order to attack me, rather than ask for clarification, so I’ll add a few more details to address some of these. First, this wasn’t a project my wife started and I took over. She will often see something on Pinterest and ask me to make it for her. I don’t mind building things for her but I usually need to know what she wants me to make so I could make it. 

Second, a lot of people talk about my wife working 12 hours and being completely drained after exhausting herself at work. I admire my wife’s work and don’t want to downplay what she does in any way, but she is an administrative manager in records/supplies and sets her own hours, working about 8 hours a day. Most days she is calling me and texting me when she gets bored and has little to do. Again I’m not trying to say she doesn’t work hard, but people are painting this picture that she comes home after 12 hours on the verge of a breakdown and collapses with no energy to do anything else, and that is far from the truth.

Third, I’m in the navy and still work every day. This past week I was not working because I was on leave. I will be going back to work on Monday. 

I have no problem clarifying any questions people have, but don’t make up your own information because you want me to be an asshole. I posted this to see if I was an asshole in this situation, not in your hypothetical situation where I’m just like your dad or uncle who is controlling and beats his wife.",252,1068,0.95

I got laid off from work last January and our financial condition was really bad by February so I asked her if she could sell some of her crafts for money. She flat out refused and said that she is working extra hard and I should start looking for a job. 

I knew it was difficult for me to get a job and that harder days were coming so I decided to sell some of her glass crockery and table cloths on Etsy. I didn't tell her before selling them because I knew that she wouldn't understand.

We survived February and March with her freelance money and glass crockery sets and some of our savings. Today she was cleaning the shelves and she asked me if I knew where her crockery was. 

I told her that I'd sold them and she went absolutely hysterical. I was going to tell her later because I knew that she wouldn't understand otherwise. She called me a thief and demanded that I return her crockery immediately. I told her it was impossible and that she could always make the exact same ones.

She hasn't talked to me and is being completely unreasonable and inconsiderate.

19,Not the A-hole,"I have a fourteen year old step daughter, Raina. We’ve always had a great relationship since I dated and married her father Dan six years ago, but I can’t say the same about Raina’s mom Rene, who has always been cold and hostile to me. 

Rene blames me for ruining her marriage with Dan and has told me directly before that she and Dan would have gotten back together if I didn’t enter the picture. She and Dan were married but on trial separation when I met Dan, but he didn’t ask me out until his divorce with Rene was finalized. (Dan did tell me that meeting me was one of the reasons why he decided not to get back with Rene.) I just try to be civil with Rene for Dan and Raina. 

Recently Raina approached me and asked if I could lend her mom money to help the two of them start a business. She and Rene are close and bond over baking, and want to put up an online pastry business. Rene isn’t doing well financially right now so she’s not in a place to put up capital for the business. Raina doesn't want to go to her father for help because Rene still owes him money.

Raina said she knows that Rene and I don’t really get along but asked that I do it for her. Raina is smart and hardworking and I know that Rene loves her and will do what’s best for her, but knowing that Rene is involved makes it difficult for me to want to help. 

I make good money and can easily provide the amount Raina says they need, and I know that I should try to take this opportunity to extend an olive branch to Rene and show Raina that she is more important than my and Rene’s differences. But I can’t let go of the things that Rene has done to me before. 

The worst was when I suffered a miscarriage two years ago, and Rene told me that God knows who is fit and unfit to be a mother. I understand why she’s angry at me and thinks I ruined her marriage, but I think that no woman grieving the loss of her baby should be told that.

I don’t want to disappoint Raina and I know it would be best to show her that I can set aside my personal issues with her mother for her sake, but right now it’s just so hard to do.",241,1897,0.97
20,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been married for 4 years and instead of having a wedding we eloped. 

My mother was completely devastated. No one else in my family really  cared, everyone was very happy that we got married. For the past 4 years my mother has been asking us to have a “real” wedding. She says it’s completely unfair we eloped and brings it up constantly.

My mother sends me photos of weddings dresses, has cried at family gatherings over the fact we won’t get married and took the dress I wore when I eloped and wore it. She mentioned multiple times that she looked better it in than I did and posted photos on social media of her in my dress. 

Even though it’s been 4 years, she is adamant that we should have a “wedding” for our fifth anniversary. She wants us to have a cake that we can cut together, me to have a dance with my dad and to have a huge party with relatives. We keep saying no but she proceeds to bring it up when other family members are around. She has said she will never forget that we took away experiencing a wedding from her. 

She has offered to spend ridiculous amounts of money for a wedding and we have politely declined. She has told us we won’t be getting any money from her for anything else because the offer of money was only for a wedding (we don’t care)

So AITA? My family is torn. Some people think we should have a party so my mother can get over it and some have said wta for eloping since weddings are for family. My husband and I do not want to have a wedding and are glad we eloped. I have other siblings so it isn’t like there will never be a wedding.",200,1544,0.96

22,Asshole,"My sister has a large-ish Instagram following ( like 10k followers) and her IG mostly talks about veganism, cruelty free recipes, fashion ,stuff like that. I have a little fashion page, it is something I do for fun. We both live with our grandmother. She’s 22 I’m 19. 

My grandmother collects clothes. We have been going through her collection for a couple of hours a day, and finding some really cool vintage stuff from the 50s-80s. Everything is in pristine condition. My sister and I have both asked to have a lot of stuff.  My sister is smaller than me so had an easier time fitting into all of the cool bohemian stuff from the late 1960s (grandma was in her mid 20s) A lot of the things in my size were 80s jumpsuits, not my thing. 

I found several pairs of very cool shoes. The most iconic of them all being a pair of white patent leather Gogo boots with beautiful beading down the side and some suede thigh highs with a little fringe. I found them first. I knew I could make a killing online selling them, so I rushed to ask my grandmother if I could have them. She initially said yes, but when my sister saw them she begged to try them on. Of course they fit her. They didn’t fit me. She begged my grandmother to let her have them and she said that she would think about it. 

My sister asked me what I was going to do with them, and I told her that I was going to sell them! I could get between $800- $1000 for them. She shamed me for trying to sell grandmas stuff. She said that she would actually wear them and take care of them, so she deserved them. I disagreed. I also pointed out that she was vegan, why she would want leather shoes anyway. She said that used stuff and heirlooms don’t count. She went off to talk to my grandmother by herself that night. My grandmother ended up giving the shoes to her. 

My sister got all excited and was trying the shoes on with a bunch of different outfits. I asked her if I could take a picture of some of the outfits, she let me. I posted them to my IG, tagged her in the pictures and mentioned everything she was wearing, including the leather boots. My post happened to get a lot of engagement from her followers, and a lot of them were mad. She ended up losing like three hundred followers, and it became kind of a scandal. 

She got mad at me and caused me of trying to sabotage her for captioning the picture the way I did, and being jealous that she got the shoes. She told me to take the picture down. I did. She said that I could cost her or lose sponsors and money. I pointed out the money she cost me by sucking up for those shoes that I found first. 

She hasn’t lost any more followers, and has been doing damage control, but she’s still angry at me. I think she’s a hypocrite for wearing the shoes in the first place, and I asked her before taking the pictures. But I feel bad about how stressed out she’s feeling and the crazy backlash that she’s receiving, So AITA for posting them?

UPDATE: 
My sister is selling some of her own clothes, to make room in her wardrobe for the things she asked my grandmother for. I have seen some of my sister’s clothes and shoes on posh mark. A lot of people are trying to shame me for wanting to profit, but she is profiting too.",2041,10430,0.89
23,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because family knows my main.

Okay, here goes. This pissed me off to no end but I think mostly because it was unexpected. I think if they'd just been honest there wouldn't have been a problem.

So I was planning on going home to see my family for a bit. My parents moved recently into a smaller place so no longer live in the family home, and there's nowhere for me to stay. My brother also recently moved and I had yet to see his new place, which he said was massive. He's got two kids so I assumed as much.

He offers to let me stay with him rather than getting a hotel. Obviously, money is money so I eagerly accepted his offer. He specifically said he had a spare bed. You can probably see where this is going bearing in mind the title of this post.

I get to his house, ask where I should dump my bag, and he shows me to the bed. The bed is actually an airbed, which is outside, in the back garden, inside a flimsy fucking tent. There is a single pillow and a sleeping bag.

I mean jesus. So I laughed, I thought it was a prank and felt completely played. Fair enough, I thought. Just another in a long and storied tale of brothers getting one over on each other. Not something we have done much in our family, but to be fair after the initial surprise I ended up thinking it was quite funny. I did try and sleep outside but found it kinda rough, so I ended up coming back inside in the middle of the night and sleeping on the sofa.

I should say that he left the backdoor unlocked for me so I could use the kitchen, the bathroom, etc.

Anyway. Next morning I wake up and he tells me I've got to go. As in, leave the house altogether. It's like 7am. Turns out his wife has completely freaked out because I'm sleeping on the sofa. It's a brand new sofa and people can't sleep on it?? As if that's a thing. I tell him to fuck off because I'm sleeping. He is not joking though and I realise this finally. And yes, I literally get my things together and go.

The next day my mother tells me my brother was seriously offended that I didn't sleep in the tent, talked about all the effort he'd put into it and how he'd been planning it for ages. Like, he wasn't joking before. He really seriously thought it was cool to offer a spare bed and show me to a tent.

I'm not the asshole for sleeping on the sofa, right? Do I owe my brother an apology? I feel like I'm probably going to apologise because his feelings have been hurt, just to make him feel better and save face. But surely I don't actually owe him one? It was a fucking tent!!",584,5670,0.97

26,Not the A-hole,"My \[29F\] boyfriend \[31M\] and I have been together 1 1/2 years, living together for about 10 months. Yes, we rushed moving in together, I know. We were dating long distance and I work remotely and wanted a change, so I moved to where he was living and we got a place together. To make a long story short, he was unemployed during two periods totaling 7-8 months, during which time I financially supported us both. 

On top of daily life and monthly bills, I also financed the move, first/last/security, and purchased 90% of the furnishings in our home. Despite having a healthy savings beforehand, I incurred a good bit of debt from this. Any windfall money has gone straight to the debt, and I've been aggressively budgeting to make sure it's paid off as quickly as possible. He, on the other hand, has very different spending habits and is making this difficult.

When we moved in together, he asked for his paychecks to be deposited into my account as he admits he is awful with money. His money is mostly used on his personal expenses and about $300/month goes toward shared bills/groceries. I manage all the bills and keep track of our spending. This has ended up causing stress between us, as he spends quite a bit on unnecessary things. He suggested taking some money out of his paycheck and giving him a daily/weekly cash allotment as he knows he is better with cash than with cards. We figured out a number based on his average non-bill expenses and that's what he gets each week.

This has helped a bit, except he still manages to spend unnecessary money on my cards when I give them to him so he can stop at the store on his way home from work, etc. Instead of just grabbing what is needed, he'll also pick up a treat like ice cream or he'll see a good deal on a trinket and just grab it. It's very sweet that he's doing it thinking of me, but it puts me in a position where he's essentially spending \*my\* money on things \*for me\* that I \*don't need\*. It's all very frustrating, and no matter how many times we talk about it, it never really changes. He is truly awful with money.

I honestly am starting to feel like his parent, and I don't want to anymore. I can't just refuse to let him use my card since that would mean I'm not allowing him to access part of his income. At this point, I think it would be a good idea if we separated our finances. I make twice what he does and can handle the bills on my own, and putting all his money in a separate account would mean I no longer have to see what he's spending his money on. If it comes down to it, I'm okay with sacrificing the \~$300/month he's currently contributing in order to have financial peace in our relationship.

WIBTA if, once his income goes back to normal after being cut currently, I separated our finances and stopped letting him use my accounts?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's periods of unemployment and frivolous spending has put me into debt, since he shares my account. WIBTA if I insisted we separate accounts?",83,210,0.94
27,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple months back and it's still relevant today cause she's been throwing shade at me at our family group chat. 

We have a family reunion every year. Our extended family members are all invited to a small party just to enjoy ourselves for a day. 

It's mostly the elderly who gets all the fun though cause I hardly have cousins who are close to me, in the same age group. I have an aunt, who is kinda obnoxious. She has two children who are 5 and 10. They're spoiled as f*ck and being around them irritates me so much.

I was just minding my own business when her five year old son started asking if he could borrow my phone to play games. I told him no because I'm using it to ease my boredom. He started crying and went running to his mom. After a few minutes, my aunt marched up to me and lectured me out loud but not loud enough for everybody to hear, just those who are near enough. 

She went on talking about how selfish I am to not lend my cousin my phone and it's only for few hours since he'll be taking a nap later on. I was fine with all the shit she's saying until she got my mother involved (who is working overseas btw.) She said I'm just like my mother who is greedy and stuff like that.

I snapped.

I screamed at her saying that why don't she get her children a fucking phone and quit bitching about me not letting them play with my OWN stuff. I told her that it's not my obligation to lend my shit to her spoiled children. Everybody went quiet and it got awkward real quick so I just left.

Until now, she's still posting stuff on Facebook about ill-mannered children, who is obviously directed to me and has been throwing shade in our family group chat because I refuse to apologize. AITA?",105,1141,0.96

29,Not the A-hole,"So I (35F) am openly lesbian. I come from an extremely conservative background and so growing up was difficult with the kind of stereotypical religious, anti-LGBT parents I had. I knew I was a lesbian from a young age and accepted it when I was 14, but never told my parents. I had secret girlfriends, some long-term in this time and always kept it a secret. I eventually couldn’t handle living my life in secrecy so when I was 22, I moved out and away to New York as I knew it was always liberal and I fell in love with the city.

I expressed myself more there than I ever dod before and I even made some friends, one of them was Dan (35M). I learnt he was gay and also from an extreme background. We both still had our families in our lives and found it hard to outright cut them off and we were sick and tired of them constantly asking us questions about our love lives. This may be wrong in other people’s eyes; but it felt right to us to have a marriage of convenience. It would keep our families off our backs and so on, it made sense. So we got married when we were 25. We became roommates to keep up the ruse but both dated in this time. Our partners were aware of the situation and surprisingly cool with it. 

Currently, I have a partner of 7 years, Chloe (37) and Dan has a partner, Matt (38) of 5 years. Both know the situation and are happy to let us keep the ruse up with our families but it in no way affects our relationships. Anyway, Dan moved out recently to live with Matt and Chloe moved in. I’ve had the same neighbours for years and they wondered who Chloe was. They know Dan and I are legally married due to some mixups with mail between our places over the years and the fact they’ve heard us talking about marriage and our families. They presumed we had “split up” and were offering their sympathies to me and thought Chloe was a friend of mine moving in.

Dan and I have been at this ruse for 10 years now and We’ve been with our partners for so long that we both just instinctively laughed and said “Chloe’s my girlfriend.” My neighbours jaws dropped and said why the hell didn’t I tell them I wasn’t straight and that I was an AH for letting them believe for years I was a “happily married woman.” I didn’t bother explaining the whole marriage thing and just walked away but I’ve been receiving handwritten notes from them saying I am an asshole as I let them believe a lie for years and that they should know who they’re living next to. I felt like I didn’t need to justify my sexual preferences to my neighbours but perhaps I was wrong.

Also, before it’s asked, yes Dan and I have both thought about just getting a divorce and coming out to our families. However, they are so deeply homophobic that we couldn’t handle it all.

Update: need to mention, these neighbours are not friends. I’ve had small talk with them sometimes but that’s about it.",206,1950,0.95
30,Not the A-hole,"I (23F) am 6 month pregnant and I moved away from Florida where the Father, Alex (22M) lives. Me and Alex are both in college dated for 1.5 years but we broke up early last year but in October we had sex and I got pregnant. I found out I was pregnant the beginning of December but decided to focus on my exams and figure it after the semester was over so I didn’t tell Alex.  When I went home to Texas at Christmas I discussed it with my parents and decided to move home and finish my last two semesters online. I have no support structure in Florida, all of my family lives in Houston and this would be the easiest place for me to raise the baby. My parents has agreed to support me and the baby while I’m in school and to let us live in home for the first few years that I’m working. My mom no longer works so she has agreed to handle childcare while I’m studying then working. It is not an ideal situation but they are excited to be Grandparents and I would not be able to do this without them. I never intended to live in Florida after graduating and the other major of reason that I didn’t go back is so that the baby would be born in Texas and a judge couldn’t force me to stay in Florida or give up custody of my child. 

I told Alex that I was pregnant and wasn’t moving back the first week of January and he is pissed. We had a bad breakup and pretty much hated each other so it hasn’t been a smooth process. He feels that since we both lived in Florida when the baby was born I should move back there so he can be involved in the pregnancy and have split custody when the baby is born. Alex is from Florida so he would have his family to help him out when the baby was born but I would have no help. I think we need to figure out how to co-parent when the baby was born but until then I have the right to make the best choices for me. 

After the first call I decided that all of our communication would be through email. I send him any important updates on the pregnancy that involve the baby (nothing about my health, I don’t think that is his business) as well as the sonogram images. I plan on telling him when I go into labor and I’ll have my mom update as needed but again it would only be about the baby, nothing to do with my health. When the baby is born a Texas court will decide custody and visitation. He has accused me multiple times of parental alienation, I am not trying to cut him out of our child’s life but until the baby is born everything directly involves me and I want boundaries. Obviously since we are living in different states it won’t be 50/50 which is what he wants. And Texas courts are much more likely to grant the Mother primary custody, especially since he lives so far away. He has accused me multiple times of parental alienation, I am not trying to cut him out of our child’s life but until the baby is born everything directly involves me and I want boundaries but I feel really guilty.

Edit: I have a lawyer who is advising me throughout my pregnancy and will file on my behalf when my daughter is born. Legally I have done nothing wrong and Alex has no rights until she is born.",736,913,0.92

• Jason is single, and the person who asked me to eat pasta of his ""peter"", that was my fault as I didn't realize I accidentally switched the names

• I have asked both Billy and Jason to stop before, several times. 

• I have also told Jason that I'm not interested in him, but he has a habit of trying to sleep with female friends. Silly me for thinking I was different. 

• Someone pointed out the therapy comment Jason made, I grew up in a very abusive household and have been in almost exclusively abusive romantic relationships. I have a very hard time sticking up for myself and that's one of the reasons I go to therapy, and they know that.

• I'm not with my fiance anymore, we broke up 2 years ago.

• I blocked both of them last night and didn't give them the opportunity to say anything. I feel a little sad, but a lot better. 

_________________________________


I have a group of friends, two of which we'll call Jason and Billy for the sake of this story. 

I have been friends with Jason and Billy for 15 years. We grew up together playing video games, and me being the only girl in the group of 5+ guys meant that there were a lot of crushes on me.

I ignored them when I was a teenager because, hey, they're just crushes. 

10 years later I got engaged, and when I told Billy in person he said ""I guess this is the wrong time to tell you I've always had a thing for you."" Yes Billy, it is.

Fast forward to today. Jason has made sexual advances on me for some time, claiming this is his personality. He took me on a ""date"" without telling me he expected it to be a date, and not just a good friend taking his other good friend out to dinner. I had just broken up with my fiance at the time, so I guess he was trying to slide in.

Billy, although he lives with his girlfriend, and has been with her for 5 years, sends me memes about sex and masturbation. He also sends me memes about thick women (I'm what you would call thick) and just says ""u"". I usually leave them on read because they're borderline inappropriate and make me feel uncomfortable.

Billy also asks if he should go ""fap"" and I never know how to respond so I just say ""sure haha"", but it makes me feel like a shitty person, because if I were his gf I would not be okay with what he says/sends to me. 

Today, I put a picture of pasta on my snapchat story. Jason replied to it and said ""Can you eat that off my Peter? No forks cause ouchie."" And. I. Lost it.

I said to him ""I will never have sex with you. I don't want to. I will block you if you continue to make sexual advances.""

He immediately got defensive and said:

""I’m sorry if you take any of my advances seriously but you forget these couple of things 1. I’ve known you for 10 years so I’d expect you know how my humor is by now 2. You live in [redacted] obviously I’m not driving all that way to have sex even if I was serious and 3. You threatening to block me is childish instead of having a real conversation, that being said moving forward I’m not going to be helping you with any of the issues that you constantly come to me to since clearly you don’t understand me as a person or a friend.""

I apologized (even though I felt like I shouldn't have to) and told him I felt that he was only my friend because he wanted to sleep with me, and that I've felt this way for some time.

He told me to go to therapy more, and that the apology didn't fix anything.

Meanwhile, I flipped out on Billy, because I am also tired of Billy's shit, and he sent me about 10 paragraphs. I didn't respond, because he said ""I wouldn't respond like an asshole, like I always do.""

I don't want to lose my friends but I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. I'm stressed, I'm tired, and I want people who are my friend because they like me as a person, not because they want to sleep with me.",424,2340,0.94
32,Not the A-hole,"So I transfered locations at work due to moving. I had not got my position from the previous store right away and worked really hard to get it back. Unlike my original store this one had two people for the department rather then one. I'll use a fake name for this but a very similar situation.

My coworker Anna was an older lady who has been working that department for 10+ years and she just could not get my name right.

She's always call me Margret rather then my real name Peggy. 

My birth name is Peggy (not really but close.) She refused to believe me. 

Any time shed call for me I didn't respond because I never realised she was talking to me. She'd yell at me to get my attention and say stuff like ""Margret I need you to help this customer."" And similar stuff and I'd say ""is Peggy."" But all she'd do it get dismissive and say ""yeah whatever, I'll call you what I like."" I'd tell her no, I'd like to be called my name.

33,Not the A-hole,"for background, I (18F) was born in a middle-eastern country. My parents brought me into the country that I am now when I was four and i was raised here. However, we (my parents, my two sisters and I) go back there each two years or so.

Last winter, we went there for 2 weeks before coming back and I did not enjoy myself at all. Since I was young, the people there would denigrate me, make fun of me or be mean, just because I was a girl. Because of that, everytime we would be back home, I refused to talk and cried a lot. I also stopped talking the language of the people there. I didn't forget it, it's just that when I tried to speak, it takes e back to the times when I was mistreated. So this takes me back to last winter. Upon our arrival, we were greated by one of my uncles, who is very kind. He brought us up to where we would be living for a week (we were gonnna stay there and then go see the other part of my family). As soon as we entered the house, I felt ill. It was situated on a high moutain and my body does not react well to high altitude. For the next 3 days, I was sick and couldn't move. During that time, my family went to visit people (I'm not mad at them for that, most og them they didn't see for 2 years). While in bed, i could hear my cousins talk about me, saying that I was ungrateful for what I and all sorts of mean things. After that I completely shutted down for the rest of the week.

But the real problems came during the other week, with my mom's family. They are very kind people, but they don't know boundaries. Whether it's talking about me while i'm still in the room, letting my cousins look into my luggage, or trying to show me ""what being a real woman is"". The worst came when a friend of my mother came ""because she learned that my mom brought back her daughters"". Because I was the only one there, she introducted me to her 2 sons, who were respectively 34 ans 47 yo. My parents were furious when they learned that happened but the damage had already been done.

When we came back, I told my parents that I decided that I would not go back there and they accepted my request, but my sisters said that I was TA for making my parents choose between them and their family.

34,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my boyfriend atm stays home and I work three 12s a week. That said, I like to meal prep so I don’t have to cook every day for my lunches. 

Well, my boyfriend, WHO STAYS HOME ALL DAY, thinks it’s a good idea to eat my lunches while i’m at work. I’ve asked him to stop but he says, “But your food is so good. Plus why don’t you make more so I can have some?” I’ve told him multiple times that I’m stressed and that I can’t make more meals because it’s a lot of work. 

So he continued to eat my food. I remember that he HATES spicy food while I really enjoy it. So what do I do? Add spice. A lot of it. 

Last time he ate something of mine, he called me yelling at me. He said I was being an asshole and that I know he hates spicy food. I told him, “Tough. Stop eating my food then.”

Now he’s mad at me....

Tl;dr- After asking my boyfriend NOT to eat my meal prepped food, I purposely made my latest meal preps SUPER spicy and now my boyfriend says I’m an asshole. AITA?

UPDATE: Holy smokes, I didn’t expect for this to blow up... as for some questions, doubling my recipes would take more time. I use a lot of veggies and rice when I cook and I homemake my sauces and which takes a lot of time. 

For those of you who say I need to dump him, it’s a big consideration, but it’s hard. He may not be the most considerate person and I’ve brushed it aside since I’ve been very lonely for a while. When we first started, he used to cook a lot for me and that was great. But after we moved in together, he changed and expected me to cook/shop/clean more often. Worst of all, dating for me is extremely difficult. I work in transportation, and while I have a schedule now, I used to have to work nights so dating was hard. A lot of dates were upset with  me and my job because of lack of availability. This guy seemed independent enough that me being gone for two to three days wasn’t a problem. For reference he’s early thirties and I’m late twenties. 

Honestly, I’m overwhelmed with what to do. We have a lease together and while I can fully support myself, he can’t since he’s laid off and I’d feel terrible to kick him to the curb. So for now, I’m logging out... thanks everyone.

UPDATE TWO: Okaaaaay so after a long conversation with my now ex-boyfriend... we decided to end it. I told him that eating my food wasn’t okay and that because he’s home all day since he was laid off, he still needs to carry his weight with the housework, shopping, and cooking like he used to when we first met. What happened? He had a Brett Kavanaugh style break down. Just started crying and saying it wasn’t fair because he’s stressed and shouldn’t have to worry about, and I quote, “Stupid things like cooking and cleaning.”  So I told him my perspective that I’m tired, I’m dealing with people all day, and I just want my lunch untouched or replaced when I meal prep. I mentioned that it was never a problem in the past and don’t understand why it’s an issue now. He just started yelling at me saying I was starting a stupid argument and that it’s not an issue. He doesn’t have the money to get takeout like he used or buy food. He said that because he was laid off, he needs me to buy all of the groceries, pay his half of the rent and utilities, and cook for him. 

We then got into other issues of our relationship and things that have been building for a while. These are things I’d rather not get into, but nonetheless, I told him I’m tired and honestly would be happier without him. He stopped crying, got all red faced, and started screaming at me. I told him to get his stuff, go to his parent’s house, and not come back.  When he tried to fight it, I told him that I won’t hesitate to call the cops since the neighbors probably heard him screaming at me. This Monday, he and I are going to the leasing office to get him off the lease. I’m in the process of boxing up his stuff for him to move out. I’d rather do it myself and have him take his boxed stuff than have him here and do it. The less time I have to see him, the less chance I’ll change my mind. 

Honestly, I cried a lot last night. But after a while, I realized it was nice to be alone in my own bed. I could actually spread out and enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who have been supportive. I’ve been unhappy in this relationship for a while and just didn’t know if breaking up was the best course of action. Thanks for saying that I deserve more and letting me see past rose tinted glasses.",1996,20261,0.93

36,Not the A-hole,"My  sons mother moved almost 6 hours away from me when our son was 2 and a bit.

From Oxford to Glasgow, to be with her family.

At first he visited frequently, every summer, school holidays, every other Christmas, birthday and Halloween and I'd visit every weekend that I didnt work.

When my son was 13 he decided he didn't want to visit anymore, I'd visit him instead as much as possible.

His room  remained empty.

I met my wife three years ago she had a 7 y/o, since my then study was larger we decided to empty it and turn it into her bedroom, my sons bedroom remained the same, he hasnt visited since his 16th birthday and he only spent a week.


My son, now 18, has decided to come spend time with me.

The problem being November last year I changed his bedroom into the study so my daughter has somewhere to do her homework and I can work from home.

He spent a few weeks on my sofa and then went home.

My ex texted me saying what an AH I was for converting my ""own sons"" room into a study and replacing him and how he felt replaced, uncomfortable and like he wasnt apart of my new family.

I text him every day and still visit as much as possible, he was aware of the room change.

Yesterday afternoon, a new neighbour in our flat knocked on our door. It was a young woman and she asked if we had any sugar at home she could borrow to use for her baby's milk for the day, since she can't go out to buy any and her husband is working.

I told her that I had some sugar left, but it's only enough for the apple pie I was planning to make that evening. She said that she really needs it since her 2 year old baby refuses anything else to eat, and that it would be a kind gesture if I could give up my apple pie for another day.

I kindly refused and I mentioned that if she really needs it, I can go out and buy it for her **(I meant with her money)** but I'm not looking to give my sugar away.

She wasn't happy and sarcastically thanked me as she was leaving. I just closed the door and continued about my day.

I'm always one to doubt my previous actions and I question myself as to whether I was right or wrong, so I told my parents.....and they told me I was selfish for not helping someone out and that they expected better from me as a gentleman.

38,No A-holes here," 

I (25f) live at home with my parents. To cut a long story short, I was a slobby mess as a teenager. My bedroom was constantly a mess, I lazed around eating junk all the time, and my hygiene habits were admittedly not the best either. I have, happily, grown out of all that and am a neat, clean adult with much better eating habits. Part of my big lifestyle overhaul was saving money from my job to do up my room just the way I wanted - I'm in my parents old room and was using a lot of their old furniture which was great for two people but impractical for just one. The result is that the furniture I have put in is better laid out and the room is much more open and A LOT easier to keep tidy, having also had a massive de-clutter of old junk.

The downside is that my parents like to make jokes about this a lot. I took it all in at first, but now it is starting to wear a little thin. Comments such as ""Oh my gosh, what is this strange thing I can see?"" (my bedroom carpet) ""You're hoovering AGAIN? Are you feeling ill?"" ""Oh wow, you finally learned what a wardrobe is for!"" It's wearing thin because I don't like being reminded of the sloppy person I used to be and want them to help me continue and improve these better habits. I've brought it up before but they just say they're trying to pay me a compliment and not take it so seriously.

So, WIBTA if I re-addressed it and was a bit more firm in asking them to stop? If not, what would be the best way to go about it?",50,335,0.96

When I had my son (who is now 11) they came and stayed a couple months to help me when he was an infant. That couple months continued year after year and stretched to three months. This caused issues in my marriage and was just not pleasant. They are both narcissists and are hard to live with. I did not stand up to them. Within the past two years I got into therapy started some medication, got a divorce and my own place. I am spending an extra $300/ month in rent to have a guest room so they can visit my son. Well last time they visited my boyfriend had just moved in. Things didn’t go well. They treated him like shit, and as usual they did not help clean, purchase any groceries or with any bills while they lived here for three months. 

I just told my mom that they are welcome to come back this year (for my son) but at maximum for six weeks. This did not go over well and apparently I am a terrible daughter and am ruining her relationship with my son.

I know I need to stand up and have more of a backbone, but as some people have mentioned it’s not super easy when you have been dealing with it your whole life. My therapist is super pleased with my progress and the fact I was able to even put this boundary in place.

44,Not the A-hole,"I have been married to my wife for five years now. Her mother is morbidly obese and suffers from asthma, as well as a bad diet and diabetes. She had been staying with us for a month before the stay at home orders were put into place due to losing her apartment, and while her and I were never the closest or best of friends, I agreed to let her stay with us rent free. I only ask that she cleans up after herself and watches over our puppy while my wife and I work remotely.

But instead of doing the few things we had asked of her, apparently she's been using her free time snooping on us. My wife had let her use her iPhone so MIL could facetime one of her grandkids, and after she must have looked through the phone and snooped through our messages. She has also admitted to putting her ear to our door or listening to us when we think we're alone.

My wife and I dabble in BDSM behind closed doors. This usually includes a lot of degradation and humiliation. A lot of our 'sexy' texts to each other would be considered pretty misogynistic however it is entirely consensual (not to mention it was my wife who even introduced the idea). Now that MIL is around we obviously keep this quiet and in private, but apparently she's snuck up on us when we're in the kitchen or sitting on the couch together and has heard me call my wife names or grab her ass.

She 'confronted' us a week ago and decided to ask me why I thought it was okay to speak to her daughter that way, and then directed the questions to my wife asking her how she'd let a man speak to her like that. We both responded by telling MIL to mind her business but it didn't do anything to shut her up. She had blocked us both on facebook but I was told by BIL that MIL had been posting about how abusive I am as a husband, how I've brainwashed my wife into thinking she enjoyed this, while in the same breathe calling my wife a bootlicking hoe. This was backed up by screenshots.

I'm beyond pissed and my wife is embarrassed and ashamed. We obviously don't want our friends and family to know about our sex-lives, and my wife is particularly afraid that it will affect our careers in the long run. We've demanded MIL to delete the posts but she won't budge. At this point, I don't want her leeching off of us especially if she thinks I'm some kind of abuser, and want to kick her out (my wife is on board), but I also hate to think of kicking an old lady at risk out on the street. She exhausted all her options as my wife's siblings are either tired of her or have children and therefore no room to keep her.

46,Asshole,"Hi all

**Background info:**

Our daughter is 13 and last year she put A LOT of weight on. She admitted she wanted to go on a diet. I said she just needed to make healthy choices and really stick to them and that I would keep her accountable. We agreed that she would weigh once every two weeks, if she had lost 1.5lb or more she could have a cheat and the rest of the time we would eat healthy food, get plenty of exercise, etc. 

**The restaurant:**

MIL had her birthday in January at a grease spot in our area. When we weighed in Daughter had put 2lbs on. We agreed that we needed to get back to healthier eating so no gorging at the restaurant. She agreed and her idea was to go one whole month junk food free.

We get to the restaurant, me and daughter had looked on online and planned our meals around what wasn't too high in calories. I can practically see everyone at the table rolling their eyes when I order water and no starter for me and Daughter.

Grandma orders all of Daughter's trigger foods for the whole table -- stuff that I KNOW she would never normally order for her own taste. Daughter instinctively goes to eat some of the food. I remind her that we're making healthier choices this month, no junk food. I can tell the family is FUMING that I encouraged her not to break and gorge herself with them.

When it came time for dessert Daughter reached for a menu, I gently reminded her that we had healthy snacks at home. My husband and son ordered a dessert along with the rest of the table and at this point my sister-in-law made it a thing.

""So, OP, it's just Daughter who has to stick to your healthy lifestyle?""

""It's her goal and her choice. Husband and Son haven't said they want to lose weight and do a junk food free month.""

""Really? Seemed like she wanted some of the food earlier. It seems like she wants a dessert too.""

""Sometimes it's not easy to stick to our goals without support.""

""Maybe you should just let your kid be a kid and worry about her weight a little less.""

""Maybe you should mind your business and worry about it a little less too.""

I asked MIL after to be more supportive of Daughter's healthy eating and got a message saying, ""Next time you're having a junk free month maybe you shouldn't come to eat out."" So the family are now excluding us from get togethers.

In-laws keep bringing the birthday meal up as an example of me being cruel, where as my friends agree that I'm doing what's best for Daughter in the long-term. My husband says he can see everyone's point of view but is starting to feel that what happened at the restaurant was wrong on my part.

47,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been working with my colleague Mika for five years and we are good friends. A few years ago our team went on a weekend outing, and on the first night someone suggested that all eleven of us sleep in our cabin’s living room. I don’t know why my boss thought this was a great idea, but since he seemed enthusiastic about it, everyone went along. I was tired from our hike that afternoon and apparently I snored loudly the whole night. 

Most of my coworkers slept through my snoring but Mika couldn’t, and she’s never let me live it down. Whenever we have to stay somewhere overnight she always brings up how I snored like a wounded whale during that vacation and jokingly warns my would-be roommates about bringing ear muffs or noise cancelling headsets. 

Last month our team was planning our summer outing (summer is April/May where I live) and I was in charge of booking our hotel. I told Mika in front of some of our coworkers that I'll make sure that she and I are staying in the same room. She laughed and said that she’ll sleep in the lobby if she has to but she will never sleep in the same room as me again because she doesn’t want to pass out the next day from sleep deprivation. 

After that my coworker James approached me and told me that I shouldn’t joke about booking the same room for me and Mika because it’s disrespectful to her and to my wife. I didn’t think it was a bad joke, but I didn’t want to have that conversation with James so I just told him OK. 

I still think my joke wasn’t disrespectful and is appropriate given the friendly relationship I have with Mika, but I want to know what you guys think.",246,1617,0.95
48,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I moved into a detached townhouse a few months ago. It's a rental, I'm leasing it for a year with the option to extend that with a second year or possibly buy the house.

My driveway is right next to the neighbours', it big enough to fit 2 regular sized cars and halfway down my driveway there's a path leading around my house., on side side of the path is my house on the other sides about 3m of yard , that's mine.

&#x200B;

Ever since I moved in I've been having issues with the neighbours using my driveway for parking, turning their cars, storing their other stuff, playing, etc etc. Asking them to stop using it and keep their items on their own property has not worked, so I placed a few large plants, installed a camera and a no trespassing sign, and that helped a bit. At least the cars are gone.

The last few weeks with the 'stay home' advice, I've been working from home, but the neighbours kids are making that really hard. They're about 5 and 7, boys, and they keep ringing my doorbell multiple times a day to ask if they can play with my dog, if I want to play with them or anything else they can think of. I asked them to stop it so I can work, which of course didn't work, so I asked their parents, and was told boys will be boys and they weren't going to do anything about it :( To keep my sanity intact I removed the battery from the doorbell but now they keep running around in my front yard, on the path around the house, banging on my windows, banging on my doors and actually tried to open the gate to my backyard this morning as they heard me in there. I once again asked them to stop, told them I will not be allowing them to play with the dog anymore at all if they keep this up and they left, sending over their dad. I told him to keep the boys away from my property and door, if not, I'll be planting some prickly bushes to teach them to stay away from other people's property and shut the door in his face.

Me (f22) and my fiancé (m23) are getting married in 2 months and have difficulty securing a rental property in this economy.

We found a perfect two bedroom home with a garden and a driveway for a affordable price in the city. We rang the number on the ad and was put through to this woman, from the start she seems unbothered and very dismissive like she wanting to get us off the phone and generally unhelpful. She took our details verbally and said she would get in contact with the landlord with our and get back to us.

A week goes by and nothing, we were pretty keen on the property so we called for a update and she said she will send us a email to fill out (asking about our income and such)... like wtf why didn’t we do this when we first called. We filled it out and sent it to her within 10 mins. 3 weeks go by and nothing again, no update or anything. Very annoyed at this point we requested to deal with another staff member who called us back within 30 mins and told us the landlord accepted another offer.

Honestly I really felt like she wasted our time, so I looked online for her boss’s email and sent him a very upset email about the unhelpfulness and rudimentary service we received from her, I expressed it has really dampened our first impressions of the company as a young couple. 

I received a email back the next day apologising and he even showed me very similar properties on the same street and said If we was interested he’d personally deal with it.

We rang up today interested and found out she has been dismissed and the person we are currently dealing with said they will help us as much as he can if we promise not to send a email to his boss loool.

Me and husband have not great relationships with our families and no contact with some, for a lot of reasons, but are doing by far the best emotionally and financially, which can cause tension. 

* edit 2 * to clarify- we have no contact and bad relationships because most of them severely abused us both as kids, those we do have some contact with are siblings who have chosen to try to build bridges with the older ones 20 years on 

They have all rang insisting on giving us all their second hand stuff, I mean, piles and piles of it. My sister had a child with someone from a family with hygiene and smoking issues and we especially do not want clothes from them.

I spoke generally to everyone that we would like to buy our own stuff and gave our reasons (they know our m/c history) and also that as its our first child we would like to buy stuff new that we have chosen. 

 Also that if they want to buy anything new the money would probably be more useful so we can get the stuff we need.

Now my mom is pregnant and last week they took the smallest room from my sister to make it a baby room, moved my sister in to my room and moved me back in with my stepbrother, as you might imagine I threw a fit but I was told to drop it as such I told my dad I want to move to his house where I have my own room, when my sister heard she immediatly asked my dad as well since we are very close and she doesn't want to live alone with our youngest stepbrother, he said yes and since we're both over 14 we can decide where to live ourselves.

I also have a cousin who will turn 20 next week. Due to the current situation they had to postpone her birthday party until july. Because my cousin threw a huge fit about not being able to have a party on her birthday her parents promised to throw her a huge fancy party to calm her down.

My cousin is not really and easy going person and because she and I are so close in age she often sees me as ""competition"". Whenever I tell a story she always interrupts me mid-sentence and then tries to tell a crazier story but most of her stories turn out to be lies. Her constantly trying to one-up me is really annoying. My cousin also doesn't have any friends because she often sees herself as superior and not a lot of people have the nerve to put up with that behaviour.

My cousin also has a lot of body image issues. She has been morbidly obese since she was a teenager because of unhealthy diet and no excersise. This has kind of resulted in her hating skinny/normal body types and she often talks crap about ""skinny b*tches"" (her words, not mine).

I on the other hand am pretty skinny because I play basketball, excersise a lot and try to eat healthy most of the time. She loves to make fun of my clothes because I like to wear dresses, skirts, skinny jeans that fit my body well.

If she disapproves I would have to send her new outfits until she approves one of them. And only I have to get her approval of my clothes, everybody else doesn't have to.

I know that she's behaving this way because she's so insecure about her body but honestly I don't want to give into her request because I don't want to feel like there's anything wrong with my clothes.

Barely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had “other commitments” despite confirming they’d be there months prior. 
One of my aunts (my grandma’s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren’t going because they still didn’t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her “Christian views”, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. 

This upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom’s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding; while my stepmom’s entire family came.

 What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom’s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom’s wedding would not be invited to mine. 

Fast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom’s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. 

We even invited my stepmom’s family too. 

Obviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn’t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife.
 My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.

I finally got to the bottom of it when I was picking her up and she was acting up cause she didn't like that we had to go pick up my son from his friend's house. I told her that it would only take a minute when she let the bombshell out and said something like ""he's not my full brother so why do I have to wait for him?"" I asked her why she thinks like that and she told me that her dad tells her that they aren't her full siblings and should be treated as such. I felt TERRIBLE that I didn't notice that sooner and I told her that she doesn't have to get along or even like her siblings but they are her siblings and wether she likes it or not she we are all in it together as a family.

When I got home I called my ex and told him to stop feeding her info that its ok to be mean and treat her siblings mean. He told me to ""mind my own business on how to raise her"" I really didn't call to start a fight and I just told him to never bring up her siblings when she's over ever again.  My husband saw me arguing with him and he just took my phone and hung up cause I was getting worked up.  He told me to not engage with him and that its not gonna help anything.  While he agrees me for telling him off I could have been nicer about it.  AITA?",231,1794,0.96
58,No A-holes here,"Seven years ago, my biological sperm donor cheated on my mother with a college aged girl that was like two years older than me. I cut him out of my life, went FULL no contact since he was a real bastard and I found it incredibly creepy that he was now ""dating"" someone that was basically my age. I haven't kept up with his life, I made it really clear to everyone in my family at the time, I want nothing to do with him and if they wanted me to still come to family things on my dad's side, that was my condition.

Everyone respected my boundaries, until recently. 

Turns out, Sperm Donor got married to his 25 yr old GF, and had a kid. But surprise, surprise, their massive age gap relationship wasn't all roses and they got divorced pretty quickly later. Not my problem, but now ex-Wife is getting remarried and gave Sperm Donor full custody over their 5 yr old. Sperm Donor was a pretty shitty parent with us, so unsurprisingly, I doubt he's too keen to be a single dad at near 60. 

Here's the problem. Gran and Auntie want me to ""develop a relationship"" with the five year old half sibling. It's still my ""blood"" apparently. I want nothing to do with his midlife crisis lovechild, and neither does my brother. And honestly, to me, it feels like Sperm Donor is just trying to get free babysitting/weasel his way into our lives again. I've lived through seven years without him, and I'm happy to die this way. I'm thirty now, I have no interest in getting to know my five year old sister.

This was when we were dating fast forward to last night, my sister-in-law was speaking to my wife very aggressively and disrespectfully ordering her around like she was her pet (actually she treats her pet better but that's a whole other thing) and I spoke up and said ""you don't need to speak to her like that that your sister"" this girl precedes to tell me that my wife is her sister if she can talk to her anyway she wants.

60,Not the A-hole,"Sup peeps, hope all of you are doing amazing,

Alright well, few years ago my parents were abusive asf. During high school we had this “ag science “ type of science and one of the requirements of the class was raising some type of farm animal. One of said options was a bunny so I’m like “hey bunnies are cute asf” so I went for the bunny. My parents had always hated animals so, then being them, they let my rabbits outside in 105 degree weather in Cali. (In a tiny 1x3foot cage for 2 fully grown rabbits) they started showing symptoms of having heat strokes but again, they wouldn’t let me bring them in or even touch them. Male bunny eventually died that summer from a heat stroke. 

Once I moved out I took my bunny with me and got a dog as well. 

Well, parents came to visit etc. they started complaining about just having my pets IN the house “that’s disgusting” “how do you live like this?” I’m like “ they’re trained, clean and healthy.” Mom was like “but the hair.?!” “No that’s disgusting, put them outside” 

Back when I lived with them they’re excuse for literally everything was, “my house my rules, the rabbit stays outside” “she’s literally panting hard asf....” “I don’t care, don’t bring that thing in here” 

So now my house my rules too I guess and was like “you want them outside? Cool, get the fuck out” she’s like “what?” I’m like “I don’t fucking know how you could ever think I’d pick you over them, you don’t like them? They mean a thousand times more than you do, either live with it or get the fuck out” 

Entirely logical in my opinion.

Now due to recent additional stressors are work it’s more like 50-55 and I am mentally, physically exhausted after working all day and dealing with the additional stress/frustration/constant policy changes.

Years ago, prior to having our child she wanted to work and asked me to “help” her find a job. That “help” consisted of me creating her resume from scratch (she didn’t know how to) and filling out applications for her (each online application takes a good 15 mins to complete now) while at the time I was working FT and completing grad school FT in an accelerated program.

Incident: My beautiful, sweet wife is a stay at home mom. She cooks, cleans, takes care of our child. Today, she mentioned to me that she wants to earn some money by opening up a catering service. I told her that I think it’s a fantastic idea and outlined a complete business plan for her (watch YouTube videos to learn how to take quality professional photos with our DSLR camera, take photos of the food she makes, create a Facebook page, join various Facebook groups and start marketing, etc.). This was not what she had in mind, she wanted me to do all the front-end work; (take photos, create a Facebook page, market on Facebook and virtually network to our community, etc) and for her to just cook the food. When I told her “no and that I don’t have the mental/physical bandwidth for that due to already working a high-stress/high-demanding job.” Her response was “Fine, don’t help me or support me.” To which I responded, “I did help you by outlining a complete business plan for you; however, if this is something you want to do, you need to put in the hard work.” She knew I was firm in my decision, therefore, she dropped the idea and hasn’t mentioned it.

64,Not the A-hole,"I (20F) am half Korean, half white. Most of my life, I ignored my Korean side. Lately, though, I've been trying to get more into the culture. I've been learning about different traditions, the culture, the language, and using the Korean name my grandfather gave me. My immediate family was never close to my Korean side of the family, but we were close to my grandfather. 

My Korean name, for as long as I can remember, has been 지해, romanized as Jihae. I looked it up and it means sea, which I feel like suits me. I've always been drawn to the water.

Recently my sister was talking to my father and found out our names end with 혜, not 해. It's romanized ""hye"" instead of ""hae,"" though it's pronounced the same (hay). Traditionally, siblings share a syllable, which is why my sister insists on me using ""지혜"". However, it's a tradition that's slowly dying out in younger generations.

I don't like 지혜. It doesnt feel like me, and I've been continuing to use 지해. However, the more my sister eggs me on about it, the more I worry I'm disrespecting my grandfather. I can't ask him about it since he passed years ago. 

AITA for spelling my name how I always have?

Edit: The new spelling changes the meaning of the name. The new name means ""wisdom.""

Update: Thanks to all your input! I've decided to change the spelling to the ""correct"" 지혜 but keep my romanization as Jihae. Thank you, everyone!",24,164,0.94

66,Everyone Sucks,"I (54f) have two children, a boy and a girl. When they were born, my husband and I were quite poor, but it had always been one of our dreams to let our children graduate from university without any debt. When our youngest was about 7 my husband I started making significantly more than we did before.

Our son has always been a prickly child. He'd get in fights at school and believed that if someone doesn't agree with what he said it was a personal attack against him. When he turned 18, we almost had enough saved for his tuition. We spoke to him and told him that we couldn't afford it at the time, but if he was willing to wait one year before going we could pay for everything - tuition, accommodation etc.

He said he wanted to go with his friends, took out a student loan and went that year. I tried to talk him out of it, saying that it wasn't worth plunging himself into thousands of pounds of debt when he had a better option. We got in a fight, he said I didn't trust him enough to make adult decisions and left.

Our relationship has cooled since then. He hasn't come home for holidays or called. I've tried reaching out to him, but he wouldn't answer. Now my youngest is 18 and it's her first year in university. My husband and I are paying for everything.

Our son has recently reached out to us. He has just finished his masters. He's in a lot of debt and asked me to pay it off since it's only fair because I'm paying for my daughter's education. I'm a bit bitter, since this is the first time he's contacted me in years and he's asking for money.

My husband is telling me to brush it off since we can afford it and that we shouldn't hold a stupid decision he made at 18 against him.

EDIT: I am British. Yes, I did have medical debt because I had to go private. My son did not study in the UK. He went abroad and got a loan abroad. I used pounds because I'm more familiar with it. When he applied, he applied for the total cost of his education - which at the time was for his undergraduate. Now it includes his masters as well.

Just two weeks ago, I was finishing decorating a two tier cake i had made when my cousin suddenly showed up at my house. She was instantly amazed at the cake i just made and starting making comments  like “hurry up and finish so i can post it on my Instagram.” Well, when I finished she proceeded to take a picture and post it. After that my family and I all ate the cake together and called it a day. Well apparently after she posted the picture, one of her friends responded to it asking if i would be able to make a cake for her sons birthday, which is today. The thing is my cousin not only didn’t ask me before saying yes, but she also didn’t let me know of this whole situation until 9a.m this morning! The boy’s “party” started at 3 today and I absolutely refused to make the cake after my cousin called me frantic on the phone claiming she forgot to tell me. Well because of this the boy didn’t have a cake for his birthday today and my cousin went around telling the whole family I refused to make a cake for a little boy, making me look like the bad guy.

EDIT: Thank you guys for all your support and feedback! I took you guys advice and I personally contacted the mother of the boy and let her know of the situation. She said she thought my cousin was the one who made the cake and gave my cousin $250 along with all the details on what type of cake, the color, etc.. I guess my cousins plan was for me to make the cake while she kept the money. I still felt bad so I offered to make a mini cake for the boy and personally deliver it tomorrow. As for my family, I made a public post on facebook since thats what majority of my family use and basically said what i wrote above. Thankfully everyone was understanding and apologized for attacking me but my cousin called me from her brother’s phone furious claiming I “exposed her” and she now “disowned me” lol.

After a lot of discussions with everyone involved, A and I decided to legally adopt the baby. The birth mother didn’t want to be involved, and wanted a a closed adoption.

My (30F) half-sister (28F, let's call her Ava) was born from an affair. We found out about her when I was 10 because her mom died and there was no one to care for her, so the government came looking for my dad. He wanted to put her up for adoption, but my aunt and uncle volunteered to take her in. He was supposed to pay them child support, but he never did. He only paid child support to my mom after she divorced him.

My mother died when I was 19, and my father when I was 21. He didn't have much in terms of assets after he died, but he did have a life insurance policy in my name that only I was supposed to know about. He got it after I turned 18 because he wanted to make sure to leave something behind for me. I used the money to pay for my dream wedding and buy our first house, and then I used the rest to make a few investments, one of which paid off better than I could ever have hoped. I now own three rental properties and run a doggie daycare. I'm very lucky.

Ava, however, not so much. My aunt and uncle did their best to make us friends, but we never got along because she was always jealous of me and would call me spoiled. The last time I talked to her was at my wedding. Apparently my grandpa knew about the life insurance policy and spilled the beans to Ava, because she stormed out of my reception. We haven't spoken since - until last week.

Ava sent me a DM saying that my nephew (7M) got burned really badly in a house fire at his friend's house. He needs several surgeries, and Ava can't afford it because her insurance will only cover what they don't consider ""cosmetic"". She asked me if I could loan her the money, and I flat out told her no. I don't even know this kid, and Ava hates my guts!

She said she is way better than dad regardless our opions and then grounded us for the rest of the weekend for arguing with her and hurting our sisters feeling who was near us. I feel that me and my brother might have been harsh on my sister and bio mom and we may have said mean things to her. I need your help to see if I am the ass or not.",42,475,0.94
90,Asshole," Hello,

So her birthday is on April 15th. Obviously malls and shops are closed and getting anything interesting was much more difficult.

Obviously, I could have done something myself, but my manual skills are poor, I can't draw... and getting materials is well, much more difficult cause of the lockup.

I could have also ordered something nice online, but I really don't like doing it. I barely buy things online, mostly when Im forced to. It just feels off for me to buy something without seeing it with my own eyes, checking it out first. I have a history of buying things online and regreting soon after, because they weren't a good fit after all or looked better on pictures. Besides, I am just so used to buying things in traditional shops I didn't really consider buying anything online that much.

So there I was, giftless, on April 13th, and I knew I won't have anything good enough for her on time. We were spending that day together and in the late evening I've asked if she'll be cool with me giving her a birthday gift later than on her actual birthday.

She was a little grumpy at first but she agreed.

On my way to her place the day of her bday, along with buying stuff she wanted me to get because she forgot, I've bought her her favorite flowers, her favorite sweets and pack of chocolates, because after all I really didn't want to come empty handed, and have at least something for her to give that day.

The next day she chatted me up. She was mad after all.

She found it incredibly unthoughful of me not to get her anything. She made comparissons to how on my birthday she put all this effort, got me a cake, came earlier to decorate the venue I made reservation in and gave me quite a big gift (bought together with some friends). She feels neglected and uncared for, and is incredibly sad that I wouldn't make an effort to get her something online earlier or even make something by myself. The argument went for literal hours, I apologised, promissed to put in more effort next time and made it really clear that Im just sorry I didn't meet her expectations. But she just couldn't stop giving me crap.

She didn't care that shops are locked and buying things online really isn't my thing, that I asked her if she's ok with getting something later and she said she was, that after all I did get her her favorite flowers, sweets and chocolates. And I that really ment it when I said I want to get her something later.

Nothing could make her feel less devastated and uncared for, none of the above, not repeated apologies. She made comments about how other men are capable of planning in advance, she is capable of planning in advance and she simply thinks that I don't care about her enough to make plans properly.

I find this hurtful and not true at all tho. In my opinion I have a right to give her something later than the actual date, especially since I've asked 2 days before and she said it she'd live with it, ESPECIALLY given the lockup situation.

91,Not the A-hole,"The year was 2008. I was a 10 year old who loved Pokemon, Neopets, and drawing. So what better idea than to mix all three together?

I began drawing my own original monsters and making up backstories. It was just a fun kid thing. I imagined how cool it would be to have my own website with my monsters.

My parents took notice and were very encouraging. Too encouraging. My father especially. I had no possible way to communicate how I felt as a 10 year old, so understandably, the following ensued.

My father saw potential in what I was doing, and I think he started to see me as his cash cow. He started to manage my ideas. He put me on a schedule, making me draw a new monster every week and telling me where to expand.

He started critiquing and insulting my older designs, forcing me to trash some and start over. Ultimately, he wanted to turn this into a business. He wanted to make money off of it.

I started getting really stressed out and stopped enjoying it. My dad would yell at me and make my cry. After all, my only intention was to have fun. I didn't understand why this was happening and all the phone calls and paperwork he was working on.

Before I knew it, he'd put together a whole file of my work to send off to some marketing agency. He kept telling me the same thing, ""I'm trying to help you"" and ""you'll thank me later"".

To give an idea of how fleshed out everything was, I had full-color drawings of around 50 monsters, a world with several lands and their lore, plants and items one could find, color/fusion variations of each monster, over 100 moves with their types and effects, nearly 50 pages of lore and mechanics, and even wrote and recorded my own songs for the series.

And all of this between the ages of 10 and 11. 

Luckily for me, the marketing agency turned down the idea claiming I was way too young and to contact them again as an adult. So, we took everything and stored it in the garage.

It weighed on my mind for months. Years. I'd lay awake at night thinking about it. Anticipating the day it would resurface and I'd be subjected to working on it nonstop again.

Finally, in 2013 I just couldn't take it anymore. When no one was around, I snuck into the garage and found the folder stuffed with the hundreds of papers I'd worked on. I shredded every single paper and threw it in a huge trash bag. Finally, it was gone. I cried for a long time afterwards.

Several years have passed and I have not told my father. He brings it up every now and then. Talks about how he can't wait to restart everything.

Unknown to me, he saved a copy of the report he had sent to the marketing agency all those years ago. I don't have the heart to tell him what I did. If I told him, I'm sure he would probably have a breakdown.

I told my mom a couple of years ago, and she sobbed. She really was disappointed in me, but also understood it was too much stress to put on a child.

92,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago I was hired as a housekeeper while I am in college (self-supporting). But the job turned out not to match the add or what was explained in my trial day. It's like 20% housekeeping and like 80% listening to my employer talk at me, boast about herself, and complain how busy she is. She is a wealthy exec in her late 40s probably, and I'm only 19.

I can't spend my life listening to her talk that many hours a day, I don't relate to her, and the whole thing was draining my life force and making me feel extremely depressed and almost despondent. I like working hard, not just sitting there listening to a torrent of blather and pretending to be attentive. If I wanted to do that I would do much higher paid jobs, like bartender (which I'm too young for but will do in a couple years) or stripper. It feels like literally watching sands drip through an hourglass watching my life slip away.

I thought about what to do and even posted about it here. My friend offered me a job with her cleaning company so I accepted and quit today.

My employer was shocked and insisted on knowing why so I told her the plain truth. No more or no less than the plain truth. I said listening to conversation wasn't part of the job description and if I had known it was such a huge part, I would have never taken the job. She was extremely angry and started screaming at me and unleashed all kinds of insults. Which I thought was honestly pretty sad, I didn't insult her back, just left.

What I want to know is am I the asshole for telling her the truth and not lying. I know some people will want to talk to me on whether or not I am the asshole for quitting my job at all but that's NOT my question. I just want to know am I the Asshole for being truthful.",52,47,0.86
93,Not the A-hole,"My cousin “Shirley” (22F) got married last August. Half a year later and my family still won’t stop giving me grief for this, so here goes.

I (28M) was pretty surprised when word got around that Shirley and Brian (mid 20s M) were having a big wedding, about 200 people. Shirley’s family isn’t well-off (my mom has helped my aunt and uncle out with car expenses and stuff like that over the years). I don’t know what Brian and his parents do.

When the invitation arrived, I saw a line on the bottom asking that we bring a dish to pass. I was a little irritated because money was tight and I have a very small kitchen that’s not suited for cooking for more than 4 or 6 people. I had also already sent them a gift off the registry that they linked to on the wedding website that had already been up for awhile.

I have a “famous” in my family moussaka that I make for special occasions. It’s delicious, but it takes me awhile to prepare, and the cost of the ingredients really add up. When I called to RSVP, Shirley said she was hoping I would make about three or four 9x13 pans of it. (I don’t even have one 9x13 pan at home.)

I was pretty honest with Shirley and told her my situation, but offered to pick up a party tray at BJ’s. She sounded really hurt and said she wanted the reception to be a chance to share family recipes (combining the two families and all that), and this would count as my wedding gift. The wedding was a couple hours away where Brian’s family lives, so transporting it would be difficult, but Shirley said “nobody will care if it gets a little cold”.

Shirley said if I can’t bring the moussaka, then I should make another savory dish, “something cheesy”. And be sure to bring three pans of it.

I talked to my sister and I guess Shirley gave her the same speech. My sister said she was going to bring a veggie tray anyways. My mom and my brother, meanwhile, spent the night before slaving over multiple lasagnas. 

I ended up injuring my foot a couple weeks before the wedding. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to keep things simple. Everyone in the family loves Kraft mac and cheese. So I got three foil pans and I made several boxes. I doctored it up with some parmesan and herbs I had at home and some bread crumbs on top.

When I got to the wedding and finished bringing all the mac and cheese from my car to the tables, I saw my uncle, who was setting up too, and he gave me a dirty look. 

He didn’t say anything but later it got out that Shirley and Brian were *livid* about the mac and cheese.

My family is kind of divided on it. My sister thinks that’s what Shirley and Brian get for asking people to bring food, but my mom thinks that I was being petty and I should’ve just sucked it up.

94,Asshole,"I'm 38M and  my sister is 35F

When my sister was 21 she got pregnant from a one night stand, baby didnt make it unfortunately which devastated my sister but with therapy she moved on.

She met her partner a year later, four years ago she had their first child. 

We're currently living with my mother to stay close together.

We got onto the topic of children and while I don't want children (neither does my partner) apparently my sisters partner wants another one so that way their child has a sibling.

She changed subject quickly  and we moved on to another subject.

We got speaking about it later and I asked her if she wanted another child, basically she said she didnt believe her son needed a sibling.

I said,, ""*well, he technically already has a sibling doesn't he?*"" 

Apparently her partner overheard and they got into a huge argument because she hadnt told him.

She's upset with me for talking about it at all and for basically telling her husband 

And her partner is upset with her, it's all a huge thing.

My mother thinks I should've never mentioned it and believes I'm out of order here.

I think her partner should've known anyway

97,Not the A-hole,"Hey y'all, this happened within the hour of posting this and my sister has been giving me hell for it.

My backyard has a partial fence. 3/4ths of it are fenced off and it isn't an issue. There are a lot of kids in my community, which is where the partial fencing becomes an issue.

My dog likes to spend time outside, why wouldn't he because he's a golden retriever. He has a 15 foot lead from the bottom post of the stair railing in my backyard so he has a lot of space to roam when we can't take him out for a walk. (I don't have a big backyard in general but he loves it because he has plenty of toys and our cats play with him.) 

The kids in the community like to hang out in the park area in my backyard, and for some odd reason, my dog is the target for a lot of harassment and taunting from these local crotch goblins.

My dog has very high anxiety so he does not like yelling or people going barking at him. I suggested my mother buying CBD oil to help him as I've heard from numerous people it may help.

As soon as I heard kids barking and growling, I immediately stood up, went into my backyard and calmly told them that my dog has issues with that, he doesn't like it and it makes him agitated. They obliged, and went back to where they were hanging out. 15 minutes later, dog is still outside enjoying the sun with my cat, I hear the kids barking and growling at him. This time, I've had enough of it so I went outside and told them, something along the lines of ""Get a life away from mocking dogs, how would you like it if I mocked you and you couldn't do anything about it?"" It shut them up and they went back to where they were and they haven't been around since, even with my dog and cat inside.

Sister told me I shouldn't have told them to get a life because it's super harsh, maybe that's true but I don't want anyone mocking the dog.",37,154,0.93
98,Not the A-hole,"My son, Adam, age 8, came from an affair. My ex, Mike, never told me he was married. We were together for nearly a year when I got pregnant, and Mike admitted that he already had 2 kids, one being a young son who lived with Mike and his wife. We broke up immediately. The custody agreement says Mike has visitation every weekend (no overnights) but he only makes it in person once a month and video calls the rest of the time.

While Mike and I agreed not to tell Adam the circumstances of his conception/birth until he was older, Mike told him in February. He presented it as me being the issue, and I set Adam straight on that one. Adam is really struggling with it. I'm trying to help, but it's caused some issues since February.

Mike later tells me that his other son, Henry, age 12, wants to meet Adam over video chat. I told Mike that wasn't happening, explaining all the issues I've had with Adam in the last couple months, but Mike insisted that he knew ""his boys"" and he knew they'd get on. I said that we can revisit this when Adam is ready, and that was the end of the conversation about 2 weeks ago.

Today Mike asked if he could have a video call with Adam. Adam was in the living room, I was in the next room when the call was made, and I heard Adam say ""who are you?"". The person answers but I can't hear it. I go in, see Adam is upset, and end the call. I console Adam, who says Henry answered. While my boyfriend takes Adam off me and gets him to eat, I go back onto messages. There's one from Mike saying he's sorry, he shouldn't have done it, does Adam still want to talk to him and only him. Adam says yes so I start the call in another room because I wanted words with Mike first.

I am greeted by Henry. I ask Henry if I can speak to Mike. Henry says ""I want to talk to my brother"". I say that Adam's busy, I need to speak to Mike. Henry says ""I want to talk to my brother"". I say ""Adam doesn't want to talk to you. Put your father on now please."" I used what my friends call my ""mum voice"". Stern, clipped, but no anger/yelling. Henry leaves the room.

Mike's wife appears after that and asks how dare I treat her son that way, first hanging up on him and then ""screaming"" at him. I tell her I called to talk to Mike about how he's treating my son, how he sprung a surprise meeting, and say I want to talk to Mike right now. She hangs up.

A couple hours later I get a message from her. She's yelled at Mike over his actions, but now I've upset Henry. She wants me to apologise to Henry, then answer some questions he has about Adam, with her also on the call. I showed my boyfriend, asking what he thought, and he says that I shouldn't have to apologise but me talking to Henry would be the compromise here. I don't think it's a good idea, and think I should just leave the whole conversation alone.

WIBTA for not apologising/talking to Henry?

Info: Mike sent the messages, and set up the conversation, and then passed the laptop to Henry in time for the video calls. Henry did not send the messages, and it's unclear how involved he was (whether he genuinely thought we'd said yes on our end or whether he and Mike planned this together).

Mike, as the father of all 3 children (Henry, Adam, and an adult daughter he's not in contact with), said he did not want his children to meet. He made the choice to not introduce Adam to his siblings or tell him about the circumstances of his birth until he was older. I agreed because as the father of all 3 children, Mike has the power here. I could be 100% willing for Adam to meet Henry and the daughter, but if Mike said no then there's nothing I can do.

If I'd gone behind Mike's back, by telling Adam he had these siblings Mike was keeping from him or organising a meeting without telling Mike, Mike could take me to court for anything from stalking to parental alienation, and for various reasons if it came to a ""who would you believe?"" contest, Mike would win. Doing anything involving the half siblings who I have no legal right to could have seriously threatened my custody of Adam, and that's not a risk I was willing to take.",71,218,0.94

I asked around, and a friend told me his friend knew someone who was interested, which was great. He gave me this friends contact information, and I messaged him.

I am not rich, I don't have the money for this, but I consider myself a short term owner. I can pay for litter and food, obviously if I were keeping them I would take them to the vet, but right now I wouldn't be able to anyways because of the current state of my city. Other people were also offering to take the cats who could afford to do this, and I was leaning towards them because god forbid something happen to the kitten, I don't want it to not be able to be properly cared for because of the high cost of veterinary services.

101,Not the A-hole,"When I (29F, East Europe) was a teen I met this guy (A.)(30M, USA) on DeviantArt. He liked some of my fanart and we started talking, then we moved to FB. We talked fairly regularly about everything: relationships, fandoms, families etc. None of us ever expressed a romantic interest in one another. He said he liked history, especially military, and developed an interest in my country's history, he even considered getting a tattoo of my country's military resistance symbol. It seemed a bit appropriat-y but I was overall flattered. At times I felt he was a bit overwhelming, writing to me daily, so I wasn't responding every time, especially when I graduated, got an intense job, moved in with my bf, I didn't have a lot of time. He didn't have a lot going on for him after high school. He also somehow started talking to my best friend (M) and she would at times openly tell him to chill with messaging her all the time. In 2018, A told me that he would visit me for a month (July) in 2019. He saved like crazy. Claimed a big part is just him wanting to see my country. I had a bad feeling about this & I warned him that at the date he picked I would be very busy preparing for a huge industry event and working on my graduation project. He said ok. It was not ok. In the middle of his stay there was one of the biggest historical reeanctments in Europe going on. He did not go. A museum connected to the resistance movement he wanted a tattoo of? Nope. Regional food my mom made? Meh. He just wanted to spend time with me and M. everyday which I couldn't do. He was completely clueless, couldn't check his buses, trains (both have English websites and we kept on helping him) ended up not going ANYWHERE on his own. He started doing weird stuff like ""accidentally"" sending M a photo of a half drunken bottle of vodka at 11 am, he called my parents about random stuff... I was running out of days off. I was exhausted when he left. M cut ties with him, said he was like a manbaby. I talked to him about this mess, how he wouldn't respect my requests for him not to write me 3-4 times a day(!), that I want to be friends but he's not accepting that I need some space. That it's clear that he only saved up to see ME and lied about seeing anything in my country. He'd say ok, then 2 hours later he'd message me about some bullshit. I tried having this convo with him maybe 5 times and then I snapped after some of his ""lol my tonsils are swollen"". And I just told him that we can't be friends anymore. I unfriended him on fb, he'd still message me. I blocked him. He started commenting on the fanpages I admin at work. He tried to comission my another artist friend(J). He'd email and text me. It's painful - we were friends for a long time but I feel almost as if it started to grow into an obsession. He still texts me sometimes, even though I asked him not to many times.

My cousin, Christine, was always the one who was really 'into it'. I, on the other hand, wasn't really into it-- I genuinely don't care one way or another about my cousins enough to care about their accomplishments. I just want to do well, whether they do well is irrelevant to my life.

Anyhow, she kind of resents me now because I got into a better college than her, and she tries to one-up me. Usually I ignore her, but she really annoyed me this time.She had just gotten some academic award for keeping a high GPA (she's a junior, I'm a sophomore). So her parents called everyone else in the family to brag. She personally got on the phone and started bragging, which started to annoy me. She asked me what my GPA was, and I told her honestly that it was 3.5. She laughed, made a comment about how I 'wasn't so good at school after all', and told me to call her if I needed help. 

&#x200B;

This really annoyed me, so I just replied she would be the last person I'd call for academic advice. She asked what I meant, so I told her she was taking a joke course (psychology) at a joke party school that you can get into by just having a pulse. I, on the other hand, go to one of the top schools in the country, studying math and economics, both of which are harder than her major. 

&#x200B;

This caused her to start crying on the phone and hung up, which I kind of expected-- she's deeply insecure about her getting into a 'lesser' school than me and lashes out at me because of it (thought a psych major could figure that out lol). Her parents called back demanding I apologize, which I refused to do. The way I see it, she consistently picked fights with me and insulted me, and I ignored her until she went overboard.

106,Not the A-hole,"Some back story is probably necessary for this. My parents have been divorced for 11 years. My now stepmother worked for my dad before him and my mom got a divorce. Though it was never said, she 100% contributed to the divorce and was publicly dating my dad before he was officially single.

She is 15 years younger than he is. She has a serious drinking problem and gets aggressive and emotionally abusive when drunk. We've never gotten along well. She's immature and can barely take care of her own child (who is 7 at the moment). She's honestly a child, but that is what my dad was looking for when they got married. Someone he could go partying with.

We've had a lot of conflict, especially when I was younger. More recent ones include her screaming at the top of her lungs over the phone at her mom at 3 am after a fight with my dad. She was also very drunk. It was the Saturday before my big Chemistry exam so I was trying to get some sleep so I could study. She was sitting in the livingroom which is directly next to my room. I knocked on the door twice, trying not to engage with her but get her to quiet down at least. When she continues yelling for almost 30 minutes I step out of my room and yell (so she can hear me over her own yelling) to please keep quiet, I'm trying to sleep. She (34) proceeds to direct her yelling at me (16 at the time) and tell me how disrespectful I am and how my dad is so shitty. I tell her I don't care and I need to sleep.

I admit that I shouldn't have yelled. But I'm also not sure how I should be handling a drunk adult screaming in the middle of the night. I nearly failed that test (75% of my grade) because there was so much conflict in the house that weekend. I also have a younger brother but he's always fairly oblivious about situations like this and he gets protected in situations like this (by our dad) while I don't.

My dad and I have a pretty good relationship, especially when we aren't around her. We get along super well. My brother loves going to my dad's house (there's WiFi and a Play Station) but I would rather not put myself in a situation where I could be emotionally affected for the next few months (I struggle with depression and anxiety so situations like the one above affect me a lot).

My dad is making me feel bad about not going to his house anymore, even if he may not be doing it intentionally. My mom doesn't want to get involved, which I can understand because she doesn't want to sabotage any relationship between us and our dad. None of us have seen my dad in 3 weeks. My brother is going to my dad's but I'm kind of being guilted into going too because I haven't seen him in a while.

I really do love my dad but I'm not sure if I want to put myself in a bad situation. I feel horrible and super guilty.

I(19f) am a university student and part-time waitress. As a hobby I run a small makeup blog on instagram where I mainly post about ""glam looks""- basically very heavy, glamourous makeup looks with eyeliner, red lips, a lot of highlight and contour.

My account was pretty much a secret for a very long time because I didn't want to be judged for it by friends and coworkers. But now a very big makeup brand reposted one of my pictures to their instagram page and that's how my friends found out about it.

When I came into work about a month ago some of my coworkers told me that they had seen the picture of me and therefore found out about my page. Most of them were pretty respectful and nice about it.

My boss also witnessed this interaction so he also now knew about my page. Apparently he took a look at my instagram account on his own phone because later on he confronted me about it.

A little background before I get into the confrontation: I never wear any makeup to work. I put on a tinted lip balm and rarely wear mascara or concealer if I have dark circles under my eyes. That's it.

My boss then showed me some of the pictures of my makeup looks and then asked me if I could start wearing these kind of looks to work because it would really look good for him and the restaurant if the servers put a lot of effort into their appearance.

I told him that I never wear these kinds of looks in ""real life"" and only do them because it's my hobby. I also told him that I have really sensitive skin so I don't wear makeup on a daily basis to give my skin a break. 

My boss them repeated that me wearing makeup would make the restaurant look good and that I should at least think about it.

So now I have to return to work in two weeks and I honestly, I don't want to wear any makeup to work. But would that make me TA? I don't want to anger my boss by not making his restaurant look good.

So AITA for refusing to start wearing makeup to work?",1094,11113,0.92

112,Not the A-hole,"I love kids, and am a very patient person. I was volunteering for free at a theater in the city, that my girlfriend is a directors assistant. It's a great place where a makeup artist (me), a director, and a set designer are all there and you have to submit a script and production begins if it's approved. I buy the makeup with my own money and can be there for 5+ hours some days.

The most recent play was written by highschoolers about a infection caused by corrupt government trying to win a war. It's actually a very good play, and I was happy to help the kids out. 

I put on a bit of blush, eyeliner, and lipstick for the girls, and blush, and mascara for the boys. I put it on everyone without incident and then went up into the audience to watch rehearsal. One of the main characters was a girl and  I realized I missed her because she looked very pale and lifeless under the bright stage lights, think flashback marry.  I kicked myself before counting the kids on stage and making a checklist. 

After the rehearsal I got her attention during lunch and explained that I was very sorry but after she ate I was going to need to do her makeup. She said ""no... I don't look good in makeup. I don't wear makeup, it's dumb, I don't get why people are obsessed with it."" I was surprised but I then kindly explained that it's because the lights are so bright that you look a little silly. She got super offended and I realized she didn't realize that I ment the royal you. 

She said ""makeup is dumb, I'm not the type of girl who wears makeup. I've never worn makeup and I'm never going to. You look like a clown, and I don't want to look like that. Your not the boss of me, stop perpetuating gender rolls and go away"". 

I said ""look, you're doing theater, and I'm not your mom, or the boss of you. Because you are a big kid. I know more about makeup than you so please listen to me. I don't want to get the director involved.""


She then ran away crying. My girlfriend said that they girl has been doing plays for a very long time and has always been like this. I felt so bad I wanted to melt into the floor. Am I the antagonist?

Edit: This girl has given us lots of problems before, saying that she doesn't like the costume, or dosnet want to wear a dress to play a female character that... Wears a dress. We asked her if she was uncomfortable wearing a dress due to gender reasons and she said that she doesn't like dresses, we let her wear a shirt that she said she wouldn't wear because it was pink.

Edit 2: I apologized profusely for upsetting her (like a lot) but she wouldn't let it go, I would say ""mabey just a little blush?"" And she would get very mad and I tried to ask her what she was ok with and she would just say ""leave me alone""

113,Not the A-hole,"I deliver pizza as a side hussle. When heading out for a delivery my manager told me to hurry because this was a remade order we messed up previously. Now I speed on surface streets, usually 65 in a 45. However when it comes to a residential area I go the speed limit (25). Especially right now with all these kids running around out of school. 

I entered this neighborhood and took a right hand turn and there was this family stopped on the side on bikes. As I drive past I move over and slow down for them. The leading lady of the party yells at me to slow down. And not politely. 

I get irritated and on my next turn I drop gears and floor it back to the speed limit and don't think anything of it. I get to my location and deliver said pizza, as I head back out to my car the group of people on bikes (probably about 10 total) start yelling at me. 

""This is our neighborhood and in it you will slow down.."" The lady said.

I interrupted her. ""The speed limit in a residential area is 25. I didn't break the speed limit."" 

""Well there's no need to drive like a douchebag"" a man said. 

""You yelled at me and I didn't do anything to you guys"" I replied

""you were speeding, and needed to slow down there's kids out"" the lady said

""I was not speeding I saw you all slowed down and moved over for you"" I replied

""And then what did you do"" said the guy. 

"" I made my turn and dropped gears and didn't break the speed limit."" I said again. 

They continued to yell at me and call me a douchebag and threatened to call my work. So I gave then the address I worked at and told them to call. I got in my car and drove away quickly while they where still yelling at me.

116,Not the A-hole,"
I am a high schooler. I went to a public school up until about a month ago when school closed, and this is actually about an argument that happened when I was in school.

My parents are really nosy and invasive. They'd read my texts, my notes to friends when I was a kid, would just never give me any privacy. And it sucked, they always had opinions on my friends,my teachers, etc. They'd always interfere in stuff that I didn't want them to, like if I had a disagreement with another kid at school when I was younger they'd force a meeting about it even if I thought I'd resolved it myself. They were always micromanaging my school too, like the school has a set schedule for classes but they thought they knew better than the teachers and tried to get me into different classes. 

Anyway, I've found the best way to stop it is to never say anything meaningful about my life or my friends. So I've made a set of ""rules"" for talking about my life when we have daily family dinners and they make me talk about my day.

1. Never mention the same person twice if I can help it. (I sometimes have to bring up the same teacher more than once because I see them everyday though)

2. Never talk about conflict

3. Talk about boring stuff in a lot of detail

So when they ask me to talk about my day it goes like this everyday...

""In first period I had study hall and I noticed my skin was very dry, and I thought about what kinds of lotion I might try. I asked this girl Anna what lotion she uses and she said it was Aveeno. (Ramble on about skincare for a while). In second period I had math and it was good, I like calculus a lot and math is my favorite subject. (Ramble about the day's math lesson). In third period I had history and we had a substitute teacher. She was very nice, and had a very pretty shirt on. I asked her where she got it and she said the Gap which surprised me because I usually don't like the Gap. My favorite stores at the mall are (ramble about a list of stores I like). In fourth period my teacher couldn't give us our packets because the printer was broken. The printer at school breaks a lot, I wonder why printers break so much. 

... And on and on through 8th period.

It's worked OK for a while until about a month ago when my parents, my dad especially, yelled at me about how I never tell them anything, they don't know who my friends even are, I don't tell them shit.

I said that I tell them about my day everyday and I tell them a lot, about every class I have and all sorts of things on my mind. 

My dad was really pissed off about it saying that every time he asks about someone I've told him about I don't have anything more to say about them. Don't I talk to anyone more than once?

I said that I just like talking to a lot of people and having a lot of friends. That's not wrong.

AITA for not saying more meaningful stuff?",339,6309,0.97

118,Not the A-hole,"I (15f) have 3 brothers, ages 12, 8 and 5.  I'm going to be calling them a,b and c for this story 12(a), 8(b) and 5(c)

We live in a four-bedroom house so I have a room to my self. my a also has a room, and b and c hare a room. My parents have the largest room, b &c have the second largest, a has the third largest and I have the smallest.

I have the smallest because my grandma spends the summers and sometimes a couple of months of the school year with us and I didn't want to give up my room and stay in b & c 's room so I gave the bigger room to a.

Anyway now the problem. C takes a while to go to sleep like 30-45 minutes and he always plays and talks loudly this annoys b A LOT and sometimes he breaks down crying. My parents try to stop c by taking away his device the next day, not letting him watch TV, etc:- but he never stops so my parents just stopped trying and told my brother that he'd grow out of it.

But lately, B has been constantly complaining and my dad put his foot down and decided that he would take A's room as an office for himself and make A move into B&C's room and c move into my room. I got really annoyed and refused because :

1. My dad has an office in the basement but he had said that he'd give it to my mom even though my mom didn't want an office
2. I have the smallest room and I choose it because I didn't want  to share with anyone
3. If my brother was to move in then my desk and dresser out of the room and put them in the basement storage because my room is too small ( It's already pretty cramped and I don't even have a bed frame or anything I'm sleeping on a twin mattress)
4. I'm a girl and the oldest and I deserve my personal space

After a lot of arguing it became apparent that my dad wasn't going to budge and my mom decided that she wanted to stay out of it so I said fine but I want the larger room and when I said that my brothers (a and b) went crazy refusing saying they didn't want the smallest room etc:- .

In the end, my mom came in and put her foot down but my brothers are giving me shit about it and my dad is giving me the silent treatment because he wanted that room as his office because it blocks out sound for when he takes calls, etc:-

So AITIA for refusing in the first place?

TDLR; my dad wanted me to share a room with my brother and I refused, then relented but I wanted the larger room and now no one is moving but everyone is still annoyed with me

EDIT: 

A lot of people have been asking why I don""t move to the basement, I had offered but was shot down because my parents have an everyone sleeps on the same floor rule plus the basement is just a large space there are no rooms.

I also want to clear up me having the smallest room my parents had given me and my brother \[a\] the choice to have the bigger room but we'd have to give it up for my grandma and other guests. My brother right away wanted the bigger room no matter what and I didn't really care and personally I'd rather not get kicked out of my room for a couple of months.",328,736,0.94
119,Not the A-hole,"Ok so for context I'm a 16 year old girl. I have a couple health issues that I got to appointments for regularly. My mom likes to be there for them so she sets up my appointments so they line up with her schedule. I've been babysitting every day except fridays Saturdays and Sundays. She knows my schedule. Lately my doctors have been doing video chats for appointments cause the whole virus thing. She started setting appointments up while I'm working and I've asked her to stop multiple times now. I'm there to babysit and care for kids and the appointments last at least 45 minutes. Today I got upset with her because she set it up again without telling me so I couldn't reschedule. I had to take the call while the kids where crying cause I couldn't play with them anymore. I got them to calm down while trying to talk to my doctor and geting angry texts from my mom because I told her I was upset. I know she wants the best for me but I dont know what I did wrong. Yes I got upset but I just told her that I was upset because i asked her not to do that again and she did anyways. Can someone tell me what I did wrong because I have no clue.

Edit: for more info I get off work at 1 or 2 every day. My doctors are open until 5. I usually set up my appointments but she likes to be apart of those kinda things so she sets up the ones I have to do online at this time. I set up things like physical therapy.

120,Not the A-hole,"I have a halfsister who is almost 15 year my senior. We grew up in different households. In fact, I did not know she existed until I was a teenager.

She was raised by her mother and her 2nd husband. My father has not really been that much in contact with her since age 4.

We have met a few times, but didn't really grow a bond. 

A few years ago my dad got cancer. He fought, but finally lost the battle.

I tried to be as fair as I could  - informing her so she could still visit him in hospital, along with her two  children and say goodbye.

Anyway, after his death the mess started.

My country does not allow disowning children, so she was still entitled to inheritance. 
First she said she would renounce the inheritance, but then told us she changed her mind. I can understand not saying no to free money, but she then basically went on to be difficult about everything. 

Since both my mother and me still live in the house, we wanted to buy her out. To us this was really logical as we did not want her to be co-owner of a property we both still lived in, but for some reason she opposed. She (as per my father's will) was not allowed to evict my mother, but we wanted to avoid her forcing me to sell in case something happened to my mom. Anyway, finally we settled on this, but so much drama.

As per my faher's wishes there was no ceremony or decorum. My halfsister whined about...all of that. First,she wanted funeral cards.. I told her she can make her own. Two days later she contacts me, saying she doesn't know how to use photoshop and if I can help. My friend, who is a graphic designer, graciously does it for FREE. My sister had the gall to complain saying she ""wanted us to do it together"" when I clearly expressed we did not want that and I did her a favor.

Second, she compained about the no ceremony I said if she wants she can get the family together, rent a place, and I'll make time to 

Guess what? She didn't organize anything, never heard about it again. 

At some point she also implied I'm 'autistic"". 

I haven't really heard from her in two years except she came crying to me on the anniversary of my father's death on messenger.

Anyway, Reddit, I'm done. Any feeling I had for this woman, good or bad are just...gone. I don't feel anything, I don't feel she contributes to my life and she's essentially a stranger.

Problem is, I do not have children (or any other siblings) and when my mom will be gone my halfsister (or if she's gone, her children) will be my only legal heirs.

And frankly, I do not want them to be.

I actually have a few better people in mind. My partner and I really like his younger brother and his wife, and I wouldn't mind it going to those nieces/nephews if they end up having kids (which they want). There's also this college kid my partner and I are sort of big brother/big sister to - we consider him family, and Iwould not mind him being my heir either.

She says she’s ok for now but one of my other sisters started a group to try to raise money for her. I said I’ll give her money if she asks for it. 

  The shit hit the fan. How dare I force her to ask, I know how proud she is! I do know, I’ve offered her desperately needed money before and she’s refused. So have other family members, pride runs strong in the family. I don’t feel like doing it again. She (any of them) can ask me for money or just not get money from me.

Hi everyone, I have a problem with my current roommate, who is subletting a room from me, and I would like some insight on whether or not I’d be the asshole. 


I am legally subletting a room in the apartment to another person. My old washing machine (which I paid for alone before she moved in) just happened to stop functioning recently, and I'm planning to buy a new one with a warranty to prevent this from happening again. 

The subletter however just let me know that she thinks that she shouldn't have to pay equally as much for the washing machine since she normally doesn't use it often anyway (she goes back to her hometown every weekend) and she only started using it more often now because she's been staying in the apartment for a longer time. 


Would it be unfair for me to ask her to pay for her share of the washing machine (which is under a 100€ anyway)? Someday she might want to use it more often, in case she stops visiting her hometown so often. If she really doesn’t want to pay, WIBTA for forbidding her to use it?

Edit: I do not own the apartment, I’m renting the apartment from the landlord and legally subletting the room to her. The old washing machine was bought by me, not the landlord.",39,39,0.85

Another friend responded: “Oh no, is everything okay?”  After a two-hour long pause, John said, “I will be okay...now. I have been diagnosed with ADHD.”

As a person with ADHD, this struck me as obviously being much less serious than a terminal diagnosis, and not worth the drama. I said, “Man, I thought you were dying or something, that was really dramatic!” He didn’t respond to me and the conversation moved on. A mutual friend of me and John messaged me and told me that John was very offended by what I said. John thinks that I was minimizing his very serious diagnosis, a diagnosis he sees as a revelation and the reason he’s always struggled to succeed in work/school.  Since this was told to me in a covert way, I didn’t see a space to apologize or explain myself.

She's had some credit card debt. Nothing major, but because her businesses' incomes have dried up, she hasn't had any way to pay her debts off. She's begun making hand sanitizers and face masks to generate some extra income, but she's always on the lookout for more cash to support the family.

A few months ago, she asked me if she could sell my old bike. I agreed, since I don't use it much anymore and it's just rusting in a corner of our storage. It took a while, but today, she was finally able to sell it, as well as my dad's bike.

I helped her to cart it out front and wiped it down before the buyer pulled up and paid for it. After the guy drove off and we went inside, I asked her for my share. She was bemused at first, and asked me who was the one who sold it in the first place. I said it was her, but it is still my bike and my property. She said she'd give me half.

126,Not the A-hole,"I (21 f) have been openly gay since highschool, and my friend S (19 f) is bisexual. In highschool S told me she had a crush on me and I very bluntly told her that I didn’t feel the same way. After that I got into long term relationship with my now ex girlfriend and S moved to Florida.

This summer me and my ex broke up and coincidentally S moved back into town about a month later. I was fairly devastated by the break up and I would drag my friends all over trying to distract myself. S was one of these friends.

What I didn’t know was that S had been going on her finsta which I don’t follow, and calling out hangouts dates, posting my photo calling me the love of her life, and generally acting like we were in a relationship. Well eventually this weird finsta thing got back to me when I was talking to a mutual friend about a girl I’m fairly into. Mutual friend was really confused about why I was talking to other girls if I was already in a relationship? I obviously had no clue what she was talking about! And mutual friend sent me a bunch of screen shots of S posts about me.
I went to go look myself and I couldn’t find the account so I assumed I was blocked. 

I called S and demanded to know what was going on. She broke down and said it originally started as a way to get back at her ex but she’d developed feelings for me again, and things had gotten out of hand. 
I told her that I didn’t like her like that again, and S then implied I had been leading her on and I had to have known about her feelings and I was taking advantage of her. 

That was the last straw for me I told S she needs to get over herself and take down all the posts of me and tell our friends we were never together. And then I followed it up by saying she needs to get help and get over her infatuation with me or I’m not going to associate with her any longer. 
S broke down and called me an asshole and told me feelings don’t work like that and I’m being insensitive giving her ultimatums.

So AITA? Some of our friends have blocked me so I assume they agree with her, my sister says I should have waited till I wasn’t so angry and the way I went about it makes me the Asshole. I think my anger was justified.

Edit: Update! I managed to get in contact with everyone I knew in the group. Unfortunately a lot of the people in the group chat seem to be her friends. But the mutual friends I managed to get a hold of were pretty understanding when I explained the situation. As for S I told her that what she did made me really uncomfortable and that we shouldn’t be friends anymore. She didn’t respond to me but I blocked her number and got her off most of my social media. I realized everyone is right after I thought about it. If she had been a guy I probably would have been really creeped out over something like this.

Edit: info my ex was trans for a period of time while we dated. When we broke up she was still using he/him pronouns and I respected that in a previous post I made about the breakup. After the breakup she told me that she didn’t feel like she was actually trans and wanted to go back to using she her pronouns. That’s the tea on that.",171,2773,0.96

128,Not the A-hole,"Backstory, it’s complicated and stupid high school drama, so I’ll try to be as comprehensive as I can. First things first, let me introduce you to Stacy.

Stacy is a female in our friend group who has occasionally played with my emotions which has become a point of contention among the group. One night she’ll cuddle with me, the next she will completely ignore me and sit across the room. Eventually she tells me she does like me, yet isn’t ready for a relationship. I’ve heard it hundreds of times before, so I get over it, move on, and don’t let it affect the friend group. A week later she’s posting asking for dudes to apply to be her boyfriend and treat her right. I ignore it and carry on.

Fast forward to a night of boredom. There’s a trend going around on snapchat where people will send you a picture and you and a group chat comprised of your friends will rate that picture. My friends decided to put a spin on it and instead of rating the picture, roasting it. The group chat comprised of me, my friend Alex, and my friend Deshaun. We made sure everyone who slid up with a picture knew that we would be making fun of them, and everything would be a joke and nothing genuinely rude. This isn’t going where you think it’s going.

The jokes were harmless, and people were loving it. Towards the end we started roasting each other, and my friend made sure to include my history of simping”. I ended up screen recording my roast, as it took up a solid 3 pages of text. One of the things Alex mentioned, as he’s in the friend group including Stacy, is that I “look like I get told ‘I’m not ready for a relationship’ then she gets in a relationship with someone else.” Very broad statement, and it took up about one second of the 15 second video. The majority of the video was Deshaun spouting gems such as “bumblebee head ass, nugget head ass, ole pine cone built ass”, etc.

Stacy sees the video and slides up asking me to delete it. I say no, for reasons I’ll go into later. She calls me disrespectful for posting it and unadded me. Whatever, it is what it is. But half of the friend group is on her side and are saying that me and Alex acted childish. Now, I would’ve happily deleted the video if 1. Her name was clearly mentioned. 2. It was false information. 3. It took up a majority of the video. But! It was a very broad statement that could apply to anyone, the only people who knew who it referred to were me, Alex, and Stacy. The information stated in the video was factual. I mean I would’ve still taken it down if it had included her name, but it wasn’t like the comment was libelous. And finally, the comment was made in passing. It took up 1/15th of the video, I could understand if she was upset because I had posted a 15 second video just complaining about her actions, but as previously stated the video was mainly about Deshaun’s rant. I’ll try to answer any questions as best I can. So, Reddit. AITA?",25,76,0.9

For Clarity we are both white and from the United States

I (26F) have a friend (32M) who I've known for a pretty long time, about 10 years we met through the anime convention scene and we've kept in pretty good contact over the years with a couple spats here and there but overall we're pretty good friends

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, Animal Crossing: New Horizens came out and obviously we both bought it because we were both pretty excited about it.

A couple days after release he invited me to his island, and I was pretty excited to see what he had done because he's usually a pretty creative guy, so I was stoked.

When I went to go I noticed his island name was ""Best Korea"", Weird name choice but whatever, he really likes K-Pop so I figured that was the reason?

When I actually arrived I was horrified, his island flag is the North Korean flag (it was on his shirt as well and he was wearing the Rice Hat), his island tune was the North Korean anthem. He had made his island completely barren and had put barbed wire fences around the entire outside. 

I left immediately and messaged him and told him that his island was super racist and that he should change it. He blew up at me and said it was ""Just a joke"" and ""I thought you would laugh"" and ""It's not THAT bad""

We havent talked in over 2 weeks because of it and we're both still mad about it.

So I just wanted to know did I overreact? AITA?",351,615,0.87

133,Asshole,"I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year.

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.

I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. 

My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.

We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.

We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.

I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.

She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.

She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.

We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.

134,Everyone Sucks,"This is a bit confusing for me but I made a throwaway cause I need a bit of guidance and SO is an avid redditor (even on AITA), TL,DR at bottom. Also on mobile.

I have 2 kids, SO has 1. I work ALOT, like a whole lot. About a year after my divorce I met someone (SO) and we instantly clicked we ended up living together and I support them primarily (their child is too young for school sp they cant work, SO shares custody with their ex) I'm fine with this as I don't see any other option. They get a pension from the government (they lie to the government about being single to get it... you could call it a single parent pension) and contribute nothing if it to the household, bar one off payments like rent when I was short or maybe some food or cloths for the kids once in a while I make an effort to reimburse whatever SO spends on my kids to them as I don't see it fit for them to spend money on my kids tbh.

Anyway so we did a budget a few months ago and it turns put that the pension they get spent even cover enough for them to buy food and entertain their child for 2 weeks so we agreed that I would supplement it by about 50% meaning they now have 1.5x as much coming in as they did. This is all fine except for 1 thing. The child support paid by SO's EX.. the EX dissent like the system and thinks it's better to use a different route I won't go.into details about that but suffice to say it doesn't support their child sufficiently.. (think it isnt feasable because there is no felxability on how and when it can be used.. kinda like paying child support in food stamp form)

Now back to the working alot part. I work in a mine in NSW Australia and I work alot 4 weeks on 1 week off, so I can fully appreciate working hard for your money and not wanting to get exploited but I am currently supporting my 2 kids my SO AND their child all while SO's EX doesn't really contribute to their child's financial situation in our house. I'm feeling very abused and not respected me and SO have had fights about this before and nothing changes or comes of it. They are afraid to rock the boat with the EX, no idea why but they won't do anything to change this and would rather just do what the EX wants to do re:child support.

I can't help but think fuck this, no.money for you or your child until you come to a compromise that works for US not just your EX cause WE are supposed to be working together. Then I instantly think how are they going to be able to afford anything... they already can't ... It's a shit situation that I think I have caused to a large extent. But now I'm nearly at breaking point and I don't know if I can keep going with this... should I cut off my SO? WIBTA if I do? You decide.

TL,DR: SO dosent contribute to the household even though they get money for losing to the government, I'm stuck supporting SO and their  hold cause they won't stand up to their ex about child support issues. Should I just cut them off financially?

I don't have the happiest home life, my dad and mom got into a lot of fights because he was cheating on her. I don't know why they're still together honestly.

He's also been angry at me a lot for academics, I've been studying from home and he thinks I'm being lazy and stupid

He and she fight a lot, and when that happens, I just kind of mentally shut down. Like let my eyes unfocus, stop paying attention to my hearing or other senses. Just relax into my own mind. It honestly feels like an out of body experience a little, I feel untethered from my own body, like I'm floating through empty space. It takes a while to come back too; like I feel kind of like I'm deep deep underwater and anything that someone says or does is blurred and delayed so much by the time it gets to me.

I know that sounds super weird but honestly it's the thing that's keeping me sane through this shit.

But I think it's been making my dad and mom really mad, when either of them is angry with me and I go to that place, they get furious, they yell at me for being a ""fucking vegetable"" and accuse me of being messed up in the head. Tried to shake me out of it once. Been telling their friends that I'm autistic. I don't think I am.

I know it makes them mad but it's honestly the nicest thing I can do for myself, I'm so sick of their shit. If I can't go somewhere physically, I guess the next best thing is to leave there mentally.

AITA for going to that other mental place when there's anger at home, even if it makes my dad and mom mad?",30,251,0.94
136,Asshole,"My ex and I dated for 4 years before I broke up with him. It was because of conflicting schedules and long distance. (He lives in London, I live in New York). The break up was 3 months ago. I’m seeing another guy now. We’ve been going out for a couple of weeks and just made it official. I currently live by myself in my apartment.

Two nights ago, I woke up to someone coming into my room. I turned on the lamp and realized it was my ex. He used the key I had given him prior to our breakup to come into my apartment. I was so mad at him and told him to leave. He explained that he had just arrived in the city and decided to come to my apartment so he could “checkup on me”. I said he could have at least given me a heads up instead of literally breaking into my apartment at 1 am. He apologized saying that he had tried to call me but I wasnt answering. He asked if he could stay the night. I finally relented because he was all cold and tired. 

I let him shower and get changed. I told him to sleep on the couch but he complained it was too uncomfortable and said he wanted to sleep in my bed. I said that’s not appropriate (nor healthy). But he snuck in and slept in my bed anyways. I was too tired to protest. So we technically slept in the same bed together. He cuddled me at one point but I pushed him off and told him if he tried anything I’d knee him in the balls.

When he awoke, he said he was hungry so I made breakfast for the both of us. After, he finally decided to leave. Before doing so he brought up the idea of “us” again and told me he still loved me. He said he knows I still love him too. He said he wants to isolate with me for the next few weeks, he can work from his laptop and that it will “be fun”.

I told him that I’m still trying to get over him and that he’s making it unnecessarily hard for the both of us. His voice broke and he said “But I really love you.” Anyways after a few more minutes of back and forth, he finally left (and returned the apt key to me). Since then he’s been texting me regularly but I’ve been responding with 1 word answers.

My boyfriend and I were video calling the other day, and he asked me what had happened (because I didn’t text him for a day). I told him I was deep cleaning my apartment. He asked why and I decided to be honest and told him the whole story of my ex coming in. My BF got extremely upset and said that I should have called 911 as soon as he broke into my apartment. I told him I wasn’t going to call the cops on my ex, especially not with the whole situation going on, letting him go to jail would be dangerous.

My boyfriend says I violated his trust by letting my ex stay the night. I didn’t tell him about the bed sharing part yet. I don’t exactly feel like I had any other choice except to let my ex stay with me. AITA here?",329,670,0.85

I have two boys one is age 8 and one is age 14. I have one girl who is age 12. Me and my son recently moved out from our apartment to our new house with my husband. The house has three bedrooms one for us and two for kids. I plan to give one full bedroom to a girl because I feel it's not a good idea to put girls and boys.

My son before we moved used to have a full bedroom so he is a little upset about that. Anyway it's a few weeks after we finished the arrangement and got the house in order. My son has been complain that he needs to have the room that my daughter got and I refused.

My son has been saying that it's been near impossible to sleep in the shared room cause his half brother is so noisy and that I read his half brother a book so that he can fall asleep. He complained about how his half brother messes with his things and distracts him from learning and studying his ap classes. I refused and told him he has to learn to live with what he got after he asked me why can't half brother move in with half sister. My son has stopped talking to me.

These are the only available sleep arrangements as the attic is filled to the brim with stuff and the 1 car garage is filled with equipment and a car.  My son also has started bullying his half sister because of the sleeping arrangements now and refuses to listen or follow with me when I ground him'

138,Not the A-hole,"I know there's another post on here rn about a colleague with cancer. That is not this.

I have 2 brothers: 15 and 11. I'm 17 and female.

11 normally keeps his hair about about an inch long on top and short at the sides. His barber has shut down and 15 recently bought clippers so 15 offered to do 11's hair. 15, having never done hair before and never used these clippers ever, fucked it up. He realised he fucked it up, tried to even it out, fucked up the other side, and eventually 11 had the options of a combover or a full head shave, and went for the full head shave (with stubble left).

11 was really upset about it so as an apology, to prove it wasn't so bad, and because he was planning on doing it anyway, 15 shaved his own head, so now they both have just stubble, nothing else.

We live with dad (mum isn't involved) and as an act of solidarity with his sons, dad also shaved his head.

I have thick, dark, nearly waist length hair. It's very frizzy with some split ends and has a lot of volume. With some minor readjustments, I can look like Cousin It with very little effort, but I like my hair. I mentioned that I might trim it, just an inch or so to get the split ends off, and I'd do it myself with the kitchen scissors and then I'd dye it.

15 heard me say this and said ""you should shave your head"". 11 heard this and said ""yeah, you should"". Dad then joined in. All 3 of them want me to now shave my head in solidarity, either full stubble like they have or an undercut that leaves it short (but not stubble) at the back/sides but long everywhere else.

I've said that they chose to do that to themselves, I've got no reason to join in. If it was a cancer thing then maybe I'd feel differently but they did it solely because 15 messed up 11's hair.

I'm going to be honest, I don't think I'm the arsehole here. I have no reason to think I am. But my dad and brothers are all saying I should do this with them, 11 in particular is saying that he misses his longer hair and wants me to do this with them, dad is saying it'll be a family bonding thing, and I really don't want to shave my head. However, it's currently 3 vs 1, and I know it's my hair, but I'm the only person who doesn't want me to shave my head and they're doing their best to convince me.

So, for starters I am biracial (23F). African American and Hispanic. 

So basically my roommate (24F) and I were talking and chilling together since none of us could go home.

We were talking about our respective partners and shit when she started telling me about her sex life. Normally I love to hear weird or fun stories about sex which people willingly share with me but this one was just really weird.

So apparently my roommate and her boyfriend have this kink called raceplay BDSM. Where my roommate pretends to be a black slave and her boyfriend pretends to be a slave owner. They're both very white.

I felt really uncomfortable when she went into the details and I told her to stop as it seemed very racist to me. I also told her that the kink is making me uncomfortable and told her to not talk about it with me in the future.

She waved off my request and kept reassuring me that it's nothing racist and I shouldn't be ""triggered"". She didn't stop even after I told her to so I got upset and went back to my room.

She isn't talking to me and it's all very stressful to me in this situation, I want to know if I was in the wrong so I could apologise.

142,Everyone Sucks,"My husband recently accused me of hating his mother (not entirely true but not entirely false) for a number of reasons (she tries to dictate how I dress my child and how I parent) 

Today he mentioned wanting to call his mom and have her come over and help with our 7.5 month old daughter so we can finish cleaning the house. I deal with a lot of mental disorders and am physically disabled, I am also in constant pain and can barely walk due to my pregnancy and haven’t fully recovered from that yet, so the household chores have piled up. Our house is filthy mainly due to me not being able to do much cleaning (not really an excuse tbh). My husband doesn’t have much excuse other than being too lazy to clean. He doesn’t work 40 hour weeks, just when people call him to work. 

As my daughter gets more mobile I want to try and keep our house as clean as possible. I feel like I’m failing her otherwise, so I’ve been working my ass off trying my best to clean as much as possible, which might not be great on my body since I’m in even more pain than ever before but I want to do it for her. 

Our daughter is currently teething and is overly fussy which makes getting anything done near impossible. My husband noticed this and suggested he call his mom to watch the baby so he and I can work on the chores today. I told him I didn’t want her over until the house is clean because I feel like she’s incredibly picky and will be incredibly judgmental and think im not a good mother based on how bad our house has gotten. 

I recently had my sister over for the day to play with and watch the baby. She adores my daughter and wants to spend as much time as possible with her so she asked if she could come over, I agreed. My husband said I have double standards because of this, I’ll have my family over but won’t have his. I don’t think I do have double standards, my family is messier than his. They won’t care nearly as much that my house isn’t spotless. His family has been in the cleaning business for decades so I feel that their standards of cleanliness is a lot higher than my family. 

I feel like my feelings are justified and that I have a valid reason to not allow my in laws over but I want to see what others think.

143,Everyone Sucks,"This happened a few years ago and the ages are how old we were then. It’s been eating me up for a while. Names are changed. 

Background: My ex-boyfriend James (22M) and I (19F) met at college and were in a friendship group of 20 or so students. He was extremely irresponsible with birth control. He never had condoms at his house and pulled the whole “feels like a shower in a raincoat” “I just want there to be nothing between us” “they don’t fit me” routine. I got myself an Implanon within weeks of meeting him to avoid discussing the issue. At some point he told me that he got his ex Bridget (18F) pregnant and she went to Planned Parenthood for an abortion which was the “worst experience of HIS life”. He let her sleep over for one night then immediately ended the relationship for “killing his baby” and told her to get her things and get out. Keep in mind he was 22 and she had only just graduated high school. She was 18 so the issue isn’t legality but life experience and maturity. This should have been a massive red flag but I was 19 and naive.

We had a very toxic love/hate relationship that ended very poorly a year or so later. A couple of months later I heard on the grapevine that he was going out with another girl from our group, Emma (18F). I wasn’t bothered by this because I didn’t know her very well so it wasn’t a betrayal or anything, and I’d moved on to a new relationship myself. However Emma is a much quieter person than me and I felt sure that he was pulling the no condom bullshit with her as well. I didn’t want her to go through the same thing as Bridget, and I thought she had a right to know. He was VERY keen to be a dad.

Here’s where I might be TA. I couldn’t tell Emma directly because she wasn’t talking to me anymore, but we were both close to a girl in our group Kirsten (20F) who is a massive gossip. I told Kirsten about what James did to Bridget and said “you can’t tell ANYONE”. 

As I expected Kirsten couldn’t resist such a spicy piece of gossip and told Emma straight away. Within a few days James called me in a rage shouting that I’d betrayed him and how dare I tell his private story to Kirsten. This was especially bad because James hates Kirsten for taking my side in the break up. 

I wouldn’t have done any of this if any of us knew Bridget but she didn’t go to our college and I don’t even know her last name.

Some time later I found out that Emma and James had in fact been hooking behind my back for the last few months of our relationship so as it turns out my interference was completely unnecessary and Emma already knew him very well and probably already knew the abortion story. But at the time I thought the relationship was new and I was worried about her. I wish I’d known how he treats women before I’d started the relationship because it was a terrible time in my life.

Now, the AITA part is this: Somewhere in the period we had a lot of these tearful conversations, I found out that she had left her facebook account logged in on my phone. This meant I was able to read all of her messages without her knowing, including the messages she sent to her ex. I read all messages she sent and received without telling her. 

Eventually I confessed I had been reading her messages because I felt bad. My ex-gf was furious at me for invading her privacy and violating her trust.

Prior to that my girlfriend tried to call me at 7:30 PM and I couldn't answer it at that point of time. So I messaged her at 9:30 PM and asked her what's going on? She didn't reply back and I even gave her a missed call to make sure she gets my message ( She's with her family, so can't pick up my call at night.)

I then slept.

She tried calling me at 11:00 PM but I was sleeping, my sister picked up her call and informed her I'm sleeping.

I woke up at 00:30 time and messaged her happy birthday\[ Her birthday started 30 minutes ago\], asked her if she can take my call ( I know she can't but was just trying my luck -- she said no). I told her I lost track of time and have been sleeping, I slept at 7-8 pm. She then started calculating my timings and accused me of lying to her as I messaged her at 9:30 PM. I said that's ok but I honestly don't remember all that. I told her I just woke up and there's some misunderstanding.

She then found it odd that my sister picked up my call and told her I'm sleeping. I admit it never happens but maybe my sister saw I was sleeping in a deep sleep so she did this for me. So my gf further thought it's me trying to do something with help of my sister.

I then shared a photo of her on my Instagram story and she then accused me of not putting effort in finding a proper photo and just downloading one from her feed. I then had to prove to her that photo I put was very wide and her feed had a square version so it was PROVED I did not just copy it from there but searched it on my phone. I was like WTF, what's even the issue if I just download it from feed? She became silent here.

Then I told her communication is not going well and we should talk on phone in morning. She won't let me go and started sending me pics of her crying. I stayed and chatted with her. And then twisted conversation to other topics and said goodnight to her and slept.

Today I confronted her again on what bullshit she did with me last night and she started crying again and said she wants to breakup and all. She told me she wanted to talk to me with something important about her feelings at 7:30 pm yesterday but couldn't because I was not available.

I've so far put the communication on a positive note and managed to dodge some bullets but I find this very annoying. AMITA?

147,No A-holes here,"First time poster! So long story short, my cat got sick with cancer (older cat but seemed healthy until recently). Started acting very different, wouldn't really do anything other than lay there and drink a lot of water. She started acting different Saturday night, took her to the vet Sunday evening. So we had two options. Keep her on pain killers and delay the inevitable, or put her out of her misery. Mind you, this is a ""family cat"". I expressed that she shouldn't have to live in pain so my choice was obvious. It seemed like my parents agreed however we hadn't discussed it much. 

Sunday passes and after some pain killers, she's the exact same in the morning. Before I went to work, I hung out with her for like two minutes and told my mom she obviously needs to be put down. I come home from work Monday morning, and she's gone. Stuffs packed away, my mom tells me shes in heaven now. Now this is where I got absolutely furious. They took her to the vet to have her put down while I was at work, with zero heads up or anything like that. They literally told me they ""assumed"" I said bye to her in the morning and that I knew it was going to happen. Yes I knew, but I had no idea when or anything. And they know for a fact that I would have wanted to be there with her when it happened.

My sis  say she agrees  with me but my bro says im not being  considerate  of her feelings... i don't  know i just wish i could  have my dad time and my mom time and the two not mix.

*MORE INFO *

 First  off thanks for all the advise!  But i didn't to put to much out there so this was more neutral but i see with out the back ground  it's hard to get a full grasp  on. So mom grow up  with out a dad  and just always  want her kids to have one unfortunately  my dad  was a functioning  drug addict, ( cocaine  and other hard stuff) and my mom kind of forced  him in to being  clean while  she  hide  his  addiction  from us. When my dad finally  got clean M was in a really bad  car accident  that effected  her state  of mind( really bad depression)  she was pretty much  bed ridden  and lost her career  because  of it but wouldn't apply  for disability  because("" it would take away her hope of getting  her life back"" )  this put a great  financial strain  on my father and and mentally  strain on me. I became i kind of filled her shoes got a job.  The whole  time we bagged  her to get disability  and she would just shut down.  Fast forward  to my college  days my mom started  her own business it was a money pit for my dad and one day he  asked  me for money  that i was saving  for school  books  i told him no and he walked out. My mom's  business  started  taking off  and my dad wanted to come home. My mom asked me about it  I told my mom No i had  it  with the both of them  and the cycle  of  there toxic  relationships. This relationship  broke  me.  So i moved to campus  haven't  had alot to do with them really , up until  i got engaged  (this was before i got the new job) now there is a fight about paying for  my wedding  even  though  i dont want them to pay for anything.  My dad thinks if were getting  married  we should  pay for it  while my mom thinks they should  split the cost  and everything  is a fight now.  Mom has said some trouble  things  to my  mom sep mom and my dad's  family  so now its like war world 3. 

So i told them neither  of there spouse my mom's  boyfriend  or my dads new wife can come to my weddin, because  they can't  get along  and my mom called  me a traitor..  ok well i hope this helps I feel like an asshole  for this, but i dont want to listen  to my mom trash talk my stepmom and i dont want my dad to   fuel the fire  by fight with my mom about  everything. But i dont really  see a third opinion.",103,751,0.92

I took catering which means I am the better cook out of the two of us (although he cooks the best cookies) which means I'm the one in the kitchen but a majority of the time I need something I have to either climb on a chair or the sides to get the stuff out of the cupboard, I've slipped several times now thanks to our dog jumping up.

I absolutely hate doing this.

I've talked to him about rearranging and he's always put it off.

I rearranged it since I'm the one who does the cooking it shouldn't be a problem? I mean I've lived here for 8 months now and the only thing that's mine in the flat is like a candle and he hates it so its never lit.

He threw a tantrum and told me I shouldn't have rearranged his things and how out of order it was etc, how he had it set up the way he liked and it's been that way for 4 years.

152,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for spelling mistakes and so on. ESL.

So we are one of those big families and we live in a big 2 story house. The first floor is seperated in 2 apartments (where my parents and I (temporarily) live) and also my grandparents live there and in the second floor is my aunt with my two cousins (m26 and f17).

So the thing is following :
2 nights ago I was upstairs with my little cousin lying in her bed and I was questioning her about her weird behavior the past week. She had been dizzy and jumpy and stuff. She finally let it slip that she was pregnant and fucking scared. She had taken a very cheep test. So knowing how it is to be a 17 year old with a pregnancy scare, I drove her to a drug store and she took one that was more reliable. She was indeed pregnant. After a long talk she said that she was going to tell her mother but asked me to be present in case she looses her temper ( has happened more than once).

Shit hit the fan. There were screams and both cried. My aunt said that she was disappointed that cousin was her daughter, that she thought she had taught her better etc. Grandpa and mom came up because they heard the commotion and asked wtf was happening. Aunt told them. Cousin run away crying (to her room) . Mom tried to calm the situation down saying stuff like ""but that's not the important thing right now. We have to look how we can support her"" etc.
I was trying as well, but seen as she had told me before anyone , aunt was pissed at me.

So here is where I might be the asshole. When my mom was talking about options my grandpa was like.
""no. There is only one real option here. And that is to have the child. Abortion is not an option!""
So I said, admittedly, very condescending ""great! Then don't have an abortion when you get pregnant grandpa"".

Then more shit more screaming about me being a disrespectful ""child"" and more comments from me. I was trying to protect my cousin. Because yes. It fucking sucks. She is 17 and pregnant but holly shit you would think that she just murdered her brother, cooked him and gave him to us to eat.
But my interjectiond were classified as me trying to justify and to applaud my little cousins actions. At one moment I got so fed up I started saying things just to spite grandfather. For example when he said ""[...] that's why women shouldn't have sex before they get married. Now look at (cousin)"" and I was like ""I had sex LONG before I got married. Your comment is invalid and sexist"". Mind you... No personal insults. Juts low jabs that I knew would make him mad.

After that my mom said that I was right in wanting to protect cousin but that I couldn't talk like that to her father. My dad thought I was right 100%. Aunt ans obs grandfather are pissed at me",191,2264,0.95

He seemed offended and the now bald gang said I was being a dick and I might as well laugh in his face.

So my boyfriend and I have been together for two years, I live in Germany, he's Dutch but works in Germany, this Easter he wanted to go see his family in the Netherlands, I was fine with it, I love his family, they're really nice and sweet and honest people. 

I have online classes since I'm in uni and I don't want to study here because I don't have the available material and notebooks and I don't have a desk here. 

We were supposed to be home on Monday, my boyfriend's car was at the workshop here and we had to wait until Wednesday till the car was fixed in the morning. 

He then asked me to stay here another day because he wants to see his family one more day, as the prior night they had a small argument, I said yes sure, but I'm done delaying getting home and Thursday is the max, he says okay, I have a few packages arriving Friday, and online classes I have to attend early in the morning. 

So today came and we showered, I finished getting ready and went downstairs and saw him gaming, he said he doesn't want to leave until Saturday, and I said it's not fair to keep telling me we're gonna leave ""tomorrow"" everyday and changing his mind and I have online classes and packages tomorrow and promised a friend I would see him this week.

He got really pissed and started packing angrily, saying he's pissed and shit. I don't get it I just want to go home.

155,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago a friend of mine was given the whole set of a manga collection (around 20 books or so) from a family friend. She wasn't overly interested in manga so decided to gift them to me for my birthday.

I LOVE this series; it's one of my favourites and I was planning on taking this set to university with me in a few months. However earlier today this friend messaged me, in a group chat mind not PM, asking if she could have the books back. She claimed that the original owner wanted them back, so she wanted them back to return to the owner.

To be honest I don't want to give them back; they were originally a present to my friend who gifted them to me, and I feel that both my friend and the original owner are being rude to ask for them back.

WIBTA if I said I want to keep them?

Quick Update: I talked to my friend about it and she had never wanted to ask for them back in the first place.

157,Not the A-hole,"So I'll try to preface this by saying that I hold no ill will towards her nor am I jealous or something of the like given I often see people jump on those reasons in similar posts and I added adopted because it is relevant to the story. I figured I'd try to get that out of the way. I am not English or American so I am sorry for any mistakes.

Now I am 22M and I have two ""Blood"" siblings who we'll call Jack(24M) and Jane(25F).

Now my parents pretty much suffered from empty nest syndrome when all of us moved out, first my brother when he was 18 to go off to Uni, followed by my sister at 21 to live with her boyfriend in another city and finally I moved out 3 years ago at 19 also to go to Uni, my mom was literally inconsolable for the first month when I moved out and would often make little jabs at all three of us for ditching them when in reality we all just grew up and are in active contact with them.

Now it is very relevant to add that the Uni I go to is pretty mych on the other side of the country resulting in me not being able to visit my parents regularly and I basically only visit them twice a year at most and they visit me a few times a year as well, but it is not often purely because of the distance.

2 years ago my parents informed me they were going to be fostering a girl and apparantly already went ahead with their plans and wanted to surprise us with the great news, my brother was the first to state the obvious that they were both in to their 50's and adopting a toddler was simply not a good idea, I said I was happy for them but stated the same worries, I mean the moment she would be 18 they would nearing 70 and who is to say they'll be in good health at that point?

Well they went ahead with it and about a year of having her they formalized it and adopted her legally

Well, I have seen her a few times these past 2 years, But I have no relationship with her, I am pretty shitty with kids to begin with add to that the fact I rarely see her, it is not exactly a good formula to create a sibling relationship, my brother feels the same as he also lives far from our parents. Only our sister sees her more regularly.

Now with the things going on my parents have been calling far more often and after a while of this my mom seemed aggitated at me, when I asked her why she said she was annoyed that I never ask to speak to my sister so I told her I am not sure what to discuss with a 6 year old.

When I think about it we're just not close, I mean I get my parents love her and want her to get the full sibling experience but  it just doesn't feel the same to me as it does with my brother and sister as we grew up together and all, she is if I am going to be blunt a 6 year old that I see once in a while if that makes sense yet I feel incredibly guilty about it as obviously she can't help it at all, I just feel this entire situation is mostly awkward and I am not sure what to even do, I can't force brotherly feelings to appear out of thin air.

158,Asshole,"EDIT: Thanks for the input, everyone. I think the general consensus is that I WBTA, so I won’t do it. I will take some of your suggestions in mind, and I also think I will talk to my therapist about other techniques for managing this specific conflict, as clearly our regular techniques are not working for this situation. This is legitimately the only argument we’ve had over the years that we haven’t been able to resolve in an adult manner. 


Original Post:

This sounds petty, and it probably is petty, but I’m super fed up. My girlfriend (40F) and I (33F) have been living together for about 4 years. We split bills, rent, utilities etc equally. I have paid for Netflix for longer than we’ve been together; we share the account with my mum and sister. We almost never argue, except over the television. It is rare but when it happens I get super angry and here’s why: 


I don’t watch a lot of TV; gf watches pretty much everything. Most of what she watches doesn’t interest me and I usually zone out and read/play on my phone while she watches. When she watches something truly annoying, I may leave and chill in the living room (the TV is in the bedroom). She uses the TV 99% of the time. What shows we watch is about 95% her choice. Most of it is on Netflix. Very rarely do we watch something we are both into. 


Last night I wanted to watch a movie on Netflix. A fantasy movie that I’ve seen before (she’s never seen it and doesn’t want to). We watched about 10 minutes before she started complaining, imitating character’s voices badly and basically saying how stupid it was. This is usually what happens on the rare occasion I want to watch something she doesn’t. It doesn’t matter how many times I point out the fact that I never behave the same when the tables are turned (which is most of the time), she behaves the same way. 


So in frustration, I switched off the TV and left the room, saying “Fine, watch whatever you want.” I went to my computer, turned on a series that I’ve been meaning to watch, and ignored her repeated attempts at apology. The reason I ignored her apologies is because she doesn’t actually apologise. She just says the same thing, “Sorry, go ahead and watch your show.” I know from experience that similar (not as pronounced, but similar) petulant behaviour would continue if I did). So I ignored her until she asked why I was being so sulky, it’s just TV. I explained that it’s because she’s selfish, which she took great offense to. 


I went to bed late, after she had already fallen asleep because I didn’t want to argue anymore, but this morning I woke up and it’s still eating at me. On a previous occasion, she brought up that she bought the smart TV independently. I did not bring up that I pay for Netflix independently. 


So, WIBTA if I logged out of Netflix on the smart TV and pretended I had no idea what was the matter with it (she has no tech savvy at all). I know it’s extremely petty, so I will take my judgement either way. Thanks for the input.",255,2025,0.96
159,Not the A-hole,"My roommate recently got a girlfriend and he has been staying at her place non stop.
Now hes saying he doesn't want to pay utilities because he's not over here using them. He also says he needs to start paying utilities over there and helping his gf out. 

That doesn't make sense to me. The utilities aren't 100% usage based. If he's not here that doesn't mean the power bill will get cut in half. The house still costs the same amount to cool weather he's in it or not, the fridge still has to be plugged in. 
The only money in power that's going to be saved by him not being here is his bedroom light, the laundry he does twice a month and his computer being on. If the power bill is 100 dollars it's not gonna drop to 50 cause he isn't here. 

The internet bill is static and isn't usage based. Nothing I can do about that. 

I don't want it to cost me money because he wants to be at her house all the time. I think he has a responsibility to our bills before anything else.

Also he has a key, he lives here and can stop by whenever to use the internet / take a shower / cook. Why would I pay for him to have access to all of those things?

160,Asshole,"Soooo, this just happened. I woke up to use the bathroom and saw that my sister had opened her bedroom door sometime between 3-6am and had also left the bathroom door open. I had been in the bathroom taking a shower before bed and left the window open to air it out bc there’s no fan. 

Now this wouldn’t normally have been bad, but I took the screen out a few weeks ago when cleaning and just haven’t put it back in because I find it nicer to look out the window without a screen there. My sister and I are both at our moms house home from our college houses so my sister brought her cat with her and we have two other cats.

I always close the bathroom door when the window is open because our cats love sitting in windows and have been known to get out of the house if they can get to the roof out of it (there’s a small roof below this window about a foot down from where the back door is). When I noticed both doors open I immediately went into my sisters room to see if her cat was sleeping in there (my sister keeps her cat in her room with the door closed at night). My sister woke up to me in her room and realized I was looking for her cat.

My sister then proceeded to yell at me that this was my fault for leaving the bathroom window open, however I took the precautionary step of making sure the bathroom door was firmly closed when I went to my room. I told her it was her fault for leaving both the bathroom door AND her door open since the window was open. Her defense is that she went to the bathroom at 5am and didn’t see the window open. That makes no sense though bc the bathroom was colder than the hallway, the window is right across from the entrance, and it’s between the toilet and her sink. How she couldn’t have noticed it is beyond me. She disagreed with me and said that she just wasn’t thinking and that it’s my fault for 1) not closing the window and 2) not at least putting the screen back. So AITA?

Edit: I forgot to say that we got her kitten, she was just on the ledge and couldn’t figure out how to jump back in. Our other two cats go outside every day so it wouldn’t really be an issue if they got out as they know where to go which is why I made sure both my bathroom door and my sisters door before I went to bed with the window open.",33,63,0.81

162,Asshole,"(RESOLVED w/GRANDMOTHER! update comment in the replies) 

hey y'all, what's good. to set this up, i'm a trans man (23M) who started socially transitioning around late 2017, and then starting my medical transition/seriously coming out to family members in 2019. i'd like to think of myself as a pretty masculine guy, and i pass about 80% of the time outside of the house. it's worth noting that pre-transition, i was only ever really a ""girly girl"" for \~2years (a last ditch effort to be ""feminine"" on my part) and this comes into play later.

i've temporarily moved back in with my parents as i'm between jobs, and with this free time, i've been going through all the old boxes with my ""female"" stuff that i left behind in storage. one of the things that i found (which i've been trying to find for years) is a jewelry box full of my old, sentimental items.

this is where stuff gets tricky -- way back in 2009, my grandmother gave me a few jewelry items that she'd been holding onto for me (her first granddaughter) when i came ""of age"". The most notable piece out of the collection was a pair of opal earrings that she'd worn when getting married to her first husband (my bio grandfather). since i was 13 and didn't want the guilt of losing the earrings that were not only 1) historically important to the family and 2) actually worth something, i put them in my jewelry box for safe keeping, and then mostly forgot about them.

through the years, my grandmother would ask about the earrings, but i was never really the type to wear jewelry (except for that 2-year stint i was talking about from 2015 - 2017), and the opal earrings really only got taken out for my prom and my aunt's wedding. my grandmother never asked for them back, or encouraged me to wear them out more often -- they were always meant to be a ""rare occasion"" piece.

now that i'm out as a trans guy, my grandmother has brought up the earrings twice. initially, i was able to honestly say that i didn't know where the earrings were, because they were so deep inside of the family's storage boxes. now that i've found them (and i don't want to lie and say that they're still buried in old stuff), i feel like she's going to ask for me to either give them back to her, or to give them to one of my female family members.

the issue is . . . i want to keep the earrings. there's special events i could see myself wearing these to -- my college graduation, my best friends' wedding, other formal LGBTQ+ events -- and while i don't plan on having kids of my own, i would love to keep the tradition of passing them onto my first niece/nephew.

so. am i the asshole if i don't want to give back the heirloom jewelry i was gifted when i was still a teen girl, even though i'm living my life as a man now?",127,118,0.8
163,Not the A-hole,"I'm on a computer, and English is my first language, so typos and such are my own fault. Throw away because my fiance knows my main. 31F, Fiance is 32M, FIL is 59. 

Fiance lost his job at the beginning of March, so we moved in with my recently retired FIL. It's been awful. He's the most misogynistic, racist, entitled trash hole I've ever met. He's expected me to cook dinner, do the laundry, etc, since I moved in, and I'm the only one continuing to work. He belittles me for the things I wear, the music I listen to, the wedding I'm planning. My fiance runs interference, and it's been an exhausting battle for the both of us. We're trying to move out, but things are hard right now. 

Before we moved in, we didn't realize  that my FIL (who only retired in December) has already depleted 90% of his retirement fund. He's spent over $600,000 in the last year since he retired. This all came out about two weeks after we moved in when FIL asked for our help with the mortgage. We paid it, thinking that the current crisis was the cause of his financial woes. The situation has since devolved to us having to catch up the rest of his mortgage payments, utilities that were about to be shut off, internet service so I can work, all the groceries, etc etc etc. It has caused a lot of tension in the house. My fiance is furious, and all they do is argue every day while I'm at work.

Yesterday morning, I was in the kitchen eating my cereal. I say it's mine, because it genuinely is. I have Celiac disease, and stick to a very strict gluten free diet because I prefer to not shit my guts out every day. I make sure to purchase regular, gluten filled cereal for my fiance and FIL, and I keep all my things sequestered in one part of the kitchen so there's no confusion between specifically my cereal, and cereal for the rest of the house. FIL comes in to the kitchen and sees my cereal out on the counter (Rice Chex, for those wondering) and decides to help himself to a bowl. The following conversation ensued:

""Hey FIL, please don't eat that cereal. There are regular chex in the pantry - those are mine.""

FIL  -  ""It's food in my house, I can eat whatever food is in my house.""

Me  -  ""Well, I can't eat the rest of the food in the house, can you leave my cereal alone?""

FIL  -  \*throwing full bowl of chex into the sink\* ""Celiac is a made up disease anyway""

Me  -  ""Are you serious? I just asked you to NOT eat my cereal because I didn't want to waste it, and you're throwing it in the sink? Can you just leave my food alone so I have something to eat?""

FIL  -  ""It's my house,""

I cut him off before he finished, looked him in his dead little eyeballs and asked him:

Fiance thought it was hilarious, however, all his siblings are calling me an asshole.

I don’t want to get into TMI territory here, but I have psoriasis around my “downstairs” region. It’s kind of itchy, red, and scaly. I can’t say it’s pretty, but it’s not contagious or anything. I’ve tried to seek treatment for it, but the only treatment that works is not great to use long term. Basically, I’m stuck with it.

I’ve had sex a few times, a few different partners, but never told them about my skin condition. My last boyfriend, the first time we slept together, he stopped as soon as he saw and outright asked me if I had an STD. When I told him no, he said it was looking “pretty gnarly” and said he would have appreciated some warning. I told him I didn’t think it was an issue that I had to bring up. He said that I was being a little disingenuous or unkind, leading men to think that they could be sleeping with a girl with an STD. And maybe pressuring them into not asking about it by keeping silent about it myself.

To start, I am a lesbian, from a very anti-LGBT family. One of my friends is also gay, and she is VERY open about it, like her whole life is rainbow themed (I.e. her hair, bags, phone case).
And we have been hanging out at like malls and everything, just anywhere but my house, for obvious reasons.

So one day, she suggests we should hang out at my house, since she has never been there for the 5 years we have been friends. I say that I would like her too, but if she would not act so openly gay around my family, because I:
1) don’t want to out myself
2) my family can be dickheads to anyone LGBT
3) they won’t let me be friends with her anymore

And she said that I was trying to discriminate against her and the LGBT community, and how I shouldn’t make her hide her true self. I get where she is coming from, but I have explained my situation to her.

Then, she told all my friends, and they all agree with her that I am an asshole. I can’t help but feel shitty, but I can’t change my situation, and I don’t want to make things worse.

166,Not the A-hole,"My dad (50m) and I (23m) haven’t had contact in over 6 yrs. Mostly because he wasn’t involved much in my life. When I was born, he was still married to his 1st wife so he wanted me to be kept a secret. My mom was only 18 &amp; didn’t know any better so she went along with it. 
Finally met him when I was 5 after they divorced once the secret was out. After that he was still a huge flake. Always promised to be there on b-days/important moments only to never show up. And on the rare occasion that we did hang out, it was so awkward and he always seemed uninterested in me or like I was wasting his time. 
He also refused to help my mom financially even though he made a good living for himself and she only stopped asking him for money when he threatened to take me away from her.

When I graduated from hs, he said he’d be there but only my grandparents came to the ceremony. I was expecting it but it still stung so I decided I didn’t want him in my life anymore. I sent a txt that pretty much was venting the last 17 yrs of my life and telling him it would be best for us to stop trying to have some type of relationship when it clearly wasn’t gonna happen. He never replied and we didn’t talk again after that.
3 months ago, my half-siblings (from his 1st marriage) found me on fb told me he had cancer and that he wasn’t doing so good. They said my dad really wanted to see me and kept asking for me.

He passed away in February and when I was invited to the funeral, I didn’t go either because it didn’t feel like my place to be there when we essentially had no ties to eachother except biological. He was always more of a dad to my other siblings anyways so at least they’d be there to mourn their father.
My older half-sister called me two days after super pissed off and said I was a selfish piece of sh*t for not honoring his last wish. And even worse that I was cold and heartless enough to not even go to my own father’s funeral. That I let my “daddy issues” make me petty and not everything had to be about me. She said she hoped the guilt would eat me alive and that i wasn’t welcome in their family anymore. We haven’t talked since. I still stand by my decision, but being alone with my thoughts these couple of months have started to make me doubt myself. I still don’t feel guilty for what happened or hurt over what she said (deep down I think she still resents me for breaking up their marriage). But it still has me thinking that maybe I should’ve been the bigger person in that situation. There’s no changing anything now except maybe acknowledging that I made a mistake. I’ll leave that for you to decide, AITA?",83,201,0.94
167,Not the A-hole,"Gonna go ahead and apologize ahead of time for any mistakes, as I haven't posted anything on mobile more than once.

I (F17) have a bad reaction whenever weed is smoked around me. I don't know what it is, but it makes me vomit and makes my stomach hurt. My mother (F39) smokes a lot of weed, which is cool with me because it's legal here. But the problem is that she doesn't seem to take my 'allergy' (I suppose I can call it that) seriously. She smokes in the living room all the time, even when I'm around which is rather annoying because then I have to leave the room. I end up spending most of the day in my room to avoid any weed induced sickness.

I've respectfully asked her several times to not smoke it around me, because it makes me sick, but she always just gets mad at me and doesn't take me seriously. She acts like I've committed some serious offense whenever I ask, and my dad always sides with her, which makes me feel really bad.

168,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few months ago but I recently told this story to my roommate who thinks I overreacted.  

I'd ordered food from an app and the driver called me to ask for my address. I had him on call for a bit because he seemed kinda clueless and it took him a while to find my building, but the conversation never went anywhere personal. I just gave him directions ,thanked him for the food and hung up. Didnt even get the guys name or anything.  

Few hours later I opened my whatsapp and saw that an unknown number had sent me a ton of voice messages. I listened to them and recognised the guys voice. Tbh, there was nothing objectively weird in it, he just talked about how nice of a person I seemed and how he'd like to keep in touch and it wasnt a big deal if I wasnt into it but it still creeped me out. I'm a female living with a female roommate and this guy knowing my address made me pretty uncomfortable. I reported him to the app and they said they would deal with it so I blocked him and let it go. A couple of weeks later the same guy messaged me from another number and I blocked his ass like lightning but I was pretty stressed at that time so I didn't really focus on doing anything about it.  

My roommate and I were chatting yesterday and I brought the story up, thinking I was in the right for dealing with him, but she thinks that it was an AH move. In my country ( and I guess in most countries) this guy was probably a min wage worker and he'd mentioned in one of the voice messages that he had kids so me reporting him could have caused him problems. According to her, he wasnt pushy and just sounded lonely and naive so I should have just blocked him and let it be. We also live in a gated building and the guy just dropped off the food with security and never saw my face so I shouldn't have 'panicked'.  

I think I was justified in being concerned for my safety, but I feel bad for getting someone into so much trouble if it was innocent. AITA?",43,78,0.89
169,Not the A-hole,"Basically my sister (14F) and I (20F) wanted a Nintendo Switch, but it costs a lot of money to get one so we decided to split the cost. Overall the switch + games + accessories cost about $420 (ayyy) and as I have a job and I’m older, I agreed to paying for most of it ($300).

We gave ourselves about 3 months to save up money, but by the end of it, my sister didn’t have enough for her $120 share (she was always spending money and hanging out with her friends.)

But I still wanted a Switch so I said I would cover her as long as she paid me back via artwork and drawings. She’s a great artist and she does do commissions, so we agreed that I would pay for her and in exchange, she would create 3-4 drawings for me.

So we bought the switch back in January and we both use it. Anyhow, I asked her to draw me a portrait of my friend for her birthday, nothing too strenuous, asked her 3 weeks in advance and gave her all the info she needed. She never delivered and i was angry, but I just bought my friend another present last minute so I wasn’t too upset.

Anyhow fast forward to February and she did the same thing. Then more recently, I asked if she could draw a character I liked from a TV show and she just straight up told me that she didn’t want to, that she never wanted to, that she didn’t know why I kept asking her to draw shit and that I was not entitled to her drawings.

I reminded her that her drawing for me was literally apart of the deal we had on the Nintendo switch but she said it’s been months since we got it so we should just drop it.

So I did just that and now I’m refusing to let her play the switch, of course she’s angry but I said it was technically my Switch now since I paid for it 100%. I brought it up to my mom and she said I need to be the bigger person here (figuratively and literally) and share it with my sister. AITA in this situation?

# EDIT AND UPDATE:

When I went to bed, this post had like 30 comments and there was no new ones coming in so I was sure it'd be dead. SUPER surprised to see 1K+ comments when I woke up! There's a lot of concerns I would like to address in the comments section but the only one I want to address is that I'm a college student who pays for my own rent, car payments, car insurance, my priority is putting money in my ROTH and 401K etc. so it DOES take me a while to save up to buy games. 

Anyhow, she actually came knocking on my door after lunch and apologized to me. She said her actions were unnecessary and she was mortified about how immature she acted. I kind of lectured her on financial responsibility and she took it very well actually! We started a change jar so she could save up, even if only a little bit at a time. We negotiated and I said the 3-4 drawing offer still stands, but I won't let her play with it until she creates at least one, and that I want the other three drawings done by the end of this year. So now she's drawing Haley from Stardew Valley. Some people are going to say I'm too lenient, but in the long run it's probably better off like this.",1779,18005,0.95

I knew she was really excited about it, but I said I wanted to use mine since it was my system and profile. Before I could tell her that I would make a 2nd profile so we each could play as ourselves she started catching an attitude and throwing a fit. Then to make matters worse our mother who was in the room started to argue with my sister about getting upset over the game which made it so I couldn't tell her about the multiple files on one island thing.

173,Not the A-hole,"So for the past 8 months or more now I've had this girl living in my building who very obviously has some sort of mental defect. She is constantly wandering around the building, opening the lobby door for any male that approaches. She constantly waits downstairs in the lobby for school kids to get home so she can snap photos of them on her phone without them looking.

Every night now for the past few months, every time I leave for work ( I work nights) this girl has been sitting outside my apartment door. She'll follow me into the elevator and all around the building (trying to be discreet but she can't because well. ya know, mental problems).

I've tried speaking to her parents (barely speak English, say they'll do something, they keep her in the apartment for like a day then it starts all over again). I've tried speaking to property management, they say it's a private matter and refuse to get involved, I've tried speaking to police, who tell me she is a poor, confused girl and I should leave her alone. Like, WTF? i'm not the one following her!

I've brought up the concern that it seems she should be in school, since all she does all day is wander around the building and the hallways, but i've been told by property management that she is in fact 18 and graduated school......

Tonight as i was leaving for work My grandmother who lives with me so i can take care of her came to the hallway door to say something to me before i left, and this girl was right outside my door. She started to say hello to my grandmother and started heading towards her when i Yelled ""What do you think you're Doing?!?!"" and "" For the love of God go Home!"". She finally left but i know this isn't going to be the end of it.

My Fiance says I should just do something to scare her like acting like i'm going to chase her off or something but i feel like the only way that ends is with me with a prison sentence. But with this nonsense going on I got scared for My Grandma's health and it kind of slipped out.

175,Not the A-hole,"This story takes place over some time. My GF is the youngest of three siblings, the middle child is ""Jake"" (26m) and the eldest is ""Dan"" (30m). So last July me (21m) and my GF (21f) went to go visit her fam in their hometown for a couple reasons. It was my birthday, it was her mum's birthday a day after mine, and Jake was planning to propose to his girlfriend in that general time period, who's birthday was after my GF's mum's. Hectic time for sure. Me and my GF helped him pick out the ring, and Jake ended up proposing to her on her birthday and it was really good. Tears were shed, hugs were exchanged, the whole nine yards. It was great.

I wandered off to the side just taking everything in and I realized that Dan was looking kind of misty eyed. I was a little bit concerned so I asked if everything's ok and he said yeah. He then asked if he can tell me a secret. Bear in mind that this was my first time meeting her family so I was like hmmmm this is like the 2nd time im talking to you and you're already telling me secrets? But no I didn't say all that, I said sure go ahead. He said he's had a ring hidden away for his girlfriend for going on 10 months now. Bear in mind that he's been dating her for 9 years and she actually just gave birth a few months before this event. Naturally, I asked him what's stopping him from proposing, if he's scared or something else. He was quiet for a moment and he said well I think I'm actually gay. Crazy, right? 30 year old grown ass man telling a 21 year old dude he's never met before that he's gay before he tells his own family. Something rubbed me the wrong way about that, but I digress. He swore me to secrecy and I honoured his request, as hard as it was. Whenever I showed up to family events it was like only I could see this giant dark cloud hanging over them.

Fast forward all the way till today, where my GF was on a group FaceTime with her family in the office. I heard loud shrieks and WTF's and I nodded to myself because I thought the time had finally come. And it did. When she told me, I tried my damndest to act surprised like I didn't know all along but my girlfriend knows me better than anybody else except for my twin and she knows when I'm bullshitting. She casually brought it up and said that I didn't seem too surprised..I sighed and told her the truth. Now she's not quite pissed off at me, but she's disappointed (which I feel is somehow worse). She says that while she understands my need to keep a secret she said I should've confided in her, as this is something that concerns her and her family. She said she's also a tad bit suspicious that he chose to confide in ME over everyone else, as if I was in cahoots with him in some way. And most of all, she said I contributed to the deception of Dan's girlfriend (now ex I suppose). I accepted what she said but maintained that I had to keep a secret and I didn't want to out him to anyone, not even his own family.

AITA?

Edit: some people think I don’t care about Dan’s ex at all which is plain false because she’s obviously the one most affected by all this. I just never mentioned her because I mean it’s really obvious to anybody that has read this story that she’s probably the biggest victim of all, along with young master William who now has to grow up in a broken household. Some people have said I only think of women as objects and accusing me of “bro’s before hoes” and that’s a bit disappointing because I don’t know how you can say that when none of you know me in real life. Not to speak of the fact that that doesn’t make any sense because I barely know the guy and I’ve talked to him less then 10 times in my whole life and I don’t even have his phone number or follow him on any social media so he’s not my “bro”. I try my utmost best to treat every single individual that I meet with love and respect, which was the reason why I did this for Dan. Don’t get me wrong, I did not agree with his actions and what he did. I would have preferred that he a) did not give me this burden to carry or b) done something about it earlier. Now my relationship with many good people have been compromised because of that and..it hurts. It hurts, a lot.

176,Not the A-hole,"This happened about two years ago but I can't get it off my mind. I'm posting here because I keep second guessing if I did the right thing. I'm 21 now. Sorry for the grammar

I was brought to the psychward and didn't tell anyone where I was except three people: my mom and my two best friends. Nobody else knew. I was discharged with 3 new medications.

McCenzie and I are acquaintances, we've only hung out once 6ish months before with two of our mutuals. I found out she said ""I knew her in middle school but we didn't talk because I was popular and she wasn't"" before I got into the car from my friends. She just seemed mean, so our friendship went nowhere further than finsta. She had posted a lot about her dream job of being a psych nurse and how close she was to getting it. I believed that she worked in the actual unit at the time and found out later that she was just a dietary tech.

I got my phone the morning they discharged me and saw a dm from her(condensed for length)

""Hi love!!!! So I could definitely lose my job for this, but I think it’s worth it because I want you to know that I’m here for you. I saw you were in the psych unit.. I don’t know why you were up there..and it’s totally fine if you don’t want to tell me, but I want you to know that I am proud of you and I hope all is well.""

I didn't know what to do so I told her not to worry and that I wouldn't make her lose her job. I know now that she probably saw my name on a meal ticket or something, not that she had access to my records. I didn't really process what had happened at the time and just unadded her on finsta after.About a month later I mentioned that she messaged me to my mom and she told me to report her.

I didn't want to get in her line of fire but I had to do it. She knew it was me and I got another message. She told me that she got the information from a third source and now that I should have came to her first since now she would probably lose her job. McCenzie wouldn't tell me who told her. We got into a bit of a spat and it only got worse after she actually lost her job.

She posted my name on her finsta and told everyone that I was a bitch who made her lose her dream job. She shared our messages where she told me to go fuck myself repeatedly and that it was all my fault.

I ran out of my medications and couldn't go back to the hospital. I have a phobia of going to the doctor now. The medication really helped me but I can't go back. Its worse knowing that McCenzie got job quickly after at a different mental health facility. I feel I am the bitch who ruined things since she had no real access to my info that I know of. She was really beat up afterwards. I stood by my convictions then but still I feel like I did wrong.

TLDR: I made someone lose their job in psychiatry when she messaged me after my hospital stay.",99,275,0.94
177,Not the A-hole,"So first post here, a little context. I (21f) live with my parents since they agreed to pay for my schooling as long as I didn’t move out. They’re helicopter parents, and even went so far as to buy me a car as a bribe to stay local for college. I work part time as a ride operator at a theme park centered around plastic brick toys (since I’m a full time student), and while I don’t make nearly enough to be able to move out on this salary, I’m putting nearly all of it away into savings so I can move out. My parents have always been very overbearing, going so far as to demand access to my bank account so they can “monitor my spending”. When I first opened my current account at 18, I asked the banker if they would be able to take money out of my account, and she assured me that they would only be able to put money in.

Fast forward to today. I was helping my mom with laundry, and my dad brought up the stimulus check that he just received, and how he’s using it to pay off bills due this month. I made a comment about how it’s good that we’re going to be able to pay this month, because of reduced income. Then he hits me with the bombshell.

Dad: Oh I wasn’t really all that worried. If I needed the cash, I was just going to pull it out of your account.
Me: .......what?
Dad: Yeah, and the best part is you don’t even notice! I pay it back anyway. Eventually...
Me: That money is what I’m saving up to be able to move out once I graduate! When I started this job you said I should put it away and not touch it!
Dad: I said you shouldn’t touch it. Not that I wouldn’t. Besides, if you want to keep driving that car, and using that phone, you’ll have to just let me take it.

I got upset by this and refused to continue the conversation. While it’s true that my parents bought me the car, my dad did tell me that I would only be allowed to keep it if I kept living with them, and went to college for what they wanted. And my phone, well I didn’t see anything wrong with the old one I had that I paid for. The current one I have was supposedly a Christmas present. I do use the electricity and water and such in the house, but never have they indicated that I needed to pay my share in it. If they had I would have been understanding, if less enthused, but then I would at least have a baseline for what I’m paying them. So far I’ve seen charges on my account from them ranging from 200 dollars to 800 dollars, and doing the math on the deposits they make, I’m still several hundred dollars short. This would be fine if they would just charge me rent, but going behind my back like this feels like theft...

I haven’t brought it up to my parents since, but it really bothers me that they essentially consider my savings to be a resource for them to use since they can’t manage their money effectively. 

TLDR; my parents used and continue to use my moving out money to pay the family bills, AMITA for being upset with them about it?",122,333,0.93
178,Asshole,"I've been with my GF for 5 years and we recently had an anniversary. We did a huge thing and exchanged a bunch of presents. One of the presents I got her was a silver necklace from a game that I really enjoyed as a child and consider one of my favourite games.

My GF loved it when I gave it to her and kept saying how happy she was with it, she'd wear it almost every day. When she was out with her friends one of them remarked ""Oh, is that so and so's necklace from that game?"". She Googled it and saw it was the same and blew up on me.

So my dad recently passed away from cancer and in his will, he clearly stated that I am to inherit everything, and my 3 younger siblings get nothing, the reasoning behind my father's decision is because my siblings had cut contact from him when he divorced my mum, (it was a mutual divorce but my mum had manipulated them into thinking he had an affair) and only talked to him when they needed money, despite that he always sent texts trying to check in their lives but they wouldn’t respond.

My father had left a letter explaining that he was hurt and disappointed that they had left him and why they wouldn’t be receiving anything, his last wish to me was to ensure that I never gave a dime to my siblings.  So I don’t know if I should carry out with my father’s wish.

185,No A-holes here,"Hey everyone, so this happened tonight and I’m not really sure what to think.
So here we go, please bear with me:
When my daughter was born a few years ago one of the things my wife would do every night is sing a bedtime lullaby to our daughter that she made up. It goes like this:

Goodnight [insert daughters name] goodnight,

Sleep tight [insert daughters name] sleep tight,

All my love to you, all my love to you,

[repeat]

Goodnight goodnight again, sleep tight sleep tight and then, I’ll see you in the morning,
[repeat verse one again]


Well it has kind of become a nightly ritual for my wife and daughter when my wife puts our daughter to bed. Recently I have been putting our daughter to bed a bit more and she’s a little older so she asks for the bedtime song and she wants to sing along with it. So I modified the song by making it a little bit more uptempo from the rhythm my wife sings it at, and also repeated a few words more so my daughter could more easily catch on and sing it too. My version goes like this:

Goodnight [insert daughters name] goodnight, night, night

Sleep tight [insert daughters name] sleep tight, tight, tight

All my love to you, you, you, all my love to you, you, you,

[repeat]

Goodnight goodnight again, sleep tight sleep tight and then, I’ll see. you. in. the. morning,
[repeat verse one again]


I only changed my wife’s goodnight song a little bit. Yet tonight I was told by my wife I’m a giant dick for ruining her goodnight song with our daughter because our daughter likes my version of the lullaby song more. My wife is genuinely pissed and said I stole something away from her by changing her song. I didn’t mean to intentionally do that, I only changed the song so our daughter could more easily participate in singing the song at bedtime. So fellow Redditors AITA???",35,59,0.89
186,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I were together 3 years. We were engaged, and then I got pregnant. We'd discussed kids previously and agreed on 2 or 3 but since finding out my ex has said he doesn't want to be a father and, as the way I'm referring to him may suggest, he has ended our engagement, because I want to keep the baby. Apparently he'd hoped I'd change my mind and settle for a pet after we got married. 

I found out the gender about a month ago, and I picked out a first and middle name, both fairly ordinary (they're both in the top 100 most common boy names) so it's nothing weird, cruel or unusual, but I like the names, and I picked them both from things significant to me (one is a book I love, one is a song my dad used to sing to me when I was a baby). When people have asked I've told them what the name will be.

A lot of people have been asking about the name/gender so I decided to make a Facebook post a few hours ago saying that the baby's name is FirstName MiddleName Surname, and it's a boy, and I didn't think any more of it after that.

And then I get a message from my ex, saying he didn't like the name. I tell him that's not really my problem. Or his, seeing as he won't be involved. He then reminds me that the middle name is the same first name as a kid who bullied him in primary school (ages 5-11) and accuses me of choosing a name I knew he'd hate to get back at him for not being involved. I responded that I genuinely did not remember the name of one of the kids that bullied him (there were about 10), it's a common name and again, it shouldn't matter to him as he isn't involved.

Ex and I did discuss baby names while we were together, and we did have a list of names we liked, but when I was choosing my son's name I didn't want to refer to the list I'd made with my ex for obvious reasons. Ex did ask what happened to the list, and I said that was a list we made for the kids we were having together, not a child I was raising alone, and the list was entirely compromises I'd made, for example I'd suggested Aiden, he said he didn't like it but he'd accept Adam, I said I didn't like Adam but Adam ended up on the list and Aiden didn't.

Ex has replied to my post saying that I'm being vindictive by naming ""our"" child a name I knew ex had bad connotations with. Ex's family I'm linked to and some mutual friends have liked the comment and messaged me privately asking why I'd do this to the father of my child.

I've talked to a couple of my friends/family and I've been given advice ranging from take the post down to change the name, and it's the people who are on my side, not Ex's, who are still suggesting I change the name that are giving me pause, because there's quite a few of them and if they're suggesting a name change then I feel like I fucked up, but I genuinely didn't remember Ex had bad associations with this name and I still love the name.

AITA for picking/not changing the name despite the connotations the father has?

Info: the name my ex is objecting to is James as a middle name (not first name), and James was apparently the name of one of my Ex's childhood bullies. I have no intention of asking for child support or help in raising my son.",284,749,0.94

192,Asshole,"We don’t live together yet, but we will be moving in together in 4 years once I complete my doctorate degree. He knows I will be bringing my cat with me when we move in, and he knows my cat hates big dogs (my cat once sent me to the ER because a 40lb dog jumped up to say hello while I was holding my cat, and my cat climbed onto my face out of fear). And now my cat will be living with a 120lb Pyrenees in a few years. I do indeed want a big dog eventually, but I was hoping to get one as a pup (once I’m already living with my partner) so my cat wouldn’t feel threatened if he could witness the pup grow up into its full size. 

But my boyfriend impulsively kept a Pyrenees puppy given to his family, and he’s chosen to keep the puppy as his own without consulting me on my opinion. I understand I can’t tell him what to do since it’s his dog and his house (and perhaps it’s hypocritical of me since I have my own pet I’m looking out for), but I’m upset that he’s making this decision that will heavily affect me and my cat.

I’ve already offered to help puppy-proof my boyfriend’s house and help him find a vet to get started on scheduling a neuter, microchip, and vaccines.

193,Not the A-hole,"Hey all!

Posting from mobile so my apologies for any unfortunate formatting that may occur. Some quick background about my job. I work at a non profit that provides multiple services to individuals with disabilities in the community. I coordinate two programs and am a payroll supervisor. We recently switched to an electronic system and have had 6 months training on it before it went live. During the training period we hired another coordinator to ease my workload, and she received the same training on this system. Despite the fact that I trained this new coordinator on how my supervisor likes things done, and OPWDD regulations, she likes to freestyle and assures us all she knows what she’s doing (she doesn’t). This often results in my supervisor, coworkers, and herself coming to me asking for me to fix her mistakes in the system. Usually it’s minor stuff but it takes me away from my work, and my team who need me. My supervisor avoids confrontation like the plague and refuses to acknowledge she constantly messes up. He also hired another coordinator, who despite being trained and having experience in the field, also constantly messes up. A major part of my day is now correcting their mistakes, and reviewing their work at random to ensure they’re following regulations (at my supervisors request).

That brings us to today. 

My coworker frantically texted me saying the other coordinator made a major mistake in the system and can I fix it. I politely asked what the issue was as I was planning on using some PTO for the day. This coordinator mass uncompleted notes submitted by our other coworker. We use those notes to bill for our services. My own caseload can bring in +$40K on a good month after staff wages are deducted. This other coordinator uncompleted a month and a half’s worth of notes by my coworker. This is around 120 notes. By uncompleting them it removes the audit & approval history, and makes it eligible for billing again despite the fact that it was already billed for. We cannot double bill.

It’s a simple fix. She has to recomplete the notes in the system because they are still there, just marked uncompleted. They will be resent to billing by other people in our department after that. That’s it.

I informed my boss that she messed up, big time. He sounded really discouraged and as if he was absolutely dreading addressing it with her. Turns out he never did. He didn’t say anything to her because he thinks that by forcing my coworker to rewrite a month and a half’s worth of notes, billing won’t be messed up. The coordinator refuses to acknowledge that she did anything wrong, make any attempt to fix it, and has told my coworker it’s her fault the notes are gone. My coworker won’t say anything to our director because she shares an office with the coordinator and doesn’t want to cause problems with our supervisor.

AITA for not stepping in? I’m tired of being responsible for fixing my peers mistakes when they aren’t being held accountable for making them.",35,82,0.96
194,Not enough info,"In five months, I (21 f) am standing up for my brother’s fiancée (K) as a bridesmaid. His fiancée has been nothing but a pain in me and my whole family’s butts ever since she came into the picture. We have always gone out of our way to make K feel apart of our family. She however, goes out of her way to tear my brother away from our family. She constantly makes excuses of why they can’t go places, especially when it involves seeing his family. She doesn’t let him hangout with friends, drink alcohol, or do anything without her. (my brother doesn’t even have a bad history with this stuff). And if it involves her it has to be what she wants. Basically everything is her way or the highway. She forces him to live and breathe for her, but she very clearly only cares about herself. She has single handedly disrespected ALL of his family, yet she feels entitled to having our respect. We’ve all held our tongue, but I’ve had my limit. I can’t let my brother marry this monster knowing I did nothing to stop it. The only thing holding me back is the fear of her making him shut me out. I also fear my mom and whole family will freak out on me for backing out. I love my brother, but I can’t support his decision anymore. So WIBTA for backing out?

Edit: for more info. 
Some proof of her acting out of line is picking a fight with my brother, making a scene, and leaving a family function early. It happens at EVERY family gathering. 
She ruined our family’s thanksgiving by pouting the whole night. My brother told me she was upset because she felt left out. (Which wasn’t true we asked her to participate in everything and she said no).
She takes it as far as saying a coworker has the virus and telling him he has to quarantine with her. I proved her wrong by asking coworkers she works with, and when she was proven wrong she said “oh yeah they actually had strep”. 
I also don’t want to just “back out”. I want to talk to him and explain my feelings, but everyone in my family has expressed their concerns, and he validates them as well, but remains there with her.

My baby hasn't been sleeping very good the past few days. She's been colicky. This afternoon, i finally got her to nap while laying on my chest. My dad put left over pizza in the oven for himself for lunch. He said he was going to go shower and asked if I could get it out from the oven if the timer went off before he got out. I told him, ""No, I can't because I have the baby sleeping on me."" He hesitated, but then he said, ""I'll be out in time.""

He went to shower. He wasn't out in time and the timer went off. I called for him a few times but he didn't hear me. The baby woke up from me yelling for him but went back to sleep within a few moments. I did not get his pizza from the oven.

He came out about 5 minutes later. He was mad that the timer was going off. He asked me why I was letting it go off. I said that I told him I wasn't going to get it. He pulled his pizza out and it was kind of burned. Not black burned but it smelled a little toasty.

197,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) have been seeing therapist (B).

\-3/17 B emails that she is switching to teletherapy. Her email says ""Once you have registered for the site, we are good to go. You will receive an email with a link to your session at the session time."" I register.

\-3/25 is my next appointment. No link comes. I log into the system, see a ""No upcoming appointments"" message. I think I must have gotten the day wrong. 

\-3/31 I look at my calendar and realize I didn't get the date wrong. I must have to resetup my appointments. I email B to ask for an appointment.

\-4/6 No response. I email her again. B replies: ""I’m sorry - things have been nuts."" We schedule an appointment.

\-4/8 I get an email notification to remind me of the upcoming appointment, containing a link to the appointment. I do so at the appointed time, and things are normal.

\-4/13 I receive an email from B with an invoice for $50.  I email B to ask if there's been a mistake. B says it's for a no call no show on 3/25. Okay, I guess she thought there was an appointment. Weird that she didn't reach out to me about it, didn't mention it when I contacted her on how to reinstate my appointments. Clearly there was an issue with the system. I respond and explain the situation.

\-4/15 B responds ""I know it was a confusing time but everything was sent out before scheduled sessions and I have appointment reminders set up that would have sent that out as well."" 

I reiterate that I did **not** get any reminders and that there was no appointment listed in the system.

B says ""I understand your frustration, however you didn’t reach out and we didn’t have any contact about you asking about the appointment or cancelling it.""

I suppose that is fair. When I saw no appointment, I could have called. But it did not cross my mind that it was a system error, I assumed that I had messed up the date.

It is just over an hour before my next appointment, but I'm pissed off. I email that I don't think it's right to penalize me for an appointment that, based on all knowledge available to me, did not exist due to an error on her end. How can I miss an appointment that didn't exist? I acknowledge that I could have called but reiterate that I'm frustrated that she won't take any responsibility for the error on her end as well, and cancel my appointment, saying that I'm just not in the right headspace for it.

80 min later, I receive a new invoice with a $50 fee for late cancellation of my appointment. Fine. I cancelled late, that makes sense.

B emails: ""I am sorry you didn’t understand that standing appointments are indeed standing and that you were still expected to attend.""

If she had at least taken some responsibility for the system error, I may have just swallowed my pride and paid the $50. But now, I'm feeling like I don't want to work with her at all.

 My mom really doesn't support me other than the few times she's bought groceries and she thinks that's enough to claim me.

200,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure, I thought I was in the right but now I feel bad. 

I am an artist who often buys supplies and other things on Etsy. Generally, I like the platform, and given recent events, I think it's a good way to support local businesses.  It was my birthday recently and so a few weeks ago I decided to treat myself to something shiny. I found a matching ring and pendant set from a local seller on Etsy, and even though it was a bit pricey, I've been fortunate enough to continue working at home and figured why not. 

The package arrived quickly but when I opened it I quickly became disappointed.  Inside the envelope, the packaging for a nearly $500 set was two smaller dented and roughed up cardboard boxes with no lids taped to the same piece of paper. The large stones in the pendant and rings themselves were covered in chips and scratches the seller had not disclosed or made visible in any photos, so I left an honest review of 3/5 stars. In the review, I cited the above factors but also included that I thought the pieces were beautiful and that overall I was happy with them. I thought that was fair, and I tried to use polite language without value words to try to be unbiased. 

Within an hour I received an extremely rude message from the seller in response to my review, calling me ""nasty"" and ""mean"" for my review. In return for my two sentence review, I got a whole page full name-calling and a statement saying they had free shipping so I had no right to complain.

I didn't reply to the message, I simply took a screenshot of it and my review, and filed a complaint with Etsy. Whether or not Etsy will do anything about it, I don't know, but I thought they should know that sellers are using their platform to harass customers. For the record, I don't want a refund, I wasn't looking to refund the damaged products, I just don't want the seller to think it's okay to talk to people like that every time they receive a mediocre review. 

I pressed send without a whole lot hesitation, and now I'm beginning to feel about guilty about reporting them. After all, I understand why someone would be stressed given the current world events, and maybe they were just having a bad day.

203,Not the A-hole,"So, I’m a high school senior and planning to attend college next year. 

For context, my mom and I have a really terrible relationship. She struggles with ADD and I’ve had a lot of just shitty things happen to me growing up, so we’ve always butted heads. Even tiny disagreements turn into full-fledged warzones is where we scream the most hurtful insults possible at each other. We each avoid each other for the next couple days and then pretend that nothing happened. 

Back in January, I was applying to colleges and she was harassing me that she wanted to review my essays. My best friend’s mom is an English teacher, and I wanted to have her review it and leave my mom out of it, because I knew how it would probably end - fighting. My mom, however, had watched probably a year’s worth of college admission videos on YouTube and considered herself an expert who could tell me what I needed. I grudgingly let her read them, and as I expected, it turned into a whole “You don’t stand a chance getting in. You shouldn’t even turn in this garbage” etc etc. I got upset, we yelled at each other, and I locked myself in my room and turned them in anyway. 

Later I get an email confirming an application that I never submitted. I confronted my mom about it, and she said I was too busy being angry and I wouldn’t have listened to her anyway, and that day was the deadline. This application was through the CommonApp, meaning she wrote up an essay in my name and signed an agreement that I was the person applying. I got extremely angry and didn’t talk to her for a while. Later she actually apologized, saying she went out of bounds by pretending to be me and not even telling me about the school to let me decide for myself. 

Flash forward to today, I got another confirmation email for a scholarship application.  I saw she had emailed the organization and pretended to be me, saying “I am a high school senior, thank you so much for this opportunity,” etc etc. This isn’t the same level as applying to a college, but I instantly just shut down and locked myself in my room. She keeps yelling through the door about how I was never going to do it anyway, it’s for my own good, I’m lazy and she’s doing the legwork for me to succeed. 

In the past, she used to make me to keep my phone in the kitchen at night, and if my friends ever texted me, she would respond pretending to be me. Her justification for me keeping my phone out was so I didn’t stay up all night playing on it. But when I changed my password so that she couldn’t go through it anymore, she got angry, saying she bought the phone so she can do whatever she wants with it. 

I’m torn because she has ADD, I don’t know how much is in her control. She refuses to get medication refills, so she’s off her meds right now. Also she is technically helping me, applying to a college and helping me get a scholarship. I’m just so angry that she’s going behind my back and doing it for me. AITA here?

Sarah will eat something without problem and say she loved it and then next time we have it she says she can't eat it, she can't even try, it'll make her sick. But, strange enough, this happens after she's told what we're having and she says she wants something else. Strange. A couple of examples:

a while ago she ordered this expensive sushi dish and loved it, said it was her new favorite meal. Next time we ordered it for her she took one bite, said something was ""off"" about it and refused to eat it. We asked her what was wrong, she said there was a lump in the guacamole and now she was sick and couldn't eat it. It was literally a chunk of avocado. My wife can't eat raw fish and I hate sushi so we ended up throwing it out since Sarah refused to eat it and no one else could.

Then, a while after, we went to this rally expensive seafood restaurant. There was this Asian seafood soup she decided to order. It wasn't a regular seafood soup, rather, it had unusual seafood. Honestly, the photo of it was disgusting but Sarah said she'd tried something similar another time and loved it. I said fine, but she wasn't getting anything else if it came and she ""couldn't eat it"", and she could only have a cup to start because the bowl was nearly $30 and the cup was $17. She agreed and of course when it came she said she couldn't even try to eat it, she had a ""mental block"". I reminded her of our deal and she started to throw a fit, said we were horrible parents, we were disrespecting her food aversions, not taking her seriously, it was her right to have something else. I told her tough and that she could either eat her soup or wait until we got home to have a sandwich. My wife agreed with me and Sarah ended up making a sandwich at home.

We have Sarah seeing a therapist (aka; psychiatrist) who has diagnosed her with hypochondria and suspected Factitious Disorder. Basically she wants to have an illness and believes she has them. She's an otherwise healthy 15 year old girl. She's continuing treatment. Her therapist says not to indulge her disorders or she'll never learn to sooth and cope. I've spoken to some friends, one of whom is a pediatrician, who says we should be indulging her so she feels supported and cared for. A couple of our friends say we're bad parents for not taking her seriously. Sarah, herself, says she feels like we don't love her because we don't take her seriously. We've never made fun of her for her disorders, we do sometimes express frustrations, seeing as we're human and Sarah throws a fit when she doesn't get what she wants.

I like investing and trading. I've traded and invested since I started my first job out of the college and thanks to the huge bull market we have had in the last 10 years, I've made a killing and I'm comfortable in my finances. Not so much in the 7 figures yet but enough to comfortably pay my rent (probably people will ask why I don't have a house, it's because I think there are better and more liquid investments that I could go for with the money I have so I prefer to pay rent) and do whatever I want or quit my job for 4-5 years without changing my lifestyle one bit.

210,Not the A-hole,"So some background information, I (21F) grew up in a very conservative Christian household in the south (like private school, church 3x a week Christian) and I came to realize I was bi at 14. Obviously, I never felt safe coming out while in high school (I would have been kicked out of school) and then was forced into going to the Christian college in my hometown where my parents work, where I could still not come out, except for to a few very close, trusted friends and my older sister. 

I have since moved out, transferred schools, and no longer have any real contact with anyone from my past, let alone my parents, and it's really bothering me to still be in the closet. I have always struggled with feeling of fear, self-loathing, and authenticity about my identity and the fact that I was keeping something that is so fundamental about myself a secret, and I would really like to publicly come out over social media. The reason I want to have a ""mass"" coming out is that my family is very scattered and I don't know when the next time I'll be seeing many of them, so if I were to wait to come out until I could tell everyone in person, I would likely be waiting several more years, and I would like to use this as an opportunity to remove all the bigoted people in my life in one fell swoop. I've dealt with shame and fear for too long to allow anyone in my life for any reason who can't at least be okay with (if not support) who I am.

The reason I think this may make me an asshole is that it would be a massive shock to my entire conservative Christian family and a matter of ""shame"" to my parents. However, I feel somewhat justified in coming out however I want because a) it's my life; b) my parents wouldn't take it well no matter how I told them (they've said they would rather me be heterosexual and dead than homosexual and alive in the past when this sort of topic has come up in the past); and c) I no longer have any contact with my parents and I don't want to give them any kind of false hope that I've ""seen the error of my non-Christlike ways"" and am coming back home.

Firstly,  I'm a guy,  26, who tries to have the healthiest life style I can.  I also make a good amount of money and can buy the natural lotions and skin care/bath care products I can get. These aren't cheap and when I do get them I make sure I use them smartly and make them last. 

My roommate and I get along great, she doesn't touch my things in the bathroom and I don't touch hers. She has her own shelf,  I have mine.  She does have a friend who comes over sometimes who is a self proclaimed beauty guru who does reviews on line to her 500 followers. But doesn't have a job and 'borrows' products from her friends. 

A few months ago she came over, and I had just gone to my room to get dressed,  products left on the tub bench, and I hear her in the bathroom practically squealing ""girl you got the good stuff! Let me use it, my followers will love it!""

I hear my roommate say no that it's not hers and the friend just says quietly that she'll use it when I go to work. After I get out of my room to head to work I immediately get my products put them in my room and listen to her start to do her show in our living room,  stating what products she's about to get to which I say loudly. 

""No you're not, I bought them, if you want them then get a job and buy them."" I then locked them in my room and since then she's told me how she lost followers, got mocked for trying to steal and was sobbing in her live stream.

212,No A-holes here,"I grew up in the slums of a very poor and disorganized country. I had two friends who I'll call Lara and Yasha. Lara took a long time to come home one night when she was 13, and 9 months later, she died in childbirth. I ended up taking the baby to a local hospital, but they refused to take the child into care unless I signed to being the mother. I did, and the child was then adopted by an American family. 

Yasha and I ended up also getting out, and now also live in America. We are now married, and I cannot have children, not that we want them. We've thought about Lara's child often. 

My opinions on what to say if the child ever tracked me down have varied over the years. At first, Yasha and I wanted to make a happier story for the kid and tell them that we were their biological parents, but that falls apart with these new DNA kits. So we decided to make up a happier version of the truth and say that Lara had been 17, had fallen in love with a local boy, and died in childbirth (and then I had to put my name on the paper to get the child adopted out). We have no paperwork for Lara as she was essentially an orphan and had made up her last name, so there's nothing I could show either way. Just a few group pictures with her in them.

The truth is that this person's father is gutter trash, and I doubt he would line up to take a DNA test. They will never realistically have any more information than what I tell them, they could only prove that we weren't their parents. We don't really like to talk about our childhoods, and we don't feel that Lara would want her/our trauma projected on a kid that would have had a normal, American life.

The adoptive parents have found us, and we gave the sanitized story, which they believed, but some of our friends think we should tell the truth.",153,519,0.94
213,Not the A-hole,"So, yesterday I texted my ex about how we wanted to go about splitting the $500 stimulus money for our son. My reason for the text was so we could have a plan in place - if I got it, I would give him $250 and vice versa. No big deal... I thought. 

His fiancée texted me about 20 minutes later saying: “Hey, I don’t know or understand what compels you to do the things you do or be the way you are, but in 4 years I’ve never seen a “thank you for paying for and raising my son and being there for him and me all his life, I really appreciate you.” (Ex) has paid you child support, fixed things and went and picked things up for you and delivered them to your house, picked (son) up AND dropped him off EVERY damn time we’ve gotten him, and I have never seen a thank you or even just a little appreciation for a man who stepped up for you and your son. A little respect and compassion for someone who deserves it more than anyone would be appreciated. NOT, “hey, we splitting the stimulus money”.   THAT IRKED THE SHIT OUT OF ME. Come on, be a respectable woman. That was ridiculous. Have some respect for my fiancé. He has done more for you than you deserve, and you know it. Don’t you treat him like that.”

I tried to call her to straighten things out, but she did not accept my call. She did, however, send several more texts basically spewing the same thing. 

A little background knowledge:
•My ex adopted my son, so he is legally his father.
•He pays $50 per week in child support (I agreed to this lower amount, so no big deal).
•My ex picks him up on the way home from work, and I’ve offered to pick/up drop off several times. Sometimes he accepts, most of the time he declines.
•I offered my ex $50 for delivering the chair I purchased. He declined.

When I confronted my ex about the texts and accusations, he agreed that it was out of line and he’d talk to his fiancée. However, when she returned home, he texted me that he wasn’t getting in the middle of this drama and he’d only be communicating through our son. 

I’m trying to look at this objectively and see her point of view, but I can’t wrap my mind around this hostility. Help me out - Am I an asshole for not saying thank you all the time or asking about the stimulus money?",67,82,0.86
214,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying that now, several hours later I do feel like an asshole. 

Anyway, so today I was out running in the woods close to where I live. I came up behind a man out walking with his dog, the dog wasnt in a leash and was walking several meters behind the guy. The dog saw me and ran towarda his owner. The guy still had not heard or seen me, not wanting to scare him I cleared my throat so he would hear me before passing him.

So I passed him and after running a couple of meters I heard him shouting and then felt something grab my leg, I spun around and screamed ""what the fuck are you doing"" the man looked sheepish, but I kept screaming at him, ""if you cant control your dog, keep it on a leash, for fuck sake"". Now guys you should have heard me, my screaming was loud and more ""powerful"" than I ever thought possible. I guess I got scared when the dog gnawed at me.

Now that I have calmed down I feel bad, I mean I have a dog myself and I know sometimes they just dont listen. But at the same time I feel like a was a little bit in the right for getting angry and lashing out at the guy.

216,Not the A-hole,"
I’ll try to keep this simple. I (23M) have been dating (23F) for about 5 months now, and our relationship has been official/public for most of that time. She is extremely supportive, generous, and I think, a great girlfriend overall. I am not a big social media user, but my she loves Twitter. I don’t have Twitter, but as she spends hours on it everyday, I got curious and decided to look her up. Sort of teasing, I asked what her username was, and she said, “Are you looking me up? Don’t look at my Twitter.” I assumed she was being lighthearted in turn and just teasing. Well, I managed to find her handle and after about 5 minutes she made her account private. 

Now, I try not to be sensitive, but I admit I was a little hurt. I didn’t realize she was being so serious about this. I asked her if I was going to see something offensive, she said no. I asked if she was doing things she didn’t want me to see, she said no (which is obviously paradoxical). 

Her position is that Twitter is “her space.” I replied that no, it’s actually the most public space you can get, which is why I’m confused that she doesn’t want her BOYFRIEND to see what she’s doing. 

We are at the point in our relationship where we’ve talked about our past. I know she has met/sexted guys via Twitter. I understand that everyone has a past, and everyone has a right to privacy, but this just feels icky to me. I am still fairly new to the relationship thing, and I am genuinely not trying to have trust issues here, but to me this feels like a red flag. My girlfriend seems to think I am making a big deal out of nothing. AITA? Do I just need to chill out?",53,65,0.86

219,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because friends/family know my main.

My husband and I have been together for about 8 years. When we met, I was 19, 5'5, and weighed 125 lbs. Over our time together, I have put on weight. While I was in college and grad school, I gained a total of 50 pounds, which I know is a lot. I admittedly don't handle stress well, and eat a lot when stressed.  I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but there was a period of a few month in college when I first started gaining where I would feel extremely guilty after I ate and throw up. 

I have been trying to lose weight for a couple of years and it always goes the same way. I do well for awhile and then eventually my schedule gets thrown off and it gets difficult to keep up with my diet and exercise, so I let it go for a few days, and then the next thing I know, it's been 3 months and I've gained back every pound. So lately, I've asked my husband to help out in small ways. Going on walks with me, exercising with me at home, etc. The only thing I've asked for help with as far as my eating is that I'm usually up late and will start craving around 11, so I asked him to remind me not to snack at night.

Today, I made myself lunch: a sandwich with a handful of chips on the side. I went and sat next to him with my plate, and he immediately reached for the chips. I assumed he just wanted one, but instead he held the chip an inch or two in front of my face and half-yelled, ""What is this?"" a couple of times. I turned my head away, and he moved it so it was in front of my face again and did the ""What is this?"" a couple more times. I recognized this as the same thing he does when our dog gets into the garbage. 

I felt instantly felt completely humiliated and disgusted with myself for eating the chips. I started to tear up, and when I looked down at my plate, I felt nauseous. I asked him if he wanted the food, and he said no. So I got up, threw my plate in the trash, and walked out to go do some work in another room. He called after me that he had just been asking what kind of chips I had. I just ignored him went into the other room. A few minutes later, he came in and leaned in to kiss me, and I turned my head away and said I was busy. He just said ""fine"", and went into the bedroom and closed the door, which he only does when he's mad.

220,Not the A-hole,"My favorite aunt passed away two years ago after a long illness. She was my godmother; I gave the eulogy at her funeral. She was my mom's sister and BFF. The 3 of us were the only girls in the family for about 20 years and did everything together: day trips, vacations, shopping, cooking. Her death hit me (49F) hard. She had two sons, one married with small children, the other, a bachelor who was very, very close to his mom. Too close? Maybe.

Growing up, my aunt had one of those cheesy lighted Christmas trees with the little bulbs. Maybe 35 years ago I said to her ""Aunt, when you die, can I have your tree?"". This became a running family joke. Every Christmas, which was always celebrated at her house, she'd say ""When I die OP gets my tree."" or ""I moved 'your' tree to a new place this year"". Everyone. E V E R Y O N E in the family knew it was \*my tree\*.

When she was dying - she knew it, we all knew it - she said to me in front of a room full of people, ""Don't forget about your tree."" Me: ""I would NEVER forget about my tree!"" and ""Oh stop, you'll be home for Christmas and you'll put it up as usual.""

Of course, she never came home.

*\*side note: My mom also spent every day, not once in a while,* **every day** *like it was her job, at the hospital with her sister. She bought her comfy clothes, she washed her hair in the sink, she put on makeup for her, she made her favorite foods and snuck them in. She would be at the hospital for 12 hours a day. She did this for over a YEAR. I don't want anyone thinking this is about money! This is about loving your family.*

Fast-forward to my mom and I cleaning out her room, going through her things to donate. 

We're done for the day, emotionally drained after going through my aunt's clothing, medicines, toiletries to toss or donate. It was rough. The bachelor son shows up when we're finished.  

Me: ""Hey, do you know where my tree is?"". Cousin: ""Yeah, about that. I'm keeping it."" 

I was floored. My chest still gets tight when I think about it. So casual. So careless.

And he did. He kept it and has never said another word about it.

We were a close family; we still do holidays and dinners together, even though everyone is married and has older kids. I see this cousin all the time. I get it. It was HIS MOTHER. I still have my mother; he has a tree. 

**AITA** for wanting to say ""Give me my tree! You're not the only one who suffered a loss! You got EVERYTHING ELSE. You deserve EVERYTHING ELSE. But not my tree. She wanted me to have it. You went against her and you should be ashamed."" 

It would be the end of our current family dynamic. The only reason I haven't said anything yet, is because I don't want to hurt my mother. Two frigging years later and I still want my tree. My ugly, gaudy, use-it-once-a-year tree. Because it's mine. Because it was hers.",39,119,0.93
221,Not the A-hole,"Yes. I know the title sounds douchey, and this is might be really cruel but... if I was certain then I wouldn’t be here. I really need some help. 

Me (22F) and my husband (30M) have been really struggling with weight loss lately. We’re both in the military and we have to keep within certain weight standards to keep our jobs. We both know exactly the problem is what and how much we eat. Basically, we’re trying to cut. 

I’ve been doing okay with it, since I don’t really snack after filling our house with gross veggie chips and a lot of fruits/veggies. I’ve actually started to slowly lose some weight and I’m really glad for it! My husband, on the other hand, has really been struggling with food addiction. It’s starting to get frustrating since I’ll meal prep to last the week only to find a majority of it is gone by the end of day two. For example, I bought two bags of that SmartFood popcorn as a light snack to go with packed lunches, but two days after buying these bags, they were completely gone (and I KNOW I only ate a couple handfuls). It also happens when cooking dinner. By the time I’m finishing my one plate, he’s already halfway through his third. Sometimes, he tries to sneak more food while I’m not looking by eating it in the kitchen while I’m out at the table. 

He’s gotten so bad, he’s plowing through foods I’ve told him not to eat (foods I buy for special reasons at work or ingredients to a meal), snack foods don’t exist because he just keeps eating them, and, worse, he’s always complaining about gaining a pound every week and how he could possibly lose his career. 

I’ve tried just about everything: setting a minimum time limit before being able to go up for a second helping, filling his plate up with veggies, only cooking so much, etc. 

It’s super frustrating and I’ve gotten to a point of spending $200 every week trying to keep our fridge stocked. I can’t afford to keep up, and with the way things are now, it’s not safe for me to go out grocery shopping every week. 

So recently I started... yelling at him when he goes for seconds. Nothing like screeching. More like a loud, “Stop,” and making him put back whatever he’s got on his plate or in his hand. I won’t stop him from getting more food if he’s still hungry, but it has to be the veggie portion if he wants more. Some people have said I’m an AH for doing so, but... he just won’t stop and we can’t afford for him to keep going. He’s eating a hole on my wallet!

I’ve told him what’s going on, and he’s told me he knows he has a problem and he needs to stop, but just can’t help himself. 

So AITA? And are there any better ways to keep him from eating our entire food stock or helping to kick his food addiction? I really need some help and I don’t know what to do.",54,120,0.89

225,No A-holes here,"I am fine with all the nurses at the doctor's except one. In my opinion for someone who works with kids she doesn't have a great bedside manner, and she's incredibly slow when it comes to giving shots. 

The other nurses will sing and joke with him, they'll be gentle when lying him down to measure him, etc. They get him laughing and generally do their best to help keep him calm, along with my husband and me. When it comes to vaccines they're usually so quick about it that they're done before he even gets to let out his first cry, and they spend and extra minute to make him laugh before we leave. I think this makes the experience good for everyone, especially since my son is entirely non-verbal and prone to more metldowns than average (he's thought to be on the spectrum abd we're on the waitlist to have him screened and get the appropriate help.) 

This one particular nurse isn't like this at all. She's not gentle, very matter of fact, and she does each shot slowly 30seconds to a minute apart.She basically just ignores him as she moves him around.

Now the bedside manner is obviously a preference. I know not everyone is happy or is willing to spend extra time to make kids laugh, but it does bother me. It makes it hard for just my husband and I to keep my son calm during everything. But I know you meet people you just don't mesh with, so if it was just this I'd let it go. 

What really bothers me is the shots. I think 30 seconds to a minute inbetween each shot is just cruel, each slow shot makes my son more and more upset to the point where he's inconsolable and he'll be crying even as we're carrying him out to the car. This never happens with the others, they're so quick he cries for a minute or two and then he's okay and we're on our way off. And once she's done she just leaves, no real goodbye or anything. 

So after the second time we've had that nurse (we've been going here since my son was a newborn he's now 18months) I've been politely asking for a different one at the front desk. They let you pick which doctor to see, so I thought politely asking for a different nurse would be similar. I didn't think I was wrong for doing this, but last time we were there, while we were in a room waiting for the doctor, I heard the nurse complaining about how we specifically ask for another nurse whenever we have her assigned to us, but we don't ask to switch when it's another nurse. She sounded really offended and irritated by it. A friend also told me I was TA because nurseres are overworked and I should just let it go. 

For me I just think I'm doing what's right to make my son/family comfortable and I didn't think it was a big deal, no one else made it seem like one, the office didnt even ask why i wanted to switch. But now I'm not sure that it's appropriate for me to have done, or maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I also thought it was unprofessional to have her complain where patients could hear as well.

Edit: I just wanted to make a few things clear that some people seemed confused about. This isn't a hospital unit, it's just a pediatricians office. I don't ask for a new nurse every single time, I have only been assigned this nurse again maybe three times after the initial 2 appointments with her, and it's only this nurse I have no issue with any other nurse. My son is 18 months old and special needs, he's entirely nonverbal, has sensory issues, and we're currently on the waitlist for an evaluation for him because it's strongly beleived he may be on the spectrum /have other things. This is why I'm more sensitive to the bedside manner and shots, than if he were not special needs. 

His meltdowns when this nurse gives him his shots last 20+ minutes full of thrashing, flailing, scratching, screaming, etc. It makes it hard to hold him still for her to finish too. 

And I also agree with everyone who said I should've asked them to note it in his file, or called ahead vs asking at the appointment. So I've done that today, I called and explained the situation, and explained how I overheard the nurse as well. They were very kind about it and told me they'd make a note in my file so I don't have to keep asking.",151,424,0.94

It's not the amount of time that's absurd, but rather the fact that I can't eat whenever the hell I want to eat in my home. Usually when it comes to food I just eat whenever I want to because I'm personally someone who doesn't mind being hungry for awhile and only eat when I REALLY need to. Additionally I hate eating breakfast, I've just always hated eating in the morning cause I never really have an appetite so early in the morning. I understand the old ""My house, My rules"" bullshit argument, but I'm 17 years old and I think its stupid that my parents have authority over my eating habits.

228,Not the A-hole,"So this all happened before the world went to hell in a handbag but since he keeps bringing it up and saying I was the AH I am wondering if maybe I was in the wrong here. 

So we were on a 4-hour road trip up from CA to Las Vegas. And admittedly I have a tiny bladder I also have what's called Spina Bifida Occulta which causes issues with my bladder. Basically, my bladder doesn't tell my brain I have to go until I REALLY have to go, like on the verge of pissing my pants. I could write a whole other post on how I used to be punished as a kid for wetting myself or my bed because no one bothered to find out why until I was 15 y/o. So it suffices to say it's an embarrassing thing for me that triggers a lot of bad memories. But I've done things since my diagnosis to improve it such as Kegels but even with those sometimes I still don't know until it's an emergency. I do however try to negate this by making frequent trips to the bathroom. 

Now my BF knows all about my diagnosis and he knows how it affects me. But apparently knowing about it and understanding are two different things. During our trip, I kept asking him to make a stop because I even though I didn't feel I needed to go get it's better safe than sorry. He kept saying no because we were making the good time he didn't want to stop just yet and telling me to hold it. That when I really felt the urge he would stop.

Well after an hour of the waiting game and me begging him to stop the urge finally hit me I was at the point I needed to go NOW! But we were in the middle of nowhere and he didn't just want to pull over on the side of the road. I told him either pull over or I'm going to go in the car. Well, I guess he didn't think I was serious because he didn't. So I emptied put the Gatorade bottle I had and said: ""fuck it I'm going now if you pervs want to watch go ahead I don't care."" I shimmied down my pants and peed into the bottle whilst he and his friends looked on commenting on how nasty and unclean I was being. (I keep baby wipes in my car so I did wipe with those, I also didn't spill any). 

We finally pull over and I threw away the bottle went into the bathroom to wash my hands even though I had already used baby wipes on them. But when I came out he started laying into me saying how I had ""exposed"" myself to his friends and they had seen something only he should. 

Considering the angle I was at there was no way they saw anything other than the top area. I told him it was his fault and he was the AH if he had just pulled over I wouldn't have had to resort to peeing in the car. I mean what did he want me to do hang my ass out the window or pee myself? So Reddit helps us once and for all settle this debate was ITA?

Ok because everyone keeps asking lol...

I didn't spill because of a few reasons. 1.) Because I've done Kegels every day of my life since I was 15 to strengthen the muscles in order to help prevent accidents from having Spina Bifida Occulta. So you could safely say I have excellent control down there that I can keep from having an accident due to sneezing or coughing, or even laughing too hard. 2.) I have to take a lot of piss tests for the field I work in so you either learn to go perfectly in the cup or end up with piss on your hands every time. And 3.) Keeping your pelvic floor as horizontal as possible when peeing into a cup or Gatorade bottle while pressing it firmly to yourself is also part of the trick to doing it.",612,3349,0.96
229,Not the A-hole,"Ordered two wedding dresses - both of which I loved and want for my wedding. I ordered them to my moms house because I live in the city and was worried about them being stolen. 

On Sunday the three of us were talking (sister next to me and mom on speakerphone) about it arriving this week since tracking said it was coming. We ALL agreed nobody tries on the dresses as my mom says it’s bad juju and I mean, I think it’s flat out inappropriate for anyone but me to put on my dress - I don’t want anyone in my wedding dress lol.

Why the fuck is she trying on my dress after we LITERALLY just agreed nobody tries on the dress? I cannot wrap my head around why either of them would do this? Why would my mom even ask and why would my sister say yes? 

However, they’re trying to frame it as if they were “helping me” because the dress didn’t look right so they wanted to check it out. It looked too small and after putting it on, I can’t wear it anyway so they’ve saved me the trouble. WTF. I don’t think that’s the point and this is a horrible plea at self preservation. I am absolutely furious because I feel that they robbed me of that decision to make myself. They keep saying the other one is nicer - I DONT CARE LET ME DECIDE THAT.

230,Asshole,"When I was scrolling through the Progressive mobile app, I noticed that our renters insurance policy was grayed out. Out of my own curiosity, I clicked the insurance button. It said we were covered from September of 2019 to September of 2020. I didn't think much of it after that, but I was still curious, so I decided to click a few of the tabs getting information about the policy it would take me to the website it said my policy can't be reached. So i called the provider, when I gave them my policy information and a few other security things, they told me that my renter's insurance was canceled in January of 2020. I found out that this was due to missing payments. I was then transferred to someone that could write us a new insurance policy.

This is where the whole situation starts to enter the fray.

As I'm on the phone with a new underwriter, he's asking me all the information about the apartment the date it was made, if it was recently renovated or not, how many apartments were in the building stuff for their own information. As I was going over this with him I realized in order for us to even live here, we had to have a mandatory minimum insurance policy of $100,000. My significant other and I, we put all of our money together in One bank account and because I was on the phone I had no way to access the bank accounts without hanging up on the underwriter, so I texted my significant other and the message was and I quote:

""-----, put the stimulus money on the red card right now. This isn't an impulse thing. You need to do this now. I'll call you when everything is done on my end. Thia is very serious, I am on the phone so you can not call me.""

 She responded in about a minute saying her stimulus money was on the card, after I found that information out I went through and went ahead and set up our insurance. $100 initial payment and then $33 every month. I don't like spending a lot of money instantly like that. I wouldn't have made it such an urgent thing, if I didn't just spend about $400 on insurance for our vehicles.

After I get off the phone, I immediately call her, and she starts going off on me because I wouldn't contact her (due to me being on the phone with the underwriter). I let her talk for about 5-10 seconds, and then I let her know everything that was going on. We had no renter's insurance at all, that we could have gotten in a bad situation if something were to happen to our appartment. We didn't have insurance to pay for or protect our well-being, animals, and personal items.

She immediately starts yelling at me and screaming at me that she is at work that I can't do stuff like that to her. It's not even that important at all, and then before she hangs up the phone on me the last thing that she says to me is: 

"" you know I really feel like you're doing this on purpose just to scare me.""

231,Asshole,"GF and I were talking and she wants to get on Birth Control to help with her cramps, which I was iffy about because of the effects it can have on her body (hormonal changes, lower libido, lack of natural lubrication, weight gain, etc). I pretty much condensed it down to it's your choice, but consider my input and keep me in the know. To which she argued it's her body and I shouldn't be part of that decision. I told her that if that's her point of view, then by that logic, whether I wear a condom or not should by my choice and she shouldn't have to part in it because it's my body.

Anyways, AITA for wanting to be in the loop?

**Edit:** I'm seeing several interesting points of view, but to clarify, I did look over the positives and negatives of BC although I'm only stating the negatives. 

And regarding a lower libido, I know it can go the other way and result in a higher one as well (which I have no issue with), I just want her to look at both sides of the coin. Sex affects both of us and is an important part of our relationship (although not a primary focus, it's a small important part).

**Edit 2:** I'll show her this post and see how she feels about it, I just wanted to see other people's take on this, I appreciate the input as I'm sure she will as well.",210,115,0.72
232,Not the A-hole,"For context, he (23m) isn’t playing for me (23f) specifically, just playing because it’s his hobby.  A few hours a day and it’s not generally popular music, usually songs from games or films and 9 times out of 10 they are what I would call ‘Cowboy Themed’.  He also does the singing in the appropriate accent for the song (we are English).

We live in a very small flat, our kitchen and living room are one and the only other rooms are the loo and bedroom.  He plays in the living room and when he starts I tend to get up and go and sit in the bedroom.  The reason for this is because it’s not really the type of music that I like, and he does it LOUD.  It’s very overpowering to be in the same room as.

He’s recently mentioned that he thinks it’s rude for me to leave and that I should stay and listen.  I thought this was a bit uncalled for, especially considering I don’t even put the tv volume above 15 if it’s something only I’m watching and he’s in the room, and I’ve also watched a video on my phone with sound out loud (not through headphones) precisely once during the time we’ve lived together while we’ve been in the same room, and he asked me to mute it within 30 seconds of it being on because ‘the woman’s voice is annoying’ which I did immediately.  I generally make an effort to not be overly loud when doing anything with others present as I was raised that this is rude.

234,Asshole,"I’m 37F. My cousin, 32M, is getting married to his girlfriend, 28F. They’ve known each other for over a decade and have been dating on and off. He’s always been infatuated with her and worships the ground she walks on but the feeling is not mutual. She was married once at 24 but then her husband died a few months later. This is not common knowledge among my extended family members. 

Afterwards she went back to my cousin and settled for him as her second choice. I know I sound bitter, and it’s because I am—I do not think my cousin should marry her. He should marry someone who loves him and regards him as her first choice. He could literally get any woman he wants, too, but decides to go for this girl who only gets with him when its convenient for her.

But anyways. It’s obscene how much money is being spent on this wedding. My cousin’s family is rich and his stepmom is throwing tons of $$$ to make sure that they have the wedding of their dreams. The fiancée dragged me to a dress fitting (even though Im not one of the bridesmaids) and her dress is this fancy ballgown and she’s wearing a cathedral length veil like she’s some virginal bride or something. 

Yesterday at brunch with my family (the fiancée was not present), one of my aunts said that since I was recently married, I should “coach her” on bridal basics like how to walk down the aisle or how to pose for photographs. I was annoyed by this and replied “Its not like its her first time.” Well a majority of the people at the table did not know that she was married before. I explained that she was widowed at 24.

Later I got a text from the fiancee who was upset at me for telling our extended family that she was a widow. Apparently my aunt had messaged her saying that she was “sorry” for her loss and complimented her on giving love another chance.

I asked her what the big deal was. I mean, its not like she or my cousin ever told me to keep it a secret. And besides, my cousin’s brothers know too and its not like they never told anybody. I also don’t get how its something to be ashamed of? Like its not like she was divorced...theres way less stigma. AITA? She’s being overly dramatic and overreacting.",282,806,0.88

So my (16F)  mom has been dating this man for maybe about four years now he has two kids of his own while my mom has three. We all moved in together over spring break and we’re all been staying  together since. Now for the past week i've been playing this game that requires me to stay up late as a result i end up sleeping throughout the day only waking up when my alarms go off and even then i’m on my phone. This isn’t new to my brothers or my mom since i've been playing this game during the summer or long breaks since it came it out. 

Yesterday my mom caught me while i was in the kitchen and told me his daughter has been complaining that i haven’t really been talking to her. Told my mom that she only came to me once and that i was talking to my friends (they live across the country now because i moved) so the other times i must’ve been asleep.  My mom says she feels as i’ve been ignoring his daughter and not making enough of an effort. My mom says i need to get along with her because  I’m “so openminded” and that “kids can be really cruel” she also brought up that I make time to spend with his 17 year old son. I don’t “make time” for him. We like the same animes and a lot he’ll just approach me and start talking to me about it. I told her that If his daughter comes to me while I'm asleep then I can't do anything about it because I'm asleep. I also said that I’m  not going to hang up on my friends for her because they’re no longer down the street.

My mom said that regardless of the distance I am from my friends I should make an effort to get to know them because she and her dad have been talking about marriage and that i shouldn’t pick friends over family. I got upset and said that my friends will alway be more family to me then she will. After that my mom kinda just stared at me and walked away. Today my older brother (18) asked me what was up with me and mom since we haven’t talked to each other. I quickly explained it to him and he's fully on my side, but I feel kinda bad because shes really nice and I know that my mom was just trying to make sure everyone gets along.

ETA: I probably should’ve explained better but i’m not ignoring her. I understand its cruel to ignore someone no matter what the circumstances are. She came to me when i was on the phone and asked if I wanted to walk to cvs with her. I said no because I was doing something at the moment and told her that i’ll go with her another time she said that it was okay and left.",43,57,0.89

My girlfriend lives by that, she physically can't help it, I once watched her eat an entire plate of food, despite saying she was full less than half way and then be sick and continue to eat because she didnt want food wasted.

241,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this short and simple. For context, I am a minor (F) living with my minor brother, my 21 y/o brother, and my parents.

I used to get flak for doing this but it's calmed down over the years, but since I recently discovered Reddit, I would like to know: AITA?

My family enjoys their food. Whenever my mom gets groceries, she gets heaps. The problem was that my family (the males mostly) would eat almost all of the food before I got around to it. I am skinny and have this mindset that ""I don't really want this now, so I'll save it for later."" though my family does NOT share this mindset. They eat anything and everything. Leftovers? Gone. Snacks? Gone. Drinks? Gone. They would eat the things that I would want later. 

To combat this, I started taking my share of things. Mom brought home multiple 12pcks of Dr. Pepper? I divide it by 5 and bring 1/5 to my room for storage. There's a snack everyone likes? Divided by 5 and brought into storage.

There wasn't too much of a problem until I started having the snacks and drinks they wanted after they had eaten them all. They would come into my room, asking for something from my stores. I would normally say no, but I can be a bit of a doormat and after some insisting would give them what they wanted. (I have since broken out of this mindset and keep what is supposed to be mine)

A few stories that have blossomed from this mindset and what I do, both involving my 21 y/o brother:

My brother had taken a drink from the fridge, which literally had my name on it. A little fight broke out whenever I found out, and he said this: ""She wasn't drinking it, so I thought I could!"" (Not verbatim) Which is completely twisted logic imo, so I responded ""Hey, do you have $20 you're not using? I could use some money."" And *he* thought that was completely different. My father, who was overseeing the argument, agreed with me. This is one of the reasons I ""horde"" food.

The second story was much more recent and a lot shorter.

We were out of Dr. Pepper (except for me) and my brother voiced his complaints. I offered to give him one from my stash, and he agrees, but immediately follow with, ""Can I get 2, actually?"" To which I responded, ""No, you can have 1, beggars can't be choosers."" And, thankfully, he accepted that. 

I would like to clarify my brother isn't entitled, the stories that I remember just happen to be of him.

So, Reddit, AITA for hording food that is rightfully mine?

Edit* Due to another Redditor's confusion I would like to clarify that my parents are ok with me dividing the food that is bought. They even encourage what I do because it avoids conflict. And side note, yes, I have my own mini fridge now!",138,602,0.94

243,Everyone Sucks,"I met her 27 years ago. We lived next door to each other for 3 years and she was a very good neighbor to have. Very nice. We reconnected 2 years ago and she's been to several of my parties. But she's really bad about inviting like 20 people to come with her and I'm invaded.

Don't get me wrong! They're super nice people and when they come, they're taking out my garbage, washing dishes, they're great! But it's a little daunting to be expecting maybe 15 people and having 40 turn up.

But that's not the real problem. Even though we were neighbors, I never really understood just how...stupid she is. I mean like verging on brain damaged. She's just really, really dense. I had her over a couple of times last year and it was, just...unbearable. She has a REALLY loud, abrasive HAW HAW HAW!! laugh that just sets my teeth on edge. She constantly interrupts you when you're talking and it takes FOREVER to explain literally ANYTHING more complex than ""food tastes good"" to her. She also tends to get really, really drunk very quickly. She's also a 'close talker' and cannot seem to modulate the volume of her voice.

If it weren't for this virus, I'd be fielding daily messages, calls and texts from her wanting to come over and hang out. I usually just make excuses or pretend I'm not home. I keep hoping she'll get the hint, but, nope! Like I said, she's just not very bright.

At the time I had been working 4 hours away only coming home on weekends. I gave my roommate two months notice of my plan to move out as well as the landlord. (My name was on the lease and not hers). That's when things went south everything was fine until then. She then began to dictate how I moved out. I explained I could only be home on weekends to move and do what I could with that time. She then decided to write up an ""agreement"" demanding her terms of what needed to be done when I moved. Cleaning, belongings, bills sorted etc. But she had it written if I did not comply she would have full control of my possisions and safety deposit. (Which should have been the landlords decision) So I didn't feel comfortably signing especially with the wording. But also knowing it had no legal weight behind it. A document she wrote up and printed. I still didn't want to take the chance of it coming back on me later. So now she is being super aggressive and holding my late mail hostage, since I didn't comply with signing. AITA?

Update: 
Also takes place in Canada
So this took place at the end of February I have already been moved out for a month. (I moved to take care of my mothers estates as she went to a home)  I also recieved my damage deposit. I have no want to get the authorities involved as we run in the same friends circle and hoping she will come to her senses. She is currently using Covid as her excuse for her not allowing me accees to my mail. When I requested to pick up my mail she was very belligerent toward me so I saved the convo. As for the agreement at the time many people told me to suck it up and sign just to GTFO, but wanted a mutual friend to witness instead she got her boyfriend so I didn't agree. In the end just to keep her from screaming at me I signed as a left with all my possessions no witnesses, no one home just to gain some peace and get my deposit. The landlord also switch her name onto the lease mid February even though I had paid till the end of the month. They were the slumlords of my town so didn't care as long as they got rent.

The saddest part is we adopted cats together which we shared costs of, I expressed interest in taking them with me once settled but she had ""conditions"" I had to meet.

246,Not the A-hole,"So I (F21) had to leave college about a month ago (for obvious reasons), and I have been living at home ever since. My mom has been on me about spending more time with the family and each of my family members, which I've been making up excuses to get out of. Today, she suggested that we do a movie night this weekend and has been pressuring me to say yes, and I finally just told her that I have no interest in participating in family activities like that. I know that sounds really harsh, but please hear me out.

&#x200B;

In all 18 years of my life that I spent at home as a kid, I can clearly remember only ONCE that my entire family sat down at home for a meal (except for meals out). I once tried to have a movie night, but that ended up being my parents sitting the kids down, putting a movie on, and then immediately leaving to do other stuff. I always wanted to cook with my family, but my dad would always shoo me out of the kitchen and tell me I was getting in his way. My family NEVER showed up to any of my concerts or races except to pick me up (but most of the time I carpooled with other people). And the night before my high school graduation, my mom walked up to me and asked me who I was carpooling with to get home after graduation. There are a lot of other examples, but basically I spent my entire childhood dreaming of and trying to build the \*perfect\* family life, or really just any family life at all, and it never worked. 

&#x200B;

So the reason my mom has had a change of heart though is because one of my siblings died last year. It was very hard on me for reasons I won't get into, but I think it also made my mom have very deep regrets about not being a closer family. My mom is now really close with my one of my teenaged siblings (they sleep in the same bed...) and my other sibling is at a young enough age where they love mommy no matter what. Because of all the reasons above, and because I'm away at school most of the time (and when I'm not, I've been working full time in other cities), I just haven't been a part of becoming a closer family. I understand where my mom is coming from, but 18 years of disappointment really made me tired of trying with my family, and I just don't care anymore. Quite honestly, I'm also just not that comfortable around my family. We're respectful/cordial, but we're not close. AITA for not trying anymore and having no interest in becoming closer with my family?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My family was not close at all for all 18 years of my childhood, despite me trying really hard to build a family life. One of my siblings died last year, and my family is all staying at home together now, and my mom wants us all to be closer. I don't any interest in becoming closer with my family.",33,105,0.95
247,Not the A-hole,"Am not a native English speaker, so sorry for any mistakes.

When I (F) first met my husband's family, I noticed they had a tradition where all the females (it's a huge family living together) would cook the food together and the men would eat first after which the women would eat. I didn't initially comment on it, not wanting to get into a conflict with people I didn't know too well.

As years passed though, I got more annoyed with this tradition. For one thing, the food would be cold by the time I (and other women) begin to eat. We also usually visited during holidays and festivals, and a lot of expensive delicacies that is not normally prepared otherwise is made then, and I don't always get any because their might not be leftovers. Not to mention, I help cook, so it seems absurd to me that I have to wait hungry while others are done. None of the other women seem to mind this.

A few months back, before eating, we were all in the living room and I thought I would ask them about this.

Me: Can we all eat at the same time?

FIL: No. This is an old tradition in our family because men would be really hungry after  coming back from work.

Me: Most of the women work nowadays though.

FIL: It seems really wrong to suddenly stop something we have been doing for so long now.

This continues on for a while - FIL insisting it's a tradition and shouldn't be broken and me saying it's sexist. Nothing changed, men ate first like usual, and I dropped it. However I had several of my husband's relatives  come up to me and say that I am an asshole for questioning their traditions, and that I don't stay with them and asking this makes me an asshole. A lot of the women also think I am an asshole because they think I made a big fuss about nothing.

My fiancé is Irish. Born and raised in Ireland. Excruciatingly Irish. We have discussed the relationship between England and Ireland throughout the years.

250,Not the A-hole,"Ok, so some background. I live with my younger brother in our family home. I'm 23 and he's 21, so we're pretty young. A couple months ago he invited his friend to move in with us when she was about to get evicted. I only found this out as she was moving her things into my house, including her 2 cats (we already have 2 cats and a dog).

Now, I took this well, cause my brother told me that at the very least her son wouldn't be moving in, and I can sympathize with someone being in a crappy situation. I didn't want her son moving in for a variety of reasons.

One is that he's young, and neither my brother or I have been around young children. I'm not good with children, I tend to be really awkward. But more than that, this house is absolutely not up to any sort of code. Work hasn't really been done on the house since like the 70s, and we're trying to slowly get things done, but its gonna take time and money. I fear the kid getting hurt in the house in any sort of way.

The other thing is that my brother keeps his weed stash out, and I keep alcohol around. Idk, I just dont think that's a good environment for the kid to be in. I know his mom smokes, too, but I'm just uncomfortable with the whole situation.

Until yesterday the kid hasn't been a problem, he's been staying with his dad and she's been visiting him. But then yesterday the kid was brought over here. I didn't say anything about it, I figured she was just watching him for the afternoon or something, but now it's this morning and he's still here.

I know that with the whole virus going around she's probably anxious and wanting to spend time with him, but I just dont think this house is an appropriate environment for a kid. I guess a couple visits during the day would be ok. 

I dont know, I feel bad, but i also made it really clear to my brother long before she moved in that if we got a roommate they couldnt have a kid with them (he actually wanted her to move in before she was about to be evicted with her kid). Also, my mom is the owner of the house, and she's also made it clear that she doesn't want kids in the house for the same reasons I dont

 AITA for wanting the kid to stay out of the house?  Should I bring this up with her or my brother?",172,1246,0.96
251,Not the A-hole,"This is as ridiculous as it sounds. 

There’s obviously been a TP shortage as all the memes and tweets show. Well, my bf’s (blessed) grandma bought us two big Costco packs so we’d be set for a while without having to worry. Well, because of this, I started to pay more attention to how much TP we’re going through, and I was astonished to see how much TP my bf goes through in a DAY!!! At least one ENTIRE roll, in a 24h period... That’s when I decided to hide one pack “for myself” and leave the other pack out so he could take from it. Good thing I did, because now he’s completely out of toilet paper and has started asking where I keep my stash... I’ll obviously share the TP with him, but I give him one roll at a time. No way in hell am I letting him use all my TP so I can find out at the most critical of times and have to use paper towels on my bum... AITA for not telling him where it is?

Edit: so I don’t have to reply the same thing to everyone: I have no clue how he manages to go through a roll a day, and every time I ask he just replies “I keep wiping and ITS STILL THERE!!”.",600,2019,0.95

254,Not the A-hole,"throwaway ID, in case not obvious. All names have been changed.

My husband's friend, Marcus, is in the middle of a child custody lawsuit against his GF, Joan. I've known Marcus for about 10 years through my husband. I've seen him through various stages of his life, and have spent enough time with him to suspect that he has a drinking problem - he becomes belligerent and likes to pick verbal fights with anyone around.

Marcus started dating Joan about 4 years ago and an unexpected pregnancy occurred in the first 6 moths of their relationship. Things progressed really quickly after that. They moved in together and all seemed to go well...we rarely saw him drink more than a few glasses of wine and he seemed softer and happier.

18 months ago, we relocated to another city and saw them less frequently. Nonetheless, we kept in touch. At last year's Easter dinner, their mutual disdain for each was evident and noticed that Marcus was drinking more. Nearly back to his old consumption level.

Then my husband received an email from Joan about 3 months ago that she and Marcus have separated. Initially they had agreed on joint custody but Marcus suddenly sued her for full custody. In the email, she asked if he could provide a testimony - one, regarding a particularly brutal argument between Marcus and Joan he witnessed some months ago (I was not present for that) and two, about her general competence as a mother. My husband told her he was willing to provide the latter but not the former. I empathise with his choice even now and throw no judgement on that matter.

However, I asked him how he would feel if I offered to testify regarding Marcus's drinking. He expressed his discomfort at that and for the present, we've dropped the subject.

So, WIBTA if I reached out to Joan without discussing it again with my spouse? I do not know how custody lawsuits work and how much anonymity is afforded to the 3rd parties that testify but maybe it's possible to provide a testimony with my name redacted. I'm not sure I will go through with it if it becomes open knowledge to Marcus - I don't want to sour my husband's relationship with his friend via my actions.

We are all in our late 30s.

(EDIT) UPDATE: After I posted, I brought up the subject with my husband. After some thinking and reading the comments, the thought of reaching out to Joan without him knowing made me feel really icky. We are still talking about it as we now both read the comments. I'm leaning towards giving Joan a friendly phone call (she does not have my new phone number since we moved, so the call is a good excuse to give her a way to contact me directly in the future if SHE chooses to.) We've both agreed that I would just keep it at a Happy Post Easter hello and check in on her daughter.

Thanks to those who gave their thoughtful advice on the situation. Just to be clear, my spouse is not an AH. As I said, he had his reasons and I respect them. I just wanted to know if I would be an AH and it seems I got my answer. I would normally stay out of these kinds of situations but I was also the child's healthcare provider for a while (she has mild special needs) and felt a bit more involved than usual.

(EDIT2) FINAL UPDATE: We've now spoken with Joan and after the conversation, we've decided it's best to NOT testify. As someone has mentioned, I was not present for that specific incident and she has other means to prove his drinking issues. She believes she can manage without my testimony so that's a relief. Since I posted the first edit, I've seen an increase in judgements thrown at my husband. Lots of assumptions flying about.

A couple of extra details and I'll be gone.

1. He chose not to speak on the ""incident"" because he also witnessed something that night that could work against Joan's case. She was not aware that he saw or heard that portion of the evening. I already knew about this but Joan didn't. He's now made that clear with her. His choice had nothing to do with ""maintaining"" his friendship with Marcus. I think the confusion might have come from ME not wanting to be a wedge. 
2. He was uncomfortable about me testifying because he thought the information I would bring forward wasn't critical enough for me to risk the stress of being grilled by Marcus's lawyer. Knowing me, he knew I would do it if asked and then suffer emotionally if things don't work out. I thought it was a bit overprotective of him but talking with Joan cleared this up anyway.
3. Joan still wants split custody, btw. All of us are non-Americans and where we live, the default is split custody. I'd say only maybe 1/10 cases end up in custody suits. Marcus makes about double what Joan makes so we've decided to help her out with the lawyer fees. Not a lot, just what we can spare...so that she can get the best representation she can afford.

Thanks again to everyone who answered my initial quandary. I really agree I would have been an AH if I had gone behind my husband's back.",138,1129,0.96
255,Asshole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm on mobile and this is my first ever post so please be kind. This probably isn't that interesting but I need an outside view. TL:DR at the end.

So my parents have three kids: K (M, 24), Me (F, 22) and B (M, 15). There's a 7 year age gap between me and B so needless to say he came out of nowhere, but we all love him. Growing up, K and I were parented pretty much the same: bedtime at 9pm, no harsh swearing, don't go too far from the house, etc. At first, B was also parented like this, but because K and I grew up and needed less parenting (could stay up til whenever, could go anywhere as long as we're safe, etc.), they started being less strict about the rules with B.

Now, the staying up past 9 and going wherever as long as he's safe is fine, fair enough, that doesn't bother me. The problem I have is with the swearing rule. Now I say rule, but we didn't have any spoken ""you must/must not do this"" type rules, they were unspoken and we followed them because we feared the wrath of mother. This particular swearing rule was that you weren't really allowed to swear, but we could as long as it was only in front of our parents, not too often, and not too harshly (for example fuck and shit were fine occasionally, but bastard and cunt were never allowed).

K and I followed this rule, and if we didn't we got punished. But if B doesn't follow the rule it's completely brushed over, and it might sound really petty but I'm kind of annoyed about it because he swears all the time, and he's only 15. It wouldn't even bother me as much if he didn't get away with what we were screamed at for at his age. Hell, I haven't even got the courage to say cunt in front of my parents now at age 22.

So, to the point of this post. My dad, B and I were all sat together and B was talking about something, and amidst his usual swearing he throws in cunt, and again my dad didn't even seem to notice. So I asked my dad why he doesn't say anything to B about swearing so harshly when K and I got screamed at/grounded, etc. His response was something along the lines of ""What do you want me to do about it? We've tried telling him off for it and he still does it, do you want us to scream at him? He's exposed to it everywhere so what do you want us to do?"". Now what I really wanted to say was ""Why don't you try parenting your child?"" but what I actually said was ""Me and K got screamed at for it, why doesn't he? It's one thing to be exposed to it, it's another to do it"". All he said was ""Okay, OP"" and he ended the conversation, clearly annoyed.

So AITA for asking my dad why he doesn't parent my little brother the same way he parented me and my older brother?

As an extra point, I know he's 15 so of course he's gonna swear. It wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't at the level he does it and gets away with it. 

TL:DR - me and my older brother got yelled at for swearing too often/too harshly but my little bro gets away with it. Asked dad why and he got annoyed.",97,119,0.96
256,Not the A-hole,"first time user here. Some backstory: my friends and I (not Jewish) are all middle schoolers. Someone in my friend group (let's refer to him as F1), posted a tiktok making fun of the Jewish people that died at the Auschwitz death camp. His tiktok really blew up and in the end it earned almost 400k views. When it was starting to gain views and likes, I advised him to change his account name as it had previously been his real full name and I didn't want an offensive video like that to possibly get him in trouble later on or even now. You see, I have always been raised under the rule that I can't post anything online with my face on it or if it could be deemed ""bad"" as everything on the internet is permanent and even colleges sometimes see that stuff. I have always abided by this rule and I quite frankly agree with it and always warn my friends about it when they post anything publicly. 

Now let's get into the AITA part of the story. This morning, my closest friend (F2) along with some other boys were laughing about F1's tiktok. F2 along with another friend F3, thought it was hilarious while another boy said it was ""fucked up and stolen content"" but he didn't care enough to get involved. I personally message F2 and tell him that I thought it was not funny at all and was just crazy offensive especially since our grade is almost 1/3 Jewish. I told F2 how I was looking out for F1 as I told him to change his name before it went massively viral. F2 told me I was being a pussy for thinking that people will ever see that stuff and I am just overreacting and I am salty. I then message F3, asking him if what I said to F2 was wrong, he said that he understood my point but F2 was overall correct. 

update: I started writing this post and then talked to one of my friends who is a VERY Jewish and even had relatives killed in the Holocaust. He obviously agreed with me and said that the tiktok wasn't funny and just fucked up. Side note: this friend loves dark humor and finds many offensive things funny, even sometimes if they are making fun of his own religion. Because of him and just my gut instinct, I do not think I am the A-hole, but I'll let Reddit decide that.",36,51,0.88
257,Asshole,"(16M) 

At around 10pm last night while my mum was sleeping, me, my older brother (19M) and my younger sister (13F) were watching TV. Since my older brother had the remote, we were forced to watch only what he wanted to watch.

We begged him to change channels and for us to change turns at least, but he'd flat out refuse and say ""Too bad, you should have got the remote first. First come, first serve."" I would normally report this to Mum but she was asleep and I didn't want to wake her up over a petty argument. So after around 45 minutes of pleading and rejection, I had enough.

I connected my phone to the TV and put on gory anime moments (he's EXTREMELY haemophobic, yes even anime blood) just to get him out of the room. He was like ""WTF?"" and tried to snatch the phone off my hand by force but I made sure to put it in my pocket. Luckily for us, the idea of switching the TV off using the remote didn't enter his mind and he instead just walked out of the room.

The next day, my older brother must've told on us because my mum berated me and called me ""sick"" for taking advantage of someone's phobia. I made my case known (or at least tried to) but my mum wasn't having it.

259,Not the A-hole,"This happened a year back and I don't know if I was an asshole. 

My friend and I were both overweight, me just a bit and him probably 50+ lbs. We both decided we wanted to look better so we joined a gym and had our mutual personal trainer friend make us a meal plan. 

We went to the gym together, but he never really put in a real effort. He'd lie about how many reps he did if he thought I wasn't paying attention or he'd make excuses about why he couldn't go today. It's his life and I didn't care because I was enjoying the gym anyways. 

I followed the meal plan and lost weight while he steadily gained weight. He kept oscillating between excuses that it's muscle or that he didn't understand because he's following the meal plan and it must be a bad one. The problem is that I watched him eat terrible food all the time and make bad fitness choices (buying mass gainer when he's trying to lose weight). 

After about a year I looked completely different in a good way, while he had actually gained about 30 lbs. He constantly compared us and lamented that I had great genetics and it's not fair. I put up with it because it sucks to feel like you failed at something and I tried to encourage him as much as I could. 

Instead of taking it in and using it as motivation to fix his health, he just started on how weight loss is impossible for him and BMI wasn't accounting for all his muscle. I explained calories in calories out, but he just kept saying he was doing everything right but it wasn't working. Whatever, his life. 

The final straw was when he started discouraging people from losing weight and comparing how he worked just as hard as me. Started spouting that only some people have the genetics to lose weight and get strong. He constantly complained denied that he wasn't properly implementing his diet and I just had enough of it. 

I explained that calories in calories out works for everyone and that he never put in any real effort and that's why he never got the results he wanted. I wasn't mean, but I just had enough of him playing the victim.

260,Not the A-hole,"The house I spent my teen years, my moms house,  is in the middle of the suburbs. Most of the people on our street are middle aged, with kids either my age or in high school. There’s really no young homeowners here. My mom is a travel nurse and I recently moved into her house. To clarify, she never here, like ever. 

So anyway, I know most of my neighbours by sight. We smile, we wave. That’s it. I don’t know their names and I’ll admit to being an asshole by saying, I’ve never bothered to ask or to get to know them but never have they tried either. I only know the two people who live directly next door to me on either side.

The dishwasher in my house starts leaking, so I call a plumber to come fix it. I walked out to my car to get something while the plumber was here and the neighbour who lives across starts to walk over. He starts asking me about why I called for a plumber and I told him. I’ve never talked to this man a day in my life aside from the occasional good morning/evenings. He has a cute dog who sometimes I’ll pet when his wife walks him and I make small talk with her about the dog. This guy, visibly feeling some kind of way asks why I didn’t call him. Dumbfounded, I just said uhhhhh. He goes “you know I’m a plumber, you’ve seen my truck.” I was like “oh, I guess I didn’t really click with me that I could have called you.” I honestly never really paid that much attention to it.

My mom didn’t have any chores growing up. Her mother did all the cleaning including my mom’s bedroom and attached bathroom.

While my sister’s and I were growing up we had to clean constantly. If we were seen playing or watching TV downstairs we were yelled at and given chores. If the house was already clean we would have to wipe down edging, rails, banisters, etc. So naturally even to this day we tend to stay upstairs whenever we are home. We have been in charge of cooking since I was 8. She says it’s because he never got a chance to learn how to clean before becoming an adult so she’s doing it to help us. I never remember my mom cleaning on a regular basis since I was 7 or 8.

The background is just to show I may be the asshole because I might be bitter.


Now my twin sister and I live with our mom while going to school.

We agreed to do a big clean once a week (separately). Along with other chores. On Wednesday I deep clean the den, kitchen, laundry room, my mom’s hallway, and the 3 rooms in the basement. My mom’s part of this agreement is she will take down the trash can, feed the dogs, wash dishes on days we don’t clean and put up dishes. 

My sister and I wash our dishes as we use them so it’s really just my mom’s stuff. The same goes for the laundry room. When we clean it 1-2 out of 3 - 4 baskets are just my mom’s clothes that we separate out and bring to her. 

One by one my mom has told us “ I think it’s really fucked up that I’m the only one who takes down the trash.”, “ It’s really trifling how y’all just leave dishes the pile up in the drying rack, waiting for someone else to put them up” “Why do y’all act like you don’t know the dogs need to be feed” She has also stopped ‘washing ‘ dishes, By washing I mean putting them in the dishwasher without rinsing them and then put them on the shelves without checking so you end up with bowls with oatmeal caked on it. My sister and I have been forced to take over every chore she has agreed to do. Now her only chore is her garden, which she is upset we don’t help with.

My mom also doesn’t cook on even a monthly basis. I cook daily and have been told multiple times making food for me and not everyone is rude. If I make myself something like bacon and a fried eggs my mom will come in and tell me to make her some bacon, hash browns and scrambled eggs. She’ll come home with chicken and expect me to drop what I’m doing to immediately make her a meal ( but not with fish, garlic, onions or Any vegetable other than broccoli because she does not like those.) and then she complains about the cooking.

262,Not the A-hole,"This happened months ago, and I had a lot of times to think that maybe I'm the asshole. 

I (24,m) hate any kind of surprises. My friend and co-worker, Linda, (22,f) wanted to celebrate my birthday, and I told her that I don't like celebrating birthdays, since I really don't like birthday party. She begged me to let her make it the best I ever had, and I told her that if we are celebrating I really want to make it really simple (just order pizza and drinks while hanging out with friends) and no surprises, no gifts.

Linda, however, when it comes to my actual birthday, decorated the whole office and actually having almost my whole office mate screaming HAPPY BIRTHDAY to me once I stepped in. And she also bought cake and presents. I really, really, really hated it. I kept my temper down and I pretend I enjoyed the day but I can't shake my annoyance towards the one thing I asked her not to do, a surprise birthday party. Later on after work, I had ANOTHER surprise birthday party from my old friends.

The next day, one of my old friend texted me and said that he's surprised I'm okay with the party, and I told him I'm not. He told me that Linda said I need to try and have a real birthday party and I might be up for it. At that point I just felt disrespected and confronted Linda on the things I told her not to do. I told her I'm grateful and all but I really disliked all of it and I wish I could lie and tried to enjoy it but I can't. Apparently Linda was extremely upset and one of my co-worker said that I should've just kept the whole ""I wish I could lie to you and say that I enjoyed the party"" to myself. I felt guilty but I didn't apologize because I don't feel like I needed to.

Fast forward few weeks later Linda tried to distance herself away from me, and obviously my old friend knows what happened. Some said that Linda is just naive and optimist and I should just apologize to her and it'll never happen again, and some told me that I should just stand to my ground and I don't have to apologize because I stated clearly about things that I dislike.

263,Not enough info,"I'll try to keep this brief but I'm feeling a bit ranty, so apologises in advance. 

So, little backstory, I've been washing my clothes/bed linen a lot more these days considering everything going on. My family have been around a lot more to see me doing said washing and have decided that it is now *my* responsability to do all the washing in the house.

While I'm not pleased with this, if it's in the utility room, it doesn't hurt or take that much effort to throw their stuff into the machine. But I'm not going round all their rooms to collect their _potentially_ dirty clothes and I've said this a few times.

This has resulted in my Mum becoming a bitch about things. I've been sleeping in late these days, no where to be, might as well, right? The second I emerge from my pit, my Mum is down my throat about no washing being on the line ""on a day like this"". Okay, why didn't you put it out ? The only response I get to that is grumbling and ranting about how she does everything. Even if I put the washing out immediately, she'll still complain about more not being done and how she's drowning in clothes. I'm doing the washing, not her. This irks me but fighting is draining, best to ignoreand go about my isolated life. 
You see my annoyance and how irrational my Mum can be, so I'll get to the point of why I might be the dickhole. The bathroom has a tiny basket and everyone chucks their shit in it, dirty clothes, wet towels, skiddy undies. I find it super gross and *never* use it. I leave my clothes in my room and cover myself with a towel.

Weeeeeeeell, the basket was over flowing and smelt pretty rank, my Mum asked me to do it. I said no, none of it is mine and it's gross. She flipped out, saying she'd have to do it because apparently she can't ask my 3 other siblings? If I'd contributed or was just towels, I probably would've done it without thinking. But shit stained undies, damp rotting clothes and whatever evil remains in that basket isn't my problem. She says because I do the washing, it's my responsability. Everyone decided it was my job, I was just doing my own things. She ranted for a while about how selfish I was, I never do anything for her and she always ends up doing everything. If everyone just cleaned up after their damn selves we wouldn't have this problem in the first place.

I pretty much told her to get fucked and I'm trying to make a point at this stage- you're all adults! Clean up after yourself. The basket was still sitting there this morning and now my Dad is complaining at me. I can't tell if I'm being stubborn for the sake of it, perhaps amplified because we're all locked up, or do I have a valid point?

Fellow humans with eyes and opinions- aita ? If I'm just being a cunt, I get it. It's such a childish thing to be annoyed about but I can't help feel they're taking the piss.

It’s been months since we moved to our current house and his things are a mess, they’re all piled up at the back of the house. We asked him to sort it out since mice are starting to live in the box and since he has a lot of time now, there’s no excuse for him to avoid that chore.


Yesterday, my mom bought some sacks of rice. My dad didn’t even go with her to buy it because he was sleepy, even though I told him to just sleep in the car just so my mom would have a companion during the trip. I wanted to go with her however, I’m working from home and can’t just leave my computer.

When she got home, my brother was the only one carrying them into the house. I can’t carry heavy things because I have scoliosis.

I told my dad to help his son. He said that I was being too much on him, he said he’s disabled and I’m ordering him to carry sacks of heavy rice. He asked me if I thought he was normal — i honestly didn’t consider his disability because I think he’s doing fine, especially since he’s smoking AGAIN even after the doctor told him not to. I wanted to tell him that for a disabled person, he sure does smoke a lot. 

To clear things out, he got a heart attach 6 years ago and had to go under angioplasty, causing him to be a person with a disability.

Anyway, I told him he could help my brother by holding one end of the sack instead just so that my brother wouldn’t literally get all of the heavy load.

He then proceeded to carry one sack of rice on his own because my brother did the rest. After that, he swept the floor and kept saying I was being too much, esp. since he’s disabled and I’m telling him to go carry heavy stuff.

My mom told me that I was being mean, especially how I told on him. I told her that I was telling the truth because he doesn’t even help at home. She didn’t disagree, however she said the way I spoke to him was wrong, I made him feel useless because he doesn’t have the job right now and the way I snapped at him made him feel more useless.

She asked me to apologize, which I refuse to do because I don’t think I did anything wrong. I just got sick of how it’s always the 3 of us who does stuff in the house and he just slacks off when he has a lot of time to do things.

I’ve always been good to his (our, really) pet. Feeding him, scooping litter, affection and play, buying him monthly supplies and even contributing to his medical costs. I’m a good cat mom and he tells me so. Believe me, I care about the furry bastard and his well-being.  

So kitty always has access to food and fresh, clean water and a plethora of other creature comforts. Despite this, he will often meow incessantly around 5am and scratch and knock things over because he decides he wants something. 

I always give him more dry before bed and check he has what he needs. Doesn’t matter. Sometimes he’ll chomp through all his food, decide he wants a faucet drink or wants his food bowl shaken or he’ll make our lives hell. 

TLDR: I’m sick of dealing with this every night. I’ve never had such a demanding cat and have stopped giving into it all the time. If I know he has what he needs, I’m no longer jumping out of bed to “tend” to him.

I tell my fiancé it’s practice for learning how to ignore a child’s tantrum and honestly, he should have been more mindful when he was a kitten/young cat not to reinforce this behavior. 

He says ITA but after 30 minutes, the cat finally STFU and he’s sleeping peacefully. AITA?",163,559,0.94

269,Not the A-hole,"My (13f) mother died in early 2017. My dad (50m) started dating my stepmom (50f), S, in like late 2018 or so? I have a brother (15m) who I'll call R.

Basically, she moved in like midsummer 2019. Her and my dad aren't married, but we all live together so close enough.

She's just always on my nerves in one way or another. Like how she turned my mother's old room into her ""office"", or how she's always talking to me about gardening or cooking or sewing but never my brother, or how my dad basically never stands up to her when she's being rude. I know I also do things that get on her nerves, like not cleaning the dishes in time or leaving a makeup item out on the bathroom counter. I do always do what she wants after she asks, though, and I can realize a lot of times I'm being unreasonable and go away to calm down. I don't mouth her off or something.

But I hear her talking shit about me to my dad all the time. ""She's so irresponsible, she's so lazy, she's so rude,"" Again, sometimes I deserve it and I know that, but a lot of times she just seems to hate me, and now my dad seems to always be angry at me too. I try to be nice to her because I know a lot of the negative feelings I have towards her are just because she's my stepmom, but she's talked about me to multiple members of my family when all I did was leave the dishes undone a few nights.

My brother does the same things too (we do the dishes together) but he never gets talked about. I don't talk back to her, neither of us do. 

Anyways, I know it's petty, but if I told her to back off or something, would I be the asshole? I already think I'm the asshole here, but I also feel like she's been kind of pitting my dad against me, if that makes sense? Like she's always talking to him about how she doesn't like me.

I'm sorry if this post comes off as rambly or whatever, it's late and I just want an opinion.",29,29,0.88

272,Not the A-hole,"Me and my best fiend had a really big blow out last night. I’m kind of confused by the argument tbh and I don’t feel I said anything out of order but I really would like some more perspective on this because he is adamant that I am in the wrong.

We had an argument which escalated when I said he was acting childish. He started to scream down the phone at me and call me a lot of names and using pretty vulgar language. After it all calmed down he said to me that being called a child was an emotional trigger for him. I said that’s fine and I’ll respect that, but in the future if something is deeply troubling then he needs to communicate that instead of losing his temper, or else how else am I meant to know? He disagreed. 

This led to a conversation about being emotionally open. He said he wasn’t emotionally open because he’s a man. I said “its not a man thing, there are  men I know who are very emotionally open”. He got very angry at me and started ranting that I was belittling his experience as a man, that I was arrogantly claiming to understand the male experience more than him, and then compared it to to saying to a black person “not all black people get shot down by police, I know black people who weren’t shot by the police” (which I don’t really think is a fair comparison).

I said sorry that he took it that way but I tried to explain that I didn’t mean to belittle his experience or claim to know what it’s like to be a man more than him. I didn’t mean it the way he took it. In my own head I was trying to be encouraging, like just because you’re a man doesn’t mean you are doomed to being a poor communicator and men don’t all have fit into the same little box. 

His argument is that I didn’t make that clear enough and my argument is that he was reaching way too much into what I was saying. I feel really frustrated because it’s like the point I was trying to make was totally twisted and taken out of context. But his argument is I should have been more careful about my wording and it came off insensitive. I’m really trying to understand his perspective but Im honestly so hurt by the whole conversation, maybe that’s why I’m missing the point
 
So AITA here?

**TL:DR** I’m a woman and my male friend said that he wasn’t emotionally open because he’s a man. I said I don’t think it’s a man thing. He thinks I was belittling his experience as a man, I think he’s misunderstanding my point and reading way too much into what I was saying.



**Update** thank you all for your responses, I really appreciate it and you all gave me a lot of interesting perspectives to consider. 
My friend and I had a talk this morning, and unfortunately it did not go as I would have ideally hoped. We still don’t see eye to eye on this at all, and have both decided to just go our separate ways. It hurts a lot because he was my best friend for so many years, but people move on just go in different directions. And like someone said here, you can’t set yourself on fire trying to keep someone else warm. 

I know a lot of these responses were of the opinion that he is a bad dude or that he’s toxic. I totally understand that it looks that way when all you can go on is one argument (and only from **my** POV) but I don’t believe he is deep down. For all the years I’ve known him he’s been incredibly kind and supportive, and shown good morals. I think he’s going through a difficult time and needs to find his own path. I wish him all the best.

I know this update is a little unnecessary, just wanted to vent a bit and just just say thank you if anyone’s reading. These responses gave me the clarity I needed to make the best decision for both of us.",71,150,0.9
273,Not the A-hole,"My husband (38) and I (34 f) have been married for 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter and and a 3 month old son. Our son has a health condition and needs to be fed every 40 to 80 minutes. 

I work in IT and can easily work from home and generally make my own schedule. My husband works from 6am to 3pm. I get up every hour at night to feed our son so my husband can sleep. I drop our daughter off at kindie in the morning and then work and look after our son. I obviously don't get much sleep during the night so I have started to go to sleep from 3.30 to 7pm and I made it clear that I am not to be woken up unless it's an emergency. My husband looks after the kids and cooks tea while I'm asleep and at 7 we all eat. After that we take turns reading stories to our daughter as a bed time ritual. She's usually down for the night at 8. Then my husband and I have us time form 8 to roughly 9.30 which is when he goes to sleep. After that it's only me looking after our son so my husband can sleep through the night. I usually do some more work and go to sleep at around midnight but obviously very interrupted sleep since I have to get up every hour. 

My husband has started complaining recently. He doesn't think I should sleep in the afternoon because during that time childcare is on him completely. He wants some time to relax when he gets home. But the thighs is, I need a few hours of uninterrupted sleep too otherwise I'll go crazy. Our son will most likely outgrow his condition and should be able to live a normal toddler life by the time he is 18 months. I can't possibly not sleep for another year and 3 months though. My husband isn't happy. 

AITA?

Edit. I should clarify that I don't actually sleep at night due to the feeding pattern. My nap is the only sleep I get. My husband doesn't want a nanny and he doesn't want to be a SAHD.",1938,11089,0.95

275,Not the A-hole,"So this happened some time ago , I (24f) was friends with let's call him Alex (25m). We met at my former job and kept in contact. He quickly became depandent on me. For me this was all just very friendly until when he and his girlfriend broke up he confessed to having feelings for me. 

I rejected him kindly and still wanted to be friends because he knows i am with my boyfriend for about 4 years and we have our ups and downs but he will always be the one for me. 

After still being friends he started to talk down on my boyfriend and said some rude things about him. I told him i didn't like that but wanted to be there for him because he was struggling mentally. 

We fought about it a couple of times because he was still talking down on my boyfriend. And he kept confessing to me. It's like he couldn't take no for an answer. 

I told him i don't see him like that a lot of times. He dated another girl and we didn't have any contact then.  When she broke things off he confessed to me again and i rejected him again. 

The next week i got a text in the middle of the night  ""took an overdose, now going to the hospital don't know if i will survive but know that i love you"". Afterwards i got mad about it and he didn't understand why i got mad even though i explained it to him. I cut off all contact. Now and then he still texts me but i never answer. I told him he went overboard and don't like he talks bad about my boyfriend and that i don't want to have any contact any longer before i cut off contact. 

Am i the asshole for cutting off contact with him and ignoring even if he still tries to contact me?

276,Not the A-hole,"I (21) have two older sisters. Amy is 31, and Bree is 26.

I am a person who likes to gift people things. Mostly just randomly, like ""oh I have an extra xyz, you want it?"" If it's like a $15 item that I don't need, I don't even really think about it. 

Recently, I bought some lip balms from a kinda expensive skincare company. We were moving at the same time and I'm a disaster so I promptly lost two of them. Bree was helping me unpack when I found one of the lost ones and I told her she could have it on a whim. No biggie.

Couple months later, Bree drove us to our parents house for my dad's birthday. I had brought bath bombs for both of my parents as a gift. The one I brought for my mom accidentally rolled out of the bag and got left in Bree's car. She realized later, offered to bring it to me, I told her not to worry about since I have more than I can give to Mom.

The next time Amy was at my house, she saw my box of bath bombs, grabbed one and said ""hey I'm taking this, since you have Bree one"". I was a little taken aback but didn't protest because I didn't really care.

I guess she was expecting a fight though, because she immediately starts saying that I don't give her anything and that I gave Bree more stuff and starts listing the above instances and a few others.

Now I'm annoyed, because it's just point blank not true. I give Amy things all the time. Just recently I was ordering myself a craft project off of Amazon and bought her one too because she mentioned it looked cool. I also buy gifts for her kids all the time, and Bree doesn't even have any yet.

I told her I didn't appreciate her keeping track of the gifts I was giving people, because if she's keeping track, we all have to keep track or else someone's going to get their feelings hurt (literally what happened). I would prefer if no one kept track under the understanding that as sisters, things will even out in the long run.

She kept protesting so then I got mad and started listing things back at her. Months ago, she gave Bree a very expensive makeup palette for no reason, did I say anything? 

If we're being technical about it, Bree was unmarried and living with me for ten years longer than Amy was, you don't think she's bought me more Hot Cheetos and Sonic and other random crap over those years? I didn't get my license until I was 19, who do you think drove me around all that time?

Everyone's mad now... somehow because of me and my penchant for giving people things. Bree's annoyed that she's being dragged into this. My parents are saying I shouldn't have rubbed Amy's face in the things I buy for her. I feel like I'm in the right here. AITA?",180,3836,0.97
277,Not the A-hole,"My ex (25M) and I (23F) had a horrible relationship, he constantly gaslighted me, manipulated me, cheated, put me down, tormented me and tried to separate me from my family. We dated on and off for three years. It was my first relationship and I hadn’t noticed all the red flags until I was far from it. Every time he would break up with me it would be over text, and he would always start dating whatever girl I was nervous about during the relationship. It was always the same, we’d break up I’d be crushed I’d start to move on (start going on dates, browsing tinder, etc.) and then a few months later he would always find a way to connect with me even if I blocked him on everything imaginable. He’d always promise me that’d he’d change and he loved me and he had worked his issues out, and then the cycle would repeat - so whatever he’s horrible. 

Rewind to over a year ago when we broke up for the last time. It wasn’t crushing and I had had enough, and a few months later I met the absolute love of my life. We’re still together and I’m happy to say that it’s an amazing relationship with mutual admiration and respect that I cherish daily. About 2 months into my current relationship my ex had texted me and asked me if I would go with him to put his beloved dog down, I politely told him no and he said he understood. Now this dog was his life, and honestly I loved the little guy too while him and I were together, my ex had exiled most of his family out of his life and doesn’t have a lot of friends, so this dog was likely the only living thing he loved more than himself. I would assume it was absolutely devastating for him to lose his dog but I just didn’t feel obligated to extend my emotional companionship when he never once had an ounce of empathy for me during our entire relationship. 

A couple months after this he texts me and tells me how shitty it was of me to reject him in his time of need, and that it was the worst thing he’s ever gone through. I told him that he was entitled thinking I would extend myself like that after how he treated me for 3 years, he more or less told me I was heartless and I left it at that.

278,Not the A-hole,"I’m using a throwaway just in case my girlfriend sees this, even though she doesn’t know about this subreddit. I’m also on mobile so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues.

Tl;dr: I moved my girlfriend’s doll from our room to the living room while she was at work and she got mad and left, haven’t heard from her in hours, I feel like a complete asshole

My girlfriend, who I’ll call Jess, and I have been together for 2.5 years. We moved into an apartment together in August of 2019 and everything has been great. We rarely fight and if we do, it’s just insignificant bickering over small things. I even plan to propose to her soon, and we have discussed marriage and kids more than once in the past.

Jess has a doll that her late grandmother passed down to her. She always has it on display because it reminds her of her and “brings her peace” (her words). The doll never bothered me much, besides it being a little creepy; I’m freaked out by dolls and clowns and the like. It was a bit uncanny that it was always in her room staring at us while we had sex and slept, but she was adamant on not moving it and I let it go because it was her room and her apartment. However, since we’ve been living together, I’ve started pressing her more about moving the doll. She keeps it in the corner of our bedroom facing perpendicular to our bed, so it’s not looking straight at us (a compromise we made) but it still makes me uncomfortable at times. For example, I’ll walk into the room or walk out of the bathroom and forget that the doll is there, and it will scare the hell out of me. 

I work at a pharmacy and she works at a grocery store so we’re both essential workers. Today when I came home from work, the doll was now on the other side of our bedroom, facing our bed. Since she was at work, I didn’t ask before moving it to the living room, just outside the bedroom door against the wall. I took a shower and a half hour nap, and woke up to her shaking me and asking me why I moved her doll. I told her I didn’t want it staring at me while I slept, and told her she shouldn’t have moved it to where it faces the bed. She should have known not to do that since we compromised on it before. She burst into tears, called me a “fucking inconsiderate asshole,” grabbed the doll, and left the apartment. It’s been three hours and I have no idea where she is. I’ve called her phone and it goes straight to voicemail. I’ve called her sister, her best friend, and her mom and none of them have heard from her. I’m starting to get really concerned and I feel extremely guilty at this point. If she isn’t home by morning, her mom and I are going to try and file a missing persons report.

AITA for moving her doll?

ETA: I should add something that may be significant: the doll is not small. It’s about the size of a 5 or 6 year old child. It is also flexible, as in it can be positioned. I don’t have a photo of it but the most similar picture I could find online is [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/onr2GWc) 


UPDATE: Jess has been located at a friend’s house, and unfortunately has broken up with me. She refuses to come home until I’m completely moved out so I’m leaving to stay with my parents. I’m so confused and wish she would just talk to me. She refuses to talk this over. She just wants nothing to do with me. My heart is completely broken. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice and validated my feelings. I really needed it.
If she ever decides to speak to me again, I’ll update. Thanks again guys.",712,2322,0.96
279,Not the A-hole,"Hey reddit, first time on this sub but came across it and figured it’d be nice to get a second opinion on what’s going on in my life right now. I (29F) am currently 6 months pregnant. My husband (M37) and I have been trying to figure out a name for our unborn daughter since we found out the sex and it’s just been an absolute nightmare. He really wants to name our daughter after someone in his family. I’m willing to compromise (like middle name or something) even though I think family names are kind of tacky, but he isn’t. And what he’s proposing I’m DEFINITELY not willing to accept. See, he wanted to originally name our baby after his father, named Julian. When we found out she was a girl, I thought he’d suggest Julia or something but noooo. He decided, unilaterally, that he should combine his fathers name and my fathers name (Evan) for our little girl to become: Evian. Our last name? Waters. He wants to name her Evian Waters.

Not only do I think this is corny and stupid, I think she’ll be bullied to hell in school. I mean, come on, Evian Waters?? He was so excited because he thought it flowed (ha ha) really nicely and thought it was cool she would be named after a water brand. I tried letting him down gently and explained I wouldn’t be ok with that, and tried coming up with different names or name combos, but he got defensive and upset and refused to discuss it further. 

Now, he’s come up with this new strategy of pretending I agreed to the name and feigning shock and confusion when I mention we still haven’t decided on a name yet. Then when I’m like “wtf” he’ll get mad again and give me the silent treatment. I guess he thinks I’ll eventually cave but I don’t want to, shes my daughter too and I think I have a say, especially since she already has his family’s last name and not mine. I don’t know why he’s so stuck on this name but I just can’t do it, I don’t even like the name Evian in general. I’ve suggested nearly 100 names to him and asked him to list some more of his favorites but he’s firm on this one. Last night, he told me I was too bossy and trying to undermine his only “contribution” to this baby since he doesn’t get to grow her like I do. 

Maybe i’m being unreasonable and the name isn’t so bad, but I feel his stubbornness and the way he’s handling it aren’t ok either. If I’m the AH, I’ll definitely apologize and try to discuss the name some more and seriously consider it. AITA?",78,81,0.93

281,Not the A-hole,"8 years ago I broke my chest which caused a few of my ribs to separate from my sternum. It was the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced in my life. It took a very long time to recover from this and I experienced chest pains for years after it happened. It was maybe only 4 years ago that it stopped being something that I worried about on a weekly basis and started to become something that only occurs on a very rare occasion.


I met my fiance 3 years ago and she knows about what happened and has been there when I've had random flair ups of pain, usually I clutch my chest and breathing becomes a bit ragged but they pass fairly quickly and basically just cause me a few moments of panic and pain and are gone.


Today one of these flair ups happened. I moved a certain way and pain came shooting into my chest only this time the pain wasn't diminishing at all and was lasting longer than any previous flair ups. I started to panic and started crying because I was terrified that I'd somehow rebroken it and that the pain would get worse or wouldn't go away.

My fiance sitting next to me at first asked if I was okay and when I started crying casually said ""oh sharp chest pains I get those too don't worry it'll pass"" I'm continuing to sob and hyperventilate and kept asking me if the pain was like this or like that then continued to ask if I was going to tell her what was wrong. At this point I'm in pain and panicking and sobbing and dumbfounded because of course I'm not going to be able to talk when I can barely breathe. She then laughed and said ""you know you're going to have to tell me what's wrong so I know if I need to take you to the hospital"".


The pain was beginning to ebb but her laughing pissed me off so when I caught my breath I said ""if you're going to laugh I'm leaving the room"" and she laughed again and said she wasn't laughing at me. I ended up leaving the room because I was angry. She came to the room I was in to try to talk to me and said sorry and I told her I was pissed off at how she responded and that she laughed and that I get that some people nervously laugh but maybe say something if that's the case.


She then said she nervously laughs and I told her next time to mention that its nervous laughter and she said that she didn't remember laughing at all and doesn't think she laughed. At that point I was annoyed because I personally feel like she was just trying to back pedal in whatever direction worked out.


I wasn't going to respond in a nice way so I just told so and asked her to leave the room.


Now I'm sat feeling like I'm being a prick but also feeling pissed off and I'm not sure if it's justified. So AITA?


TL;DR old injury flaired up severely and I went into a panic attack, my fiance laughed while asking what was wrong so she'd know if she needed to take me to the hospital. I got angry told her so but now I feel bad, AITA?",30,70,0.89
282,Not the A-hole,"Hey all, this is my first time posting to this sub so I hope I don't do anything that clashes too horribly with the rules. Using a throwaway because everyone I know IRL knows my username and I'm a coward.

Anyway, as the title’s explained, I ended my first long-term Dungeons and Dragons campaign tonight following a hissy-fit from a player that I’ll call Devin. Devin played a Chaotic Good rogue self-insert, but most would define his general attitude as being more “Chaotic Stupid” than anything. To list a few standout moments within our last two sessions, he’s tried to steal prosthetic arms for amputees, needlessly dragged the party into a fight with a high-level NPC, and started a bar fight with one of his fellow PCs for no reason--and that’s leaving out a lot of similar events. Tonight was only our third session. 

During this session, he was pulled into questioning because he happened to trigger a scripted event that I’d had planned since session one--if a party member picked up some golden feathers in the first dungeon and flaunted them out in town, then they’d be brought into questioning later because the feathers belonged to a missing person. No biggie--they’d join up with the party again within the same session because they didn’t have anything to do with this person’s disappearance. Well, Devin seemed to think that this was a personal attack and threw a massive fit before finally acquiescing and muting his mic on Discord while his two party members continued on their merry way. 

When it came time for Devin to be interrogated, though, he never came back. We messaged him and waited for him for thirty minutes and he still refused to return. Because of this childish reaction to a story beat, I decided to pull the plug on the campaign full-stop (this was a decision that his two fellow players supported as well). If he wasn’t willing to accept the fact that his actions had consequences, then I wasn’t willing to put up with his self-indulgent pity party anymore. I put a lot of hard work and care into the session and he sank it without any regard for how much it would hurt me. Because of this, he has been unfriended on all social media platforms and I’m sure he understands why.

One of my players reached out to him after the fact and let her know that he never came back because he fell asleep. Why did he fall asleep? Because he ""didn't like his time being wasted for honestly a subpar reason"" (his words). He's turned this into grounds to attack me and say that I'm targeting him in particular as an ongoing personal attack rather than as a story beat. I've always considered this campaign to be more business-like--any drama from the outside doesn't come inside. My players and I tried to tell him that what I did wasn't personal, but he's still insisting that I'm in the wrong here.  

And so, Reddit, I ask you--am I the asshole for ending our campaign tonight?",133,681,0.95
283,Not the A-hole,"After washing my face I threw my cotton pads in the garbage and a brown stained cloth caught my eye - it looked like it was stashed underneath all the other trash and if you ask me I think it was purposefully hidden. We’ve been running out of Lysol wipes (we have the antimicrobial kind) really quickly but I chalked that up to us obsessively wiping all the surfaces so I didn’t think much of it till now. Upon further inspection with gloves and  while holding my breath there was a big pile of the same brown stained porous cloths that looked just like the Lysol wipes.

I knew this might be a difficult topic to broach so I tried to do it gently. I casually asked if she’s noticed our wipes seem to be running out quickly. I then asked if she’s been using them for anything frivolous and she started to get defensive, saying no and asking why I’d ask her that. I cut right to the chase and said that I found some Lysol wipes in the bathroom bin and asked if she’s been using them to wipe. Uncomfortable conversation for many, I know. She looked away and admitted to it in an embarrassed voice. When I pressed further, her reasoning is that it gets the job done better than regular TP because she has to keep wiping and wiping and wiping but with the wipes she’s only got to wipe a few times before everything’s ok.

Look, I’m not the smartest tool in the shed but theres’s no way that those things are good for your nether regions. I said why don’t we just get baby wipes/flushable wipes, she said that’s pointless because the Lysol wipes can be dual purpose which saves money. I proposed investing in a bidet and she said that’s pointless and we might not even be able to do that because we’re renting and idk if our landlady would be able to allow us to, which is a fair point. But I just can’t get over it. I told her that she should stop it because we need it for other, better things and she said I should quit being controlling and leave her alone because she’s doing nothing wrong. I just can’t let it go though. This is so bizarre. Surely I’m not the only one who feels this way?",1170,6148,0.97
284,Not the A-hole,"My cousin (23M) does the same thing any time there’s a family gathering. He will start a conversation with someone about combat tactics, military fighting and stuff like that. He goes into detail and says stuff like “if you’re getting shot at from X by weapon X you should take cover at X angle which will give you the most X advantage because blah blah blah.” He wears camo all the time, has a bunch of bumper stickers on his car pertaining to military specific jokes and he uses military slang and jokes. He tries very very hard to act like he actually is in the military. 

He does motions and everything. If you didn’t know better you would think that he was some special ops vet who took people out on the daily. He only “knows” all of this from playing hours upon hours of games like Call of Duty and similar. 

My bf, who is a marine vet, thinks this behavior is amusing and doesn’t really care. However I find it extremely annoying that my cousin sits there and likes to pretend he’s knowledgeable on this stuff because of games. 

Now I’m not saying that the games are inaccurate because I’ve seen my bf play and they do teach you some decent skills and stuff. There’s nothing wrong with being nerdy about military stuff. It’s just the way he presents it. He doesn’t mention the game at all and leaves strangers believing that he actually does all of that stuff. 

The last straw for me came when we were at a gathering at some restaurant and he started a conversation with some girl who was there too.

I walked up and asked what they were talking about and he said “oh just about all this combat stuff.”  To which I replied “oh all those hours playing COD are really paying off huh?”

285,Not the A-hole,"My brother (19) is gay and our parents are not really accepting of that due to their religious background. He didn't feel comfortable staying with them so about a week ago he asked me if he could stay with his boyfriend with my husband and I. After some discussion with the spouse we agreed to let them use the guest room temporarily until he can get his own place.

Anyways his boyfriend is an aspiring chef and he wanted to pay us back for letting them stay with us. The problem is, it's only his fantasy, he's not actually any good at cooking. I wouldn't describe it as awful, but it's certainly not great. My husband is very prone to vomiting and it's not something he can control (he's seen an allergist for this btw, but she wasn't really helpful and I now know his tastes so I can cater to them; he did in fact throw up a lot of stuff involuntarily back when we first started dating and I'm a *good* cook!).

I suppose you can guess what happened. Brother's boyfriend tried cooked something (some sort of enchilada with custom made meatballs I think?) and it made husband nauseous; my husband hurled his creation in the sink. This upset my brother's boyfriend, and he started to berate my husband about respect. My husband argued with him, and my brother joined in, berating my husband as well. 

I saw red and told off my brother about respecting my household, but he brushed it off. Anyways the boyfriend tried cooking again yesterday and again made my husband throw up, and again the boyfriend went off on my husband, worse than the day before and accusing him of just faking it. My brother once *again* joined in; I had enough and told him to just get out if he wasn't going to respect us. After a screaming match he went back to our parents and now has been sending me angry texts about how I ruined his life and he never wants to see me again.

I'm M23 and mf gf is f21, we've been together for 3 years and living together for 1 year. She always wanted to get a dog for our place but I don't like dogs and don't want to take care of one. Her family dog passed away about 1 year ago and she's been nagging me even more for us to get a dog. I gave in around November of last year but on a few conditions. Mainly being I'd never take care of it, that means walking, feeding, picking up after it, taking it to the vet, cleaning up after messes etc. She was fine with this and we agreed we'd get a dog then. This lasted a few months until a few weeks ago when she became annoyed that I wouldn't take the dog for walks, feed it, or clean up after it when it shit in the kitchen a few times.

I told her we had a deal and its her dog not mine, so she has to take care of it. She called me a lazy POS and a huge asshole and has been pissed at me for a few days now.

288,Not the A-hole,"Hello! I’m really upset at the moment. I know this sounds immature and silly. We’re both 24 btw. 

So my boyfriend has been working from home while I’m just in grad school. I lost my job due to everything. Now my boyfriend’s work from home is really easy imo. He has his gaming computer open playing games all day with his work laptop open and checking for notifications/call requests. 

The game he’s been playing while he’s at work is Hearthstone if anyone is familiar with it. (It’s an online cards game like Magic the gathering I think.... sorry if I’m describing it wrong for any players out there). He tried to get me into it but I found the game extremely boring.

So my boyfriend gets to log off from work around 6-7ish and sometimes even later. Once he’s done we’ll go play Animal Crossing together and work on our island. It’s the little bit of bonding we get throughout the week. 

The problem is my boyfriend has started having Hearthstone on his phone and playing it while also playing Animal Crossing with me. He’ll tell me “hold on” and “give me a min” constantly and slow down our Animal Crossing game playing because I have to wait for him. This bothers me so much because a) he plays the game from 8am to 8pm sometimes while working and b) he’s ruining our little bit of bonding time during the week and c) I find it really immature that he can’t put his phone down to spend time with his girlfriend. He even plays Hearthstone or other gaming YouTube videos while we eat dinner. 

AITA for this? WIBTA if I ask him to not play on his phone while spending time with me at the end of the day? I play video games myself so it’s not an issue with gaming. It’s his frequency of playing it and how he prioritizes playing it over time with me when we have so little at the end of the day. 

Side note: Truly this concerns me because his parents are counting down the clock for grandkids but I don’t see my boyfriend being a responsible parent if he can’t put his phone down and absolutely has to play this game literally from morning to bedtime. Imagine if something happens to our hypothetical baby because he’s more focused on his phone. May be a reach but it truly scares me that I think he could cause something so bad from being glued to his phone.",35,34,0.89

I wear a 38"" waist in jeans and an XL/2XL in tops... for my birthday my girlfriend bought me a bunch of (expensive) new clothes that are WAY too small for me. 

She bought me jeans in a 28"" waist and tops in a medium.

She told me that I can wear them when I lose weight and hopefully they would motivate me. 

I mentioned once to her that when I was around 16/17 I was skinny and wore a 28, but I'm not sure it's feasible to get that skinny again. I'm not sure I even want to, I was borderline underweight. I gained the weight due to giving up sport and extreme depression and binge eating disorder that started at age 21. I don't binge anymore but I'm still fat.

She never consulted me on what I want to look like and I just feel kind of hurt and disrespected. I just feel like she's basically told me ""happy birthday you fat fuck"" lol..


I think she must be really disgusted by my body to do something like that. It's not her fault, my body really is disgusting, but I guess there's always a part of you that hopes your partner is attracted anyway.

293,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a single dad of my 19 year old son. He’s been dating a girl from his college since the beginning of freshman year, and when he came back she asked if she could stay with me instead of her parents. I thought about it pretty deeply because I didn’t really know how I felt about it at first, but I have a lot of extra space and I figured if I said no they’d try and see each other anyway despite the stay at home orders. I’ve been treating it as close to a regular roommate situation as I can, although he is my son so it’s not quite the same, but my house is big enough that they can keep to themselves without bothering me.

And not that I’ve been trying to listen to their conversations, but from what I’ve heard they’re very good for each other. They’re always very happy and nice to each other and there doesn’t seem to be any conflicts.

Anyway when she first moved in her parents had a meltdown, they called me and demanded I kick her out and make her go home. I told them I wasn’t going to do that and if she wants to leave she’s free to. She has her own car and it’s only a 45 minute drive to her home town. They berated me over the phone a few times and then finally gave in and let her stay. 

Apparently she let it slip over video chat that they’ve been sleeping in the same room(I don’t really know what her parents expected when she moved in with him... but ok) and they called me again and demanded I separate them. I told them that again if she wants to leave I’m not keeping her, she has the means to go home, it’s not like I’ve locked them in the same room. And there’s a third spare bedroom that she can stay in if she decides she for some reason does want to be separated. 

They said that I know what they’re doing in there and that it’s a tragedy that I’m endorsing it. From my point of view is they’re both the same age, technically adults, they can serve in the military, I’m sure whatever they do in there they were doing at college. They’re old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do.

299,Not the A-hole,"In January, I got a phone call from my brother (17) and he tells me he got kicked out and he has nowhere to go. He had a new job for a few weeks and really enjoyed it. I ask him to explain why he was kicked out. He told me that he decided to get a puppy without asking.

This turned into a huge argument between mom, brother and husband. The husband told our mom that this was the last straw and that he wasn’t going to be coming home unless she cut ties with my brother.He and my brother already had a rocky relationship.

I offered my brother to come stay with me, I live a few towns away. He declined because he said he needed to keep his job which was close so he could get to work daily. He dropped out of high school and just works. I respected his decision to keep his job as I can’t drive him 45 minutes each morning to work since he had no car but I did suggest that he find a good home for the dog so he would have a place to stay. I.e. a friends house, a shelter, etc.

My brother has depression and really felt like his world was going to end if he gave away the dog claiming that he needed her because he has “basically no friends” and now no family support besides me. We tried to call his grandmother who lives close to him and she no because of the dog.

That night we were able to find a place for him to stay with his dog. The next day he gets a phone call from his only other friend saying that my mom keeps calling to ask his mother to take guardianship. My mom barely knows her btw.

I decided to call our states help line which offers resources to people in need just to inquire if there were any options for him. She urged me to report the situation since my brother already has mental health issues and it may not be safe for him to be on his own. So she ended up taking a report and getting a social worker to reach out to them.

After this my mom got so mad at me. Which I understand to an extent. She was sending me long texts about how my brother deserved to be out and that she couldn’t take it anymore. Also about how she wanted her husband in her life and she wasn’t going to break up her marriage for him. She also changed the locks and said he wasn’t welcome.

My mother hasn’t spoken to me since that day.

301,Not the A-hole,"Ok so I may sound like a total a hole in the title but hear me out 

Disclaimer for bad grammar I’m upset and writing this quick.

Ok so for the last 3 years I have been aware that my brother goes in my room while I’m at school (he gets home an hour early as he’s in elementary and I’m in 8 grade middle school).

Now I don’t like the idea that he goes in my room but he also takes my stuff all the time. Wether that be a old toy of mine or my coveted  legos (yes I’m a little old for those go off). The worst part is my parents never tell him to give anything back or try and tell him that it’s not ok. Apparently cause he’s young he is t held responsible.

All this has brought us today where on our couch I found the bottom half of my Isabelle amibo that I was gifted. At this point I was pissed because I had cleaned his room the day prior for him because it was disgusting (I’m talking it took me almost 2 hours and still is not the best). 

Now I asked him in front of my dad why he stole it from my room and where the other piece was, and as usual when he gets in trouble he just closed his eyes and stoped responding. 

So I gave him an ultimatum, if he doesn’t tell me where the other piece is or I find it before tonight ends I’m taking back everything he’s stolen from me. This includes a significant portion of his LEGO toys.

I don’t think I’m being unfair as I’ve told him to stop a multitude of times and to cut it out and this was my breaking point. I don’t really need many of these things he’s taken so I may just donate them all if I can.

So would I be the asshole here?

Extra info: I’m 14 and he’s 6.
. I still enjoy legos however don’t use the ones he’s stolen as often anymore.
.He’s asked me for things in the past such as       some of my stuffed animals and other bigger things.


Update: so I’ve had a talk with my parents and as usual they’re very no receptive to what I’m saying and my dad went as far as to say “he didn’t take it out of the house so it’s not stealing”. That being said I talked with my brother and he, after a day of saying he didn’t know where it was, finally told me that it was in the bottom of a bucket and dug it out. My dad made him say sorry and I told him about not going in my room.

This is not a permanent solution as My parents are unlikely to enforce this however it’s a start and at least I have one of my many possessions that I cherish, back to it’s resting place in my room.

Thank you all for the advice and making sure I know I’m not the A-hole I’m letting him keep most of the stuff he’s taken cause most of it is stuff I don’t use however I am still taking back the legos.",129,417,0.94

I (18M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) since we were 14. We got together in freshman year, and are now in senior year. I love her more than life itself; she means the world to me and I am so lucky to have her. 

She used to have an eating disorder a couple years before high school, and was still dealing with it when we started dating. She's been actively recovering for just over 3 years now, and I'm so proud. She is much healthier and happier now. 

As she started recovering, she also started gaining weight. Nothing too crazy or sudden, but she's around 130lbs now (still 5'2"").

Earlier today, we were looking through photos from freshman year, and she made a comment along the lines of, ""I'm surprised you still love me even though I don't look like that anymore."" She has always thought no one would love her or think she's attractive if she wasn't skinny or had a flat stomach or small thighs, and it's the thing that's been the hardest for her to work through in her recovery. 

I responded by saying, ""I'll love you no matter what you weigh or how flat your stomach is or isn't.""

I didn't want to say something like ""You're still skinny!"" or ""You're not fat!"" because I don't want her to think I equate skinny with attractive, or think being fat is bad, because it's not. She knows I love her no matter what, and she'd still turn me on even if she was twice her size. 

She didn't say anything but she went to bed soon after, and when I peeked in to check on her, she was standing in front of the mirror and poking at her stomach. I felt like I fucked up, so I called her best friend, who is probably the only person who knows her better than I do, and explained what happened. 

Her friend said that I was an asshole for implying she isn't skinny, and that I should have assured her she's still thin, and that I made her feel bad for no reason. I tried to explain why I didn't just say ""You're still skinny"" and leave it, but she hung up. She then texted my girlfriend and told her I was being an asshole, and that she should reconsider our relationship. My girlfriend hasn't said anything, but her friend sent me a screenshot of the text messages.

When my son was born Ex wasn't there, and refused to sign the birth certificate. We were both teens at the time, but to this day Ex has never met his son. Ex's parents asked to be involved in my son's life, which I agreed to, and they are now a key part of my son's life. None of us have ever pressured Ex to be involved as we agree that we'd rather surround my son with people who want him than people who feel obligated to be there.

Present day, I have a fiance, Ex's parents are in their grandson's life, and my son is an amazing kid. I got a message from Ex, updating me on his life (married with a 2 year old) and asking if we can work out some sort of split custody. I messaged Ex's mum asking if she'd anything to do with this, and Ex's mum said she hadn't but his wife had probably encouraged him to reach out as them moving back is recent.

I told Ex we could try to work something out. Ex thanked me, but when I said I'd contact a lawyer to sort out a custody agreement, Ex asked why we needed a formal agreement, saying he'd assumed my fiance was adopting my son. Further discussion showed that he had no intention of adding himself to the certificate or signing anything, just seeing my son, off record, preferably every other week.

I emailed Ex and said I'd be willing to work something out but I need a formal agreement and him to claim his son legally before I let Ex meet him. Ex responded that he shouldn't have to ""jump through hoops"" to see his own son. Ex's mum messaged saying Ex had been complaining to her, and that she thinks it might be a money issue as the move is recent and his wife hasn't found a new job yet, so Ex could be worried about child support.

I wouldn't ask for any support, I don't need Ex's money and I'm pretty sure I make more than him, anyway, however I'm also not about to agree to alternating weeks with someone who legally has no connection to my son, and I don't want to agree to anything informally. I told Ex all this, and he said he doesn't have time to go through the legal stuff with a 2 year old and a new job. I said that if he doesn't have time for that then he doesn't have time to meet his oldest son, either. Ex then said he was trying and called me insensitive for not agreeing to anything.

Fiance is on my side, Ex's mum is staying out of this, and Ex and his wife have both messaged me asking me to reconsider. Ex has apologised and Ex's wife has made a plea to know her ""stepson"".

My sisters who are about 8 years older than I am have always struggled with our parents strict rules, especially those about clothing. They'd try to directly convince them to let them wear shorts or tank tops but then start yelling when they didn't agree. I however, realised at a young age that what I said to my parents didn't matter as much as how I said it. 

So growing up, I learned how to read my parents moods and what to say to them to turn the conversation into my favour. I am the first one to openly wear shorts and mini dresses in front of our parents without getting grounded or worse. 

There are things I have gotten that my sisters didn't simply because I knew how to ask and when to approach. I've tried telling my sisters how to look out for cues but they refuse to believe that I usually get what I want because I know 'how' to ask. The favourite child argument has been used against me a lot. 

Once, there was this strapless dress I really wanted to wear. I bet with my sisters that if I walked up to our parents and asked permission like they did our parents would disapprove. My sisters didn't believe me because they were steadfastly holding onto the 'OP is the favourite so of course parents would approve' belief. Sure enough, my parents shot it down before I could even get the full sentence out of my mouth. 

They still didn't believe me but it turned from 'OP is the favourite' to 'OP is manipulating our parents to get what she wants, how unchristian can she get?' 

I'm a second year uni student and a few months ago my parents let me go on holiday with all of my friends. This is when shit hit the fan. My sisters were only allowed to go on holidays within the country with their female friends during their university years, no matter how much they begged to go abroad or with boys. But our parents let me fly to Spain with all of my friends, guy friends inclusive. 

We got in a screaming match where I ranged from being the favourite child to 'brainwashing' our parents and my personal favourite ""manipulative piece of shit"".

About 2 weeks ago ‘D’, the roommate whose grandmother rents us the house, informed me that our other roommate, ‘S’, recently let him know that he would be moving out “in like a month.” “D” was pretty vague about the details and this news had “D” kinda stressed out about having to find a new roommate on short notice

A few days later my g/f and I were discussing it and decided to go to “D” to talk about her moving in with her kitties and taking up “S” portion of the rent, to which “D” agreed. 

For context: We had made this decision because over the last 7 months we have been commuting back and forth between her place and mine which is approx an hour away. Since she has small kitties that can’t be left alone for more than 2 nights at a time & no vehicle, so we spend the vast majority of our time at her place. In the month of March I spent exactly 3 nights at my house, 2 of which with my gf. And if I were to guess she has probably spent in total, 3 maybe, 4 weeks at my place spread out since October. The ratio of time spent between her place and my place is probably a 90/10 split.  

Today, My RM “S” sent “D” and I a long text so, I’m paraphrasing - slightly.

“hey guys, I’m gunna be moving in May. I’m taking the living room furniture, microwave and anything else that’s mine. Start thinking about replacements for that stuff.  
I’ll pay my rent this month but I don’t think I’ll pay at the end of May, I think OP & his gf should pay my share b/c of all the time she has spent here for free already. Tbh, living w/four ppl & two broken toilets is partly why I’m moving out it’s not worth the money -
I’ll probably be out by mid May. Lmk if you guys have any questions.”

(To be clear we didn’t break the toilets.  We have hard water and when the filter doesn’t get maintained it rusts up the pipes.)

AITA for thinking that is completely ridiculous & refusing to pay for his share of the rent for a month that he will still be living here because he thinks my girlfriend has slept over too often?",43,164,0.91
311,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory on my phone throw away account etc etc. 
Back story - I (26f) moved out at 19 and have lived independently since. My cooking skills have obviously grown from jam on toast to fairly complicated meals. Although we have a recipe book, quite often I do extras or swap ingredients or mix and match from the recipe book because of the added flavour. 

Husband (27m) lived at home until he moved in with me at 24. I’ve always cooked in our relationship (I absolutely love it, it’s my favourite thing to do after a long day at work) and recently he’s been joining me in the kitchen whilst I cook and “helping”. 

But everything I do is wrong. Everything. I’ve cut it wrong, it’s too many, not enough, you didn’t follow the recipe to the t! You’ve not cooked the onions for long enough, you added the sauce too early too late etc etc. And I’d had enough today. I was peeling potatoes for a roast dinner and chopping them up ready to cover in lard and go in the oven and he tells me I need to boil them first (whilst yes you can boil them first and in the past I have, I wanted to follow my dads suggestion so I wasn’t going to this time) I said I’m not boiling them just going to roast them, he relies no that’s not the recipe from the book and grabs a pan sticks the bits that I’ve already chopped in... I’m annoyed but fine we’ll boil them whatever. 

Then I put lard in the tray ready for when they’ve boiled and turn around to peel carrots and he puts olive oil in the same tray. I’m like what why have you done that? He says it’s got to be oil not lard! You’re doing it wrong! And I just snapped this has been building all week and I said there can’t be two head chefs you’re either helping me cook and listening to me or you’re getting out the kitchen! Well he didn’t like that and shouted back I was wrong and don’t listen and don’t follow instructions (baring in mind he’s never once complained about the taste of the actual meals and quite often says how nice they are). 

And then he left the room. 5 minutes later I went up to talk to him and he’s still angry and I lose my temper and I say to him “you don’t respect my decisions as a cook, you’re constantly questioning everything I do and telling me I’m wrong and not listening to me when I try to explain what I want to do and why I’m doing it that way” and he just said I don’t want to talk to you fuck off - now I was so pissed off I said fine you’re not eating my food tonight then you “see you next tuesday” you can cook your own food! And he said “fine clean up your own mess you bitch and slammed the door to his office.... 
we’ve both calmed down and although I’ve apologised for shouting at him he is ignoring me. I did serve up his plate and left it in the microwave, I told him where it is and he hasn’t touched it :( 
AITA ? 

Tdlr 
Husband told me I was wrong, got mad, a few bad words were exchanged, he got mad I said he couldn’t have tea and he is now ignoring me.

Update - he apologised he was angry with himself for upsetting me, he’s apologised for shouting and for telling me how to cook and he’s agreed to cook tea tonight! 

Update 2 - he cooked pizza and managed to burn it 😂 he says he will let me cook without telling me off in future and promises he’ll let me be head chef 👨‍🍳

312,Not the A-hole,"So I've posted before about my flatmate and his girlfriend and they're back again!

So my flatmates girlfriend has been staying here for about a month now and she's actually a really nice girl and we get on quite well. Now, yesterday she offered to cook a roast dinner for me and my boyfriend since she was cooking one for them and had extra food. I'm 7 weeks pregnant and morning sickness has been kicking my ass so I really appreciated the offer and accepted.

It's probably important to mention that we ate separately, so she didn't see how much we ate or how we reacted or anything. I went into the kitchen to see if she needed any help or anything and noticed that things were doing.... not so great. Somethings were overcooked and going cold on plates while some things, like the chicken had been taken out of the oven raw and had to be put back in to cook longer. I didn't want to upset her as I realise it's probably a lot to deal with, sorting out timings can be hard especially when cooking a big meal for several people and I didn't want to be rude about it so just carried on helping. 

When the food was eventually done I took mine and my boyfriends into our room and we started to eat. I don't mean to sound rude when I say this but the food wasn't that great. The potatoes were burnt and dry, the chicken was still raw, the vegetables were raw too and the parsnips were still frozen so we only ended up picking at the food and not really eating it. We did try a little bit of everything just to see but we didn't really want to eat it so we decided to get a bag and put it in that and put some of the rubbish from our room on top to hide it. My boyfriend then put it straight into the outside bin so she wouldn't see it inside as we didn't want to upset her. After this I texted her to say thankyou and I washed all the dishes as I did really appreciate her taking the time and effort to cook for us, so I thought it was the least I could do. 

It turns out this morning she went to put something into the outside bin because she didn't want it to make the kitchen smell and saw that the bag we used was half empty and wanted to utilise the space, I guess. And then she saw the 80% of our meals we had thrown away and got upset. I got a message from my flatmate saying we had been rude and ungrateful about her cooking for us, which isn't true. I hate that we upset her because I know it feels awful when someone doesn't like your cooking but we tried to hide it and I still thanked her and showed appreciation but she's still very upset with us, which I kind of understand. They're of the opinion that we should've just eaten the food and been grateful for what she did, which I can understand.

So, AITA for throwing away the food she cooked for me?",21,25,0.84
313,Not the A-hole,"
A background on this friend and our friendship: We’ve been friends since I was six. She is 16 and I am 17. She lives with her grandparents, who are my neighbors, after spending her toddler years in foster care and has recently been struggling with school and mental health. 

So a few weeks ago, she was over my house getting help with her school work. After she was done with her school work then went home. I left my airpods out from the night before. When I woke up in the morning, I wanted to use my airpods and couldn’t find them. I looked around the house and when I still couldn’t find them I made her a suspect because she has stolen my earrings this past fall, which I let her off the hook for.  I knew she wasn’t home but her little sister was, so I walked up to her house and searched for them.  After they were found, she came home and I asked “why would you take these from me?” And she replied “I was borrowing them”. I went home because I was so mad and didn’t want to argue anymore. She later texted me “i’m sorry” and I said I wasn’t accepting the apology, i cant trust her anymore and I wanted an explanation for why she stole. The explanation was that “she wasn’t thinking clearly and saw something she was really jealous of and wanted” and I wasn’t having that. I said “wdym not thinking clearly? you had plenty of time to think.” We continued talking, her apologIzing and me not accepting. Finally she stopped texting. The next day she texted saying that she was sorry, and life is so short that I should forgive because she can die any day. I texted back saying that i’m not forgiving. We went back and forth and I still wasn’t accepting the apology. She finally called me an a*hole and a bad person after I told her if she was so concerned about death she should think about being the best person she could be. When she continued to get mad at me for not forgiving her, she started to say I was a horrible friend and that I didn’t care about her. By this time i was MAD. I called her out for everything she did. Like how i stood by her for her racist posts, how she is so mean to all my other friends and how she gets mad at me for the littlest things. She then told me if she that I made her feel unsafe in her own body and other things in that category. She ended the conversation with “im gonna go talk to my real friend who will make me feel better. find a better friend who doesn’t make mistakes”. I stopped replying but texted her grandparents that she was texting concerning stuff. A couple days later she said “are you still not talking to me” and i said no and repeated why I was mad, and adding that she was so rude when I explained why I was mad. She said “youre gonna regret this” and we havent talked since.",27,36,0.86
314,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 24 year old woman of Indian heritage and I've been dating my white boyfriend (26) for the past 3 years. 

My boyfriend loves my cooking I often cook Indian dishes like Butter chicken, saag paneer, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala for him. 

So back in mid march, my boyfriend's father and his wife came to visit us all the way from Alabama to tell my boyfriend about their pregnancy. Of course, we had no idea that she was 5 months pregnant when they told us they were coming over. 

We assumed it would a 3 night thing and then we'd go back to living our normal lives. 

Obviously, the situation changed and they're now stuck here for a while. 

Truth be told, we were definitely not prepared for their extended stay. Now, I often cook Indian for my boyfriend and I have a lot of spices and masalas stored in my kitchen. (Some of which I actually got from my ancestral village in India).


Turns out his stepmom can't handle the smell of Indian spices, so we decided to stop cooking Indian food. 

However, last night we were basically like F it! we have had enough! and decided to treat ourselves to a garlic naan and butter chicken dinner. 

His stepmom and father were at the hospital the whole day, and I utilized that time to cook. 

When they got home, my boyfriend and I were just about to start our dinner. The moment she stepped inside, she scrunched her nose up in disgust and complained about our home smelling like curry. 

Then she asked what was in the menu. When I offered them to eat with us, she said that she'd rather not as the food apparently looked like poop. I was legitimately angry at this point, but I wasn't going to lose my cool on a pregnant lady. 

Later in the night, she had a craving and woke me up from my sleep asking for left over butter chicken. Oops. We didn't save any. 

She then ordered my boyfriend's dad to get her  Indian food. The poor dude spent 2 hours out driving in the middle of the night looking for Indian food but he didn't get any. 

When he came back empty handed, his wife threw a toddler tantrum crying about wanting butter chicken. His dad then asked me to cook it for her. I put my foot down. It was 4 in the morning and I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the kitchen. 

His stepmom then guilt tripped my boyfriend about not caring about his unborn brother. (WTF?)

316,Not the A-hole,"LTL/FTP, throwaway acc cos family members know my main and I don't need the stress.

My husband and I are choosing baby names. We both have Scottish and Irish heritage -- several family members either having an anglicized version of a Scottish/Irish first name or surname. 

We are strongly considering giving our child a Gaelic name. Our top three contenders if it's a girl are Saoirse, Ealasaid, and Marsaili. Two of the boys names we like are less difficult for an English speaker to pronounce -- Eamon and Seòras -- but the other one, Eoghan, might confuse some people. 

I DO strongly believe we should give them an English-friendly middle name, think Ealasaid Rose (we haven't gotten that far yet lol), so that they have another name to fall back on if they need it. Husband is on board with this.

My MIL and my sister, however, think that this would be horribly cruel even with the middle name thing and insist we HAVE TO give them a ""normal"" first name -- Elizabeth instead of Ealasaid, for example. Neither me nor my husband like the way Elizabeth sounds (nor any of its diminutives), and the same goes for Sarah instead of Saoirse and Marjory instead of Marsaili (Marge just makes me think of the Simpsons). The same goes for the boy's names.

MIL has gone so far as to say she will call them by the English equivalent and will make Husband's younger siblings do the same. I told her that's a one-way ticket to No Visits Town, which she handled as well as you'd imagine.

I was always hungry & dirty, left with abusive caretakers while she was dripping with jewels & furs, exploring Europe. She moved us around so much I could never make friends. I became industrious & got money mowing lawns, babysitting & making art. Once I was able to move out I had my life together until one tragedy after another just left me too depressed to act. I managed to pull my self out of it & make a name for myself. My desperate need for approval & stability found it in an abusive relationship that lasted 10 years. I became a raging alcoholic with truly bad health. Once I finally didn’t recognize the person in the mirror I made up my mind to leave. I didn’t exactly get clean but I put my life back together & reconnected with an old flame. We got married & reveled in our low income lifestyle. We made some good faith bad decisions & ended up in debt. We made some hard but necessary decisions & got on top of it. Then my mother died & left me some money. I paid off my husband’s car & got one for myself outright. I got health insurance & fixed my teeth, had a mani/pedi or 2 then started paying off my debts.

320,Not the A-hole,"My roommate works late night shifts, so she often sleeps during the day. Me, I am doing online classes, but for various reasons my schedule tends to be unpredictable - sometimes I'm nocturnal, sometimes I'm not. This is well known.

&#x200B;

My roommate's boyfriend likes to come over while she's sleeping and cuddle with her while she's asleep. She knows it, she's fine with it, it's happened before. She thinks it's romantic.

&#x200B;

Usually, I don't care one way or the other what they do. But the one thing I requested was some warning before he comes over. I've let him in while she's sleeping before, but that's when he texts me first to say he's coming and gives me time to at least make sure I have pants on.

&#x200B;

A few minutes ago, the buzzer went off. I ignored it because we don't usually let people in without notice and the people down the hall tend to have parties where they ring the wrong door anyway. I didn't realize it was the boyfriend until he starts trying to call me on messenger. I didn't answer, because I'm ""asleep."" So he keeps buzzing, which is setting the dog off, which is going to wake my roommate, which I think is pretty fucking thoughtless of him since she works at night. 

&#x200B;

I \*could\* have gone to open the door anyway, as it's not his fault my schedule is erratic and I don't wear many clothes in my own room. I could have done it just so she wouldn't be woken up. But all I asked for was warning and I didn't get any warning.

Her father has been very cranky and critical these last few week though. I get that he's stressed, but so am I and some of it is very aggressive. 

For example, my daughter wanted to do that challenge where you do a handstand and put a shirt on. I filmed her attempts and sent them to her father. She was laughing the whole time and because she was doing a sort of angled handstand against the wall, she would fall on her knees and not her head or neck. I thought it was a cute video and sent it to her dad. I immediately got bombarded with texts and voice messages yelling at me for letting her do something so dangerous and calling me a reckless mother and an attention grabber (I didn't post the video anywhere public, just sent it to her dad and grandma). 

Another time I sent him a photo of our daughter eating frozen peas and corn out of the bag. She hates both of them hot but likes to snack on them when they're frozen. I thought the picture was cute and sent it to him and he sent back a snarky message accusing me of neglecting her and not cooking her nutritious and filling meals. 

It's all been very draining on top of everything so I just told him that I will not be sending anymore photos and videos. He's welcome to call whenever but I'm done sending him snapshots of our daughter's day because he's so damn critical. He's very angry and feels that I should continue sending the photos because he misses her and is missing visitation.

323,Asshole,"My (21) boyfriend (20) has a cat who he's completely in love with. Saying this is not at all exaggerated. He fawns over her like one would *maybe* do over a new kitten for the first day, but he had this cat since he was seven. Basically, I'm jealous of the cat. This sounds so pathetic but please hear me out:

He treats the cat as if she were his girlfriend and not I. The only things they don't do are french kissing and having intercourse. For real: she gets more physical attention than I ever did. When he's cooking, Cat always gets a small piece of meat before it's seasoned but he rarely shares anything with me that way. Cat has her own chair at his family's table. This might have been normal in his family of four at a table with four chairs and a bench but I'm always seated on the bench when I'm over, as to not take Cat's chair. He talks to Cat like one would to a human partner, sometimes even calls her ""darling"" or similar. 

He gives her those pecks on the forehead which aren't that uncommon for pet owners, (I did so myself when I had a dog) but he does so in passing all the time like they're a newly in love couple. Yesterday they were lying forehead to forehead, cuddling for at least half an hour. If we're watching TV and she's in his lap first I'm not allowed to disrupt her to cuddle with him. When coming home he often greets her before me or does so more enthusiasticly.

Basically, he's totally obsessed with this cat to a point that it seems unhealthy. Apart from that, he's the perfect guy for me, we rarely even fight about anything. Cat is also really sweet, I love her like she's mine, but I'm not willing to share my spot as girlfriend with her. His family roll their eyes to this, but they seem to view it as still reasonable. I'm worried for my BF and, admittedly, also a bit jealous. I also fear what's going to happen when Cat dies eventually; after all she'll be 13 this month so she's definitely not young anymore.

324,Everyone Sucks,"My wedding was a few months ago, and I deliberately didn't invite my uncle. He'd hit on my wife in a really weird way at a family event that year. (My wife and I are both women for the record) 

And on my wedding day, there he is... I guess his brothers invited him along? 

One of my friends is a total firecracker, she's brave as anything and not afraid to say what's on her mind. She and two other friends of mine were my bridesmaids and I was telling them about my uncle having shown up, before the ceremony. 

She asked what I wanted them to do, they could kick him out, they could ignore him, or anything in between. I said that getting him out would be great. She asked if it would bother me if she drew attention to the whole mess. I said no.

So she marched right up to this guy in the pews and told him in front of everyone ""get the fuck out, you weren't invited for a reason."" And he asked what the matter was, what was going on, and she went ""you fucking know what you did, get your creepy incestous ass out of here or me and OPs family is getting you out"". My other bridesmaids walked over with her but didn't say anything

He left and I asked her later what the ""incestous"" comment was about, and she was like ""Uhh he was trying to screw future family? Gross."" And while I thought that was a little of an exaggeration I honestly put the whole thing out of my mind that day.

But apparently that caused a whole lot of gossip and speculation and shit in my family. Some of my family members are also upset my friend told my uncle that my family would kick him out, when they would not do that.

326,Not the A-hole,"I'm(16m) am from a blended family. My dad kicked my mom out after she got pregnant with my half-brother(14). My mom then went on to marry my half-brother's father.

When my dad left my mom, he had just landed a good job in finance whereas my mother was a nursing student and my stepdad was a DJ. So obviously, my time with my dad was pretty different.  I spend the week with my mom and step-dad then my dad would take me for the weekend and he always had something plan. We'd go to Disney or we'd go fishing or wakeboarding. The only problem was that as I got older, my mom would make me stop talking about my time with my dad in front of my brother. She'd also either make me share gifts that my dad bought me or if I didn't want to she'd take them and give them to my brother until my dad picked me up. 

When it came to clothes my dad would have my stepmom take me shopping(she's a fashion writer). My mom would take my brother and me to the thrift store but she would once in a while take my brother to actual clothing stores but never for me. Earlier this school year, I hit a huge growth spurt and none of my clothes fit me properly. I asked my mom if she could take me shopping and yet again she was going to take me to the thrift store because only one her sons deserves new clothes. I told her to forget it and my stepmom and dad took me shopping to replace all my old clothes. My dad then suggested that I sell my old clothes to have some spending money.
 
A few weeks later I have enough money to get a car and my brother was getting ready for his first party. he was having a wardrobe malfunction so my mom came and asked me if he could borrow some of my old clothes. After a while of going through my closet, she asks about a pair of Balmain jeans and a Hugo Boss shirt and a pair of Jordans. I told her I told my dad they didn't fit me anymore so he bought me a bunch of new clothes and let me sell the old clothes. She got upset and told me I should've asked before I sold them. I told her my dad was someone and asked why she cares since my dad was the one that bought them. She told me some bullshit about how my brother doesn't have as many opportunities to get ""cool"" clothes like me and that instead of selling them I should give them to him. I told her that she needs to stop punishing me because my dad can treat me right. I'm tired of her favoring my brother and considering how he was conceived I think it would be disrespectful to my father to give them to my brother. My mom teared-up a bit, grabbed some clothes that she actually bought me and gave them to my brother. 

Things have been kinda rocky since then and I'm living primarily with my dad RN. To her credit she did apologize for how she handled the disparity between her and my dad but she still thinks the ""brotherly"" thing to do is share with my brother.

Now, his class trip has been cancelled. His mother and father now have possession of the money and intend on using for their own purposes. 
The money was a gift to him, not their family.

I recently moved to California for awhile to pursue college and build up the relationship with my family out there
My mom, step dad, and step sister are all cool but no matter what happens, I cant find it in me to want to associate with my brother anymore (male. 20)
Like
He always yells,  calls people names, is asking for money to cover his  car insurance Bill's but spends all of his money on games and drugs
Eventually it got to the point where he spent his entire college fund on microtransactions on GTA V
He lied about where it went saying it went into stocks but it eventually came out he was hiding it

As kind of a 1 time bailout thing, I took a personal loan out for him so he could continue going to college since he wanted to keep going and paid for the semester he owed and the following
Turns out that he wasnt even going to any of his classes and had literally a 0 percent grade in each of his classes and I just wasted my money. Ontop of that. He consistently says I dont do anything for him when I wont help him with getting rides to his ""plugs"" and telling him how to ""give a girl a miscarriage without her knowing ""

He started doing drugs and blowing me off and actually damaged my car so I cut him off for awhile
Eventually,  he got into a really bad accident because he was texting and driving and broke his femur and totaled his car
I was there for him as a person because I hoped maybe this life changing event would actually change him
My mom got him a car with and he only had to pay his insurance. 
She stayed up every night for hours and home from work to make sure he was doing okay and on the correct meds and he was being taken care of
It didnt really matter to him. He started giving her attitude for dumb things
Like, my mom wouldnt allow drugs in the house because of my step dads work, or for him to be out after 2am without letting my mom know whatsup .

He started calling her names and cussing at her and etc. 
Eventually, it got really bad to where she found cocaine and other hard drugs in his backpack along with a machete and another club like weapon
My mom took that to the police and kicked my brother out 
My brother reacted by getting his friends to try and intimidate my mom by harassing her at her home and work and following her around
The police actually had to get involved
Eventually,  my brother apologized and my mom took him back with open arms but I'm not budging
I dont want him in my life and I think its awful.how he treats everyone there and walks all over everyone

One is over my actual bedroom door holding my coats/jackets, and I decided to put my collection of plaid shirts on the other. There are other plain shirts on this rack but they're all buttoned and dad hates all of them. I can't hang them inside my wardrobe because due to my reorganisation the space they used to occupy is now taken up with jeans/joggers, non buttoning shirts, and shoes.

335,Asshole,"I've finally about had it with these assignments we've been having for our PE class. To explain in an unbiased manner, these assignments require us to fill out information about people from a particular sport using a packet given to us online.

Now it doesn't sound difficult to complete (they're just very, very time consuming), but the PE teachers didn't make these assignments for online learning, they are make up assignments they've been using for years. And that is my first complaint that they are getting paid full wage to do probably not even a quarter of the work they were doing before, make the assignment available and grade it when it gets turned in.

My second complaint is that these assignments have nothing to do with PE itself. Imagine if Math teachers only taught about mathematicians, but not math itself; or if English teachers only taught about authors, but nothing of the author's works or how they influenced English. The same argument is made here for PE, we are learning about the people who played these sports, but not a single question on the sport itself. 

The only reason I can see myself being the asshole for wanting to complain is because some kids actually have classes much more difficult than this PE class and that I'm complaining about something very miniscule compared to actually very difficult classes. I can also the reasoning behind why they did it; they're semi-easy, but time consuming assigments pre-made and ready to be assigned and all they have to do is grade them when they're turned back in.

<><><><><><><><><><>

Edit: It seems some of the people commenting have looked over the part where I mentioned these assignments were already pre-made and ready to go many years ago. I also wanna add here that I wanna complain because many teachers are actually doing very hard work and preparing all sorts of lessons and videos for students, but not the PE teachers who are reusing assigments from the past. 

The questions aren't difficult, you just have to search through literal pages of information to find one thing about one person, but for the teacher it's a quick ""yes"" ""no"" or ""maybe"" and takes probably 5 seconds for a single question if that. No exaggeration, I promise.

<><><><><><><><><><>

Edit the 2nd: I think it might be beneficial to add that these assigments started after our spring break two weeks ago, giving them a total of three weeks to create something they haven't already used. Today, we got a repeat assignment of the very first one they gave us two weeks ago. 

Many are right, I don't know what it's like the be a teacher, but the PE tests we used to have every two weeks related to the sport we were doing for those two weeks were much easy than what we are doing now. The tests asked questions about the specifics of the sport like lengths of fields or the names of certain moves or equipment; these are the type of questions they have available that they could've turned into homework assignments.

<><><><><><><><><><>

3rd and final Edit: I really should've added a lot more detail than I did, this is on me and I hope this is the last edit I have to make. At my school, we did almost everything online to begin with. English, Civics, History, Math, etc have all been almost entirely online. Even PE had tests and make up homework online. The only thing that majorly changed is that lesson plans now have to be done on an app called NearPod (which most teachers already used) or through video recording of them giving the lesson on a TV at home.

I explained in the previous edit what they could've done for PE which they had plenty of time to do. My school adapted very well to online learning even if some teachers were more lazy in their approach than others. I'm essentially calling out the PE teachers ***at my school specifically***  for this because their approach was very lazy and could've been handled much better than how they did. That is a fact based on what they had available to work with, the time they had to prepare, and the knowledge they already pocessed to make something that doesn't take two hours complete.",61,35,0.79

338,Not the A-hole,"This has bothered me since I was a little kid. 

I started reading really early. My mom said no one taught me to read; just one day when I was 3, she realized I could. 

I was about 7 when my mom's belly started getting noticably bigger. I learned I would be having a sibling soon. I had a bunch of questions my religious  mom wasn't comfortable answering so she got me a book called A Child Is Born by Lennart Nilssen. In it, I learned how a baby gets gestated and born. I don't remember learning about adoption, but at the time of this event, I knew it meant your bio parents couldn't care for you and someone else stepped in to do it. I knew sometimes it was a secret and sometimes it wasn't.

Shortly after my brother was born, he and I started seeing a new baby sitter because my previous one didn't watch newborns. This new sitter had two daughters. A 4 yr old and a 5 yr old. My first day there, they still had some of the decorations from having the 4 yr old's bday party. Very shortly after that, they had a party for the older one turning 6 yrs old. And then the following month, I showed up and they wanted me to help make party decorations with them. I asked who's bday it was going to be this time and they said ""it's our adoption bday tomorrow"". 

So I asked if they knew their real parents. The girls were like yeah mom's in the kitchen making snacks and dad is at work. I knew those people were their parents for real but hey - that's not what I meant. I explained it to them. And then the drama started.....

They started crying and everyone was yelling; it was a total shit show. These adults had told the kids they were adopted without explaining what that meant. The kids talked about it freely so I figured it was no secret. I just wanted to know, since one was almost 2 yrs older than the other, if they knew their bio parents at all. Did the older one remember them? Where they from different parents each or where they from the same set of parents since their adoption anniversary was on the same day? 

Everyone was super mad at me and told me off. I had to sit by myself for hours till pick up time. When my mom came to pick us up, we all had a meeting where I, again, got really chewed out for being inappropriate. The sitter didn't want to watch me anymore. To this day I still don't know how they figured they could openly tell them they were adopted but not explain what that meant without something coming out.",140,598,0.92

So she said she would but it never actually happened, so things kept going up and down until this breaking point where he decided to kick us all out in a days difference (yes he really was serious he even changed the lock of the door in front of our faces without giving us a new key) so it was at this point i said i could stay with my grandma because we didn't have money to afford a 3 bedroom apartment at the time so i decided to just make things on her easier and move with my grandma. My sister is still with my mom at what i thought was her now ex-boyfriend but soon enough come to find out that my mom got back with him and they are just both acting like all is fine... i guess it was easier when they got me out of the picture.

The home-classes and home-office suited best for me as I started keeping up with classes more than my usual.

In one of my classes however, the professor sent the class notes and voice recordings to students through e-mail but forgot to bcc the students. Instead she allowed everyone to see the other students e-mails in the recipients list. I replied her for the first time ever to remind her of EU GDPR rules, and requested that she started sending those e-mails to me through bcc and thanked her for her work in this bad times and wished the best for her health.

But the e-mail I received was rather an outrage, asking me whether am I a legal advisor to the dean or the rector, saying that I am trying to hide something, i am a self proclaimed famous person, and I am disrespectful because only the dean or the rector could ask something like that from her.

She also happens to be a foreign national and said that ""Is it so easy for you to do so because I am a foreign national and I am more likely than A citizen to get afraid?""

The problem is that I eat a lot of foods my boyfriend considers gross. Some of these are foods everybody considers gross, and others are things just he does. 

Things he thinks are gross: melted cheese, shredded cheese, hummus, chickpeas, fries in milkshakes, this Indian yogurt I eat, and peanut butter with nothing else.

A little bit of backstory.

My  mom is still single, and my dad remaried, for the record I never liked  my stepmother, but she hasn't really done anything special to make me  dislike her, I just do, its probably the fact that I got introduced to  her while she was almost moving in together with my dad and I guess  living with a stranger is uncomftable (?).

When  I was graduating high school, my school launched a graduation ceremony  and since I did not want stepmother in there, I said none of my parents  could bring their couples (my mom had a wonderful boyfriend at the time  who I liked to hang out with, but to make it fair to my dad and to make  things less uncomftable for everyone I decided on this), my dad got mad  that his wife was not invited and said ""If she is not comming, Im not  comming"", and so he did, seeing as my dad was not comming, I decided my  mom's bf could come to the party since what was the point of keeping it  that way if neither my dad or stepmom were coming?

Anyway  my dad got even madder when he saw the graduation pictures and seeing  mom's bf in there, thinking back about it I make have been the asshole  in this situation.

Now, some years  later, Im getting married (not the best time to get married I know),  and we decided to make personalized invitations so I asked both my  parents for the names of the people they wish to invite, so they both  send theirs, and while checking the list with my mom, she notices some  names in my dad's list that she doesn't like. The name was about a  friend my dad has had since college, and yesterday my mom told me that  when they divorced this friend made sure to make my mom's life  misserable because religious matters I guess, not only that, but she  invented rumors about my dad, turned all of mom's friends against her  and even told her on her face she was a whore for divorcing my dad, and  also threatened my mom to hurt her were it would be the most painful to  her (me). As she told me all this, I got really mad, since remembering  the time of the divorce my mom was really suffering and a lot of things  just fell into place. Of course I agreed this friend could not come to  the wedding, so I called my dad and explained the situation ( he knew  about all the bullying this friend did to my mom, and still decided to  invite her).

We had a lot of people over, and I don't know a proper way of saying it, but when she was breast feeding her son there were a lot of times where her breasts were just completely uncovered. Like she wasn't breast feeding normally at all. Her son would walk away and she would leave herself exposed.

I offered her our guest room that we have on the ground floor of the house if she wants privacy. I even offered her a towel. She insisted that she was okay. I told her I was like hey can you please do a better job of covering up. 

&#x200B;

She flipped out on me, her husband without saying anything just got their daughter from my daughter's room and left. I don't see myself as the asshole here, in that a lot of people were uncomfortable. I don't have a problem with breast feeding really it is just have some decency.",763,2349,0.95
350,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying I don't expect my boyfriend's kids to default respect me, treat me like a mother figure, or anything like that. Respect in my book is earned even when it comes to adolescents (especially teenagers) and adults. But I do however expect general common courtesy. 

So I have been staying at my BF's house and have basically taken over the cooking as well as providing groceries to help out and alleviate some of the stress as he is an essential worker. Now, for the most part, I get along with his children Kay (17f), Ben(14m), and May(9f). Kay can have a bit of an attitude towards her dad though as well as myself but I generally try to let it go because I remember what it was like being a teenager. You're on the cusp of being an adult but not quite so it's an awkward time filled with the need to push boundaries and assert yourself. But lately, Kay has become increasingly hostile I assume part of it is because no one can go anywhere right now so I've tried to give leeway and not take it personally but last night was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I make a pretty amazing meatloaf that I top with homemade macaroni and cheese. It's a very hearty meal, it keeps well, and there are always leftovers because I make a rather large batch. Also, pertinent information is I grew up in CA and now live in the south so meatloaf is slightly different I don't put the red gravy on top of it. 

Last night when I served dinner everyone sat down and seemed to really be enjoying their meals, well all except for kay who pushed her plate away. When her dad asked her what was wrong she said that the meatloaf wasn't made right. He calmly tried to explain that just because it's not what she's used to doesn't mean it's not done right.  She then asked if I made the macaroni and cheese from a box (she doesn't like the box kind) I told her no it's made from scratch I got the recipe online. To which she replied that if I followed a recipe it wasn't homemade or from scratch. So I told her fine if you don't want to eat it that's ok, but my food is homemade just because I followed a recipe that doesn't make it not homemade. 

Well, she called me a fucking bitch, got up and left the table. I left the table shortly after to cool off and my bf comes outside yelling at me for being rude to his daughter and making her go to bed hungry. I told him I didn't make her go to bed hungry she could have made her own food if she wanted something else as she is old enough to make her own dinner. I also explained that I was upset over her comments and he brushed it all aside saying she's a teenager it's not a big deal. So now I feel like this huge AH and am not sure if I was in the right or not here. AITA?

Edit: since everyone keeps asking for the recipe here it is. Hope you all enjoy it.

Meatloaf

2 lbs of ground beef
2 eggs
Bread crumbs (about a cups worth give or take)
1 1/2 cup of ketchup (I eyeball this to make sure it's not too wet)
Salt
Pepper, 
Garlic powder
Onion powder (to taste on seasonings)
1 1/2 cups of croutons (I prefer the texas toast cheesy garlic ones. 

Mix well making sure the bread crumbs entirely cover the outside while the inside has the moist ketchup and eggs for binding. Make sure you press it down so it's compacted leaving about an inch or more of space at the top.

Cook for approximately 45 mins at 350 degrees. 

While it's cooking prepare the macaroni and cheese. 

You'll need 

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

3 cups of milk

1/4 cup butter

2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons butter

1/2 cup bread crumbs

Pinch of paprika 

Cook macaroni according to the package directions. Drain. In a saucepan, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Stir in enough flour to make a roux. Add milk to roux slowly, stirring constantly. Stir in cheeses, and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and the sauce is a little thick. Pour macaroni and cheese mix on top of the meatloaf. Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and brown. Spread over the macaroni and cheese to cover. Sprinkle with a little paprika. Return to oven and cook for another 30 minutes. Then serve",393,1834,0.96
351,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my brother uses reddit. First time poster; sorry if I make any dumb mistakes. 

I (22F) was on a group call with my brother (26M) and mother (55F) as we usually meet up for dinner once a week but can’t go on outings due to the world’s current state. Anyway, we were chatting about what we were all doing and I mentioned that my schoolwork was getting hard. I’m in my school’s nursing program and since everything switched online we’ve gotten an insane amount assignments trying to make up for clinical hours being cancelled. 

When I made this comment, my brother snorted at my remark. He’s made several hurtful remarks about my education because he went to a four year school and thinks community college is “for losers”. I got mad and told him to just say what he wanted to say. He said “It can’t be that hard and you know it.” I will admit that I got defensive very quickly because this is an incredibly touchy subject for me and told him that I was sick of him making shitty remarks about my schooling. He then went on to say that it wasn’t his fault that it was taking my five years to get through a two year college. I told him he was being way out of line. My mom just kind of nodded and said that if I couldn’t make good choices then I should be able to take criticism for them. 

For context: my school is a damn good one. I went to a state college for one semester and then could no longer afford it without drowning in student debt, so I switched to a community college and went part time (working full time as I didn’t live at home) for two and a half years doing prerequisites for our nursing program. I got really great grades and thankfully got in  last semester. I have one more year to go and then I’ll become an RN. However, since it’s not a bachelors degree, my family acts like I’m inferior. In my opinion, they’re being elitist, wildly unfair, and incredibly hurtful for no reason.

My brother went to a public four year school and graduated on time, then got a really nice job. I’m not trying to say he didn’t have to work hard, but he got financial assistance to pay for college from my parents whereas I did not (both lost their jobs in my first semester of college, it wasn’t a game of favoritism). I just think he’s not thinking about how our circumstances were different. 

This is where I think I’m probably TA - I told them they could both fuck off if they were going to keep talking to me like that. I know I shouldn’t talk to family like that and I feel bad. My mother hung up immediately and my brother told me I had fucked up bad, then hung up too. 

I don’t know what to think. Sorry if this post is a mess. AITA?",37,105,0.93
352,Not the A-hole,"
My husband and I plan on retiring in two years and moving back to our home town where all our family live.

We found a house for sale there that we loved and we didn’t want to wait and risk losing it so we bought it. The yard needs some work, but it’s overall it’s beautiful and only a couple blocks from the beach.

However the town can be a bit of a party town in the summer. So we thought we would find a family member to live there and keep an eye on things until we could move there.

That’s when we think of our nephew, Parker. We know that he’s been trying to find a place for him and his girlfriend to move into together for awhile, but housing prices are outrageous around there so they haven’t been able to find anything decent where they will also be able to save up for a down payment on a place of their own.

We thought that we could make an arrangement where everyone benefits. Parker and his girlfriend could live there paying us only enough to cover taxes and insurance in return for them cleaning up all the weeds and dead plants in the yard, doing some painting, things like that.


Parker and his girlfriend were very interested. Which isn’t surprising considering at his parents there are 6 other people living there and they all have to share rooms. To say the least it’s rather chaotic so they can’t get any privacy at all. His girlfriends current living situation is also very similar.

So we thought all was good until Parker’s older brother, Mike, found out. Mike has been wanting to move out for a long time too for the same reasons, but he cannot afford to live anywhere nice on his own as he is disabled and just has his disability payments as income.

He and his parents have tried looking into housing assistance programs, but the places are all in sketchy neighborhoods without good access to public services and features he needs.

So finding out his younger brother is getting to move out before him and to a nice place is a nice location got him very upset. Now he and Parker aren’t getting along.

My sister says we should have asked Mark first if he wanted to move in since he is older and has been looking for a place for longer. The reason we didn’t though is because we would have had to have added a bunch of things to make the house handicapped accessible and he wouldn’t have been able to do any of the work we wanted done.

My sister says we’re discriminating and now wants us to let both the boys move in since there’s enough room, but we said that was really Parker’s decision now and he doesn’t want to.",40,156,0.97
353,UPDATE,"Hey Reddit, it’s been a while. Here is an update to my post from a few months ago.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e602d9/wibta\_if\_i\_asked\_my\_ex\_to\_pay\_me\_back\_the\_money/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e602d9/wibta_if_i_asked_my_ex_to_pay_me_back_the_money/)

The general consensus was that I wouldn’t be an asshole to ask my ex to pay me back as long as I asked nicely, but I was an idiot for lending her money and expecting that she would pay me back four grand at three weeks notice. So I went ahead and called her and nicely asked if she could pay me back at the end of December because I just want a clean break so we can all move on. She said she understood and she’ll see what she can do. I later learned that she sold her car to her boyfriend, who let her continue using the car. In short, I got paid and she kept the car she sold to pay me. Great ending for everyone.

But then a few weeks later she called me saying she wanted to talk. She and her boyfriend went to my apartment and told me the craziest thing: she’s pregnant.

And with that, I have accepted the fact that I will never get the clean break I wanted.

It’s been three months since then. We did the paternity test and confirmed that I’m the father. She and her boyfriend are still together, and he is in counseling as a sign of his commitment to her. The main reason she left him before was that he had an alcohol problem that he couldn't control, so I was concerned that she was staying with him while pregnant. He assured me that he’s turned over a new leaf for her and he will stay with her through this. She says that things are great between them and he is completely sober now. We all try to get along as best as we can for the baby.

When I made that post, I never imagined that this would be the update I would be writing. I never even thought that this would be how I have my first kid. But what’s done is done and at least we’re on the same page about prioritizing the baby.

Thanks for all the replies to my original post and wish me luck.",330,7421,0.98
354,Not the A-hole,"Kinda a long story so here goes nothing.

So I (29M) am married to Lucy (26). We’ve been together for almost 6 years, married for just over 3 years and we have a daughter Daisy (3.) even before we began dating, we had been friends since 2008 so we know each other very well and I’ve always known about her financial situation. Basically, her maternal grandparents both worked their way up in certain industries, creating names for themselves and are extremely financially well off. Lucy’s ain’t and mom both ended up working their way up certain careers and became extremely well off too, so the net worth of the family was in the millions. Lucy was well off, but she didn’t grow up in luxury, as in she wasn’t spoiled and she in the whole time I’ve known has never owned any luxury or designer items or spent her money in massive amounts. Anyway, onto the story.

Both Lucy and I are musicians. We’re both at similar levels of I guess recognition or touring. We’ve often toured at the same times and whatnot. She toured a little when she was pregnant and at the same time, her mom died and she inherited the recording studio her mom owned (she was an audio engineer and record producer.) it took her a little while to get used to it, but Lucy began working in the studio and along with her own music, she began earning more than me. Absolutely not an issue, I had no problems with that and was just happy she was happy.

I and my band had a bit of a break, so I was a stay at home dad for a while whilst touring was off the cards and we began working on new music. Lucy was off touring quite a lot and in the studio, so the bulk of our household income came from her. Again, no issues with that and we were happy with this setup. We did what we’ve always done and split our lifestyle costs equally or Lucy paid a little more when I couldn’t.

Well, due to everyone being inside, I’ve been communicating with my band mates on social media and our drummer turned into a bit of a dick. He and the other members have known my wife around 11/12 years too and he abruptly brought up about how much money has. He said that since our work is technically done for the time being, I should be depending entirely on Lucy’s money for everything and that I’m stupid not to exploit it. I said that was completely unfair and just why would I depend on her when I’ve got money of my own to fall back on. He then went on a tirade digging into my wife about how she is set financially for the rest of her life and that she shouldn’t get to keep all that money to herself. I hung up on him but he then has been sending me messages calling me an AH and an idiot and everything else and he’s even called Lucy an AH for not sharing her finances even though it’s none of his business.",58,188,0.87
355,Not the A-hole,"Two weeks ago we had taco night. My mom made a bunch of meat, beans, corn, etc. My brothers got to the kitchen about ten minutes before me to make their tacos and as I entered, my little brother was finishing making his fifth taco and used up the last of the beef. I was pissed because they didn’t save me any and the meat is the best part of the taco. 

I told them to give me some meat and they ignored me and went to the living room and started eating. I went to my mom to tell her what they did and she didn’t even care. She didn’t tell either of them to give me some meat, so I had bean tacos instead. Not terrible but I was kind of mad about the selfishness. 

Flash forward to yesterday morning and my mom made eggs and bacon. I got to the kitchen first, followed by older brother, then my little brother about ten minutes later. I took one third of everything that was made, and my older brother took the rest even though he asked me if my little brother had eaten yet and I said no. What a dick move. 

Anyways, my little brother comes and sees that nothing was left, and tells our mother and all hell broke loose. She yelled at us that he hadn’t eaten yet, he is to eat first from now on, and that we shouldn’t have eaten it all. She then made him a separate breakfast. 

I think this is unfair because she didn’t do the same for me. I couldn’t even convince her to. Furthermore, I took my fair share, whereas he took way more than he should’ve. I called her out on it and she wouldn’t respond. Then my brothers said I was TA. I disagree. What does Reddit think?",446,1119,0.88
356,Asshole,"This is a throwaway account as she does have Reddit and I know she uses this sub. I really don't want her to know this is me.

So...me and my best friend had this huge fight - she can just be a little judgemental, she's always got to be right, and she's really pushy and like she's one of those people who will say what's on their mind without a filter. I mean sure she's really supportive with my aspirations of wanting to be a model and helps get my shots done but she's got a big personality.

Anyway - we got into a little fight. What it was about isn't important but we haven't spoken since. Anyway, a day later her sister dies and I know she was really close with her sister. But...because of this fight and I don't wanna be the one to apologise first because what if she judges me or says something mean or just throws it back into my face?

But someone else told me I was being petty for not texting her when her sister died but if we're not speaking because of this fight then why should I? I'm a really nice and kind person, and I always do what I can for everyone around me - she's the one who lost her temper. I'm pretty sure I'm not the asshole here.

Edit: Some of you are just as judgemental as she is!! I am a really nice and kind person always, and have never once been mean to people. I didn't message her because we were fighting and didn't want to apologise first because she might judge me if I do and that would mean she was right. If she says sorry, I'll even go to the funeral if I don't already have plans.

Edit 2: Look I messaged her a simple message just to see if some people on here were right and she didn't really seem that grateful that I had reached out to her. All she said was thank you and that she was having a hard time right now. When I mentioned that this didn't change our fight and how she hurt me but I would be there for her because I'm nice and kind. Then she texted that she hadn't been thinking about it, so she clearly doesn't intend to say sorry!! Like what was I meant to do?

If she isn't going to be nice I don't see why I should be considered this asshole. Can people just stop arguing with me and see things from my side so I can show her the replies? I only wanted some sympathy and some prove that she has been really judgemental lately, and really all I have found is people taking her side because her sister died. But everyone is ignoring that we were fighting about something that she started and that she should apologise for.

I am really sorry that her sister has dead, and I know they were really close, sometimes she even hung out with her sister instead of me but that's only because she doesn't have any other friends and I do. I don't think I should have been the one to message first given her texts back about the whole thing and maybe now Reddit will finally agree with me.

Edit 3: I hope this is the last time I have to defend myself. I never imagined that people would use this platform to cyberbully me about this and was really hoping for some sympathy and reassurance about all of this. 

I wanted to share some details about the fight so people can understand things from my side. My ex best friend is just a really judgemental person and can be really mean to me and she's dating my brother so we're really close like family most of the time. I was having a house party because I don't really see the point in this fear thing the government is doing and I'm trying to stay away from banned topics on this Reddit but yeah I was having a house party and invited all of my friends. Including my brother and my ex best friend, even though she doesn't socialise much and can be really judgemental and critical I was trying to be nice and kind like I always am and invited her. 

She and my brother made excuses to why they wouldn't be coming but I let it go. It's mostly my friends since she doesn't really have any of her own anyway. 

So I'm having fun at this party and wearing this really nice dream and had my hair done nice, and someone had called the police on us. I just wanted fun with my friends and I know it was my so-called best friend had called them on me because she was feeling judgemental. She's always judging me. I called her the next day and she denied it but I know it was her so we had this fight and my brother has really turned on because of it. 

Some additional context she is really judgemental all of the time and says whatever is on her mind. She'll bring up her nursing studying whenever I ask about her day like she's better then me because I'm an aspiring model, she only ever likes my selfies instead of leaving comments and if I don't have any change for the homeless she'll always take out her purse to make me look bad. 

My brother is also vegan in the house unless they order takeaway or go out because he claims they can't always afford to buy two of everything but I know she's just being judgemental and forcing him to be vegan. 

I hope this shows that she hasn't been the perfect friend always either. She purposely got me into a lot of trouble when I have only been nice and kind to her since she started dating my brother. ",503,311,0.7

358,Asshole,"A while ago, I stayed at an Airbnb with my dog. The owner was a nurse and came back home late at night after we had settled in. My dog is skittish and she barked at the owner, who must have seemed like an intruder in her new home. Thankfully the owner seemed very understanding.

The next day we met the owner’s own dog. It was a small Dachshund and it barked a lot at my dog. The owner said sorry for the barking and from then on put him in her room whenever we came out.

The third day, I was eating dinner with my dog in the dining room, which shared a glass wall with the sunroom where the owner's cats stayed. My dog hates cats and started growling at them when she saw them through the glass, just as the owner walked out of her room. The owner let out a big sigh and angrily said ""Can I give you some advice? I've had dogs all my life and it's not cool for your dog to growl at me. You gotta be firm with them and nip that in the bud or they'll walk all over you.""

I was flabbergasted and just replied “OK,” but I got more mad as I thought about it afterwards.

First of all she wasn't even growling at the owner, she was growling at her cats. Second, I didn't appreciate that she implied that I was not a good owner and was being walked over. Every single time she barked or growled I was doing my best to stop her and make her feel safe, even if it might not have seemed as firm or effective as the owner thought. Third, her own dog barked like crazy and she had even less control of him. I felt betrayed by a fellow reactive dog owner who I thought was understanding.

It was only after I ended my stay that I made my frustrations known. I didn't give her a bad review but left a rather rude message:

Thank you for hosting me. I wish I could say I had a great stay, but to be honest with you now, it was ruined when you angrily (and hypocritically) gave me unsolicited advice on training my dog. Also, your many comments demonizing her and making a big fuss every time we stepped outside made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in your home. I'm glad you changed your listing to no pets because you're obviously not very good with them. I suggest you take your own advice in controlling your dog's incessant barking; maybe read up on that ""Dachshunds for Dummies.""

I later received a message from Airbnb telling me that my account received a warning and to make sure my pet does not present a risk. Furious, I called Airbnb support and filed a similar complaint about the owner's dog.

Now months after the fact, I somewhat regret my pettiness. My dog's reactivity has gotten worse since then and sometimes I feel maybe the owner was right in some ways and I also could have been more upfront. We understand her reactivity more now (shoutout to r/reactivedogs) and have been working hard to train her, more methodically than we had been at the time of the incident. Still, I'm not entirely convinced I was in the wrong so what do you think?",241,962,0.89
359,Not the A-hole," I'll try to be brief...

New neighbors moved in beside me back in Oct.

They are first-time owners and although I am too - I have a lot of (non-professional) experience, skills and know-how in home maintenance and repairs. When they moved in, I mentioned this and they requested my help on some small projects around their house (light plumbing, electrical, landscaping, repair etc.) They have always been very thankful for my work and make me meals, treats and they pay for all materials I have to purchase.

They are very eager to learn, so they are always over my shoulder asking what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. They want to be self-sufficient and I totally respect that and am cool with that (teach a man to fish, right?).

Fast forward to this past week and they are redoing all of the floorboards on their back deck, as a lot of their have rotted through. They told me they spoke to someone who would teach them how to do it and instruct them as they did the work (vs. him doing it) for $500. I told them I'd do it for $250 and I'd let them use my tools. They shrugged it off and moved forward with this contractor/teacher.

I felt slighted by this. I've been there and done great work for them for 6+months now. But apparently not enough to get actually paid for it.

This morning they had all their wood delivered and knocked on my door. They were asking to use my tools. Miter & circular saw, impact driver and others (even tape measure). I told them I would have to charge them due to wear-and-tear, insurance (also time used, means I cant use them for my own projects). When they mentioned that I offered them in our last conversation, I told them that the implied caveat was that they hired me.

So, AITA for attempting to charge them for tools?

361,Not the A-hole,"OK so like most people right now I'm trying to use quarentine to upturn unhealthy habits and become fitter and lose weight. I'm currently 7 stone overweight and have a long way to go (8lbs down so far woohoo!) My friend who is 5 stone overweight asked to join in and since I thought the accountability would help and given that we are both living alone during isolation Skype work out sessions and food swapping seemed like a great plan.

Lately tho my friend is beginning to annoy me. She's constantly complaining that eating more than 1000 calories is just too hard for her cause she never eats more than that anyway. I've tried explaining that that can't be right since she's significantly overweight. Whilst I'm heavier, I know how many calories I was eating to get to this size. She would always reply that she knows what she's been eating and she knows she doesn't eat more than that. I told her to see her Dr and after tests they found nothing wrong with her except a fatty liver a sign of obesity. 

It's been a month of her complaing that she can't eat more than 1000 calories and when we did our weekly weigh in she got upset cause she gained weight this week. She then went on and on about how unfair it is and how she's trying so hard and it isn't working whilst I ""gorge"" on 1700 calories a day and lose 2lbs a week. She said we as in both of us should quit. I know that dieting is hard and isn't always linear but being delusional has to be one of the biggest reason diets fail. I'm sure she's a secret eater and whilst I'm sympathetic I want to succeed at this and I'm finding her negativity draining. 

Well I snapped, see this lifestyle change is it for me and I want to do well And I feel like she's not taking it seriously and is just giving up. Well she sent me a pro Ana video where the girl showed her only food intake was 3 packets of hula hoops a day and she said that she also used to do this. My friend has been overweight her whole life tho so this didn't ring true to me. So I said to her ""you mean you would be eating a sharing bag of crisps 3 times a day. Interesting that you eat 1000 calories a day and are 5 stone overweight you must be a medical anomaly."" she got upset obviously and demanded I apologise but really I think I'm a bad friend if I feed her delusions and she needs tough love before her weight causes her health issues. 

I think I was harsh but I am sticking with the diet and exercise programme and she now isn't and she's told all our other friends that she's quit because I was horrible to her which made her lose motivation. In my opinion, she had no motivation already because she's delusional.

So reddit, since my other friends have taken her side AITA?

EDIT: to clarify I know what an ED is having suffered from binge eating for years which is how I got so obese. Having had a moment to pause and reflect on comments, you guys are right I was mean but I think it's more because I'm concerned that being around someone during this journey who has an ongoing ED is going to be toxic for me and risk me falling apart.

I started wearing suites a lot and love colorful ties and bow ties. My Mum is super conservative and obsessed with gender roles and went a while where she couldn't look at me without crying. When I decided to shave my head she wouldn't even look at me. 

Eventually I started seeing her again but she is always twitchy and nervous, solely due to the fact that I was wearing men's clothing. She refused to even talk to me until I took my tie off, which is really upsetting to me, and I was tired of bending to her whims, so I told her that I would not take my tie off unless she took her bracelet off, which she was visibly hurt by.

Going to college, my mom agrees to co-sign a loan and apartment. My mom got remarried to this douche-canoe who looks like the Gorton's Fisherman(GF). A year in, comes time to renew my loans. I try, denied, ask my mom to help me again. She tells me that she won't do it. So I can't keep paying for school and can't keep my apartment. My mom and her husband came to see me. We went to dinner. GF goes to the bathroom, alone with my mom, calmly, ask why she wouldn't help me anymore. She starts to get emotional saying not that she won't do it, she had been denied. Now I felt bad. She did what she could for me. I feel like a dick now

Fast-forward to last days of the apartment. I get an email from GF. In it, he proceeds to outline just how much of a piece of shit I am. That I flunked out because all I did there was ""smoke weed and jack off"". Also tells me my mom was not denied. He told her to stop helping me

Living with my dad again, trying to find work in a super tiny town. I started getting weekly calls from my mom and her husband demanding I start paying back my loan. A job just wasn't happening. The phone calls became more frequent and belligerent. Every time she'd call, GF would take over the phone, re-establish that I'm a lazy piece of shit, and start threatening me with lawsuits for not paying back the loan

My dad was diagnosed with cancer. My full-time job was now keeping him alive. My brother was the only income in the house, he loses his job and leaves. My dad and I get evicted. We lived in a two bed no-tell-motel room, for about 4 months during his chemo and radiation. Whole time I was there, my mother and her husband continued their calls demanding money and that I get a job

Good news, my dad beat the cancer. (well he did this time and 5 times after that but you can't win them all) We left the motel and he went to stay with my sister and I went to try and start my life. Moved a few states away, got a job, started paying. The phone calls stopped. Mail from the Fisherman didn't. No longer threatening me over loans but still attacking me for being a lazy pothead that flunked out of college and that I'm a horrible son because I ""forced"" my mom into that loan and now I don't call or message her. It's not like I would screen her calls or ignore texts, she made no effort to talk to me now that she wasn't demanding money. I'm the one at fault for not reaching out

It's been 7 years. For the last 3 years I have been screening her single call a year. I get an email from GF at least once a year, just so I don't forget that I'm a piece of shit. I bring all this up as my family says I should talk to her and she doesn't want the loan to keep us from talking

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for still not wanting anything to do with her?",63,202,0.94
368,Not the A-hole,"I might have had framed it the wrong way so please hear me out.

I have a friend or had but I'd stay with having because I don't feel any resentment towards her since her intentions weren't of ill-nature. Sounds like Jane Austen novel, I'm sorry. Anyways - I have a friend. Her father died about 8 years ago while on holidays alone and we talked about it long before my father suffered brain damage. 

Anyways, back in late summer 2019, we were supposed to go on Golf holidays with my dad and the day before he drove off to do some practice, during which a vein in his brain ruptured and sprayed his right hemisphere with blood, damaging most of that half of the brain - that means not only he can't use his left side of the body but that he's now not well mentally either. There are ups and downs, it's an emotional rollercoaster and for past months I've been emotionally supportive of my mother too. I don't want to be too descriptive of the state he or my family is in but let's just say this continues to be hard and stressful for everyone.

Now. My friend (we work together) blanked me out, I felt like we're no longer friends and I began noticing she made friends with somebody else the exact ways she made friends with me before. So I got my courage up a bit and we talked openly; she told me I'm being extremely negative about the whole situation, that I should be looking for the good sides of the situation and so on. I never used my dad as an excuse, I still went to work every day, smiling, because I refused to have this ""have you heard"" over my head because ppl from work know my father well. I still made fun, still joked, I wasn't going around, visibly mourning, moping or any of that, except for a few moments of way-too-bad-to-show-nothing depression fits or those few times when I was expecting bad news. I worked hard, I tried my best, I woke up every day acting like all is just fine and nothing out of ordinary is happening while this new changed and horrible reality settled into my life.

I heard her out what she told me - she argues that ""at least I still have my father"" - which I judge as a lame excuse for the pain we all endured, are enduring and will endure. I tried to look for something good in it and suffered two absolutely fucked up weeks of feeling like I don't deserve to feel the pain I'm feeling. Basically, it felt like I was told I don't deserve to feel shit because it's not ""as bad"" like my depression, stress and anxiety were not justified.

So, I told her, that I thought about it and that I can't look for something positive in all this shit and that I hope she won't take it personally, because I totes respect her point of view and that I wish I was able to do this. She's not talking to me now. I told her this mindset of sunshine and rainbow makes me feel even worse and that I don't think false hopes and looking for positivity at all costs will help because facing truths is way more helpful, especially in the long run.

370,Not the A-hole,"I'm a tech YouTuber. Not even close to on the scale of the likes of Linus Tech Tips or MKBHD but if you follow those communities you may have potentially seen my channel content appear at the bottom of a long list of recommended videos. I'm lucky enough to have a full time career of it. So, fortunate that this whole crisis hasn't had as much of an impact on me as it has many people in the world and with the exception of not really being allowed to go outside much (I live in the UK) it's been pretty much business as normal. My roommate on the other hand has been off work for the last month, he hasn't lost his job, he's just working a lot less at the moment.

My roomate(24M) and I(25M) have lived together for almost 5 years, and while he's a tech enthusiast too, he's never really shown much interest in what I do. This all changed when he started being at home a lot more often than normal. In the time span of the last 4 weeks he's decided he wants to be a creator too and has been asking me for help. Admittedly I've been reluctant to help him out too much, but i've been doing what I can. I haven't loaned him filming gear or anything as the stuff I use( a RED dsmc2) cost me a fortune. But, I have been loaning him some stuff I've used in previous videos. I haven't helped with editing much as thats the most important part of being a creator and everyone should have the opportunity to do that themselves.

Right, so onto the AITA part. He's been badgering me since he started his channel to shout him out or let him appear in my videos, saying it's only fair since he shouts me out in all of his(2). Eventually I relent and let him appear in a video where I interview him about some tech I feature and he chooses a favourite. Didn't shout him out but linked his channel in the description and he got a couple hundred subs from it too. Now, the video did about average for me, not good or bad. Video went up, I got paid for it. Thought that was the end, but nope. He knocks on my bedroom door this morning and asks when he'll be getting his half for the video. So I, confused and groggy, tell him he's not getting anything. I did him a favour, shared his content, put him in the video after he'd begged me too. He says its only fair since the video wouldn't have been made at all without him, I say I only made the video because he asked me too. It led to a fight in which I've told him I won't be loaning him anything he can use again.

I'm sorry this went on a little longer than I'd hoped, I just wanted to paint a full picture. If this sub decides I'm in the wrong I'm fully willing to accept it and give him half the money. But I just want an unbiased opinion on this, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Should have mentioned this in the initial post but didn't think of it... There was no prior discussion of payment. All that was talked about was how he wanted to get his face out there and make it known that he was friends with a bigger channel. That's as far as our conversations beforehand went about it.

&#x200B;

 

Edit 2: I appreciate all the support guys, it's nice to know I wasn't in the wrong but we've worked it out and we're all good. He's agreed to keep my job separate from our friendship and won't ask for anything like that again, in exchange I gave him 10% of profit from the video.

But I ask that you guys please stop asking for my channel name. I really don't want to grow my content based on a reddit post bitching about my roommate. I appreciate all the interest about it but I'd really rather remain anonymous. Though If anyone does find anything about me, drop a comment on the vid and I promise I'll reply!",165,2218,0.97

373,Not the A-hole,"Hi folks, throwaway for privacy

Long story short, my parents and step-mum are dead, as are my sister and step-brother. Yes it’s all very sad but it’s not like they all died suddenly, it’s taken about a decade all told. 

My step-sister Katie (even though my dad and her mum never married, I’ll just say ‘step’ to make it easier) is 15 and lives in a small town with very elderly grandparents after our (step-)parents died. Her gran and grandpa don’t have too many more years left, and are open about the fact that they’re not to up raising their granddaughter, no matter how much they love her etc. Everyone recognises that, and it’s fine. 

Katie is about to finish school and move to a two-year college for university entrance exams (known as 6th form in the UK). She’s asked to live with my fiancée and me in London, about an hour away from where she used to live. We’re lucky in that we both have great jobs and enough space. Everyone gets on with each other and all in all everything’s great (dead relatives not withstanding). 

My fiancée and I are in our late 20s but are more than ~~ignorant~~ happy to help look after Katie in this difficult time. We’ve cleared it with Katie’s grandparents as her guardians, and will be made guardians until she’s 18 for medical treatment etc. All standard enough. 

Katie has found a very nice but pricey 6th form to attend and is all ready to move. Everyone will be new at that school, and Katie has spent a while researching careers and subjects along with us. So far, so good. We’re very lucky that cash isn’t an issue (dead relatives had great jobs, houses etc, so that’s now split between Katie and myself).  

We were all ready to go ahead and confirm the move when I had a random call from Katie’s aunt and uncle. They live in Europe and had *many* opinions on our decision to steal Katie, to force to study certain subjects, to waste her inheritance, all while we “practice” being parents. Effectively they think we’re going to mess around Katie so that our own (non-existent) children will be improved from it. Barmy. 

Having never been a teenage girl I can’t say I really know what I’m getting myself into, and certainly my teenage years were far more present than her’s. I’m under no illusions that I’m likely to be in over my head 

Katie gets a Christmas and birthday card from her aunt and uncle but hasn’t seen them outside of weddings and funerals for years. They suggest that Katie moves in with them and move away from abusive me. Katie told them to fuck off. Since them I’ve heard a lot from random distant relatives about forcing my views on Katie. 

The only difference I can see is that I’m black and Katie is white (my fiancée is mixed, so...rainbow?). I hope there aren’t any racial overtones but I can’t be sure. 

I’m pretty sure I’m not TA, but have I missed something?

TL;DR: arsehole move to raise step-sister? Possibly family objections due to racial differences?

Edit: I didn’t expect to get this much traction! Thanks everyone for the comments, it’s given me a lot to think about, rest assured that everyone will be ok!",157,1306,0.95
374,Not the A-hole,"Just a few days ago I took in a young Galah (Cockatoo) named Pinky. Pinky has incredibly bad vision, yet can still see well enough to navigate his way to any point indoors or in his aviary.

For the past few days, I've reorganised many different rooms within my house (with my mothers permission) to accommodate for Pinky's disability  as well clearing out the aviary to make more space for him to fly.

I firmly believe it's wrong to clip birds wings and researched the issue after a neighbour went off at me, and from that day on I began training members of flock basic flight training techniques such as recalling, ascending and descending.

I've decided to train Pinky to do the same, but have made changes to my approach and methods of training I use to ensure he will be okay.

For the few days I've had Pinky, he's made a few successful recalls and has only crashed once due to an error of mine. Otherwise, if he misses me he'll then loop back to his perch before trying again.

This morning, my Mum had her friend over. She asked to see the Birds so I introduced her to all members of my flock. She sounded interested in what I was doing and I didn't really think much of it. Until she saw Pinky.

She saw Pinky was in the largest aviary despite me having bigger birds. I told her Pinky has poor vision, but I don't want to take away his natural instinct because of it and that I've made changes to accommodate him.

She turned around and snapped at me for ""putting a blind animal at risk"" and that i'm ""endangering the poor thing."" 

I told her that I'm working around his poor vision and even told her about how much great progress he's making and how I'm confident he can learn more if he allows me to train him to (I never force my birds to do anything as it damages our relationship.) 

But she kept yelling. I told her to leave as a few of my flock members started becoming irritated and frightened, and she just went back inside.

She told my mum that I'm an animal abuser and that I need to clip Pinky's wings for his safety. A bird group on facebook said I'm an asshole for not clipping his wings after I went there for advice.

AITA?

Edit: I spoke with a Woman who has 30 years of experience working with cockatoos. To summarise what she said, birds with poor vision need their flight feathers so they have their ""flight response"", giving them confidence in defending themselves as well as making the bird feel secure.

She's encouraged me to continue what I'm doing, and has suggested new methods of training I can use to ensure Pinky feels safe and secure as well as happy.

I've been suggested to take Pinky to a specific veterinarian in Perth as they're apparently well experienced and equipped to deal with birds.",42,51,0.88
375,Not the A-hole,"My friend has recently bought her first house and has asked me to move in with her because she realised she doesn’t like living alone. I won’t be moving in until June/July and in the meantime she has gotten two kittens to keep herself company.

I love animals, and I don’t have an issue with her getting kittens. As far as I’m concerned, it’s her house and she can do what she wants, especially when I’m not even living there yet. My concern is that she has been talking about chores and taking care of the cat food and litter would be on my list of things to do.

I pet sit frequently for other people, and I find cats are always the one animal I don’t particularly love cleaning up after. The general smell of their food and waste doesn’t sit well with me (keep in mind I grew up on an animal farm so I’m not being precious about smells. It’s just cats). 

I mentioned this and tried to point out that me moving in wouldn’t automatically make them my pets too. They are her cats and would still be her responsibility. I would be more than happy to help should she need it or step up when she is absent, but I don’t think I should have to worry about them day to day.

Last night I told my bf about a bakery that's still open with my favorite types of cakes and asked him to come by and buy me some when getting off work. He agreed. 

This morning when he was at work I sent him a facebook post of the bakery showing their menus, address and current working hours without saying much. He replied 'okay i'll get some' and then after a few minutes followed with 'that's it? You just threw out a link without saying anything?'. I was confused and said that I already told him about it last night and he was like 'For real? Not even a thank-you?'. I was so confused saying that he hasn't even gotten me those cakes yet and that it's weird to ASK for a thank-you like this. I have bought and made him stuff without expecting or asking him to show a ton of gratitude. But he is unswayed, saying that a 'thank-you' is minimum mannerism and I should have said that instead of just 'throwing' a link at him. I told him I don't want those cakes anymore.

382,Not the A-hole,"I (35F) share an apartment with a flatmate (29F) in a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment. She moved in several months ago before Xmas after my long-term boyfriend unceremoniously left the country and ghosted me. I couldn't afford rent on my own, so I found someone to move it. She's a doctor, and I work for a tech startup. 

*For information purposes that may be valuable: she has a separate lease with my landlords, so she's not my sub-letter; the country we live in doesn't have strict restrictions currently wrt outside movement; we are both foreigners from different countries in the country we live in; she spends multiple days a week riding her horse, so in theory, she has time to herself. And yes, this is a throw-away. :-)*

I work from home, mostly, or in cafes. There aren't co-working spaces in my city. She knew before she moved in that I worked from home. I do the majority of the cleaning and offer her leftovers of my cooking/baking, since I know she's busy. I just generally try to be a pleasant and giving person, but I also recognize she's incredibly busy and that I'm home more to tackle these tasks. 

I suppose this hasn't been a huge issue before, as I used to travel a lot, as well as take classes and go to the gym. But every now and then, she'd ask if I could leave the apartment to ""give her some alone time.""  It never really bothered me much, honestly: we pay equal rent, but she never gets to be in the apartment by herself, so I acquiesced because that seemed fair. I could always find something to do.

However, these requests are becoming more frequent, almost weekly. I tried talking with her, and tried compromising, by saying if she'd like to have personal time in a public area of the apartment, I'd stay out her way completely. Now, though, she's taken locking herself into the kitchen for hours, and leaving me starving. I'll admit, I have a tendency of being over-sensitive, so I'm worried I am over-reacting.

I've decided I don't want to leave the house anymore on request nor do I want her to bogart common areas. I feel like if you want alone time when you share housing with someone, then that's what your private bedroom is for, and shared spaces should be kept open. But I'm worried I'm not being a very good flatmate if I push back on this, or maybe there's an age, personality, or cultural difference I'm not considering. Maybe as an extrovert, I don't truly understand the need for genuine alone time. **So, WIBTA if I told my flatmate to go to her room or go for a walk when she wants alone time, when I get copious amounts of alone time at home?** 

TL;DR: my flatmate keeps asking me to leave the house to give her alone time. She also requests alone time in shared areas of the apartment, meaning I'm stuck in my room to respect her request. I'm really tired of these requests but I wonder if I'm being unfair. WIBTA if I simply told her ""no"" and to take her alone time in her room or even go for a walk?",21,55,0.91

To explain my garden; we've sectioned it into two parts, the nice part is at the back and the childrens section is at the front where they've got their toys and play area type thing.

Julia has a terrible phobia of everything that bites, she hates birds, rabbits, hamsters, dogs and can barely stand our cat - I don't know where she got the fear from but she's trying to move past it and if she sees a dog outside will interact when possible and used to take my youngest out to feed the birds, still does when she asks so she's attempting to move past it but it's a slow process.

So, spontaneously I picked it up.

I plan on doing research on the rabbit later.

Julia flipped, calling me an insensitive AH because if she makes me rehome it she'll be the bad guy and on top of that what I've got is ""completely unsustainable""

     I (19F) have two twin 3 year old sons that I gave birth to in highschool, two years before I met my fiancé. Their father (19M) is also heavily present in their life. For a little background, I am Sicilian and Greek, and their father is Korean. Safe to say, they look very not white. 
     My fiancé, however, looks very white. Curly blonde hair, pale skin, blue eyes. 
     Whenever me and my fiancé go out with them, no one assumes that he is the father, which has never bothered me, my fiancé, their father, or my boys. Even now, as I am in the last few weeks of our first pregnancy together, we haven’t had any problems with our family. My fiancé and his parents are ecstatic for our baby girl, and so are my boys and their father. The only person it does bother is his older sister. 
     Three days ago, while we were setting up the nursery in our apartment, his sister began talking about how I was not fit to be a good mother, and all the “complications” that would come from her being raised by a “dirty white” 
mother and surrounded by “halfling brats”; along with how she wanted nothing to do with my sons lives, only our daughters because she needed “actual guidance”. 
     Of course, I went mental. I told her to get out of our apartment and how she could return her bridesmaids dress at her nearest convenience.

386,Not the A-hole,"My (23f) boyfriend ""Mark"" (28m) comes along with my family really well. I used to love this side of our relationship until Mark an I started having problems.

The past 8 months we've been fighting quite a bit more than we used to. For the most part we've been talking things through and are working on keeping personal stress out of the relationship. However, when we do fight - no matter who starts it or how significant or insignificant the reason is - Mark tends to vent it on my parents, especially on my mother. Mark's not very close with his parents (rarely meets his mom, never met his dad), so in a way I'm happy for him finding a support network in my family.

It's just that I used to be able to talk to my mother very openly about my things and for quite some time it has happened that Mark's been telling his side of things before me, and my side is not heard anymore. At first my mom was pretty objective about what she heard, but now she and my dad have been taking Mark's side in everything. Eventually I did stop talking about any of this to my family, but they keep bringing up our disagreements about which they've heard from Mark. My mom keeps referring to Mark as ""the son she never had"" (I have 2 sisters) and it seems that she's worried of us breaking up and therefore defending Mark in everything.

Things escalated yesterday when I eventually told Mark that his behavior has changed my family's dynamics and I'd appreciate if he didn't talk about our interpersonal stuff to my parents anymore. He was upset and claimed that he doesn't specifically call my mom in order to complain about me, but these things just come up. I responded with ""then just stop calling her"", which was a bit too hurtful but honestly - I find it hard to believe he doesn't call especially to complain about me when my mom seems to know our fights thoroughly in just a matter of hours.  He's acting like nothing happened now but I can tell he's not fine.

Edit: I never expected this to get so much attention and I appreciate you taking time to read my opening and respond. I've read through the comments and it has opened my eyes, mainly on the fact that I really need to discuss this with my parents as well.

A lot of people are commenting on Mark being potentially abusive etc and I want to say that I'm not surprised over this based on the very limited information of my post. We'll keep trying to figure things out but I'm not about to break up with him over these comments which I'm sure you all understand.

I'd also like to say that even though there most definitely is a petty side in me, I think it's a misunderstanding that I'd just be mad over my parents taking Mark's side instead of me. I don't think they should be taking anyone's side since it's my relationship. And as said this is having an affect on my family dynamics and I feel like I have the right to be upset over it.

I told him no, drop it, and he dropped it. I said “looks like he found a new toy” and she was annoyed, said something about how he “better not do anything” and then we continued our night.

Mentioning about how we’ll have to get rid of him ( she doesn’t mean this, she always says harsh things when situations get rough). Throughout her discovering the shoe I mostly remained quiet because I knew that I believed the shoe shouldn’t have been left laying around.

Is she the asshole for being mad at our puppy for chewing her shoe?

391,No A-holes here,"Hey there,

so yesterday my girlfriend was going for a walk at about 3 pm. She wanted to go alone because she needed time for herself and wanted to listen to music. I was expecting her to be gone for at least an hour as she always takes pretty long walks. So after about an hour and a half she texted me that she randomly met a guy who was a good friend of her in the past (about 10 years ago as she told me later on). At 5:30 pm she texted me they want to hang out a little longer outside (they met at a lake in the city, so nothing too private). At 6pm I asked her when she is coming home because I got hungry and wanted to prepare dinner but I didn't tell her. She answered at 7:30 pm and told me they got something to drink and she doesn't want to stay too long anymore. At 8:40pm she texted me she lost her purse. At 9:30pm she called me and wanted me to come outside to meet her friend and smoke a cigarette together. 

By the way: she took my pack of cigarettes without asking and when she came home they had smoked the whole pack but 2 cigarettes together so I got to share a cigarette with my girlfriend. Of my own pack I bought the other day. With a guy I don't even know. Without even thinking about buying their own when they were buying alcohol at the gas station.

When we (me and my gf) got inside I asked her what she thinks how I feel about her going for a walk and coming home after 6 and a half hours, hanging out with a guy I have never even heard of and losing her purse while being slightly drunk (I noticed she was talking a little drunk). She said I was overreacting and she wouldn't mind if I did the same. AITA for being pissed off?

Edit: I should have known you guys are gonna point out we are in the middle of a pandemic. Gonna bring that up to her again as she is in general very careful atm but seems to have kinda forgotten yesterday when she met him. I haven't thought about it because I got a little mad. Germany btw for anyone wondering. But that's not the topic of this post. Still you guys are absolutely correct about mentioning it.

EDIT 2 to give more information:

She always told me about the long walks she took when she was a teenager (24 now). So I guess it's a thing for her. But we've been living together for about a year now and she actually never did that. Gotta admit I forgot to mention that she had planned to go for a walk at 10am but overslept. That's what she told me at least. 

On the other hand she wore a little make up because she was in a good mood yesterday. Usually she does this only when we go out. Might be suspicious. When I came home today she got like 5 messages pretty quickly, I don't know from who. She never liked me looking at her phone while she was texting, so that's nothing new. But she almost never goes out to do anything alone as we are both working full time and are mostly exhausted when we come home and there's the virus.

She's never done anything suspicious before. But I got a bad feeling because I always have in situations like this. Bad experiences with my ex. Like REALLY bad. But she knows that because my ex is her best friend who is a hoe. Like for real, that girl regularly leaves their friends without any information where she had gone when partying. Usually she's getting fucked by some guy and she also did when she was my gf. Everyone is getting worried after she is missing for a few hours but she doesn't care. 

So my gf exactly knows what I've been through from age 16-21.

UPDATE: well, we just broke up basically 2 hours ago. We still livin together right now but I'm moving into my best friends flat and we'll have one hell of a time. It wasn't because of that day but our relationship was basically fucked for a few months and I didn't have the guts to tell her until now. But she took the chance before I could. She didn't cheat on me and I believe her. But it is what it is. Thanks for your support and opinions guys, truly appreciate it and I'm looking forward to a single but happy future. In the end we're cool and taking it like adults.",96,272,0.92
392,Asshole,"Actually the title isn't all but yeah do forgive me for my tone and any grammar mistakes because I am really pissed right now and I might need some rational opinion.


I am single living alone with 2 cats and some fishes. My younger sister is a 23 year old single mother of a 2 year old with some medical conditions that requires some expensive treatment until, if, their condition improves and they grow out of it.


My sister is like a child herself, too spoilt and naive for this world. My parents enabled her going on her own ways and she insisted on having the child despite being told the risks and having the man dumped her over it, somehow believing that a baby would make him stay. She is now living with my parents and my parents are providing for both of them.


As for me, I moved out of the house years ago for my terrible relationship with my sister. I was the only one to scold her for her mistakes when nobody else would and she always had our parents to back her up. Yeah I am always the asshole to them, and I don't regret leaving, though we still keep in contact.


My sister came to me begging me for money, as my parents are now on a tough spot and they have trouble providing for her child, they may need to switch to a cheaper but lesser effective alternative to treat them. I warned her that time that she shouldn't keep the child but she insisted and now it became like this.


I need to provide for myself and my pets too, especially since one of my cat has some health issues. I refused to give my sister any money and she ended up bringing family onto the plate, saying how we should help each other in times like this. 


I told her that my cat is my family, and her child isn't. I am now rather regretting what I have said but at the same time, half of me is telling me that she really deserved it, I am not her parent.


Edit: Alright after a few hours of cooling down I think I do need to fill in some parts that aren't left out intentionally, though I would prefer to leave out details because of privacy. 


Yes my parents did show favorism towards my sister because she is quite a few years younger than me. She is the type who can be very sweet, needy and clingy, so it wouldn't be far fetched to say that helicopter parenting was part of of it.  


As for my sister herself, while I don't think she is a bad person, she never grew out of thinking everything is rainbows and unicorns. She used to have me taking blame of every trouble she stirred up, thanks to my parents who used to jus assume it is my fault because I did not stop her from doing them. Responsibilities is something she never learnt. 


I admit I do bear grudges against her, against my parents. However she still comes to me every time she needs something, oblivious about my feelings and just assumes that I have what she wants, only listen to what she wants. This is why we kept in contact even after I moved out. 


She came to me when she got herself pregnant that time, and wanted me to help her sort out a plan. My advice was simple: abort it. Mind you, I also warned her about him before and she brushed me off. 


She wanted to go through it, even after the doctors warned her that there were risks to herself and her child. I knew it wouldn't have gone well, so I tried to talk her out of it. Guess what? It is a precious life and a hope to bring her trash ex back, my warnings fell on deaf ears again. 


And now, after everything played out just the way I told her it would, she had the nerve to beg me for money. She is miserable, my parents are miserable, and here I am thinking I can never get rid of her and expected to clean up after her again, just like before. Because why? We are family. 


Fuck that, she is not my family, not her, not her parents nor her child. I know the poor child is innocent but they wouldn't have suffered so if their mother haven't made the wrong decision again and again.


Edit 2: I can't believe I need to say it, I believe I do NOT hate the child, I do want nothing to do with them though, you are free to interpret it any way you want. Actually, this may just be a good time for me to cut them off completely. Sheesh this is why I don't want a family of my own, maybe for the better, assholes like me shouldn't breed anyway.",1651,4130,0.9
393,Not the A-hole,"For context: I (29F) come from a working class immigrant family and live with my parents and my younger brother. I'm the main breadwinner for my family. I pay 100% of the rent and most of the big bills. My parents cover the HOA fees & groceries for the most part. I know my parents sacrificed a lot to put me and my brother through school and I am happy to provide for them. In my culture, adult children stay with their parents until they get married so my situation is pretty normal.

But while I'm happy to provide for MY family, I don't want to do the same for my relatives.

My uncle just showed up today out of the blue and announced that he had to move out due to being short on rent and that all his belongings were in his car. He didn't ask us if he could stay. He just informed us that he was here with everything he owns. This isn't the first time he's come to live with us. The last time was immediately after his divorce. He said it would be two weeks then - he stayed for over a year.

He has diabetes, high blood pressure, and failing kidneys. I understand that living with all of those is incredibly difficult but in the time he lived with us, he refused to do anything to help around the house. I've seen him do the dishes maybe once. He wouldn't help set or clear the table or pitch in for groceries. Letting him into our home again means that I would effectively be providing for him financially, while my mom takes on the brunt of the physical and emotional labor of taking care of him. I love my mom very much and she recently went through surgery for cancer. She's making steady progress on her recovery but I worry that his presence here will cause her undue stress. I can't watch him put her through this again.

When he mentioned this as a possibility a month ago, everyone in our family told him that he could not stay here. My mom and I have actually been helping him with his rent for the past year or so that he wouldn't try to move in with us again. We've probably given him thousands of dollars at this point because he's my mom's brother and she didn't want to see him homeless.

After he showed up earlier today to inform us of his stay - he left to make deliveries for food apps. We reminded him that my mom is immunocompromised and his job puts her at risk. He left anyway. He didn't contact us all day after that so we thought maybe that he had found somewhere else to stay but he just showed up at midnight and made his way into the living room. I'm livid and I want to tell him tomorrow that he needs to leave.

But if I was really adamant about kicking him out, he'd literally be homeless, and his life would be in jeopardy without access to a refrigerator for his insulin and proximity to a dialysis center. Am I the asshole for wanting clear boundaries and saying no to providing for a family member who is in real danger of dying if he were homeless?

EDIT: When I made this post before going to sleep last night, I didn't expect so many people to respond. Thank you so much for all your insight! 

To answer a couple of frequently asked questions first:

* My uncle specifically waited for my parents to fall asleep and called my younger brother to open the door since he could leverage family seniority dynamics to guilt him. 
* My cousin still lives with her mother (my uncle's ex-wife) so him moving in with her is pretty much a 0% possibility. 
* He's been staying at a motel, so it's not a traditional landlord-tenant situation and the eviction moratorium doesn't apply. 

&#x200B;

As for a small update: 

He actually snuck out of our house around 8 AM this morning. I think he was afraid of having a confrontation once my mom woke up. She ended up texting both him and his daughter to let them know that he can't stay here and they need to figure out what to do about his living situation. I was surprised since my mom has always had a soft spot for him, but I think this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I was ready to be the bad guy in this situation but it was much nicer to have a united front. 

We called him back to our house later in the day, and sat down as a family to let him know that he's not welcome to stay. I gave him some money so he could go back to his hotel at least for the week and told him that this was the last time we could help him like this. My mom let him know that she still wants to stay in touch via phone but he is absolutely not allowed into our house for now.

He said he understands and will talk with his daughter and his daughter also contacted us to let us know that she will sit down with him to figure things out. He seemed genuinely apologetic so I'm not sure if it was just all a front to get more money/mooch like some people mentioned. But it seems that the problem is solved for now. I've had a talk with my mom about everything you guys mentioned and she said she didn't even think about paying the motel directly. If he ever comes to us for help again in the future, we've decided to take that route and I'll be coordinating with his daughter to split payments so I'm not the one bankrolling her father if it comes down to it. 

Thank you again! (We had a follow up doctor's appointment today for my mom and they told us that she won't need chemo or radiation therapy so thank you for all the well wishes for her too!) ",122,818,0.95
394,No A-holes here,"Basically what it says in the title. My boyfriend made an OnlyFans a couple months ago to make a little extra money. I wasn't crazy about the idea at the time but I figured he's an adult and if he wants to get naked on the internet for money that's his prerogative.

Anyway lately he's been bugging me to subscribe, and I just don't see the point cos I already see him naked all the time plus he shows me everything he posts before he posts it to get my input already... like what's in it for me you know?

So I said all that to him and he basically said I should do it to show my support for his work and endeavors, and then he said how he comes to all my gigs (I'm a musician) to support me and I should do the same thing cos couples support each other. And I said those 2 things aren't the same and he said how exactly are they different? And to be fair to him, I couldn't think of a reason.

But Idk! I still don't really wanna pay 10 bucks a month to subscribe to his only fans. Like I just don't see what's in it for me. Now he's lowkey upset with me and I'm wondering if I'm being selfish or hypocritical for how I feel. Would love an outside perspective...

396,No A-holes here,"Ignore username, old burner account just incase.

I’ll start by saying that I am SO incredibly unaffectionate.  I’m awful at handling emotions.  I always have been.  I’m also notoriously insensitive, hence the post to see what other people think.

That said, I love my boyfriend with my whole heart.  We’ve been together for almost four years, about a year long distance currently, and are getting engaged soon.  He’s perfect for the most part, but y’all, I swear he tells me he loves me EVERY OTHER SENTENCE.  It wasn’t always like this, but ever since he moved for work and we only see each other once every few months, it’s non-stop.

He says it, and then expects me to say it back.  Every single time.  If I don’t, he gets upset, so I typically suck it up and say it back.

I get it, that part sounds awful, but I just feel like we’ve been together for long enough that I don’t need a constant verbal reminder that he loves me- I know he does, and he knows I do, too.

I confronted him about it last night.  I asked him to stop saying it so much because it bothers me, and he twisted it into me not wanting to say it ever, insinuating that he thinks I’m not in love with him anymore.  That’s definitely not it, I’m just someone who finds the constant reassurance more annoying than actually reassuring.

But, he hasn’t talked to me all day, and now I feel like I might be an asshole.  Am I?  It all feels so high school drama-esque, I can’t stand it.",53,71,0.79

398,Not the A-hole,"My sister and I are very close. We've been to college together and recently moved in together as well. I take care of rent and she takes care of bills. 

Now, my sister is a very extroverted person. She loves attention and loves doing things other people might not find fun. She's also a very sexual person and is not afraid to talk about sexuality in front of other people. I cannot tell you guys how many times I've come home to find her having sex with her boyfriend in the living room. I've found them in the bathroom as well. Most of the times, I just politely apologize and piss off. It's extremely annoying and It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to open my room's door in case she's with her boyfriend again (the living room faces my room). It's always so fucking awkward and embarrassing for me. I hate it and I've told her multiple times that it makes me uncomfortable but every time, she dismisses me and tells me we're all adults, she's doing nothing wrong and to just go to my room or leave the house if it upsets me so much. 

To make things worse, before her boyfriend, she used to bring home guys all the time. And because we're identical twins, sometimes guys would confuse me with her. That's why when she told me she and her boyfriend are considering doing porn I flipped out. I mean, I understand she's an adult and it's her body, but I'd hate to be associated with that. I don't want people to see them and then see me and assume I'm her. 

I was so mad and mortified of the idea that I threatened to kick her out of the house if she does it. The apartment we live in is in my name and I pay rent, so I have the power to kick her out. My sister got really mad at me; she kept saying how immature I am and how I don't control her. I said some hurtful things. We've never fought this badly before and honestly I'm really upset because I love my sister to death and it just feels wrong having her not talk to me anymore. However, I cannot let her get into pornography. She's gonna expose herself and whether she wants it or not she's gonna expose me.

399,Not the A-hole,"This happened before current events. I was having a conversation with friends during a virtual hangout and we ended up pretty split on this so hoping Reddit can help settle it.

I (M29) had come back from a bachelor trip and rather than having my wife or parents pick me up because it was rush hour and my wife doesn't like to drive I decided to take the train home from the airport. It takes two trains, one to get to the union station and one to get back to my neighborhood.

I got to the second train pretty early, about 15 minutes before it leaves and at this point it's almost 7pm so the rush has died. The train is almost completely empty and I put my carryon backpack in a seat next to me and started to browse on my phone. There is a lady sitting diagonally across from me when I sat down.

A few minutes later, this lady's friend joins her and the bus is about half empty. All of a sudden I see the first lady start to move my luggage and I'm taken back. Normally when I take public transit I only put my bag down if there's plenty of seats. The moment the seats start filling up I move my bag back to my lap. I give up my seat for elderly every time. I get the social norms but my carryon was extremely heavy to put on my lap. The floor was wet because it had snowed that day and my carryon didn't have wheels so I'd rather not put it on the ground although I would no problem if it were a fuller train. Because the train was so empty I didn't think it'd be a problem and yet this lady was moving my bag. I'm also very not okay with a stranger touching my stuff and this isn't even about getting sick, I'm right there. Had she asked it'd be a different story.

I ask what they are doing and the lady gives me a ""Your bag needs to move"". I didn't really understand as there was a seat next to her for her friend and the bus was half empty. I was also sitting by her for a few minutes and she could have just told me the spot was for her friend when I first arrived. At this point I'm not having it with her touching my bag and her attitude.

She wanted to move my bag to the seat beside her which is in front of me. That's not ideal to me because I've been robbed a few times before and I want my bag within arm's reach. So I told her okay fine seats are for people, I'm a person and I sat in the seat that my bag was occupying and then placed my bag in my original seat. They finally sat down next to each other and spent the next 5 minutes cussing me out. Then for the next half hour every few minutes they'd mention me after gossiping about people. They'd end with something like, ""yeah cause of people like that *expletive*"".

AITA for not letting them have the one seat on a bus they want because they're pretty rude and obnoxious?

(Edit) Additional info:
A few have asked why I sat near her in the first place. Here's a picture for reference of what the train looks like: https://www.alamy.com/empty-seats-on-a-go-train-traveling-in-ontario-image69622478.html
1) I sat diagonal from her. There's actually a pretty decent amount of room. We were not in each other's space much if at all. If I was in a pod alone and a stranger came in that's the best spot for them to take and I would not have thought much of it personally but I'm open to being wrong or thought of as an ass for it.
2) I was on a 5 day bachelor trip for a buddy in New Orleans. I'm not into gambling/partying but I did stay up and hang out just to be a good sport. I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep, and then I got off a 5 hour plane ride back to Toronto, and then I had to a train to take this train and there's obviously a lot of walking involved between every stop, my carry on is not on wheels so it was extra tiring lugging it around. By the time I got to the train I just wanted to grab a seat quickly as I was really tired.
3) To the best of my recollection at least the first 2 pods had people in them, and it's not easy to just look down and know which pods are empty after that because sometimes people's heads don't stick out so I just picked a seat that was close and I didn't no have to sit next to or in front of anyone. If I could do it over yes I would suck it up and walk further to find an empty pod but that day I was weak and it got the best of me and I didn't expect to find someone so rude and unreasonable to deal with either.",40,106,0.89

She says I’m being disrespectful and they’re her dresses so I don’t have a say in it, she gets to decide if I can wear them or not.

416,Not the A-hole,"I (26f) have grown up being ultra aware of my weight and appearance due to comments by parents, but especially my dad, made. 

I was a chubby kid (not severely obese, but chubby - about 20lbs or so overweight) and I would understand a parent wanting to get their kid healthy, but I was encouraged to starve myself and go on fad diets from about the age of 12. I thinned out a bit by 16 but my dad still sent me to glorified fat camps for summers of sophomore and junior year to “keep it off” and “maybe lose 5 or 10 more.” 

Around age 22 I went to therapy and made a lot of progress as by then I’d developed an eating disorder. Since then I’ve been a healthy weight and much less obsessive. My dad of course has made comments over recent years that I don’t look as pretty and might lose opportunities because I’m not willing to keep “putting the work in.” 

Anyway, my dad is getting older and the past couple years put on a lot of weight after retirement (he had a job that required staying pretty in shape). It’s quite noticeable.

Well, I was invited to a dinner a month ago with my parents and some of their friends in celebration of my dad’s birthday. 

When the cake came around, he commented to me that I should really stick to just a half a piece. I snapped and quite loudly said maybe he should worry about himself and shouldn’t have any. I said soon enough he could start playing Santa at Christmas for my nieces because his growing gut turns him into a dead ringer. 

I don’t actually care what my dad looks like and it makes sense for people to gain as they get older. But I’m so. sick. Of the snide comments. I have asked many times for my weight not to be up for discussion. I feel that my comment was justified, however my dad has refused to talk to me since then and my mom has yelled at me numerous times about how I humiliated my father on his birthday. She’s also furious and it seems like what I said has harmed my relationship with both of them for a long time.

AITA? 

tl;dr my dad has always criticized my weight, even sending me to fat camps and encouraging starving myself/other fad diets from age 12. He made a snide comment at his birthday dinner that I should only have a half a piece of cake. I basically called him fat in return, loudly, in front of his friends and our family.

417,Not the A-hole,"I am 19F, my mom is 36F, her new husband is 40ishM. 

My mom met this guy in November of 2019. They got married last month without any warning. Our family has known him for forever as a family friend but nothing personal. He’s nice enough, but everyone, including myself, is just not comfortable with him yet. It’s extremely touchy for our family as the marriage was very rushed and there is always continuous drama. 

I don’t live at home. My boyfriend and I rent a house together. However, I had surgery around 2 months ago and my mom has been taking me to and from my post op appointments. I have had this issue that the surgery was for around 2 years. My mom has always went with me and done my bandages and care when I couldn’t as it’s on my lower back and I cannot see what I’m doing. She drives me to and from as I usually have to take a pain pill at some period on appointment days. 

When we moved into our house, I had surgery about 3 months later and my mom came over during the day to help me shower, move, and change my bandages. My boyfriend also works during the day so it was easiest for my mom to do these things. 

However, my past few post op appointments (every 2 weeks) she has made every excuse for her new husband to come. I’ve told her I’m not comfortable with him coming at all even if he just sits in the car because I don’t know him like that yet. Before it has been that she started taking new sleeping medication, my little sister wanted to come and needed company to sit in the car, etc. Just things that could be solved. Even my grandmother has offered to drive the both of us and sit in the car. 

I have an appointment tomorrow. Today she again said that would have to drive because her “car needed fixing”. This was a lie as she literally drove it today and it was fine as my sister was with her and told me this. 

I offered to let her drive my car. I also offered for my boyfriend to drive the both of us and him just sit in the car. She told me she had already asked her husband to go and it would hurt his feelings. I told her I didn’t really care as he’s an adult and it’s not really anything to do with him.

418,Not the A-hole,"First time poster and on mobile so sorry for formatting. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’ve (19M) been with my current SO (18F) since we were 14. I’ve never had the best relationship with her family, regardless of how hard I try, but it’s never been so much of an issue before now.

My SO and her brother (10M) have been “sharing” an Xbox One (which was gifted to her on her birthday by her mother, mind you) for a little under 2 years now and by sharing, I mean, she gets to play only when he isn’t, which is rare, and her mother (37F) thinks this is fair. I don’t think that’s okay so before the holidays this year, I decided to get another part time job to put the money aside and get her a gaming console of her choice for either Christmas or her Birthday. I told her on December 25th what my gift idea was and she was ecstatic, but her mother and brother were less than thrilled. 

Her brother has behavioral issues and is EXTREMELY spoiled by their mother. He was upset because it’s not fair that she gets a new game console and he still has to share the Xbox. Her mother also said it wasn’t fair unless she was sharing her game console as well. I told them that my gift to her is my choice. If I buy her a diamond ring, do I have to buy one for her brother too? So, I told them I’d be getting her her own console as my gift to her. Fast forward 2 weeks, girlfriend and I go out, she picks out a Nintendo Switch and is very happy to play all the Nintendo games. Over the last 3 months, he has been non-stop complaining about wanting to play on the Nintendo switch and she hasn’t let him because it’s hers and he didn’t want to share the Xbox. So what does he do? He waits for her and I to go out to pick up dinner and he takes the switch and breaks it. The screen was SHATTERED, the machine didn’t even turn on when plugged into the base. The only reason we knew was because there were still shards of glass/plastic on his bedroom floor. What did her mother say? “Well, what do you expect me to do about it? He can’t pay for it and I’m not paying for his mistakes.” Well, I call bs, they can sell the Xbox and put the funds towards her new switch and I’ve just about reached my limit with him. 

Over the last 4 years, he’s broken a few of my possessions including a phone, a watch, etc. None of those bothered me until now and I haven’t spoken to him in 2 weeks. He speaks to me and I walk past him like he’s not there. Now her mother says I’m being an AH for ignoring him, I’m an adult and “he made a mistake”, “he’s just a kid”, etc. Him and I used to have a decent relationship and play sports together or video games and now I just don’t acknowledge him.

419,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE! I nicely asked what she was going to do with the money (I didn't want to insinuate that I thought she'd already spent it). She said that it all went to medical bills from *things* that led up to her being infertile. Honestly I'm ok with that. 


 A family member of mine is struggling with infertility.   I'm very close with her and her husband and I wanted so badly for them to have their dream of becoming parents.

When they started a Go Fund Me to pay for in vitro fertilization I donated $500 and through the GFM they raised an admirable >$3k. Unfortunately, for those who are familiar, $3k is no where near the $10k they need.

Since then, she's told me that she's going to accept ""God's plan"" and that they aren't going to have kids. She isn't looking into adoption because she really just wanted *her own* (biological) kid. I expressed my sympathy and asked what she was going to do with the GFM money. She said that she isn't intending to return the $ because if she had gotten to $10k she WOULD have done in vitro. 

To another family member, I expressed that this didn't sit well with me and they freaked out calling me insensitive. Am I wrong here?

Note, there was no clause in the GFM that if she didn't reach her goal that the $ would be refunded, that I am aware of.",379,4729,0.97
420,Asshole,"Wait! My fiancé loves being called a whore, slut, etc. Don't castrate me. 

Me(24M) and my fiancé(24F) are staying in the guest house near her parents house, as they want her to stay close during the *situation*.

While we were at home (her parents' guest house), my fiancé decided she wanted to initiate sexy time. Like right then, while I was in the middle of playing a video game. She wouldn't let me get to a checkpoint. You see, it's very difficult to play while someone is kissing your neck/trying to bite you. I kept telling her give me, like, two more minutes, but I don't know what porno she just finished watching to *this* needy. Whatever, I blew the game and was being rather rough with her when her mom called. She got off me mid kiss to go answer the phone, and basically her mom said food was ready, come over right now etc. We were mildly annoyed as we put our clothes back on, but we didn't start fucking so no harm no foul.

Fast forward to when we're eating dinner, I'm still mildly annoyed we didn't get to start, and I decide to return the favor of her distracting me by pinching her thigh when her parents aren't paying attention. Shes into it, don't worry. We finished eating and her mom takes everyone's plates and her dad went to the living to watch some desi movie, idk. So while everyone's back is turned she thinks it's a good idea to try to slip her hand up my shirt. We're both playing, keep in mind. I push her hand and her elbow bumps into the table while I say ""God, you're *such* a whore."" I guess it was louder than intended because both of her parents heads *snap* towards me.

I almost had a heart attack, I swear.

We were having fun, but from her parents perspective, all they hear is *painful thump* you're such a whore!

Yeah, I understand why they kicked me out.

Her dad yelled at me, how dare I call his daughter that in *his* house. Her mom was cursing me in her native language, and though I didn't understand I knew enough curse words to know she was *mad*.

My fiancé was telling them to calm down but her parents were not having it. Her parents are brown, we can't just explain to them that she likes being called a whore, she'll call us crazy. Her dad yelled at me to gtfo, I didn't wanna piss him off more so I left and she stayed and later told me she was trying to make up some scenario on that spot to why that would be acceptable but her parents weren't having it.

I went ""home"" and I get like 7 text messages from my fiancé saying that I'm an idiot, why would I do that *in front* of her parents, her mom is gossiping to all of her sisters etc. I didn't feel bad then because I knew we were fine but it's the next day and her parents aren't letting her see me and I feel bad now. I didn't mean for them to hear but they did and they're furious with me.

423,Asshole,"Hello all. Throwaway b/c I’d rather not have this associated with my main. I have family that lurks on here. 

I (30F) am pregnant with my first child, and it’s a girl!!!!💗💗🎀🎀🎀 I’m so excited to meet her. She’s definitely a bright spot in our lives right now. I also have a large, traditional, very Irish-Catholic family. There’s a lot of reusing names—i.e. one cousin is “Rose Elizabeth” while another is “Elizabeth Rose.” So far, it’s worked without too many snafus and a lot of compromise. 

Here’s where there might be an issue. My uncle and I have a mutual interest in family genealogy, and we’ve been trying to create a family tree via old letters/documents. As I was going through it, I found what I consider to be the perfect name—for these purposes, I’ll say that it’s “Mabel Josephine”, nn Mae. My husband loves it too, and it’s the first name that we’ve agreed on since we found out she was a girl. 

My sister (34F), however, is named Mae Janice. She has a daughter named Mei with her ex-husband as well. When I told her what our plans were, she kind of made a face and said that I needed to choose another nickname. Her reasoning is that there are way too many Mae/Meis in our family already, and that it’s gotten confusing and frustrating. She asked if we would mind using the full name but calling her something else—i.e. ‘Bella.’ I got really mad, and I admit that I said some regrettable things about her family and husband. We aren’t speaking now. 

AITA? I want to use this historically significant name for my daughter, every single part of it. My family is mostly on my side, but the other day our brother suggested that I had been a bit too harsh in how I’ve gone about this, and that it would save everyone a lot of drama and confusion if I just chose another goddamn nickname. But at this point, it’s the principle of the thing.",68,81,0.7

426,Not the A-hole,"Some time ago, we divorced which was originally amicable at the beginning but when it came time to discuss custody things began to break down. I wanted 50/50 split custody but she wanted about 80/20, and her reasoning was that she was a SAHM so the kids would be more comfortable with her. Even tho I was the primary earner I still have a great relationship with my children and that’s something really worked hard at and I’m proud of that fact. Anyways the judge ordered 60/40 in her favor and I pay 4500 monthly which, if you go by my state’s CS calculator, is more than I should be paying but if my kids are doing okay then that’s all I care about.

I made a risky choice to quit my job and start a business that’s now paying off big time and my per annum earnings have nearly doubled. I thought we were on at the very least cordial terms so when I was dropping off the kids she was asking me how life is going and you know the typical friendly co-parenting conversations, I said it’s going pretty pretty good. She noticed I had a new car and I said yeah my business is doing pretty well. She casually asked if that means that the child support payments will be increasing, and I said I’ll think about it. I deliberated at length and I decided that if she cannot prove that she needs it then I’m against increasing the payments voluntarily. I’ve never missed a payment, I cover her and the 2 kids under my health insurance plan, and I’m almost singlehandedly funding their 529’s since she barely makes enough to have discretionary income to contribute towards the plans, even with the fact that I have to pay spousal maintenance.

She asserts that I can afford it but the reality is that I live a very frugal life. I’m single in my forties and I give the vast majority of my wealth away to charities and people who need the money more than I do. I live in a modest 4bed condo and the only reason for that is because I want my kids to have their own spaces, otherwise I’d just downsize. 

She’s now threatening to take me to court and she says that my “unwillingness to be fair” is going to blow up our otherwise good co-parenting relationship but if that happens it’d be because of her own greed. The kids have foods in their bellies. Rent is paid (and if she’s got issues with covering it from time to time I don’t mind stepping in to help). The new car I got was only because I was driving a beater for years and finally got rid of it. We (including her) live a comfortable life so I really for the life of me cannot see a reason to do what she’s asking.

Slight edit: because a lot of people keep bringing up the quality of life argument as a reason for increasing child support, and it’s a damn good reason. Except it doesn’t apply to our family. Me and my ex have worked very hard to minimize all differences between us in terms of my place vs her place. Although I guess you could say I’m wealthier, I try very much to live within my means. What I’m trying to say is that there is practically no difference when my kids go to her place vs when they stay at mine. Source: my children themselves, who have said so.

One more thing. Some have asked how much I’m paying. The court ordered me to pay 3k/month in support along with 3200 monthly in spousal maintenance. The alimony order expired 2 years ago but I have continued to pay it out of goodwill for her. I have also paid her an additional 1500 in addition to the CS payments as a quasi-emergency fund thing. Now that she’s shown her greed, I’m however seriously considering removing the voluntary portions of what I give her.

Edit #2: I’ll reiterate this because some people seem to have missed it and I’m not sure if that’s because I didn’t make it clear enough or because some of y’all just aren’t reading. I pushed for split custody because as far as I know, both back then and now, my ex is a fit parent. No drug addictions or anything like that, so I didn’t want to deprive my children of their mother for seemingly no reason. SHE wanted 80/20 which was unacceptable because I wouldn’t get to see my kids at all. So I petitioned to the judge for 50/50 and he gave her primary custody which hurt because I’m not abusive, I’m a man of upstanding character, and I have an awesome relationship with my children. It hurt a lot, and it still does.",270,654,0.93

428,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have 11 mo old twins. I’m a high school teacher, so I’m home with them now and teaching remotely (another whole issue). He works shift work and alternates between 12 hour days/ nights. He averages about half the month off and half on.

My partner loves his phone, like we all do. He’s very active on reddit, communicates with his friends, and watches tons of YouTube. It’s not mindless stuff (except Clash of Clans) but more like his hobbies and such. He has lots of hobbies and that’s great. He is the type to really get into stuff. 

Here’s the problem. He spends more time on his phone around the babies than I would like. I’m not innocent of it by any means, but he really sits on it around them. He’s a great dad; he cooks for them and he does play with them and love on them, but he is on his phone a lot. Sometimes he’ll put them in their bouncers and just sit on his phone until they are fussing to get out. Sometimes he’ll splay toys out and then sits on it. Sometimes he’ll put something on the tv to occupy them. Sometimes he’ll leave the babies in their cribs after they are awake for a long while or they clearly don’t need a nap because he’s on his phone still. They have to be fussing pretty hard for him to go get them we get does that. He’s just not as engaged with them as I would like. Play sessions might be between 10-15 minutes then it’s time for them to do something else so he can look at his phone. 

Here’s where I think I could be TA. Husband is currently on nights which means he is gone from 5 pm to 6 am. He comes home and goes to bed until about 12-1 pm. That leaves 1-5 that he is up and home with the babies (they also nap during this time and he gets ready for work). He does nights for 3-4 nights in a row. Today, the babies were playing on the ground and he was just on his phone again. I’ve been helping them practice walking and teaching them to sign and stuff, and I just want him to play with them. I need a break too (especially since I’m still teaching and at home with babies) and I would like to just sit around on my phone too!

In the past I have mentioned to him that he is on his phone a lot. I say we both need to work on it (because we do). I’ve been direct about how it’s teaching the babies to value phones too much (and they do gravitate to them now). So today, while he was laying on his phone, I said things like “oh babies, don’t you wish your dad would play with you before he goes to work?” and “Daddy can be on his phone all night (which is true; he even takes a charger to work), but he is doing it now instead of spending time with you!” and other obviously guilt-tripping tactics—I fully admit. He got angry at me, but in his anger, he grabbed both babies and now I hear them playing in the other room. 

I recognize the hypocrisy of typing this out on my phone while he is playing with them, and I do think I hurt his feelings, but if it makes him spend quality time with the babies, is that so bad?

After class, my professor emailed me and asked me to “please dress more appropriately for class in the future” and that “my very obvious nipple piercings were distracting while he was trying to teach”.

My wife & I bought a house last year a few miles from where my mom moved from. We have 2 daughters, the youngest & oldest grandkids in the family respectively. It was always the plan that we would still do holidays here. Everyone had been traveling back here for years & it’s where we all grew up. Mine is also the one house that everyone can fit in (we had the prospect of hosting holidays in mind when we were house hunting).

We did Thanksgiving separately after having traveled a lot for family wedding in October. After Thanksgiving, OB suddenly says that he should host Christmas because he’s “the elder” & because he’s been driving here for the past decade. Mind you, this guy drives 9 hours to climb mountains on the other side of the state 3-4 times a month, driving directly past me to do so. He says this was the first year his 1 year old would be “present” for Christmas so she should be home for it. He essentially gave the family an ultimatum between 2 houses 100 miles apart.

The weekend before Christmas, OB was in town for the holiday dinner with my mom’s side & suddenly it was his wife’s idea. He really did want to come to our house. Mom agreed that we’d all try to push for Christmas at my house in a few days. That’s what I was told. 

What happened was my second older brother arriving from the Midwest & along with my mother, hopping in the car the next day (Christmas Eve) to go stay with OB until they all went home 3 days later, all while telling us they were working on getting OB to come here. My wife, kids & I were the only ones left out. 

The following week OB sent out a group text saying how much he enjoyed the holiday & how we should all rent a house in Ohio next year so we could have a “neutral site” which directly contradicted his whole argument about needing to be home. I took this text as a personal fuck you.

432,Not the A-hole,"Update: thank you all, reading these comments have been enlightening and helped lift my heavy heart 💜

This happened a long time ago, but to this day I still think about it. 

Some backstory: my parents split up for the final time when I (28f) was 7 and my sister was 4. 
My mum had very clear boundaries with us - what was hers was hers and what was ours was also hers because we were her children. For example, this meant that I wasn't allowed to use so much as her hairbrush without permission, but that if I got a pair of shoes as a gift from someone else, she'd try them on first to see if they look ""better"" on her. If they did they were now hers.

Around 11, my dad brought me and my sister our very first bikes. They were really nice - mine was purple. We lived in a block of flats on a council estate, and even though we weren't allowed out, my mum would sometimes let us come with her to play with her friend's kids when she went to visit them (they lived on our estate). 

On this particular day we took our bikes out and she told me to give her my bike. I told her no - I wanted to ride. She started telling me off, calling me spoilt, how could I not let my mother ride the bike, she just needed it to go up the road to go to the shops, she'll be back in 10 mins. 
I submitted, mainly because she was berating me in front of her friends and the other kids - I was embarrassed and felt a fool. 

I watched her ride off, and some time later watched her come back into view. Our estate was enclosed from the street, and when she stopped to turn in, she fell forward off the bike smacking her face on the gravel. 

I watched as her friends helped her up and took her to their flat (which was very close to where we were) and I ran up to my abandoned bike distraught at the state of it. The frame and handle bars were bent, and the paint was all scruffed up so you could see large patches of silver through the purple. I cried my eyes out and I remember running up to her friend's kitchen window and saying, ""you broke my bike, it's ruined.""

She got really angry at me, told me to stop crying and being so melodramatic, that it was sick that I was more concerned for my bike than I was for her wellbeing - my own mother. She said I was materialistic and a spoilt brat. In my head, I remember thinking that her friends were taking care of her and she seemed alright (she was) but my bike had just been treated like trash and nobody seemed to care. 

AITA for being more upset about my bike being broken than my mum hurting herself? I feel like I was justified, but to this day my mum is adamant that I'm wrong. I'm trying to get reality set straight in my head and if I was wrong I need to know so I can check myself. Thanks for reading.",35,46,0.89

434,Not the A-hole,"So a few months ago my Gf had to get a skin lesion cut out. Just removing an infection about the size of a dime then stitching it back up. She asked me about a week before if I would go with her. I told her I don’t think so because I had just started my last semester of college and had class at the time. She said okay, but a few days later made me feel bad for not volunteering to go with her, so I made arrangements to skip class. 
Till this day she still shames me for being selfish saying that the fact that I initially didn’t want to skip class is a reflection of my bad character.

435,Not the A-hole,"Alright, now that I read the title, it sounds pretty bad, but let me explain. My family has a dog who’s six months old and pretty small, think cocker spaniel. He’s a puppy, so he’s jumpy, but whenever we meet people we make sure we can hold him back and he has gotten much better at greeting people. My neighbor, who lives downstairs, has two cats. Of course, whenever the pup meets her he smells the cats and gets all jumpy. We restrain him and apologize every time, usually he doesn’t even jump on her because we grab him. We’re always extremely apologetic about his behavior to her, and make it known that she can tell us if his barking gets too loud. 

Today I was taking him out for a walk as my designated teen duties (I’m 15) and we encounter the neighbor in the tiny lobby space. It’s less than 5x5, so not even much space for two. Of course the dog goes crazy, and I grab him to make sure he doesn’t jump. This is where my neighbor, who’s never owned a dog in her life, decides to teach me how to handle the pup. 

She grabs him, already setting me on edge, and tries to sit him down on the ground. The pup, thinking it’s time to play with this new person, only jumps up more. Then the neighbor begins to go on about how “yeah, this is how it’s done, you have to do it like this.” And telling me that we need to get him into obedience school ASAP. I’m polite, laughing and saying how jumpy he is and sort of agreeing with her. 

I try and leave, saying he needs his walk, but apparently I haven’t gotten her message. She just keeps going on and making these passive aggressive little comments about the dog all while pretty much holding him down. Eventually, I have enough and tell her, 

“Can you please not grab him, it’s making him more jumpy, and we’ll get him in obedience school as soon as the schools open up again, along with everything else.” 

And then leave to go on the walk. She then told my parents about the way I talked to her, but they know she’s like this so swayed more to my side, but told me to not go off on her like that. 

Yes, I know I could’ve been more polite, and I should’ve just left. I also have the suspicion that she doesn’t like the dog much because of the occasional barking, but she always says she can’t hear it? It’s just, she does this all the time and she doesn’t and never has had dog, only cats. AITA for snapping a bit?",22,56,0.88
436,Not the A-hole,"I live with my fiance, mother in law, father in law, and father in law's sister, who I will refer to as my Aunt in this story. We used to live alone but father in law lost his job and couldn't afford the house so we moved in to help out. Now we have things split up where we pay for some things and they pay for others. One of the things we buy is paper products for the house.



Our aunt moved a few months ago when she was kicked out of her son's house for not contributing to the household, and I assume other reasons. She is not super fun to be around, complains about everything, refuses to eat anything except things typically children eat like chicken tenders and hot dogs. No veggies, nothing else. I'm typically the one who cooks and I use a lot of veggies so she has refused to try anything I've made, even the times I've attempted to cater to her preferences. Just trying to give you guys an idea of what her personality is like.



On to the toilet paper problem. My fiance and I share the guest bathroom, and now also share it with our aunt now. We take 7 - 9 days to use one roll of toilet paper (I calculated so I always know when to buy more before she moved in). After she moved in we went through an entire roll every 2 days. These are the huge rolls that barely fit in the holder. I recalculated and it looks like she uses close to 50 sheets of good Charmin every time she uses the bathroom.



Honestly I'm flabbergasted. I have never seen anyone use this much. Before the current emergency state we would make jokes that she wipes with the whole roll. I really didn't want to say anything, so we bought a bidet to hopefully help.



She refuses to use it. Now, my fiance and I use even less paper, but we're still running out at the same pace. I have no idea what to do, so I'm at a crossroads right now. My mother in law and father in law are nonconfrontational and refuse to talk to her about it even though they are even more upset than I am. They're worried about the pipes as well.



So, I feel like I can either ask my aunt to start buying toilet paper from her meager babysitting income with which she already pays for her own gas and car insurance. She has bought it a couple of times but she always buys the cheapest one ply toilet paper. Or I can talk to her about her usage and see if there's anything we can do to lessen it. Maybe she doesn't know she uses a lot? 



Maybe we could start keeping our personal toilet paper separate, which is something we are trying now. She has 4 rolls until she's out and we will switch to some leftover one ply from the last time she bought. My Fiance and I have a couple of rolls squirreled away and they should last us about a month with the bidet. We were thinking of taking it to the bathroom when we need to use it and hiding it back in our room to try and force her to either buy toilet paper or use the bidet. I just feel like that's petty and we should probably talk to her about it instead.

What should I do? How do I avoid being an asshole here?",39,106,0.91
437,Everyone Sucks,"My son is 21 years old and lives at home with his dad and 2 sisters (19,14). Pot is legal where we live and I know he does smoke. My husband and I both agree we don’t want it in the family home. 

Our son knows he is not allowed to smoke in the house, and anything I find laying around I will throw away. If he wants to smoke he can go to one of his friends houses, but we have been clear it is not be in our house. 

There have been a few times I’ve seen a pipe laying around in his room that I’ve yelled at him for, but I didn’t take it from him or anything. The other day I went in this room while he was at the store. I went in there to grab his dirty clothes and as soon as I opened the door I smelled pot. It was strong and I hate the smell of it which is part of the reason why we don’t allow it in the house. 

I saw the pot scattered on his desk, and he knows the rules, so he should have hid it or something. I took a tissue and wiped it up and flushed it down the toilet. My husband found it pretty funny and wanted to see our sons reaction, when he got home I told him what happened. My son was pissed at me for getting rid of it and I told them he’s not supposed to leave it out. 

My son was pissed and claiming I should pay him which I said fat chance. I’m not reimbursing my son for throwing out his weed. He said it’s legal and he’s old enough to be using it, so I told him he’s old enough to look for his own place than if he wants to smoke whenever he wants. He accused me of snooping through his stuff, which I would never do, I told him the pot was sitting on his desk in plain sight. 

He then went to complain to his sister about it. She told me I didn’t need to throw it away, But he knows the rules. She told me That since he’s 21 (and she’s 19) that my husband and I really shouldn’t be going in their rooms anymore unless we get clear permission from them. If they still want me washing their clothes I have to get them somehow. My son knows the rules and I’ll keep throwing his shit out if he leaves it around.

438,Not the A-hole,"I (29m) sometimes have fights with my fiance (25f) as we all do from time to time. So let me just tell the facts of what happened and let you guys give your opinion. We were having our disagreement before work and time was a concern, she had a web interview for work (at home) and I had to leave because I was already late for work. Things started to get heated so I did what I thought was best before things went south. So I got dressed and politely got in my car and left. She watched me drive away and she was visible angry. I like any person can tell when I'm getting frustrated to the point I might say something inappropriate and or rude so I left to chill out. I know her and she will argue with me and escalate the situation to the point where she will start crying and stonewall me emotionally. I care about her so I didn't want her to be in any worse of a mental state then she already was for her interview. She obviously did not see it that way, she thinks I'm a jerk for calmly putting the argument on hold until I got home. We tried to talk it out over the phone as I'm driving but we did not come to understand each other in that time. While I'm at work and before we had more time to sit and talk to each other she posts this on facebook:  
 

>Sometimes the only support you need is from yourself.  
>  
>It's best to rely on yourself when other people are unreliable.

We talked after I got home from work and absolutely talked everything through until we amicably understood each other and we were both happy again. I don't get on Facebook unless I'm really bored and didn't see her post until 3 days later. I politely told her that I saw it and it hurt my feelings, she thinks I'm being a jackass and policing her facebook because ""it's vague enough no one knows that she's talking about me."" I agree that it's vague and no one knows for sure but still... people aren't dumb. She thinks it's ok because she didn't say ""LuteBear is being such a dick."" It hurt my feelings because she had to go vent about a very private discussion publicly on facebook **before** we could talk about it like adults. She said I am unreliable because I left in the middle of an argument and that pissed her off before her important interview. I obviously don't see it that way, it was clear to both sides that voices were getting raised and you can feel the tension in the air. I personally don't see any positive reasons for venting about it on facebook as it only exists to seed anger in the other person and make things worse. It to me shows how little faith she has in our ability as a couple to talk things out. I don't go through life thinking I can't work things out with people. But I want to address her points as well, she says ""I'm not letting her express herself."" That ""I guess only LuteBear's feelings matter and she can't say anything out of line in LuteBear's book."" She considers it casual facebook posting and not venting.",38,45,0.86

There is an apartment unit next to my property with 6 units, they have 6 trash bins which they store less than 6 inches from my property line. A lot of the units dump their trash straight into the bins, and the ones that use bag over fill the bins with untied bags even though other bins are empty. The bins are stored in an alley way between my property. The slightest breeze blows trash from their untied bags onto my property, when the wind picks up it blows the lids open to the other bins and also blows the lose trash onto my property. The trash blows on my property on a daily basis, you name it it has blown on my property IE used tampons/pads, food plates, food ETC. 

I told the property owner about this issue asking that he move the bins so this stops happening, all he has done is tell his tenants to use bags and tie them which they still do not do. So the past four years I have been putting on gloves, pick the trash up and throw it in their back yard where it can't blow back over. One day one of the tenants who dumps trash with out bags sees me does. He says to me you can't do that, that's your trash. I laugh at him and tell him to use bags and I won't have to throw his trash in his back yard. He then tells me it's my trash cause it blew on my property and he will call the police. I say great call the police so we can discuss your littering by refusing to contain your trash. I go inside and he never called the police.

441,No A-holes here,"My husband and I have been taking care of my parents for 10+ years, beginning with my father’s inability to drive. This began with driving to all appointments, and through the years has evolved into full time caregiving. Since my mother’s death nine years ago I have been my father’s housekeeper, cook, and yard ‘man’. I have never asked for or received any compensation. We invited him to move in 3 years ago.
He is now 98. 

My only sister does not help us. She used to live in the same town and would show up for dinner, and without helping to prepare or clean up, would eat and leave. She moved an hour away several years ago and visits a few times a month. She says she’s helping - she talks non-stop, never asks Dad how he is, takes a nap, and drives home.  There is no reason she cannot take part - she has a good income, only works part-time, has no dependents, has a good relationship with our father and lives near-by. 

Since beginning caregiving, my husband and I have not had a vacation or any significant break. Medicare does not provide any respite care and home care services require a weekly commitment of 20 hours. My sister has had numerous get-aways including trips to London (twice), Ireland, and Ecuador. While planning her next trip to Europe, I suggested she stay with Dad instead so we could have a break, and she flew into a rage. She claimed that since she doesn’t get paid vacation, it wasn’t possible. Asked why she couldn’t use the same time off she uses for vacations, she couldn’t comprehend what I was talking about. 
 
My father is aware of the conflict and agrees she is being unreasonable.

I have since blocked her on phone, email and text (my husband mediates any necessary communication). I have no plans to re-connect with her, even after our father dies.

EDIT:  I left out some background in an attempt to offer a neutral description. We planned the caregiving to be shared. I would do most of the hands on care and she would offer occasional breaks and some financial assistance. During this time she has spent 3 nights with dad. There has been no financial assistance. 

After the conversation about her using some vacation time to stay with dad, she sent an email saying I was dead to her and she never wanted to see me again. She has previously taken out a restraining order against me twice. The decision to block her comes after a lifetime of her harassing me. Rather than engage in useless arguments, I decided to ignore her.",77,206,0.95

443,Asshole,"Throwaway. This took place awhile ago but the fallout is still hot. My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

However since then, I have made repeated attempts to call him back but he has refused my calls. I understand he has the right to be mad but he should also understand I did it so he wouldn't be stressing over what would be a happy time in his life.",2625,13244,0.86
444,Not the A-hole,"I have been dating a single mother for about 6 months although we knew eachother for a little over a year. We live in the same gigantic complex. Often times I have to go into work on scheduled days off (an important detail to remember). She works as a remote sales rep for some kind of distributor and shares custody of her 8 year old demon son. When it comes to finances, I make a decent living and I budget for everything and she spends her money almost as fast as she gets it.

Here's what happened:

One day we're at my place and I just got a brand new tv and we're watching a movie off my xbox(65 inch 4k,about $700).I suddenly get a call from work informing me that there's an QA audit. After an audit, the auditor reviews with the GM (roughly 30 min) and during that time, all department heads & division leaders must report to the boardroom for the preliminary results. I tell my lady I should be back in an hour, and as I'm getting dressed, I remind her that he's not allowed to play on the console without me being there (He's broken 2 controllers).

While waiting for the GM, I receive in a group text from my neighbors (we play gta and modern warfare together) they're asking me wtf is going on because I'm playing so shitty. I tell them I'm not home, they send me a screenshot of my xbox user name in the party, I send them back a selfie showing I'm at work. This is strike 1. I get back to the apartment and notice the tv is off but the xbox is still on and nobody is there. Cue the text

Me: So when were you going to tell me that my tv was broken?

Her: Wait your tv is broken? (Strike 2)

Me: First you disrespect me by allowing him to play on the xbox and he breaks my tv and instead of letting me know, you shut it off and go home? 

Her: You're right, I'm sorry. Go ahead and buy another one and I'll pay you back.

Me: WTF?!?! That is not how this shit works. You are going to replace it.

Her: You know I don't have that kind of money. Why are you being such a dick about this?

Me: You make that kind of money. Frankly I'm tired of your kid terrorizing my dog, breaking shit in my apt, and it goes unpunished. 

She finally apologizes for how she acted. We agree that she will replace it. Around mid march, I'm at her place and she gets a delivery. She buys herself a brand new macbook, her demon child gets an ipad and his own xbox one, oh and I get my replacement tv... a 32 inch smart tv that was older than the one I replaced (it had an external wifi antenna). (Strike 3!)I laughed, put the box down and walked out without saying a word. Later, she tags me in an IG post where she says ""When your ungrateful bf rejects his gift""

A buddy gave me the idea to take her to small claims court. Others think I'll be taking it too far.

EDIT: Okay folks, here's the update. However, let me explain because I accidentally removed how I found out the tv was broken. The screen itself wasn't cracked but when I turned it on, it was a huge black circle and this webbing of cracked lines.
So I was on a conference call with my buddy's gf's friend who interned at a small firm and a paralegal that she knew there. I was explained that yes I have a case and all I needed was the text where she admitted fault and  agreed to replace my original tv. While it's not necessary, we can both have attorneys present (however due to the low monetary value it'd be pointless). To file would be $80, and the actual court fees would be $200. I would only be allowed to ask the judge for the court fee to be billed to her but it would completely be at the judge's discretion. The court wouldn't rule that she had to replace the tv, only that she would owe me the original value I paid because she agreed to the actual replacement (no depreciation) and collecting what I'm owed would be completely up to me and the courts won't help. At best, I could sell the debt to a collection agency and at best I walk out with $100-200 in my pocket. 
Like many of you, he advised that I threaten to take legal action and usually that would be enough to get someone to pay up. So he sent me an email which I took a screenshot and forwarded to her. Email stated that he'd be willing to take on the case, he'd charge her my fees if we win, if there were any retaliation I'd have grounds for an actual civil suit (not true) but I would have to wait 10 days for a response but I would have to document one final attempt to collect prior to filing. I told her that she had one week to either purchase the tv and deliver in person or a confirmation email from the source if she decided to purchase online. I sent a copy of the text to one of our ""mutual friend"" in thr event that I was blocked. This was roughly 6pm, at 10pm I received a text from my ex asking if I was really that much of an a-hole to take her the court over $700? My response? ""It's not about the money, it's about sending a message"" (God, I always wanted to use that line)

Recently with everything going on they’ve started making plans for what they’re planning when they’re no longer with us.

As a background I’m 25, married with a two year old son, we live close to my in laws because to be honest they’re brilliant, when we’re at work they look after him to save us on childcare fees and generally help us with a lot of other stuff.

Well this didn’t go down well at all, my mum instantly shot me down saying no I would have to move to their house and live there to make it easier on my brother.
I said I understand that but it’s not possible, my job and support structure is here I can’t just uproot my life if something did happen. 

My mum started getting really angry saying she knew I wouldn’t help them and that they would agree with my younger brother (22) to look after my little brother but not to expect anything from them when they die because I won’t deserve it.

I shot back with that’s totally fine by me, if it comes with strings I don’t want or need anything from them. My mum then hung up on me.

Now they’re not talking to me at all, all I’ve had is a message from my dad saying that they’re both extremely disappointed that I couldn’t put my little brother first.

447,Not the A-hole,"If anybody needs this information, I am 17.

Since March 15th, I have been laid off. I have not been working ever since so I've been at the house. My mom would ask me biweekly (when she gets paid) if I can take her to the grocery store to buy food. I always say yes and take her.

However, my brother recently talked to our insurance company and they told him that since ""I'm never moving my car"", if I want to, I can store it in a garage (my parents are divorced and my dad owns a house, so we would store the car at his house) and I would only have to pay for the comprehensive which would just be 13 dollars a month. I figured since I've only moved the car maybe two times since I last worked, I saw no point in continuing to pay 115 dollars. I have money saved up, but I only have around 380 since yesterday and who knows how long this stay-home will go on before I can go back to working. 

Today my mom officially found out that I took my car to my dad's house and left it there. She asked why and I told her I'm barely moving it so I'd might as well just leave it there. Without me talking, she basically went on a rant and accused me of changing my insurance plan because I didn't want to take her anywhere and because I wouldn't let her borrow my car.

For starters, my mom used to have two cars. She had a jeep liberty that had too many mechanical problems so she stopped using, then she had the toyota camry that my brother previously owned. It made a loud ringing noise, but it was still movable and managed to get her from point to point B. About a couple of weeks ago, she ended up buying another car. She bought another jeep liberty. Little did she know that jeep liberty also came with mechanical problems. About two weeks ago, she sold the toyota camry to junker and said she plans to use that money to fix the problems with the new jeep liberty she bought. She still hasn't taken it to the mechanic.

She had asked if she could borrow my car while she gets the jeep fixed. I told her no because (1) my dad made it clear that the car was for me and for me to drive (he was the one who bought my car) and (2) I hate how she drives (3) when I put the my car under her insurance, she told me in my face she would never use it. I offered to take her to work even if I had to wake up at 4:00am and she told me where she works is dangerous and I am to inexperienced to drive there.

During the rant, she said that if I had left it in her car insurance, she wouldn't have minded paying the 115 dollars even if I wasn't driving it. I never took that under consideration because at one point she would ask me again to take my car and if I told her no, she would bring up the argument that she's paying my car insurance now so I have to let her take my car.

Few recurring questions:

1. The BAME officer is long graduated so no need to report

2. The joke referenced was regarding the ‘doctor lawyer engineer’ expectations of our parents as I studied law

3. I am aware I am advantages due to my white privilege. It’s not something I can change I’m more wanting to know if it’s ok to claim this as my own culture as it’s the only one I really have but I understand that it’s a touchy subject 

Thank you 😊 


This happened a while ago but came up recently with the friend mentioned and I’ve always felt conflicted. 

So a bit of background my bio parents are English and Irish with a bit of Romani. I myself am very pale with freckles and bright red hair and very Celtic. Think Merida from brave but with straight hair. 

My dads wife is Nigerian. They’ve been married since I was a baby and I call her mama. As far as I’m concerned I have three parents. 

This situation concerned happened at uni. A friend is Nigerian and his family is from the same part I spent a few years living in with my mama. We were discussing a top I had in a more traditional pattern and how we had a typical Nigerian upbringing regarding career expectations etc. We had a lot in common culturally and it was nice to talk. 

It turns out another student was listening (we were in a public space) and made a formal complaint I was partaking in cultural appropriation by wearing traditional clothes and making jokes about stereotypes. 

My response when it was questioned by the uni was the jokes being made were not about stereotypes but my actual experience. The other student I was with agreed and pointed out no one minded him saying it despite him never actually having lived in Nigeria but I had. 

The complainer took it to the president and BAME officer and there was a formal disciplinary meeting regarding the appropriation and racism.

451,Not the A-hole,"I'm not really good with remembering things about people. I forget birthdays, things they like, things they don't like and plans that they make. A couple of years ago I bought a journal and started to make notes about my friends. Each friend has a couple of pages with their birthday, contacts details and notes about them. One friend is allergic to peanuts, another has asthma, another frequently has periods where they don't contact people, another hates a specific bar etc. I make notes of it all.

I've been dating my GF for about a year now and added her to my notebook. Restaurants she doesn't like, favourite gifts, games she likes, things that make her angry etc. I also did the same for my ex before here.

This journal is also used by me to note down my password, two factor authentication keys, different e-mails, recovery question and all sorts of things as I don't trust on-line methods for storing this. 

With the current situation my GF has been staying with me and she must have been snooping around the house because she found my journal, it wasn't exactly hidden as it was in my desk. She must have read through as it started a screaming match where she said I was being creepy storing this information and that she was going to tell all my friends. She refused to give me the journal back so I said ""Give it back or leave my house"", she thought I was joking and when she refused to give it back I told her to get out.

She's now left to go back to her flat and has taken the journal with her. Did I act like an asshole here? I've got a backup of my password and stuff so I haven't lost much, just the notes about her and my friends.",45,38,0.84

That's before we get onto them telling me what I can't eat because it's ""theirs"". I pay for what I eat. I can eat what I want, when I want...

455,Not the A-hole,"I (M21) was recently given a set of wireless ear buds, the type that hang over the ear. A coworker that im close with gave them to me as a gift since he didnt like/use them. These are expensive ones that he was otherwise going to sell online if i didnt want them. 


The problem is this. Upon coming home and telling my mother about it and how nice it was for him to gift them to me, she asked, which then became practically begging me to give them to her after i had initially said no. She had gone on to say that she never got to have nice headphones/listenjling apparatus and how she had gotten me nice things in the past. 


I didnt really want to give them up, but i also felt guilty about keeping something nice from her. She's someone who's worked very hard to give me a good upbringing and right now we're both working to pay for expenses between the two of us.

456,Not the A-hole,"This is a delicate issue and I’m not sure I handled it well. I (36F) am close with my neighbor “Allie” (30s F). Allie is pregnant, and I have and 18 month old. Yesterday we were chatting in my yard (six feet apart, of course) and she was telling me about some preparations she’s been making for the baby. She hadn’t wanted to reveal the name before  he was born, but she slipped up and mentioned it. It’s Oiler. 

I...don’t even have words for how bad of an idea this is. Her husband is from Canada originally, and he’s a big Oilers fan (for those that don’t know it’s a hockey team). He picked the name, and she didn’t object. The baby’s middle name will be Guy (pronounced like “Gee”), apparently it’s her FIL’s name and non negotiable. Their last name is regular Irish, so imagine something like “Oiler Guy McCrea.” Just ridiculous and goofy.

I told her how I felt, and she was really hurt. She said something about how I picked my child’s name from the top 10 list — true, but it was also a family name. I think I really ruffled her feathers and I feel bad. My daughter woke up from her nap, so I had to go inside, but I’m thinking about apologizing to Allie.

457,Not the A-hole,"I currently have two PC’s, one that is my work computer that my company provided me so I can work from home, and the other is my ‘normal’ computer that I use primarily for gaming. 

My boyfriend wants to use my gaming computer to host a Minecraft sever for him and his friend so they can play together. This wouldn’t really be a problem in and of itself, except for the fact my boyfriend games CONSTANTLY. I have no problem with video games, as I play myself from time to time but I’m talking hours and hours each day with very minimal breaks at a time. It really bothers me because it means he has very little free time to spend  with me and I feel as though he prefers games and his friends more than me. 

I have discussed this with him countless times and he says he doesn’t feel that way, he loves spending time me but he also loves video games and they are a respite for him especially during these hard times that we are all going through right now. I totally understand that, but I feel like it’s just too much. Especially since he shirks household responsibilities to game. 

I would never want him to stop playing video games because it’s a huge part of his life and a way for him to connect with his buddies. However, I do feel he plays  way too much and it’s getting in the way of our relationship. I’ve tried to offer to play games together, video or board games, go for a walk, watch a movie, etc. but he would just rather play games most of the time and I feel like I’m forcing him to spend time with me, which I don’t want to do. 

Anyway, WIBTA if I said no to him using my PC for his server? I just don’t want to support the habit any further and I feel like if I let him do it he will just spend even more time gaming. But I also don’t want to get in the way of his fun because there’s really no good reason why he can’t use my computer aside from the fact that I’m so sick of the constant gaming.",14,28,0.85
458,Asshole,"I have been very close friends with “Lucy” for over four years. Lucy is a beautiful and confident woman. We met during our first year of university and have maintained a great friendship. While I do love and respect her, our friendship has always been platonic - albeit affectionate (for e.g., hugging).

The first birthday Lucy had while we were friends I posted a tribute to her on my social media. I wrote how much I enjoyed our friendship, appreciated her company and valued her time. I meant what I said but it wasn’t something I would usually do - I did it because I knew Lucy would like it. Lucy did like it — she expressed her gratitude and said no one had done something like that before. 

Well, this set a precedent. The birthday after I posted another tribute on my social media, and last year I also uploaded a collage of our photos and memories to my stories. Each time Lucy has been extremely grateful for my posts.

Recently, I’ve been crushing on a girl: “Ellie”. Ellie and I met on Tinder; we have no mutual friends and didn’t know each other prior. We’ve been on a few dates and get along really well. Lucy has been supportive through this — she’s given me a lot of advice and guidance. Without her help, I doubt I would still be seeing Ellie. 

I haven’t told Ellie about mine and Lucy’s friendship. It’s not that I’m trying to hide it - Lucy is a big part of my life and that’s my choice - but I haven’t found the right time to “announce” that my best friend is a very attractive woman who I spend a lot of 1-on-1 time with. 

It was Lucy’s birthday last week. I decided not to post a public tribute for her - I didn’t want Ellie to see it, especially having no prior knowledge of Lucy, and assume something was going on. Instead, I messaged her privately - saying all the things I’d have posted publicly had Ellie not been in the equation. 

Lucy got upset. She asked me why I hadn’t posted it publicly. I told her it was because I didn’t want Ellie to think I was in love with her or that there was something going on between us. This made Lucy angry; she rang me and said I was putting Ellie before our friendship and it especially hurt as it was her birthday. She said that everyone who knows us is aware of our friendship dynamic and if Ellie can’t accept it then she’s not right for me. 

Lucy hung up. Every time we’ve spoken since she’s been cold and blunt towards me; yesterday she said she was hurt that I hadn’t apologised yet and called me a dick. 

I admit that I haven’t apologised to Lucy. I think she overreacted and I think her response was unjustified. Whenever I start to feel bad and think about reaching out, she messages me and aggressively accuses me of prioritising Ellie - it’s so draining that I don’t think she deserves an apology now. 

This is still ongoing. Am I the asshole in this situation? At the end of the day, Lucy still got her birthday wishes... just privately.",110,189,0.92
459,Not the A-hole,"My younger sister (10) has been having a problem with electronic addiction, i.e using her school computer for games instead of well... school, choosing to be on her phone instead of watching a movie with the family, and she's even developed a callous on her chin from resting her hand there when playing games. Because of this my mother and step-dad have decided to do an 'earning system' where if you do a certain chore you get 10-30 mins of electronics time, they can 'add up' and e.t.c

I wouldn't have had to much of a problem with this because I'm not that social-media addicted and I enjoy doing school work, so no problems right? Wrong. I'm a cosplayer and am part of a cosplay group where I have to post at certain times and have a role in voting on auditions for said group as well as over all keeping in touch with everyone, so most of my communications have been cut off due to this new rule.

I understand my parents wanting to be fair but I haven't done anything to deserve this kind of punishment. I have straight A's, my room/closet/bathroom are always clean, I cook my own food, do my laundry, and am responsible for my own school work and grades. I'm sure many people will say 'oh well you still get time on your phone, so what's the problem?'

Well, as I've said before I cosplay and instead of me enjoying what I do and being okay with the content I put out, it's become stressful, trying to find audios to use, making sure that I finish everything fast enough to get good lighting, rushing videos I do make, and having to wait over a day or two to even post, much less have the time to reply to the comments I do get.

Basically I ended up crying and freaking out on my mom because I hated the content I was putting out for my 3.3k audience that was slowly decreasing (not important but it hurts) and told her that I was being punished for nothing and that she's the one who should be on probation (she's on her phone 24/7 because she's an author so that prioritizes above everything). AITA?

Edit/Update: I've talked with my parents and I brought up what you guys said and even proposed some new ideas. I was hoping they would take it all well, and they did not my mother said that she already lets me check my phone sometimes and that I'm being 'a privileged addict' and my step-dad said it wasn't fair to only enforce rules on one child (despite me proposing new rules) and they both came to the decision to take away my phone until I earned 48 hours of time, and that I'm not allowed to even check my phone until I 'fill in the negative for being difficult and challenging the authority' (I'm writing this on my school computer through the guest login bc its blocked on my account)",47,192,0.92

The daughter who this is about, Mary, is biologically my wife’s niece and was adopted by us at 5 when my SIL and BIL (both 34) passed. I have a very close relationship with Mary and consider her my own, so much so that she is one of the only people I trust to help me out in the garage, like I used to with my dad when I was little.

Mary is a beautiful and smart girl who will be attending college in the autumn. The problem is that Mary’s birthday is also coming up around that time, so the wife and I have agreed to buy her a car and pay her insurance. Well I thought we were buying her a car, until Mary came up to me thanking me for giving her my late fathers car and then hugged, I was very confused at this point and didn’t know what to say so I just hugged her back and let her know how much I loved her and how proud of her I was. I asked her who told her, and she said mom.

I asked my wife why she thought telling Mary she can have the car was a good idea and she replied that she knew Mary liked the car and we were going to buy her a car anyway so why not just give her one of the cars no one drives. I told her that the car belonged to my dad and I don’t want to give it to away as its very close to my heart and special to me, she said it would be nice and mean a lot to Mary if she got the car as it would show her how much she means to me. I got kind of mad that she said that me giving her the car would show how much she means to me and asked her what about the last 12 years, don’t they mean anything. She said that I was taking it the wrong way and we’d continue this conversation when I calm down. I felt she wasn’t respecting my attachment to the car and so I (very immaturely) asked her who she thinks she is wanting to give my stuff away. 

We both later apologised, and we’re good again now, she maintains (and I know) giving the car away is the right thing to do. I kind of feel conflicted as I know Mary loves the car will look after and cherish it, but it has great sentimental value to me.",81,239,0.95
461,Not the A-hole,"This was a few months back, but said friend (McLovin - 27M) keeps bringing it up so I'd like everyone's opinions. 

McLovin and I were embarking on a 8 day hike/trek in South America. Because I've never really done a multi-day hike this long, I researched on what to pack/not pack etc. McLovin and I both knew there was a chance we wouldn't have access to ""clean"" water along the way, and so I heavily suggested we both buy a mini water filtration straw like system and/or water purification tablets. McLovin said no to both, because ""we can refill our bottles at the rest stops"" and that I was ""a rookie at hiking"" who was ""overreacting"". Regardless, I bought two mini water filter straws (one for backup) which cost me roughly $130 (AUD).

To also provide some background on McLovin, he's a bit of a freeloader who likes to take but not give. For example, I always drive him places (he doesn't have a car) but he never pays for petrol. Or I'll buy him small meals (<$10) but he'll never turn the favour. He's not broke, he has a full-time job and buys expensive as f\*ck clothing. 

&#x200B;

Back to the story. Lo and behold, 3 hours into Day 4 of our hike, McLovin runs out of clean water. There's a rest stop with clean water roughly 45 minutes - 1 hour away. McLovin asks if he could use one of my straws as we had just walked past a stream. I tell him no. He gets upset and asks if ""I want to see him die of dehydration"". I could tell that he wasn't (""dying""), because he had just downed a substantial amount of water. He'd also consumed a number of my gels/snacks because he didn't pack enough, and that he's ""a big boy who needs to eat"". In all honesty, if it had been any of my other friends who had asked for the straw I'd say yes, but because I had some built up resentment against this McLovin for constantly leeching off me I said no.

Anyways, he likes to tell all our friends now that he was severely dehydrated on our hike because I didn't want to share my clean water with him, and they all think I'm an asshole. AITA?",15,38,0.9

463,Not the A-hole,"I (28f) have a brother (18m). Our parents have always wanted a boy, so my brother quickly became the favourite. He was very spoilt growing up. He'd have big tantrums, but due to our large age gap I started babysitting him from young to let our parents work so they didn't see a lot of it. It was when I moved out that they started really seeing how bad his tantrums could get. 

Things like birthday presents don't really matter to me. I'd prefer a note or a meal. However, my brother loves presents so I've always bought him gifts.

His birthday passed in January and I was going through a lot of medical issues so birthday's were the last thing on my mind. I didn't even realise it was his birthday until our family WhatsApp group started blowing up with birthday wishes. I quickly call him up, apologise, tell him why I didn't send a present and wish him happy birthday. He was a bit upset but said he understood. 

He had told me he wanted a nintendo switch for his birthday. Due to my medical bills, money was tight so I stretched and got him a switch lite instead of the normal one and had it delivered to him ASAP. I couldn't afford gift wrapping or a game bundle. He wasn't so happy.

I guess he was expecting the expensive version.

Then he calls me and goes ""how would you feel if I forgot your birthday and didn't get you a present since you don't think of me?""

My birthday passed in late March and sure enough, no present. I get a happy birthday text from him but that's it. I reply with a thank you and go about my day. Later I get a call from him and he says ""sorry I didn't get you a present, I forgot."" I reply ""that's alright, I don't mind."" 

I get a call from my parents that night saying I made my brother feel insecure and overdramatic because I said I don't mind not receiving a present. 

""You know he was upset that you forgot his birthday and didn't get him a nice present, and by not giving you a present he wanted you to know how he felt. So when you didn't get upset, you made him feel as if his reaction was overdramatic.""

I laugh. ""Let me guess, he's throwing a fit since I didn't react how he wanted me to and you want me to fake being upset to make him happy because you don't know how to deal with him?""  They start denying it but I know that this is the case. Usually if he acts like this they'd just get him whatever he wanted so he'd stop. They can't do that in this case and now they're freaking out. 

I felt bad for them, because it could be quite scary seeing him that way. His tantrums as a child were annoying but harmless. His tantrums as a 6'2, 190 pound 18 year old are legitimately terrifying. 

If I had pretended to be upset, I probably would've been able to talk him down. But I still refused and instead arranged for my uncle to pick my parents up so they could stay at his place and give my brother the night to cool down. They haven't spoken to me since.",57,200,0.93
464,Not the A-hole,"People involved in this:

&#x200B;

* Me
* My friend Dominic, the guy referenced in the title
* His gf Sophie, who posts NSFW content on reddit and pornhub 
* Nick, another friend who knew about this beforehand

So, we're seniors in high school (Sophie's 18), and my friend Dominic has been dating Sophie for 5 years now, starting in 8th grade. They're kind of that stereotypical 'high school sweethearts' type you expect to get married. 

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I was talking to my friend Nick the other day, and he told me he had made the biggest discovery ever. I asked him what, and he told me that he had found Sophie on reddit and pornhub and shit. Apparently, he's into some bdsm stuff, and being bored out of his mind the other day, he was just scrolling through a subreddit when he saw a girl who looked like Sophie. To confirm, he looked at her profile and was pretty sure it was Sophie. 

&#x200B;

I wanted to confirm for myself, so I asked for the username.  Sure enough, it was definitely Sophie-- same face, same voice, etc. Her bio even confirmed she's an 18-year-old from our state, 

&#x200B;

I asked Nick if he was going to tell Dominic, in the case he didn't already know. He said no, because he didn't want to break up their relationship. I didn't see it that way. I feel like Dominic deserves to know, and if their relationship only works with Sophie hiding something, then it's not really a legit or valid relationship. 

&#x200B;

I convinced Nick of my point of view, and I told Dominic. Turns out, he didn't know, and he ended up breaking up with Sophie. Sophie got pissed at me specifically for 'breaking up her relationship' and claimed she envisioned a life married to Dominic, which now would never happen. She also claims I'm a hypocrite for 'consuming her content but looking down on her for producing it'.

&#x200B;

I have a few points here: 1) I wasn't consuming her content 2) I wasn't looking down on her, I merely thought Dominic should know 3) the logic doesn't work out here imo. Looking at naked pictures isn't the same as taking them and putting them online 4) Dominic deserves to know that his girlfriend posts NSFW content that shows her face. He may against it, and if someone found out before him, he could be seriously embarrassed. She shouldn't have kept it from him 5) I think I did Sophie a favor long-term. It's pretty clear Dominic isn't into the same stuff as she is, so long-term their sexual chemistry wouldn't work out.

469,Not the A-hole,"I probably should start by saying that I was raised in a somewhat religious environment but I'm now agnostic (leaning towards atheist). I've definitely been open with my friends about my lack of belief in any religion and most of my friends have respected that. I don't have a problem with people who follow any particular religion, I just want nothing to do with it myself.

So at the start of the year I noticed one of my friends, who was already kind of religious, was suddenly extremely religious. Like they would turn every conversation into a chance to discuss religion, they always posted on Instagram and Facebook about religion, etc. She's a really nice and sweet person so I didn't complain about it - it's good for her if religion makes her happy. But I started hanging out with her less since she became difficult to talk to and I didn't want to tell her to stop talking about something she clearly cares about so much. 

More recently I noticed she was spamming all our group chats with links to virtual church services for Easter, which I was a little bit annoyed by but I didn't really say anything because there are a few Christians/religious people in those chats who were probably interested and appreciated it.

The problem was when she messaged me directly yesterday and said she was forming a group to teach a course designed by her church (to be honest don't really know what that entails). Again, totally fine that she wants to do that - it's just that she knows I am not religious and never want to be. Our conversation went something like this:

Friend: So do you want to join?

Me: No thanks.

Friend: Can I ask why?

Me: You know I'm not interested in anything to do with religion.

Friend: It would mean a lot if you would support me, could you maybe try it once?

Me: I'm sorry but I really don't want to do it and I don't want to argue about it.

Friend: I just want to spread God's word and help people. I'm trying something new and you could just give it a chance.

Me: You could just stop forcing your religion onto people who clearly aren't interested.

She didn't reply after that, but later I started getting messages from a couple of her friends saying that I really hurt her feelings and that I should have just played along instead of being stubborn. 

Looking back I'm thinking that I probably could have been more polite and sucked it up for one session at least, to show support for a friend who probably only had good intentions. But I also think I was right to be firm and tell her to stop when she kept pushing it. So was I in the wrong here?",133,726,0.95
470,Everyone Sucks,"My sister (24F) has been vegan for years. She met her husband (25M) in 11th grade, they watched some documentaries together and BAM - they've been annoying vegans ever since. They've calmed down a lot recently, though, which is nice, but man, those high school days were rough. Anyway, the three of us all live with my parents due to financial reasons and since my parents won't let any of us pay rent we do all the cooking/cleaning.

Now, as for me, I (23F) will NEVER be vegan because my favorite food is fried chicken. Ever since I was little, I would always ask my mom to make fried chicken. I know how to butcher and fry my own chicken from scratch, and it's a weekly ritual for me. On fried chicken nights, I'll usually have my sister make the sides so she can make them vegan and still eat with us. The problem is, she always moans about how watching me butcher and fry the chicken makes her sick and she's even tried getting me to do the butchering another room while she's in the kitchen, which is never gonna happen because that's both unreasonable and unsanitary.

Well, here's where the story turns - my sister is pregnant, and now she's been craving fried chicken. She literally eats KFC behind her husband's back. She even bought a mini-fridge to put in the garage behind the spare fridge where she hides entire buckets and eats out of them throughout the course of a few days while her husband is away at work (he's a trucker).

Needless to say, I find this hilarious. I keep telling her that she just needs to tell her husband and he'll understand (I know him really well, I don't think he'd freak out if she just explained it due to cravings) but she refuses because she's the one who made him go vegan in the first place and she doesn't want to be a ""hypocrite"".

Now here's the story - last week I'm frying up my chicken, and BIL is out on the road. My sister is behind me making the usual sides, and I notice she's staring at my chicken. As everything starts getting plated, she asked if she can just have a drumstick. Um, no. The drumsticks are MINE, everyone in the family knows this. She then asks if she can have a thigh. No, those are Dad's favorite pieces. She asks for a wing, and no again, those are Mom's favorite pieces. She asks for a breast, and I say no again, because I like to save those for making wraps the next day for lunch, and she can eat her hippie crap she normally eats. She gets super pissy at me, complaining loudly the rest of the time we're cooking, all the way to when we finally sit down for dinner. She manages to bully my parents into each giving her a wing and thigh from their own plates, and they're all still calling me an asshole for it. But it's my chicken! And after how much shit she's given me for butchering my chickens, she can't just suddenly act as if she's entitled to it! AITA?

472,Not the A-hole,"I don't have a relationship with my father. I severed ties with him when I was 15 after he divorced my mom for his affair partner. I told him in clear words that if he goes ahead with his relationship, I wouldn't be sticking around. He chose to marry the other woman, and I decided to cut ties.

Fast forward 16 years later, I'm married to my college sweetheart, have a 15 month old and pregnant with my second.

I don't have contact with any of my dad's family, except for a cousin. We grew up together, and she had recently gotten married. She and her new husband hosted a family gathering, and we were invited. 

I hadn't seen my father in the last 16 years, so when I saw him at the party with his wife and 2 teens, I chose to ignore them.

I live with my husband in another country so the relatives were very excited to see me and my baby. My cousin knows that I'm very protective about my little one and that I trust her to not let strangers touch him/hold him if I'm not around.

My father tried to initiate a conversation with my husband, and out of respect for my feelings, my husband excused himself.

At one point, I left my baby in my cousin's care and told her that I was going to the washroom, telling her in no uncertain terms that strangers weren't allowed to hold my baby without me around. 

When I came out of the washroom, I saw my father holding my baby and his wife and teens pulling his cheeks. My baby was crying and my cousin wasn't around.

I saw red. My father was faking tears and smearing kisses all over my baby's forehead trying to soothe him, making my baby cry out louder. I was horrified. I quickly took my baby away from his hold and told him to stay away from my kid. I was too upset, and didn't want to ruin the evening, so we decided to leave the party. I was disappointed with my cousin, but thought that it was for the best to leave the party quietly.

Guess what I found out? My father posted about the incident on an estranged families page on Facebook, portraying him as victim whose older kids cut him out of his life and taking his grandkids away from him. He narrated the above incident, and got tons of sympathetic comments.

I am being made to look like a heartless monster who abandoned her aging father.

To make things clear, of course I was mad about him holding my child without my permission. But that's not all. He has been posting about me on Facebook with posts dating back to 2015. Posting my childhood pictures without my consent and revealing my identity by mentioning my name.

This happened a very long time ago but I've always wondered if I handled the situation correctly.

I am not close with my dad's family; mostly because my mom never liked them and guilt tripped my sister and I when we went with my Dad to visit them. My mom was being unfair, but that's not what this post is about. My dad has a younger brother who has always given off creepy vibes. I can't explain exactly, but I've never liked being around him.

When it came time to plan our wedding, I invited my dad's parents because it felt like the right thing to do. They declined, which is fine. But I had no intention of inviting creepy uncle because a) He is creepy and b) because I didn't want my mom to feel uncomfortable at her daughter's wedding. At the end of the day, I just didn't want him there. I guess I was too much of a wimp to tell my dad that I didn't want him there so every time my dad would bring it up to me, I'd make an excuse about keeping the guest list down, not enough seating, etc.

Imagine my surprise when I was walking down the aisle and there was creepy uncle sitting in a pew. I was surprised to say the least. Turns out my dad went behind my back and invited creepy uncle. I was livid and, I am not proud of this, as soon as we left the church I went up to my dad and told him since he was not contributing to my wedding an any way, he had no say so over who I invited or didn't invite.

Apparently, creepy uncle made his way over to the O Club where the reception was being held before my husband and I got there and my dad took him aside and told him he had to leave. I later found out that my dad was upset that he had to do that and that if he could do it again, he would have left with him.

AITA?

tl;dr My dad invited my creepy uncle to my wedding behind my back and was upset he had to ask him to leave the reception.",70,574,0.96

Today when my sister in law came over (she's also our neighbour) her 10 year old son also came along and instantly started tellimg me about his tik tok account which has many followers.Initially, I was happy for him but then he asked me if he could download tik tok on my phone, so that i can like his videos. I told him that he can just send me his ID and I'll like his videos later since my phone might not have enough storage rn. He just forced me to download it and even started to seize it from me..since i didn't look forward to any kind of arguements or fights i told him I'll download the lite version. He agreed but my phone didn't have enough space for that either coz online school is going on and phone storage is full of notes, pdfs and stuff like that. I told him I'll download later and he started throwing a tanrtum demanding i delete some of my stuff rn i said everything i have on my phone is needed and nothing is unnecessary so i won't delete anything. He went through my gallery and started selecting my friends' pictures to delete them.. i was furious at this point coz i don't click much photos it's just a couple or three at special times. So i grabbed my phone and went in my room. My sister in law saw this and was furious at me for ruining her son's day. I told her I'll definitely like his tik toks later and i have some  assignments on my phone and I'll install tiktok as soon as I'm done with them..she was mad at me for lying about assignments and not giving importance to her son's wishes and went home without having lunch :( Am i the asshole for this?

So, because of school being moved to online, I moved back home from college (about an hour away) for the time being. I still pay rent and utilities every month like normal even though I’m not there. I noticed from social media that my roommate was still having parties all the time- but I didn’t say anything about that since I was not there, just figured I would let it go even though it did bother me. But someone recently sent me pictures of my roommates friend basically living in my room while i’m not there. She posts snapchats in my room and acts like it is hers, even moved in some of her personal belongings. she’s made herself right at home. 

No one asked me if this was okay. 

I’m so mad right now, I want to drive back there and throw everything out of the room that’s not mine and change the locks. I have anxiety and hate confrontation, but i’ve reached my limit with her. AITA? should I just let it go?",26,38,0.84
476,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the confusing(?) title, I don’t exactly know how to word this.

I’m 21f, my dad was 46m. To make a long story short: When I was 9, my dad cheated on my mom, while she had cancer, and got married immediately after she died. Stepmom, who is 43f, and her daughter, who is 18f, were not nice people, and made growing up a living hell for me. They were constantly reminding me I didn’t have a mom, and would do things like destroy my bedroom, any school stuff I had, and throw any nice thing I had out. My dad knew about most of it and did nothing. When I turned 18, I moved out and refused to contact any of them again.

About a month ago, my dad had a heart attack in the middle of the night and died. I didn’t learn about his passing until two weeks ago, where I also learned he’d left me everything in his will. Not “everything” everything, but he left me what money he had, and several precious objects that are worth a good bit of money. Very little was left to step-mom and step-sister. 

I found out he died because they called me to start harassing me about giving them what I was getting from my dad’s will. They told me they would be struggling if they didn’t get it. I ended up telling them that I didn’t care if they were struggling, and that if they really wanted to do this, I would see them in court.

AITA for collecting what I was left from my dad’s will, leaving my step-family to struggle?

Edit:

1: step-mother was left something, yes. She was left with the house, and money from my dad and her’s joint account. I was left money from a separate account that she does not have access to. 

2: Yes, I’m looking into getting a lawyer. And a copy of the will. It seems like the will was written about a year ago.

3: Because of the current world issue, the funeral didn’t happen. Dad’s been buried, but they’re going to do a memorial service for him in June, and I’m not invited.

I tried calling the dog by the name they had given it Peanut, I tried for 3 days to get her to respond to it I couldn't get so much as an ear twitch she just wouldn't respond, so I tried calling her Honey she instantly responded if I called her Honey and asked her to sit she would do it right away if I called her from across the house calling her Honey she would come running. My friend who arranged for me to get the dog is saying that I shouldn't just change her name and that she's had that name for 3 years.

Mary has been a vegetarian since she was 12. I fully support her in this and I'm glad she's following her convictions. Even before she became vegetarian, we didn't eat a ton of meat, just because none of us really like it enough to have it at every meal. So her vegetarianism is very easy to accommodate. Most meals I make don't have meat in them, and when I do make meat, it's separate from everything else so Mary can still eat the rest. 

Now, Amy has recently gone gluten-free. She says it's for her health, but as far as I know she hasn't gotten a diagnosis of anything or been told by doctors to stop eating gluten. I think she just wants to do it for some reason. The problem is that I can't really accommodate this. Personally I dislike a lot of gluten free things and I know my husband does too. I told her that I wouldn't stop using gluten things, but that if she wanted I could buy her gluten-free stuff and she could cook it for herself. I never use any flour or anything in most dishes, so she could still eat most of what I make. The only things she couldn't eat are desserts and pasta and the like.

Now Amy is very angry at me that I will make vegetarian meals but not gluten free ones. She said that it just proved again that Mary was the favorite child (not true) and she's barely talking to me.

Well she eats more then any person I have ever known, especially considering her physical appearance, she is 5'4, petite, thin and yet she eats more than I do and I am 6'6 and a bit of a gymbro.

Yet she seems extremely selfconcious about this and as a result will act surprised when something is gone, try to blame me, states I am eating too much whenever I eat anything, essentially, she tries to deflect her eating habits and projects them on to me out of embarrassment about her eating so much I guess? The thing is, I don't care about her eating habits, she can eat whatever she wants to eat what I am done with is her constantly trying to blame me, whining about food and picking fights about it.

Me (23,m) and Misha (24,f) are friends and we live together to save money. We decided to throw a mini reunion party for our friends (after pandemic ofc) and we discussed about about everything including food. Misha is coming from a more privileged family, and she suggested that we call a chef to cook for us. I was surprised a bit, and I said it's better to cook simple stuff or order food instead of calling a chef because it might be a teeny bit awkward to invite a chef for a reunion party and it's a bit inauthentic for small events like this. She got peeved and said that its no different than ordering food or eat at a restaurant and all of the food was prepared by a chef. I argued that I'm talking from middle class ground and our apartment is not fancy enough to invite a chef but if she wants to, we can make an arrangement with the chef.

I am certainly not doing that, but she seems pretty firm on it. I feel like if you want to embarrass me like that, you can host your own reception without my family and friends there, and embarrass me all you want in front of your family and friends.

So my daughter is in a sorority, which I 100% supported. My wife and I paid for her dues and supported her when when she asked if we would be okay with it. Unfortunately, last week I found out something very upsetting. My daughter was trying to enroll for classes but had holds on her account with prevented her from doing so. 


She called the university to get everything sorted out. When I asked her what happened she told me her sorority was in hot water for underaged drinking and they all had to take an online course about alcohol and student conduct on campus. When I asked why she didn’t tell me this before she told me she was too embarrassed to. I don’t know why (call it intuition I guess) but I didn’t believe her. I decided to do some research on my own and stumbled across an article written by her schools newspaper about a halloween party thrown by her sorority and their brother frat.

Since this isn’t a debate sub, I don’t want to say exact details but I will say the theming of the party was very offensive. In the article was a screenshot of an instagram post from the party and there I saw it, a picture of my daughter in a racially insensitive costume. When I confronted her about this she immediately became frustrated and told me it’s not that big of a deal and she didn’t tell me because she knew I’d blow it out of proportion.

I decided to leave the room and go talk to my wife about the situation before I said something I’d regret and my wife and I both decided that we will no longer pay for her sorority dues. Both my wife and I support racial equality and have always taught those morals to our daughter, to see her disregard them was very upsetting and we decided that we would not support our daughter in an environment which undermined those views. When we told her this she completely blew up, saying that we promised to pay for it etc. etc. She also called us financially abusive as we both know that she would not be able to pay for the dues herself and finding a job is nearly impossible. 

She has one last payment due this semester and she doesn’t have the money to pay for it. She talked to her sisters and they told her that they would be willing to give her an extension until the fall semester, but she is unsure if she will have the money then. Our daughter is very upset with us and thinks we’re overreacting. She’s been crying for a week and I have to wonder, AITA for refusing to pay? Was our punishment too harsh?

EDIT1: Since everyone’s asking I guess I should state what the costume/theming was. The theme was “Pimps and hoes” (and those parties never go well.) And my daughter got box braids as well as an extremely deep tan, she’s extremely pale and while she does use spray tans I’ve never seen her this dark before. Think going from [this](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/05/USAT/d82fe52a-60de-4d3a-94d4-401cb7fe0c45-GTY_1090534622.JPG?crop=1734,1734,x1089,y181) to [this](https://i.insider.com/58bd727a460178471c8b4c62?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp). To me it was obviously emulating and making fun of black people which is extremely gross. I raised her better than that and I don’t know why she thought it would be okay.

EDIT2: I figured I would clear up some other misconceptions. First, my daughter didn’t have to take an alcohol class, she made that up. In reality she had to take a class pertaining to racial sensitivity/diversity and take a quiz afterwards. This course took her an hour tops. There was also a community service aspect but that was cancelled because school let out early. She was not the only student in an offensive costume, in the photo that was posted in the newspaper there were two other students in blackface as well.

488,Asshole,"This happened in early March, but the situation is still going on.

I have a 5 year old daughter, who we'll call Emma (not her real name). We live in a neighbourhood full of families with young children, so it's not unusual for kids from different families to play together with 1 or 2 parents supervising. I'm also occasionally the supervising parent, so it's not like I just expect other people to watch my kid.


Early in March, Emma was playing over at another 5 year old girl's house with the other kid's mom (let's call the mom Lina) supervising. Lina later told me that her nephew was also visiting at the time, and he ended up having an accident and Lina had to go clean him up. In the meantime while Lina wasn't supervising her, Emma had gone to Lina's art room (she is a professional artist) and played around with her art supplies. She ended up destroying a few of her paintings and brushes.


When Lina got back, she got mad at Emma and brought her back to my house. She told Emma to explain what she did, and she told me that she had played with Lina's art stuff. Lina then showed me pictures of her art room after Emma had played there, and I admit, it looked awful. I apologized profusely and told her that I'd have a talk with Emma. Lina told me that it wouldn't be enough, and that she needs me to pay for all of the damages. I told her that she shouldn't ask me to pay for all of it, if her daughter also had her part in ruining the stuff. Lina told me that her daughter knows not to ""touch her stuff"", and that Emma did it all by herself.


I took Emma inside and asked Lina how much I'd have to pay. She told me the amount, and it was almost in thousands! I'm not doing well financially and told her that I can't pay that amount. She started yelling at me about how Emma ruined her artwork and brushes and how that's a huge financial loss for her, but I just asked her that if I don't have that kind of money, how am I supposed to pay for it? At this point my boyfriend came to the door to tell her to leave, and Lina left with the other kids she had with her. 


A day or two afterwards, she came knocking on my door with two of her relatives (man and a woman) and they all just started talking loudly at me and telling me that I should pay for her art supplies. I got angry and told them that Lina should've supervised Emma if she wanted to make sure her art stuff would be untouched. They all seemed to get even angrier and then the man asked if I could pay for it partially now and the rest later. I don't have anything to take the money from, and at that point I was just so done I said ""nope"" and closed the door.

Ever since that, I've been receiving messages from Lina/her brother/her cousin/her SIL/just basically all of her relatives telling me to pay for Lina's art stuff and threatening me with court. I think they're overreacting at this point and I'm just so done with them. I don't know what to think.

489,Asshole,"My girlfriend moved into my house about a year ago and for a long time things went smoothly. But this month, when she's had to transition to working from home, it's been frustrating.

She works in robotics, and when she took her whole work setup home, she set up in the dining room.

My work from home setup is in the computer room / home library, which is off the same hallway as the dining room. Neither room has doors, so I hear everything.

And she's so noisy. She has a lot of conference calls and meetings, and they get heated. Like her and several coworkers having what sounds like a really intense argument over technical stuff.

I'll ask her what that was about, and she'll be like ""it's all good, just a meeting with Joe and Tim."" And I'll be surprised because she's always talked about Joe and Tim as good friends.

Just last Friday, I heard just her end of the conversation, but she was really tearing into someone saying that something wasn't going to work, and she wasn't about to waste her time trying to cobble something together based on a poor design. She  sounded super dismissive.

I asked later what that was about, and she said ""Just my weekly meeting with my boss, were figuring out how to implement the (thing)"" 

I said that I would never talk to a boss like that, and I was kind of worried about the state of her job if she kept on like that. 

She said that it's all good, her boss hired her because of her practical experience in a certain thing that a lot of people only know academically, and he'd rather have an honest reality check when something's not gonna work.

I kinda find that hard to wrap my head around, even if that's the case that was such a confrontational way to put it.

And day-in day-out it's like this. A couple hours of silence as she works, then an explosion of noise from a conference call. And repeat. It's honestly stressful to hear raised voices, seeming anger over technical stuff that I don't really have the context for so I just get the tone of voice, etc.

I've talked to her about this, and she said that's just how people talk when they get really passionate about something they're doing. They're not really angry, just opinionated. And she's legit on good terms with her coworkers, she just got a great raise at her last performance review, there are no problems.

I told her that still, I don't like it, I don't like living in a house with someone who has these kinds of arguments day in and day out that I have to hear. And that I regretted moving in together, I hadn't known this side of her when I moved her in.

She got really upset about that and said that it's always been there. And there's nothing bad about actually giving a damn about your work.

491,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don’t want this mess on my main.

Some background: I (32M) met my late wife when we were 17. We dated all through college and moved in together and got married after graduation. Two years later, she got pregnant and we were anxiously waiting the birth of our daughter. However, it was a rough pregnancy, and she passed away while giving birth to our daughter (7F). 

I won’t lie, it was a horrific time in my life. I was struggling with losing my first love unexpectedly and learning how to parent a newborn. I relied heavily on my family for support and after a couple of years I pulled myself up by my bootstraps for my daughter and got our lives together. 

Around this time, I met my current soon-to-be-ex-wife (30F). She was the first woman who caught my eye after so long grieving, and we fell in love. I admit I became a little too rash after seeing how good she was with my daughter, and we got married after about a year of dating.

Flash forwards to now. She’s cheating. I found out about it through one of her coworkers who thought I should know. I’m devastated. I filed for divorce but because of current world events we are still living together and forced to interact. 

Because of this, we have spent a lot of time talking about how to split things up (not always amicably). She wants 50/50 custody of my daughter. I said hell no. 

To be clear, my daughter is 100% aware that her bio mom died in childbirth, and that step-mom is not her bio mom. She calls her step-mom by her first name (that is how I introduced her). 

I do not plan to fully cut them off. My STB-ex is the only mother figure my daughter has known, and I will fully support them having contact and keeping up with their weekly Saturday movie nights. I just don’t want to split custody 50/50. My daughter is mine and she will stay with me full time.

However my STB-ex is calling me selfish and horrible and saying that my daughter is hers as well and it’s cruel to not allow for an even split. So Reddit, AITA?

These are some of the more nicer comments. I had to deal with this for three years

While I was watching my tv show my half sister came in and started bullying asking why are you asexual. I then snapped at her and told her I am asexual cause I don't want to sense any love from people like you your face MADE me asexual cause of how ugly your face was. My mom came down and scolded me and told me to apologize to my half sister for making her feel bad about her self but I refused and I told my mom no I dealt years with her shit if she can dish it out she can probably deal with it.

I then told my half sister that I will only apologize after you admit that you bullied me for years. My mom knows this but refuses to acknowledges this. My half sister refused and told me she was always right and I was always right and I did not apologize. My half sister is crying in her room right now and swearing.",138,784,0.92
493,Not the A-hole,"We had recently gotten a new roommate back in the middle of March, with the promise of him getting a job and paying rent by the end of April, and helping around the house until then. Lets call him J. While J hasn't done much in the way of chores, he has TRIED to cook for the household, me and 2 other roommates. Normally, I'm the one in charge of the kitchen and I'm very particular about the way I keep it organized, but after spending the last 7 months being the only one cooking I was thankful for some help. Except he didn't... The first thing he tried to cook, Fettuccine Alfredo, was burned so badly I had to ruin the bottom of my pot with steel wool to get it out.Then they made 5 BOXES of Hamburger Helper in the SAME pot, and burned it so badly you couldn't eat it.Then on Sunday, that was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. He cooked spoiled hamburger meat with Manwich sauce to hide the smell, and fed it to us. Surprisingly, it wasn't burned and tasted perfectly fine.Until I had to leave work early because of food poisoning.I have instructed him to stay as far away from the kitchen as possible. Since then he's started to act depressed and wants to blame it on me for being ""rude to him with no reason."" I 100% think my actions were justified but maybe I'm just an asshole and don't know it?  


EDIT: For those asking for some more information.   


* When he moved in with us he explicitly stated that he'd be willing to cook and clean, which I paraphrased to ""help out around the house""  

* I know it was spoiled because after confronting him about it, he said that it ""smelled a little funny but after I put in the sauce it was fine."" Don't cook smelly meat... That's bad...   

* Nobody has offered to help them improve in their cooking skills aside from the simple tips like ""watch the bottom"" or ""remember to keep stirring.""   

* I've been cleaning the messes afterwards simply because he won't. He sets it on the counter and doesn't touch it aside from a little water and soap in the bottom.   

* No, he currently does not pay rent, though he said he would be by the end of April, but it doesn't look like he's going to be able to get a job because of the quarantine and covid-19 situation. ",49,83,0.94
494,Asshole,"My grandma lives with my mom. It was my grandma’s 80th birthday yesterday so many of my relatives gathered at my mom’s house to celebrate the occasion. I (23M) was at my mom’s house all day to hang out with my brother (18M). My mom told me to buy pizzas for everyone for when they’ll arrive in the evening. I bought 5 large Round Table pizzas, 1 vegetarian for the 2 pescatarians in the family and 4 supremes, of which one was cheese-less for my lactose intolerant brother. 


My uncle, 2 aunts, and 4 cousins came over, of which one of them, Marika (20F), would be at odds with me later. I don’t follow her life closely. The last time I saw her was over half a year ago. She was always fairly skinny, but not deathly skinny. I’d say she was always around 5’6” 115 lbs and ate a normal amount of food, including meat. This time she looked very emaciated and looks to only weigh around 105 lbs give or take. The only meat on her bones are her fake boobs that weren’t there the last time I saw her. She doesn’t look like the fit-skinny type of girl you see at the gym. She looks like she can’t even cradle 5 boxes of pizza. 


I know better than to give unprovoked negative comments. However, while we were all in the backyard eating pizza, Marika was the only one who wasn’t eating any. When my mom asked her why not, she said that she’s not hungry. It seems like her parents aren’t concerned about her health. No one in our family besides my grandma is fat, but no one is as skinny as Marika is now either. I’m a relatively fit person at 6’1” 180 lbs. I’m slightly concerned that Marika has a possible eating disorder. 


I told her that she should have some of my brother’s pizza since it doesn’t have cheese so it has fewer calories. She said that she’s really not hungry. I asked her what she ate for lunch. She said she had guacamole on toast for brunch. I said that doesn’t sound very filling so she should have a slice of pizza. I also said that she looks to have lost a lot of weight and it concerns me. My mom and grandma said they agree and that she should eat more. Again, she said she eats a normal amount and when she’s hungry. I told her that she should at least eat a slice with everyone and that a slice is only about 300 calories and a girl her size can eat 1500 calories and not gain weight. 


She yelled at me to stop being so fucking annoying and pressuring her to eat when she just isn’t hungry. I said I’m just concerned for her. She said she’s sick of people like me who keep making a big deal out of how she eats. Her mom apologized for her and thanked me for worrying about her health, but that Marika can handle herself well. I said that’s great and that was pretty much the end of that discussion. Marika seemed kind of cranky, especially with me. She was on her phone nearly the whole time while the rest of us caught up. She’s not usually like that and wasn’t like that before her eating habits were brought up.",591,1347,0.89
495,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. Sorry for length.

I (29F) live in a 4-bedroom house with 3 roommates. My boyfriend Luigi (30M) and I live downstairs, Daisy (28F) has two small bedrooms upstairs, and Bowser Jr. (33M) lives in the master bedroom. Our avg monthly expenses are around \~$3,000 split 4 ways. We've lived together for over a year with next to no problems: sometimes someone doesn't clean up after themselves, but there's been no real animosity.

Fast forward to late last year: Bowser Jr. meets Rosalina (20sF). Rosalina is a nice girl and none of us have any issue with her personality. However, over the last few months (and increasingly as the weeks go by) Rosalina is in/at our house like she lives here and is causing friction.

Issues include:

1.) We are 4 people living in a house with a tiny driveway. Luigi and I usually park in the driveway, Daisy and Bowser Jr. park curbside in front of the house. There's one small space between our house and the neighbor's house on the street where a potential guest could park: Rosalina is parked there 6-7 days/nights a week.

2.) Bowser Jr. is shopping/cooking for 2 people. Our already small fridge is even more packed with food, dishes are piling up/dishwasher needs to be run even more frequently, and the trash/recycling piles up even more rapidly.

3.) Bowser Jr. and Rosalina smoke weed in the house. Like, every single day. The smell comes out into the hallway and into Daisy's bedroom. We don't have a problem with weed in general--if they want to smoke it, just keep it outside. Our lease has language specifying that even having drugs inside the house is grounds for termination of our lease. Obviously it's a lot easier to hide evidence of weed if it hasn't been smoked in the house.

4.) I have never seen Rosalina take the trash out, wash the dishes, empty the dishwasher, bring the recycling to the curb, or even bring the mail in.

Last night I came upstairs to grab a snack, and the trash can was so full the lid wouldn't close. All the trash on the top of the can was from Bowser Jr. and Rosalina's food. I had snack-related trash: so, I had to take the over-full trash outside in the rain to put it in our pickup bin. We have a few animals in our neighborhood, I couldn't just leave the bag on the porch or one of them would have definitely torn it open in the night.

Admittedly I was pissed off. I already find myself cleaning up dishes/emptying the dishwasher more than I like, but taking out the trash sucks: we should all split that equally. I texted our group chat saying ""we are all adults: if the lid won't close when you put trash into the trash can, take it outside. Also, Bowser Jr., if Rosalina will be here 6 days a week, I think we need to start splitting bills and rent 5 ways.""

He didn't reply. Daisy and I agree. I tried to talk to Luigi, asking him if he can see why I'm so annoyed, but I can tell he doesn't want to start conflict with Bowser Jr. who admittedly is more his friend than mine or Daisy's.

So AITA?",33,100,0.93

So hear me out
When I was the age of around 1.5 yrs my dad abandoned me and my mom. Reason is unclear to me as all the explanations I heard was from my mom's (biased) side. My mom left her job after I was born(didn't do it again ever)and we fed on my grandparents (mom's side). We lived a very poor life. That house did not belong to me, there were conflicts everyday , people were making fun of me cause my dad was missing for indefinite amount of time, I lived in fear of when I'll be kicked out. I have very poor social skills because of that atmosphere. 

One day(I was 11 )when the judgment of court came, my dad was given two options: 1> to pay a huge sum of money to my mom and divorce 
2>to take me and my mom and live together.
So my dad chose option no.2 and thus we left my grandparents house and went to a new city with my dad. We were basically traded (?) to save money. When I came here, I suddenly had so much freedom, I could write on walls, eat for 3rd time, none made fun of me, I could watch tv, I could buy things that were useless and many things which I couldn't do before. 
But my father was a new person to me. I was going through puberty and suddenly a new man with whom I never had a 15min conversation was introduced as my biological father. I was uncomfortable. There were still conflicts between him and mom. He was forcing me to socialize with his side of relatives who were 110% strangers to me.

I tried to call him dad(in our language), I tried for many days really hard , but it didn't come naturally so I couldn't. Maybe because I stilled haven't forgiven him(what happened wasn't his mistake entirely)I never had a father figure and suddenly I couldn't call him that.
I call him by something like'hey' or 'excuse me ' . Other than that he is very nice. Our relationship is nice. He takes good care of me. Provide all money for me. Although there is no emotional support but that's fine I guess. 
So yesterday (I'm 18 now) my mother started giving me shit for not calling my dad ,'dad' . She said she was ashamed of telling this to anyone, Why I haven't adjusted, it'll be a problem when I marry and stuff. So am I the asshole?",21,35,0.88
499,Asshole,"Hey there. So I have gotten mixed reviews fro friends and wanted to know AITAH.   
Backstory:  
I am a junior in high school doing the IBDP program. In the IB, you take 6 subjects and each subject is graded out of 7 with 1 being the lowest and 7 being the highest. My school admits people in grade 8 and grade 11.

So one day, me and my friend, Jack (not his real name) (he is also my best friend and I his), were hanging out in school in one of our free periods. For reference, Jack and I both joined the school in Grade 8. We were talking about the fun we used to have pre-IB when our workload wasn't so high. We were chilling outside the library when Jill (not her real name), our classmate, rudely interrupts and makes a comment about feeling bad for Jack as he had to hang out with me for the past couple of years. Well, we ignored her and carried on our conversation and she left pretty quickly. Jack told her to buzz off but it still sorta stung.

Now the story:

So this week all people in my economics batch were asked to give a presentation on a topic of their choice. Note that this was a graded assignment and our classmates were allowed to ask us questions (questions could be asked in the middle of the presentation, did not have to be saved till the end) but no questions were going to be asked by our teacher. Also, this is online on Microsoft Teams. Well, I get done with my presentation (got a 7 which is roughly an 80% plus) and was chilling at home, chatting with friends on Discord when I hear that Jill is gonna present next. She was presenting on a topic on which I had worked a lot (Want to do something in that in the future) and knew quite a bit about. Well, she started with her presentation and I sort-off hammered her with questions. They were all related to the topic and presentation. Well, she stumbled and couldn't really answer most of the questions. The teacher noted this and gave her a pretty bad grade. After class, she called me an and told me that I was an asshole for what I did. So Reddit, AITAH?

EDIT: The questions were all related to the topics she was speaking on(probability, sunk cost fallacy, etc). Nothing obscure or arcane.

Edit 2: This assignment counts for roughly 35% of our grade in case anyone is wondering.",528,2015,0.92

501,Not the A-hole,"AITA for bringing up an adult’s very recent history of bullying after he got into a disfiguring car crash?

I am a 33 year old gay male. I live in a medium-ish city with a fairly tight knit LGBTQ community. Everyone basically knows who everyone is. It’s kind of like high school all over again. And just like high school, there are cliques. Lots and lots of cliques.

One of the group of guy friends is almost a facsimile of the Plastics from the movie *Mean Girls*. They are vain, self-obsessed and all they outwardly care about is status. They openly insult other guys who don’t meet their standards, even in the most banal of situations like asking to move around them at a crowded bar. They are rude to service staff. And I have personally been targeted by their bullying behavior numerous times over simply for daring to exist in the same space as them and not being up to their physical standards. 

Recently, one of the guys (34 yo, I’ll call him C.) was in a car crash that put him in the hospital for weeks. It left him with some nasty scars on his face and noticeable mobility issues. Now, believe me when I say, this is not a case of me taking delight in his misfortune. I don’t think that way. And after the crash and during his hospital stay, word got around on Facebook and through the community. Tributes were posted. Get well cards were sent. I was asked to write well wishes in groups. I usually just ignored these.

Once C. was able to get out and go to the bars again, he still hung around the same group of guys. And being the “gay royalty” that he was, now he’s more popular than ever. All people could talk about was how brave he was. The bar I went to did a fundraiser for his medical bills. Except I started to become more vocal about my dislike. If people mentioned him, I would openly say I really can’t feel bad about a person who never giave a shit about others. It makes me so angry that people like C. get so much positive attention when I feel like they neither have earned it nor deserve it, and I don’t really feel like I need to hold that in anymore.

People have said he’s mellowed a bit. *Wow*, what a low bar that is. Some people have said I should be more open and try to give him a chance. What for? Being in a traumatic and moderately disfiguring accident doesn’t magically erase the pain you’ve caused people for years. And I really have no way of avoiding interaction with him or his group of friends and admirers because I enjoy going to the same places. I recognize that he is a human being and has suffered, but why should that make me magically modify how I feel about him, and why should I censor my feelings?

503,Not the A-hole,"

My partner (30m) and I (32f) keep having the same argument but the outcome is always the same. 

Argument: Respect my belongings. 

Outcome: He is apologetic yet there is no change. 


Problem: He uses my stuff disrespectfully. He takes without asking, breaks/dirties/eats the item, then says he’s sorry and we’re back to start with a different object. The merry-go-round can’t get any merrier. 

Examples: 
1) Once, he used and moved my toothbrush to where I couldn’t find it. He said he couldn’t find his toothbrush so he took mine, used it, and put it on the high shelf in the bathroom so I couldn’t find it or brush my teeth that day. I brush my teeth in the shower and have a little hanging spot for it. He brushes at the sink like a normal human. I told him to respect my belongings and not to move my personal items. 

2) He destroyed the charger to my Bluetooth speaker. I couldn’t find the charging cord for weeks and when I found it at his desk it was frayed. He refused to say that he took it for the weeks leading up to my finding it. 

3) The replacement charger he bought after fraying my original one has been at his desk and he’s been using it for his phone. He does not have another charger for his phone. My conclusion is that he took my charger, broke it, then bought himself a new one. 

5) The actual Bluetooth speaker he later (months later) took with him to...work? I presume..and left it in his car. After discovering it missing, it took him 3 days to bring it into the home and it was covered in sawdust and jam, or some kind of dried food substance. I asked him not to take my things. He has 2 other speakers. 

6) I bought new earbuds and the first time I went to use them they were covered in earwax. I thought it was strange that I’d received used earbuds from amazon and confronted him. He admitted to using them several times. I asked him to replace them and he did. 

7) The replacement earbuds he bought are the exact same type, and again, he uses them and I find out later when they are covered in grime. He said  that he had lost the charging case for his and used mine. 

8) He eats my leftovers. I typically order/make enough food at dinner that I can have some for lunch the next day (I pack my lunch for work). I’ll tell him I’m saving a portion for lunch the next day. I go to get my leftovers and they’re eaten.

The double standard: I’m not allowed to use his tools. Even as simple as a hammer, if it is his, I’m not allowed to use it. He doesn’t believe that I’ll treat his belongings with respect or put them back where they belong.

So here we are: I leave his belongings alone and respect that they aren’t mine. We’ve had conversations in which he has told me that it is an irrational expectation for me to think my things will be where I left them. He expects that his belongings be untouched unless he oversees me use them.

Neither of us are religious but his family sees baptism as a part of culture and family tradition, so we agreed to please them this way. After all, we currently live in France and after I finish university we will probably go to Turkey, my homeland, and I want them to have a connection with both their cultures and this is a part of it. When my oldest was born, her grandmother said that they would like her aunt to be her godmother and I didn’t give much taught to it. She also named the baby but I shrugged cause I really liked the name and it fit her perfectly. (She named her Aurore, which means dawn in french and she has red hair!)

We also named the kids with my bf (Selene and Helios, which mean sun and moon, so I think the three pair together perfectly) My bf’s mother was very frustrated and said that she would like her other twin daughters to be my twins’ godmothers, and she had already started sewing their dresses.

We are going to live in the largest room and i suggested that her 2 boys shared the first medium sized room and 2 of my girls share the other medium sized room and the other gets the small room to herself. She wants the triplets to all share the first medium sized room and her boys to each have a room to themselves.

I think this is unfair however she says that they are triplets so they need to be kept together and be there for each other so it wouldn’t be any surprise if they have to share a room together. I think thats bs and she just doesn’t want her children to share a room. The other option is that we share a medium sized room and the triplets get the largest room (so they have more space) but she doesn’t want this as she likes to do yoga on the floor which she could only do ‘properly’ in the largest room.

Then he said the last part of my course required  me to do a practical test at another swimming location the next day. I drove all the way to the new swimming pool about 30 minutes away and went into the swimming centre. I saw my swimming instructor and other swimming classmates. My swimming instructor said “sorry, I forgot that your swimming level (I am doing bronze star) doesn’t require an practical test. The practical test is only for those doing bronze medallion and above.”
So me and my family went home.
Then weeks passed and I still have not received my bronze star certificate in the mail. 

I went to the swimming pool and told a staff member I haven’t received my certificate. Then she told me to write my mobile number down so my swimming teacher can contact me. Weeks had passed and I did not get a phone call from the teacher.

I went to the swimming pool one day and happened to see my swimming teacher so I said that I still haven’t received my certificate. He said “that’s not my problem if you haven’t received your certificate”. I’m not the type to argue so I just left it there and came home and told my dad. 

My dad said to email the swimming organisation and say that I haven’t received my certificate. They replied back and basically didn’t believe me. Then i had to reply back explaining the whole story, I even included the part where my teacher said “it’s not my problem”. Then finally the swimming organisation replied back and apologised. I received my certificate about two months late. 

Then the following year I had that same swimming teacher again to teach me swimming. He basically ignored me the entire time. AITA for going to great lengths to get my certificate? I mean I did pay around $100 for the course.",18,59,0.89

512,Asshole,"I am honestly heartbroken right now.

I (24F) am a breast cancer survivor. I have had my left breast removed and there's just a scar there now. 

When I go out I wear a silicon padding on my left breast otherwise it looks very odd and makes me self conscious. 

My boyfriend (23M) and I have been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years. We had met a couple of times but we just enjoyed each other's company. He knows i am a cancer survivor but doesn't know about my breast.

I decided to move in with him about a month ago and we tried to have sex. 

I said tried because the moment he laid eyes on my breast his face went white and he refused to touch me further. He said I had cheated him and that I should have told him earlier about my breast.

I told him that I didn't think it was important since he said he loves all of me and that he thought I was beautiful. I am honestly so conflicted right now and I feel like a horrible person.

AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I don't have breast?

Edit: Had a talk with him. He says he can't be with me anymore, he didn't know I was lacking a breast because I looked fine in my pictures. Thank you for your help everyone

518,Not the A-hole,"Before I start I wanted to thank everyone for an honest answer and I am sorry for each mistake I made. English is not my first language. 

I(23f) recently had a discussion with my brother (20m) and my boyfriend (24m) about my mother. I am currently going to therapy every weekday because of my depression and possible trauma, etc. Nearly my whole school life I was extremely bullied. We talked about my mother who sometimes made everything much worse. She never really hit me, but when I was crying she put me under an ice cold shower, she always screamed at me, she ignored me for hours / days when I did something wrong and everything what made her upset was my fault. But then there were the confusing parts, where she was like an angel to me. She tried to give me everything I needed, tried to be my best friend, etc.   


Today she is only rarely acting like that. But I still feel every time she gets upset it is my fault because she will again ignore me for hours.   
In the discussion we had I said I am grateful she is trying to be nice to me and I think she is trying to show me that she loves me and that she is here if I need support, etc. But I am still angry / hurt because of the past. I have mixed feelings about my mother. I feel supported but I also feel hated, unwanted and I feel guilty when I am angry or hurt because of the past or those rare situations when she acts like this today.

Both my brother and my boyfriend told me that I am not better than her and mean because I can't forgive and because I am still holding a grudge to this day. 

My brother also told me that it was my fault my mother acted like that towards me. Because I was a bad child who always came home crying and I over strained her.

My mother doesn't know this and I don't act like I am angry or hurt. I treat her like everyone else in my family. So I always thought it's okay and I just need to learn to forgive in therapy. 

My brother went and told my mother about my feelings and now she is acting like in the past. She is ignoring me and she is crying at night. I can hear her cry and I can see she is very hurt. 

I feel like I destroyed her life. I feel guilty for her pain. The though that it everything was my fault because I over strained her and that I now did it again is haunting me since.

519,Not the A-hole,"Hello! This is my first post on reddit. 

My partner, Rose (27F) and I (25F) live together. My partner's mother, Beth also lives with us. 

We had asked for her consent before getting a dog and she was very excited as well. She told us that she would like a pure Labrador or a Poodle and she sent us the contact details of some breeders she had found online.

Rose and I told her that we would be adopting from a shelter instead of buying a dog since shelters had lots of beautiful puppers waiting to be adopted. This adoption thing was my idea and Rose also agreed. Beth didn't seem very excited with the idea.

We told her that if we found a Lab in the shelter then we'll definitely get one. Lo and behold! We found the most beautiful, the most friendly Lab mix ever. She took a liking to us so we brought her home. Her name is Cookie.

Beth looked disappointed after seeing Cookie, she didn't greet her or try to be friendly with her even though Cookie seemed to really like her.

Then the complaints started. Beth would say Cookie would disturb her in her sleep, Beth would say Cookie would pee on the couch, Beth said Cookie would rip her clothes and so on. 

We never found evidence of Cookie doing all those things. Beth would say she cleaned the couch before we got home or that she threw her clothes away. Cookie also always sleeps with us in our bed and we keep our door locked. 

Beth is also cross with me and says that I brought a ""troublesome"" dog on purpose. She says she wants me to get rid of Cookie and get a dog from one of the breeders she told us about earlier. 

I genuinely cannot understand what Beth's problem with Cookie is. Cookie is a very good dog who didn't really have a loving family before us. Beth had also agreed with the idea of getting a dog before we got Cookie. 

Rose says that Beth would take some time to get used to Cookie. Meanwhile Beth continues to be passive aggressive to me about Cookie and makes me feel bad.

AITA for getting a dog?

523,Not the A-hole,"So, I'll have to be brief here but I'll provide info in the comments if necessary. I am currently rather confused about my own feelings and I would like to have some outside perspective on whether I am TA because of what I am planning to do next.

My best friend, Kay, started dating my ex Liam behind my back. Liam and I dated for about nine months two and a half years ago and it wasn't a good relationship. He did not treat me particularly well and Kay knew about this. As my confidante and best friend, she actually knew how bad I felt in that relationship until I broke it off. I want to make it clear that today my ex is not my problem, but her actions are.

A few months ago, Kay started seeing Liam behind my back. When I realised this was happening started limiting contact with her. She noticed and started contacting a few of my friends to talk about the whole situation and - according to my friends - get validation for what her actions which apparently she even got from one of my girlfriends.  When she finally contacted me I told her that I withdrew from her as a friend because I am hurt about her actions. Now Reddit, I am fully aware that I don't own neither my ex nor will I ever tell Kay who she's got to date, it certainly isn't up to me. But I am hurt over the fact that she started dating him without ever considering how it would make me feel, throwing the last bit of loyalty and integrity towards me out of the window and that's what I told her. She apologised for not being transparent and after this she just started to pretend everything was fine between us. I kept telling her that to me it's not and that I have lost trust in her.

In my opinion she can't simply expect to date him and still maintain a friendship with me, even if that is what she so badly wants. I feel she chose him over me and I have lost my confidante over this. I don't want to stand in her way, I have always wanted nothing but happiness for her. But I definitely don't want to be a part of this. I am almost three months pregnant and I have to put my baby's and my well-being first right now and I feel like I desperately need to get away from the situation because it stresses me out so much. I think the best way to do it for me is to cut contact and cancel the friendship so I won't have to think about it ever again. I guess by doing that, I will get a lot of shit from our common social circle which stresses me out even more because of my upcoming wedding.

I don't expect her to stop dating my ex but I feel as she expects me to just pretend the whole situation didn't hurt my feelings and wants to reconcile the friendship. As I said, I am planning to cancel the friendship with her for good because I feel betrayed and all of this stresses me out to no end.

524,Not the A-hole,"I (24F) had a pretty complicated childhood. To understand where I'm coming from, I have to explain a little bit. 

My biological mother was married to a man with whom she had two children. She then had an affair and I was the result of that. Her and her husband stayed together for a few years but when I was 5 they divorced. A lot of things happened in that time, but eventually we came to live with John (the husband). My half siblings are his biological children, while I was not. He never wanted me but he wanted to make my birth mother miserable, so he took custody of me too. 

He was not a very nice man. He married multiple times and blamed me when they ended. His children, my half-siblings, were also not very nice. They were cruel (slamming a door on my hand, among other things). When I was 11 he told me I wasn't his child and he sent me away to live with my aunt and uncle (his reasoning was that I was ruining his marriage, again). My aunt and uncle are wonderful people who raised me with a lot of love and I owe them everything. I have no contact with my birth mother. 

My half siblings have tried to contact me. John has too. But I never want to talk to them. They remind me of a very bad time in my life that I don't really want to think about. I also know that if I contact them, they will tell their father, and I don't want him to know anything about my life. My only issue is that my aunt and uncle have often told me I'm wrong to not want contact with them, mentioning that I will regret it when I'm older. 

AITA for not wanting contact with them? I don't feel like I am, but maybe some of you might have some different opinions?",18,27,0.96
525,Not the A-hole,"About a month & a half ago my now husband & I got married. We had a professional photographer & a photo booth. Throughout the night family members wanted to take pictures so we weren’t able to take pictures with all of our friends. Before we knew it, it was almost the end of the night & we hadn’t taken pictures with a few friends. So we went to the photo booth & took pictures that way. 

I recently started looking at the photo booth pictures & noticed that his cousin was in all of our pictures. All of the pictures were with people she doesn’t know. I really wanted to have a picture with my husband’s former roommate & another one of our friends. I thought the picture was going to be of us four. But it wasn’t. There was another one where maid of honor & best man were taking a picture together & the cousin is also in that one.

I mentioned this to my husband & he got mad. He said that I don’t like his cousin so I’m just trying to talk shit. He said that she was trying to take pictures for the memories as she’s from a different country & wanted to have an “American experience.”

In his defense I don’t like her because she’s too much. During the reception the best man & I were talking when in comes the cousin & starts getting all handsy with him. I should also mention that best man, my husband, & cousin are all distant cousins. So needless to say we weren’t ok with her being like that with best man. The next day all four of us went to Disneyland & she was like that as well. Best man asked me to be a buffer between them as he had asked her to stop & she wasn’t. So every time I would see her getting handsy I would block it. We also found out she was going around to people asking them to get her alcohol from the bar during the reception. She’s 19, I told her she wasn’t legally able to drink way before the wedding. (She’s able to drink in her home country). One of our friends texted me & told me that she was telling people she was 21 but didn’t know how to order a drink as English isn’t her first language. And people bought it. I ended up chewing her out. That night I told my husband I didn’t want to see her anymore. My husband talked to her & she apologized for her actions. He told me to just suck it up because she would be leaving soon. So I did, for the sake of his family. 

So fast forward to a week ago & me looking through all the pictures. She’s in all of them! I can’t crop her out because she’s front and center. She honestly ruined a lot of my memories from the reception. As more time passes I keep hearing stories of shit she was doing that day & I’m fed up. I told him that I don’t want any contact with her. It’s bad enough that she invited herself to the wedding & then mentioned the wedding to family members we weren’t planning on inviting, but this last trip was the end for me. 

So, AITA for not wanting her in my life?

526,Not the A-hole,"Me (28F) and my bf (31M) have been together for about six months now. We are still very much in the ""getting to know each other phase"" of the relationship. A few weeks ago, he indicated he wanted to get me a present but wasn't sure what to get me. I ask what he had in mind and he suggests a charm for my charm bracelet. I liked and appreciated that idea. However, he wasn't sure what I would like and made a few suggestions. One especially jumped out to me as VERY not me or fitting with the theme of my bracelet, and I was honest (but kind) about it. I said something like ""I appreciate the gesture and the thought, but I'm not a fan of this particular charm because \[insert reasons\]. The others you suggested are fine, and I'll send you my wishlist as well."" I forwarded him my wish list (which contains like 15 charms to be collected for 2 different bracelets, each with their own theme going on).

He seemed on board with my reasoning, albeit a tad disappointed as the one charm I indicated I really didn't want is also the one he was most enthusiastic about. I understand why he would be disappointed but I appreciated he checked with me first. I also let him know that I really both the gesture  and the double checking before the buying.  


Forward to last weekend. He gives me the box and seems extremely happy and proud with himself. I open the box, and see the ONE CHARM for my bracelet I very clearly said I didn't like and even listed why I didn't like it.

He sees my face and asks what's wrong. (I am not good at hiding my real feelings, my face always when something is wrong). So I say ""Well, I appreciate that you want to buy me something. However, you asked me what I wanted, and it seems you willfully ignored my wishes.""  
Cue the start of an argument, in which I was basically made the villain. I was made feel that I'm ungrateful, among other things. 

He genuinely doesn't seem to understand that it's not about the fact he got me a gift. It's about the fact he *asked me what I wanted* and then ignored those wishes. Especially since I gave him nearly 20 other options that I would be happy with. 

One friend indicated that she wishes her SO did things like this. She told (politely) me to suck it up and appreciate the gift just because it's a gift and that I should get over the fact that my wishes were ignored in the process.

So in short: AITA for not pretending to appreciate a gift since I was asked about my opinion before it was bought and I was being honest from the start?

If I try to use Always or store brands... it's not good. My sisters keep taking my expensive pads. I've asked them nicely 1-3 times each to please not take my pads. They said okay, sorry and continued to take them. So today when I was at the dollar store for groceries I went ahead and picked up some of the cheapest pads. 10 for a buck. These are one of the few cheap brands I can use and they work just fine, they are just bulky so I would rather not. I went ahead and hid my pads in my room. I put the pads in a basket that said ""PADS FOR MOOCHERS"". When my middle sister saw it she got mad. She said the sign was insulting and the pads I got were ""horrific garbage"". My other sisters and mom agreed. They want me to put my pads back in the bathroom because I ""don't use them that much anyway"".

531,Not the A-hole,"I (22F) moved out a few years ago into an apartment closer to my university (it’s my last semester). However since all this craziness started and my school has switched over to remote learning I have opted to stay with my parents (52F, 49M) and my brother (19M) at their house. The reason I write is because I have a really big problem with the way my brother treats and talks to my mom.

Just some background, my brother has always been crazy shy to the point where he comes off as rude and has always been obsessed with video games. I'm talking about playing from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed even though he is enrolled in community college and has a part time job. I think it is worth mentioning that it is a job I got him because my parents begged me to find him a job. I'm good friends with the manager so thats how that happened. I know it’s a lot and doesn’t seem really related but I just want to paint a full picture. 

Since I’ve been staying at my parents house again I noticed my brother treats my mother like a maid and he’s honestly just fucking rude. Him and I have gotten into several fights since I’ve been there because he’ll ask my mom to make him food when she’s relaxing on the couch. If she protests he’ll say, “too bad get up I’m hungry”. He’ll leave his dishes at the table and refuses to pick them up because he says, “well you’re already sitting there just put it in the sink”. I’ll admit I don’t handle it the best way and I have repeatedly just cussed him out calling him a bitch, fucking lazy,  and told him that my mom isn’t his servant. 

I feel bad because the fighting has been stressing my mom out but today she told me to mind my own business which honestly really pissed me off. I ended up packing my bag and came back to my apartment. She has been calling me and telling me to go back and to just ignore it because he’s her son and she’ll deal with it her way but I honestly just can’t. My dad agrees with me and will defend my mom when this happens but really doesn't seem to around for these fights for whatever reason.

The son spends most of his time at his girlfriend’s house and is rarely here, so the daughter has been staying in his room.

My gf and I have opposite work schedules. She works 3pm-11pm and I work 4am-12pm. The daughter is currently not working, and whenever I’m up and around the house, it never seems like she’s ever busy. She’s always just on her laptop or phone. I’ve noticed that she usually cooks for her mom when she gets home from work because there are always pans on the drying rack and leftovers in the fridge when I get up in the morning.

My reasoning is that I live here too and I even pay one third of the rent to help her mom out even though there are four people living here. I work 40 hours a week and she just stays home all day. It couldn’t hurt her to throw something together or throw something in the oven, so I have something to eat when I get home and aren’t forced to just snack on their leftovers or just eat canned soup everyday for Christ’s sake.

She seemed surprised at first when I asked her and gave my reasons, then got moody about it. She kept giving excuses like she only cooks for her mom because she eats around the same time she gets home. I told her the easy solution to that would be to also eat around the time I get home. People eat more than one meal a day. When I was living at my sister’s (30F) house before moving here, she would work 40 hours a week AND cook for us, so I told her since she isn’t even making money and contributing to the household, the least she could do is cook as part of her chores.

A little more about the chore, I do my fair share. We had sat down when she moved back in and divided chores up in between the four of us, so it would be even. Since she willingly offered to take on most of the kitchen for her chores, I had figured that it would include cooking. Just to add, whenever her brother comes by the house, she always offers to cook with him, but she’s never shown the same courtesy to me. I’m the only one in the apartment that’s being excluded from this.

It makes me not even feel welcomed here even though even though it would be such a simple task for her. AITA for asking my gf’s daughter to help contribute more in the house?",207,218,0.8

539,Asshole,"I own a small gig-based business. Most our employees are part time.

I was approved for the PPP loan, and have to use a large portion for payroll. Well, our gigs are for larger events, which aren’t happening right now so they can’t work.

I thought, what if... I went ahead and paid them their average monthly wage for the next 2 months, so they’re not going without, then when work picks back up, setup a 10 month repayment plan to deduct from their paychecks until the advance is paid back.

The loan paperwork didn’t say anything about this scenario being off-limits. What would your response be if your boss said, “you’re still getting paid, but it’s an interest free loan that’ll be paid back over 10 months.”?

Edit: Yikes. Glad I posted here first. I’ll give them the money and will not have the money “paid back” in any way shape or form. There is no work to be done so it’ll just be “here ya go” money.

540,Not the A-hole,"My family lives in an apartment building. Everyone works from home at the moment so I have a lot of time to cook which is one of my passions. Our neighbours both work in a hospital, she's a doctor and he's a nurse. So I asked them if they would like some food and they said yes. So the last few weeks I always froze heaps of food and gave it to them so that every day they could just quickly heat something up. They seemed to appreciate it.

Skip to last Wednesday. It was my daughter's 16th birthday and I wanted to make her favourite cake. At 1pm I started mixing all ingredients together. Only 5 minutes later I hear someone ringing our doorbell. I was our neighbour and she seemed quite upset. She said they only just got home and wanted some rest. I apologised and explained it was my daughter's birthday. She said it's selfish of me and that right now there are other things that are more important and her sleep is one of those things. 
I felt really bad and later brought them 2 slices of the cake as an apology.

But later when I talked to my husband about it he said that yes some things are different now but that doesn't mean that our daughter's birthday is not important too. I thought about it and agreed. I haven't brought them any more food since. 

I do feel guilty for this and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.

541,Asshole,"About a year ago, my younger son (14M) came out as gay.

My wife and I have no problem whatsoever with this and neither does my older son (16M). My brother on the other hand was not happy at this news. Me, him and my sister grew up in a relatively conservative community and he still reflects that. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, he is homophobic. He doesn't like the thought of same sex relationships one single bit. I never tried to confront him about this, even though I disagree with him on it, until I found out about my son. However, it's clear I am not going to change his mind about it.

While I'm sad that he thinks like that, he is family and I want to keep in contact with him. My son however said a few months ago that he wants me to cut him off and said that he basically feels that by keeping in contact with my brother I am not valuing him as a person. I understand why he doesn't want anything to do with my brother, and have allowed him to stop coming with us when we visit and stay in his room or go out the house while my brother visits us. But I don't want to tear the family apart over this and lose my relationship with my brother, and also my niece and nephew. My son got extremely upset when I told him this and accused me of not caring about him and said that I will never understand what it's like to face homophobia.

I genuinely feel sorry for him, since he first came out he has faced a few incidents of homophobia with some of the other boys he goes to school with so the issue is very personal to him, but at the same time my brother is still my brother and I don't want to lose him because of this.",1047,2329,0.92

543,Not the A-hole,"Today was Easter and despite not being able to leave the house, my twin sister and I decided to dress up nice just to feel normal on a holiday. We did our makeup and put on some bunny ears for the occasion. Our mom had already started cooking Easter dinner (which she does almost every year) and saw my sister and I dressed up, so she decided to dress up nicely as well. My dad saw this and copied her. All the while, my 37 year old sister who lives with us never left her room. We could all hear her arguing on the phone loudly with her boyfriend for several hours. 

My sister and I got comfortable on the couch to play our Switches and my dad decided to take some photos of us. Keep in mind, while I was dressed up I was also wrapped up in a blanket and holding a game in my hand. 

My mom came downstairs dressed nicely and my dad said “Can you sit down for a second so I can take a picture?” At that point I sat up straight, removed the blanket, etc. Then my mom got out of the picture and took one of me, my twin, and my dad. Then my twin said “Okay, now how do we get all four of us together?” 

I set up the timer on my phone camera and started propping up the phone against a piece of furniture. That’s when my older sister came downstairs, wearing sweats and the same shirt she’s had on for at least 3 days.

Older Sister: So you guys are taking a picture and no one could tell me?

My mom: We didn’t know you were awake, go put something on and get in! 

Older Sister: You want me to get in NOW? You’re taking a FAMILY PHOTO without the whole family. Do you not see how that makes me feel?

Me: It wasn’t a big deal, we were just taking photos and everyone kept getting in.

Older Sister: Don’t tell me what’s not a big deal! What’s a big deal to me might not be a big deal to you!

I told her not to scream at me and she continued screaming at all of us. It became a pretty big argument and at some point I just gave up and got back on my game. This isn’t the first time she’a gotten upset like this over something that wasn’t a big deal at all.

So, am I the asshole for not inviting her to the photo? I’m genuinely wondering. To me, it wasn’t a big family thing we arranged, it just happened. Let me know if I’m totally wrong here.",27,63,0.93
544,Not the A-hole,"Me (F) and my husband (M) are planning on getting married this August (fingers crossed we dont have to reschedule) and even with the circumstances are still planning it. Recently, I picked my bridal party, and so I face-timed my maid of honour (who will be my cousin) and my bridesmaids (2 close friends). I was originally hoping to include 2 of my other very close friends in the bridal party, but have since decided to exclude them. 

The reason for this is they hate each other. They have never really been friends, and since weve been in high school (10 years ago!) they have not gotten along. They constantly talk bad about each other and can barely even be in the same room without getting in a screaming match. 

Of course, I still want them to be at my wedding, as they are 2 of my closest friends. However, I decided not to include them in the bridal party because it calls for working so closely together and constantly being with each other. We have to go gown shopping, bridesmaid dress shopping, have my bachelorette party, actually be in the same room for hours on the day of my wedding, etc. 

When I told them my reasoning they were understandably upset and they told me they would be able to keep it together. I want to trust them, but they have promised be before to keep it together (on birthdays) and have never been able to, I even have to have individual birthday lunches and dinners with them now instead of a party. I really think theyll fight at my wedding and although its selfish i just feel its better if they arent in the party altogether rather than just picking one. They have even now said they dont want to come to the wedding. 

Some friends agree with my decision, however a couple of my others dont, and one of my friends in the bridal party and my mom have told me I am being dramatic. I really dont want to hurt their feelings but I will also be super embarrassed and upset if they fight all the time we do wedding activities.

545,Everyone Sucks,"The past few days, my step dad (54) has taken up the shared living room TV with nothing but rated R action movies. Four days. This afternoon we decided to go on Netflix and find a movie as a family. I was playing Animal Crossing and finishing up the Bunny Day quest while Netflix was being flipped through. My mom paused on an action movie and I spoke up, saying after watching so many action movies I would rather watch something else. 

My step dad didn't like that. He said if I wanted to watch a movie I needed to ""participate"" and put my game down. I'm 19, and he has a thing with talking to me like I'm 10. I said I would put my game away once we chose a movie and he said that no, I wouldn't, I would keep playing. I reminded him that a week ago when we watched Dark Pheonix and Black Panther, I was actively watching the movie since it was one I enjoyed. He didn't take this and kept repeating ""If you want to watch a movie, watch the movie."" To which I'd reply ""We aren't watching a movie yet, once we do I'll put the game away."" and ""I didn't say anything with you watching all those movies for 4 days, this is the first time I've added input and you're freaking out."" (He started with a raised voice and just kept raising it). I tried to ask why he was getting so mad about such a mundane topic, and eventually brought up after enough remarks form him that I didn't appreciate him talking down on me. He said I ""always brought it up"" and needed to respect and listen to him since he is the grown up. He then did the blow of he pays for the cable.

See, my parents don't own the house. My maternal grandparents do. It's under their name and my parents (my mom) pays them rent monthly. In response to him saying he paid the cable I responded that my grandparents owned the whole house, and he fully exploded at me. This led to him storming off very angrily.  

It's been a few hours, I've calmed down so now I ask fresh and unbiased ears. Did I fuck up? Was he actually right for getting onto me with the game and was I really in the wrong for bringing up who owns the whole house?

547,Everyone Sucks,"This happened awhile ago but my GF is still giving me the silent treatment.

My GF and I have been together for 3 and a half years. My GF is turned 23 a few months ago. Before her birthday celebration I planned to get a her a really nice set of earrings. I had saved up my hard earned money to buy these for her. My GF is a big jewellery lover and I do not think these she had these sort of earrings (important for later). I bought them and put a lovely card with them.

I had a party for my GF at my home, inviting most of her family and friends. Her childhood best friend (I will call her sally) came early to help me set it up. I told Sally what I bought my GF and she said that I picked a really good gift. Everyone except GF showed up because she was running late from a 3 and a half hour shift. We surprised her when she came through the door and immediately started presents. She opened all most of them without thanking any of the people who bought them for her. She got to my present and I made it clear it was mine. She opened it and she did not react. She said:

""I have these kind of earrings already. You should know this.""

People were shocked. Her mother told her to be grateful. Sally then interjected and told my GF that the earrings were lovely and she should read the card that went along with it. She did not bother opening the card and went on to the next gift. Out of pure shock and anger I took the earrings off the table and gave it to Sally. I said to my GF ""If you don't like them so much I will just give it to someone who is grateful.""

The party inadvertently came to an end when my GF stormed off to her room. Nobody really said anything to me but quickly left. Her best friend and Gf's mother stay to try and console her. Apparently what I did was despicable, said by my GF. She said that she was having a bit of a bad day. She also said that if I was so willing to give away those earrings I would be more prone to cheating if our relationship went rocky. That is absolutely not how I saw things. I saw it as her being an ungrateful spoiled brat. I lashed out like that because I spent a lot of money on the earrings. Sally returned the earrings to me but I told her she can keep it.

AITA? (will provide clarification in the comments)

EDIT 1:

Sent her a text telling her we are done. Because she is giving me the silent treatment I will take that as her ghosting me. I do not want anything to do with her anymore because she wants to treat me like that. I also sent a photo of that birthday card ripped up and told her I should have never given her a present. I do not need anyone tell me I am TA for doing this text.

EDIT 2: 

My Ex GF FINALLY texted me back. She has said that she is sorry for the way she acted our relationship. She says she wants a second chance with me because ""I am the love of her life"". Excuse me but if you really loved me you would not have ghosted me during this time with everything going on. I understand cooling off from her birthday celebration but not asking if I am okay during this time and being isolated at my apartment? Give me a break! Seriously! It hurts to have to throw away this 3 and a half year relationship but I cannot be with someone who ghosts someone when their livelihood could be endanger.

I asked if if she was alright during this time and if she needed any help with supplies. She left me on read and did not ask if I was okay! I realised that she only texted me back because I have decided to cut off the attention and my pathetic attempts at trying to get her back over text. She realised that I have mentally checked out of the relationship and she HATEs that she does not have the power anymore. I ended up answering one of her phone calls and she tells crying that she ""is sorry and that we should try again"". I tell her that ""you should have thought about that for trying to string me along. Don't pity yourself sweetheart because you brought it upon yourself. You are a spoiled brat who I made the mistake of thinking I could love you. Once I end this phonecall I will not be feeding you attention. I will also be finding a younger, hotter, thinner woman who will appreciate my gifts. It's a shame Sally is a lesbian.""",230,790,0.84

550,Not the A-hole,"I (20f, college sophomore) had 300 dollars in my savings account that I put there after I got paid for my work study job. Last week I went on my account and it’s gone. I went to my dad about it and he said he moved it somewhere else to save. I very politely said that since it’s my money from my work I would appreciate him putting it back and not touching it in the future. Fast forward to tonight, it’s still not back so I go to him again and he starts going on about how he can show me where he put it, that he won’t be moving it back to my account, and that I have no right to be upset. I said, okay, you have until tomorrow or I’m making my own back account for my work checks. (He has access to my current one bc it’s also where my college tuition, which he pays for, is paid from). He told me I was being a brat, that I am not to go off making my own account, and that I should appreciate him saving my money for me since I’m a bad spender. I tried to go to my mom about it and she said the same thing. 

I admit I sometimes overspend, but I’m still upset over this because I feel like since I’m an adult, they need to let me learn how to save my money now and if I end up blowing it, I blow it and that’s on me. If I don’t learn that the hard way without mommy and daddy helping me now, when am I supposed to? But all that said, AITA?

EDIT: mentioned this in a reply and was told I should add this to the original post.

552,No A-holes here,"Obligatory LTL/FTP. Throwaway because my roommate knows my main.

I (19F)began my freshman year this past August and because of everything happening we've been sent home for the semester, but I would still like to know if I was TA. My one roommate was a random pairing and got along swimmingly until it came to our sleep cycles.

She liked to get up 7am every day (about 2 hours before I did generally) to study before her classes start for the day in the dorm. Sometimes it did wake me up but it was never an issue I thought was worth voicing, I just accepted the fact that this is how it was living in close quarters. However, I tended to study pretty late, most nights until about 12. Since she was in bed by 10pm, I would generally leave and go to the library.

I disliked going to and coming from the library late at night because there wasn't much security. In September, one day I decided to study in my dorm at night and used a desk light. It was the type where you could control the brightness and aim the light, so I kept it at the dimmest setting (it was still hard to see my notes) and aimed the opposite direction of her bed. She said that it was difficult for her to sleep with my light on, so I offered to order her a sleep mask. She said it was a great idea. It was a really cute silk one and she seemed to like it, but that night she said it just ""wasn't working"" and didn't elaborate. I turned off the light and went to bed. From then on I stopped studying in my dorm after 10 for the rest of the semester and basically left when she went to bed.

I hit a breaking point when one time in January I was working on my laptop the night before an exam. She woke up (sans mask) and told me the screen was too bright. Here's where I may have been TA: I told her this exam was really important and so is the rest of my schoolwork and I cannot keep leaving to study. She was definitely upset and just kind of huffed and went to sleep. I stayed on my laptop and did not leave the dorm for the last two months to study for anything. She would occasionally wake up and ask ""how much longer do you think you'll be up?"" and it never escalated past that, but I still feel bad about her losing sleep. So AITA?

553,No A-holes here,"This happened a while back, but got brought up again, and got mixed reactions again. So y'all decide. 

My friends John (28) and Sarah (25) are by far the two dirtiest people I've ever met in my life. Sarah is a dear friend, and a joyful person, who brightens every room she enters. I absolutely adore her. Her husband is okay. Before this incident, we were okay friends. He would always make comments about the difference in our financial situation, and joke about me slumming it with the poor folk. Anyway, thier home is disgusting. Ever seen an episode of OCD Cleaners? Like that. I'm not exaggerating. When they moved out the apartment had to be stripped down to the studs, because of the mold, mice, cat piss and bugs. 

Anyway, they asked me to come over to wait for the cable guy while they were at work. I knew what I was was getting into, but severely underestimated my ability to withstand being around that much nasty for an extended period of time. Before I knew it, I was cleaning. Cable guy comes and goes and I'm still cleaning. By the time they got home, I had filled eight 12g trashbags. Basically thier kitchen and livingroom were as clean as I could get it in about 4 hours. I could leave knowing they had a clean place to eat, and watch TV. Honestly, at first I did it because I was uncomfortable, and just wanted a clean place to sit, but I also figure since Sarah constantly complained about living in filth, that I would just continue until they got home, since I needed to return the key anyway, and I care about my friend.

Now Sarah was in tears when she walked in. Good tears. She was incredibly happy and thanked me profusely. Her husband on the other hand was pissed. John took it to mean I pitied them and thought I was doing it to show off. I said it was because I was bored, and Sarah knows how I am about needing to stay busy. Figured I do it to fill time. 

Sarah knew my answer was bullshit. She knew why I started cleaning. She knows me, and she even said (away from John), that she figured the place would be cleaner when I left than when I arrived. But she also knows if it was purely for my own comfort, I would have just left or sat in the car to wait rather than clean anything.

John is still bitter about it, and whenever I invite them over or stop by he brings it up. ""Oh here comes the girl who's afraid of a little dirt."" Then the whole thing gets brought up and whoever's around voice thier thoughts. Tends to be guys agreeing with John, and women agreeing with Sarah and me.

So am I the asshole for cleaning without asking?  Side note: my husband thinks I'm a little bit TA, because he thinks it was condescending.

*edit* To be clear I did not throw out anything that was recyclable, reusable, salvageable, unidentifiable, or could possibly hold value. I really did fill up 8 bags with moldy food, wrappers, cat hair, kitty litter, paper towels, ect. I did not throw out anything that could be considered a belonging, not even a broken flip-flop, because maybe they could repair it, or use it in an art project, or maybe that broken flip-flop was from thier first trip to the beach together.",41,33,0.87
554,Not the A-hole,"I (21f) currently have to share a bathroom with my two siblings (25m) and (23m). I used to live alone with my parents and had the bathroom to myself, completely spotless and sanitized, but due to current circumstances my brothers are back. 

 One brother (23m) does a pretty good job of picking up after himself, but my other brother (25m) leaves his laundry on the floor. He never picks up his laundry at all, even if there is a hamper in the bathroom, he’ll just drop it and leave it on the floor. My brother (23m) and I do our own laundry, so he put the bathroom hamper in his room, and I have my own hamper in my room. 

Last week I did a deep cleaning of the bathroom and did all of the laundry that was in the bathroom (which was just towels and a whole huge heap of my brother’s clothes). I asked him not to leave his laundry in the bathroom and he said ok. 

A day goes by and a pair of pants, underwear, and a shirt appear on the floor. I ask him to clean it up, he says ok. Another day, another pair of pants. Funny, I think to myself. It seems as though the clothes are spontaneously generating inside the bathroom. I ask him to take care of his laundry, he says ok. 

A week goes by, the floor is covered in clothes. I ask my mom to ask him to clean up after himself, he rolls his eyes and calls me a narc.

We have been living together for the past 5 months in his apartment. We split rent and utilities/food shopping 60/40 based on our income. He earns a little more than me as I've just finished my degree. 

We have been lucky enough to be able to continue working throughout this crisis, as we both have jobs which mean we can work from home. 

My boyfriend recently won £1,000 (around $1246)on a scratch off lottery ticket. We had a quick discussion regarding the winnings and decided together (he actually suggested it first) that we would put it in a savings account to start a savings fund to buy a house together.

I was very happy with this as his apartment isn't the biggest and we have been discussing possibly starting a family in the near future. 

Life continued as normal for a few weeks until I get a text message from my boyfriend telling me to 'come outside'. I leave the apartment and my boyfriend is sat in a beautiful, top of the range Lamborghini. Obviously my first question was 'where did you get this'. He explained that he has a friend who knows a guy who rents his car out for 24 hours at a time for £1,500! He put some of his own money towards his lottery winnings and picked this car up for the day.

Obviously I was livid and refused to have any part of it. My boyfriend was obviously happy as larry swanning around in this car all day driving past friends houses and letting them drive it.

This was last week and things are still very tense, he says he should be able to spend his own winnings on whatever he wants but I think he should have kept to his original promise and put the money away for something productive and beneficial to our future.

557,No A-holes here,"I (27M) proposed to my fiancé (28F) 6 months ago. It was atop of a mountain in a picturesque scene and was totally unsuspected. I used my great grandmother’s platinum 1923 engagement ring with a 0.5 carat diamond and six ornamental 0.1 carat diamonds. It’s been in my family for 97 years and I was in possession of it for 1.5 years before proposing. 

Today, out of the blue (not really, several of our friends have gotten engaged in the past few months with larger diamonds and more modern designs), she said she wants to modify the ring by taking some of the diamonds and making a new engagement ring that “more suits her style.” 

This was met with resistance and shock because in my opinion, the ring is beautiful and unique, but also because it is historically significant. AITA for thinking it’s wrong for her to change the ring?

P.s. she mentioned that her friends were consulted about what kind of ring they want before being proposed to. This was her justification for changing it.

Edited for clarification:

1. We’ve dated for about 5 years before the proposal. We've talked about getting married etc., just never about ring style, which is my fault I guess.

2. Within the days/weeks after the proposal, I offered to get a bigger rock or different style, etc. She declined.

3. We got it fitted to her finger about a month after the proposal.

So in the past couple of years, my older brother has become very religious. For example, something he said was ""I am not sure if homosexuality is the path to heaven."" That type of religious. I think it came from the school he went to which was a small private christian college. I'm not going to name it but its a very strict school that does not allow drinking or sex. 

The other day we were talking and I have no problem hearing other people opinions (as long as they don't push it) but some of the things he said irritated me. He said he is christ follower, whereas most people are christ fans (including my mother who he said only likes the idea of jesus). At some point I brought up that Jesus forgives you for your sins and my brother was like ""but he does not forget."" So does jesus hold your sins against you? I'm just getting really annoyed with my brother and I really try to be a tolerant atheist but it is hard. On Easter my brother sent me a text with the photo ""he has risen,"" knowing I don't believe. So, in response I said thanks and sent him this picture. Now I know I probably am the asshole and I feel bad now but damn I just miss my old brother. I hate the person he has become. He's so judgmental, even though he says he's not. He constantly judges our parents who are alcoholics (which is bad but they are still our parents) and told me they will probably be dead in a few years (he works with people who abuse substances and said most of them who had alcoholic parents died around our parents current age). That really freaked me out and I just feel like I don't know him anymore. I probably am but AITA?",24,47,0.88
560,Not the A-hole,"Please excuse me for my English.



I am 13 year Male and I moved from my home country of south Korea to Canada when I was 11. It is almost 2 years since I have moved. My English isnt the best but it is getting very better. My name is Jaehyeong it is a very hard name for native English people to pronouns because of that they almost always get it wrong and I correct them. Normally when I correct them I just repeat my name instead of saying that not my name. I feel this is easier since it maybe would make people mad. I let a select people call me jae but I just find it disrespecting to call someone you arent close to a shorten name.  we had a different teacher on the online classes and when he called my name it was so miss pronouns I didnt hear it correctly one of my friends had to say something to me to tell me that this man called my name. So I said here and the teacher said I am going to call you jae form now on. I said can you please learn. My name instead and he didnt say anything. When he then called on me again he mis pronouns it again so I didnt know he called on me. It is still hard for me to keep track of everything in calls. So once i answered the question he said he is going to call me jae because he cant pronouns my name and I cant understand his miss pronunciation. I agreed. After the class I got my grade and it said I got 10 points taken off of professional because of my ask for him to say my full name and then not answering to it. Am I the asshole",69,115,0.89
561,Not the A-hole,"Am I the asshole for ignoring my hungry friend?

Well here goes. I stay on a college campus, living in one of the dorms. I have a friend who lives at a dorm on the other side of campus. Everyone left including all my roommates and his roommates, and our only other friends live in my dorm and are female, so he asked to move into my dorm and sleep on the couch and I said okay.

So me and the girls usually go to the grocery store to get food because the cafeteria is on the other side of campus(where he lives) and it’s easier to stay in our dorm and cook. He usually makes the long trip back to the cafeteria and back. I told him to come with us at least once and get some groceries so he’s not always so reliant on the cafeteria but he keeps saying he’s too lazy. 

Also for some added context I am currently on a bulk. I aim to eat at least 3400 calories a day but ever since the beginning of the month started I’ve had to reduce it to at least 3000. It’s hard to fit in all 3000 calories now that I don’t have any takeout options(since all campus dining and restaurant options have been closed apart from the cafeteria) so I’m very particular with how much food I eat, trying not to waste anything while also eating 3000 calories a day.

So yesterday, it began raining pretty bad around midday. My friend woke up at 2 and the caf was closed by then, to be reopened at 5. But 5 rolled around and it was still raining pretty badly. I told him before the rain got bad to go back to his dorm and chill there so he could easily go to the caf if the rain got bad but he didn’t listen. Anyways 5 rolls around and it’s not pouring. I ask a friend for an umbrella to give him but he tells me he can’t go with an umbrella in this kind of rain. It’s not that bad but to be honest it was more than just a drizzle. I say okay.

Then I proceed to make my own lunch. It’s about 700 calories of rice with a 200 calorie chicken thigh. I aim to eat 1000 3 times a day so that was a bit short. While I think about offering him food but then I get mad because I feel he kind of expects me to offer him food because he hasn’t eaten all day. He keeps asking me what I’m making and giving me hints that he’s hungry, but I ignore them. I don’t have a lot of money myself and I had to plan extra carefully to make sure I can still meet my calorie goal a day without going bankrupt, so I feel he did this to himself and I shouldn’t bother.

This morning he’s been acting extra angry and making me feel like an asshole. AITA?

EDIT: Also to add, the only reason I feel bad isn’t because I didn’t feed him, it’s because I ate so much while he was going hungry. Do I have the right to ignore these feelings and feel justified?",20,53,0.91
562,Not the A-hole,"I'm a student. My parents make enough money that when I went through student finance to get my maintenance loan I was told I could only get the minimum (just over 3k a year) because finance is calculated from what your parents earn and there's an assumption that your parents will help you out.

I'm on a high intensity course and I wasn't sure how I'd be able to balance studying and schooling, so when I found out I was going to get minimum I told my parents I wanted to either take the coming year to save up, and then go to my first choice university a year later than planned, or go to my second choice now because I wouldn't be able to afford to live in the city my first choice is in. My parents then said that they would pay my rent if I went to my first choice on schedule. They set me up in a studio flat, so all I had to do was get a part time job to cover the cost of food and bills.

On 18th February - my 20th birthday - they called me and said that I was relying on them too much and needed to find out what the real world was like by earning my own money, so they would cover my rent and phone for that month (so until end of February) and after that I was on my own, then said that they were still my parents and they loved me, and wanted me to stay in touch, just learn some independence while doing this. I begged them to reconsider but they ended the call, so I had 11 days notice that I would have no flat or phone. I begged my uni for emergency housing but they said that I had no proof I'd been cut off so they couldn't do anything. I emailed my parents asking them to write a letter stating they'd cut me off so I could sort my student finance and emergency housing, they said no.

I asked work if I could take on more hours and was told that due to my contract I can't do any more than I'm already doing, so I'm now looking for a second job. I'm sleeping on a friend's sofa until a place I can afford opens up, and as I still don't have proof I've been cut off for student finance I will probably have to drop out this summer.

I got a facebook message from them today telling me they were disappointed I didn't call on mum's birthday a couple days ago, and that I've not given them my new phone number yet. I responded telling them the position I'm currently in and that I no longer want a relationship with them. I've gotten a bunch of messages from them and my brothers asking me to reconsider.

My friend says I shouldn't feel bad but I feel incredibly guilty, and like a spoiled brat, because I don't love my family for their money, I love them because they're my family, but at the same time they've really screwed me over here.

AITA for not wanting a relationship with them?

&#x200B;

Update: I messaged them asking why they cut me off, saying the least they could do was explain why they're fine leaving me homeless. They responded. My friend (the one I'm staying with) is an out and proud lesbian. There are maybe 2 posts about me on her social media, one being a group shot of us and some people we were studying with in the library with me and her sat together, and another from a couple days before my birthday where she posted a photo of me when we went to lunch because we weren't planning on seeing each other on my actual birthday, and in the caption she refers to me as ""princess"" in a clearly joking way. My brothers then showed our parents and told them I was a lesbian and she was my girlfriend. So now I have proof that they cut me off, proof they're homophobic and confirmation that they can and will switch on me at the drop of a hat, as well as proof of my brothers (who are older than me and living with our parents) being jealous shit heads. They didn't just tell me this on the phone because they hoped I'd figure it out, which is tricky ~~given that it's not fucking true~~ \*. Apparently there's enough affection still there for them to expect a call on mum's birthday, but not enough to not totally fuck me over. So yeah, never talking to them again. Any of them.

I've sent the screenshots to the person I spoke to in emergency housing, though I've been warned that for something called ""emergency"" housing it's not very fast. My friend has said I can stay with her as long as I need. The reply my parents sent hasn't explicitly said the phrase ""we cut you off because"" but given the context of them replying to my message asking why it should be enough. Thanks everyone, I felt really shitty cutting them off over finances, but now I know they're pure fucking evil I don't feel so bad.

I've also sent my parents the screenshots of my brother confirming that he and my brother lied about me, and they've very apologetic, but that doesn't change anything. As my brothers live with my parents, I hope they're all very happy together right now.

New plan: changing the focus of my studies going into third year to focus on the subjects I want to do, not the ones my parents wanted me to do. If I do this, I have a far better shot at getting a work placement (it's far less popular than my current field of study) and if I get a work placement I can spend my third year working full time, earning a bit of cash, and then resume my studies the following year. Failing this, and if I can't get any help from the university or student finance, then I will defer my third year and work full time for a year. My friend says I can stay with her as long as I need and has said if I can't get emergency housing but can sort out my placement or another job then we could get a place together next year so I have a confirmed roommate.

I no longer think I'm TA so I'll probably be taking this down.

\*so here's the thing. I might not be straight. I'm figuring it out and I don't really have the capacity to go through it right now, but I've never said anything to anyone, at all, ever, because I knew my parents were homophobic, so my brothers may have thought they were lying but they also may have been inadvertently correct, and I have to say being correct by accident is very typical of them.",699,5870,0.98

We were having a barbecue today (parents and a younger but also adult sister) and dad told me to grill the meat and specifically said he would not touch anything because he always does without asking and i always complain.

Dad stays behind me the whole time i'm lighting the fire, looking over my shoulder, making sure to comment on every tiny little thing he would have done differently.

When the fire is going enough that i'm not worried about it going out but is still not hot enough for the meat, i sit at the table to chill but dad stays on his usual chair beside the grill.

Eventually, i go put the meat on the grill and it's already there. Dad just says that he thought the grill was hot enough and he doesn't want to wait the whole day for the food.

A couple minutes later i go check on the meat and it's been flipped. Cue some eye twitching.

""Dad, wth?""
""It needed flipping and you weren't here""
""It didn't need flipping, i was gonna flip it now""
""Well, i think it did and i wasn't going to let it burn just because you weren't paying attention, it's common sense""

Two minutes later he calls me:
""Do you think it needs flipping now?""

""How tf should i know? I don't know when you put it on, how hot the fire was or when it was flipped, i have nothing to do with it""

2) Stare me down as if I stole their credit card.

567,Not the A-hole,"So I(20F) live in Iceland, the population here is roughly 350.000 people, we are all somewhat cousins and everyone here knows each other. Ever since I was little I have always been 100% sure of what I want to do when I am older and that is to make movies.

The problem with that though is that there is no real market for it to make actual money here in Iceland and we don't have any film schools worth attending so the only actual way for me to fulfil my dream is to study abroad and most likely live there in the future.

I am very close to my family and all of my extended family lives here. Everyone in my family is Icelandic and our family dates back to the viking age so you could say I have strong roots here.

Last semester I was lucky enough to get the chance to take 6 months off in university and go to a folk high school in Denmark that focused on filmmaking and I can say without a doubt is was the best thing I have ever done, I think my bubble kind of exploded and I actually got to see how small Iceland really is and how many opportunities are out there. There I also met my now boyfriend who is Danish and we have planned for me to come again in the summer (or fall depending on the situation) and move in together because I just got accepted into a film school there. Right now I am in Iceland working 4 jobs trying to save up money. Everything is working out great for my dream to become a film maker and maybe even build a life there.

However not everyone is happy for me. My family really guilts me for leaving everyone behind and choosing to move to another country. My grandma says stuff like how Im likely to miss my chance of getting to know my sisters future children and my mom talks about how I am always going to miss out on my grandma and my grandpa's last years. I also really feel as if my boyfriend isn't that welcome into my family, while my sisters boyfriend is the greatest thing on earth according to my parents, my boyfriend is just the thing that is pulling me away from them and they often ''joke'' about how if they could choose I would only be with an Icelandic guy and stuff like that even though I keep telling them that my boyfriend treats me better than any Icelandic guy I have met and how happy I am with him. I also keep getting told by both my friends and family how I am always going to be unhappy living so far away from my my people and how I am making a mistake and being selfish.

Now I just try to avoid talking about Denmark to the people closest to me because all I get is just eyerolls or a lecture about me making a mistake or being selfish.

I understand that my family and friends may just say these things because they are going to miss me and want me to stay here but why would they be saying these things if they weren't true?

So this happened tonight (we are in Germany) and the argument between my boyfriend and I just started off again and we need to settle it. I think you need to understand the game in order to judge, but maybe I am wrong. And I know, I know basically this argument is super childish. But sometimes grown ups argue over the most stupid things. 

Here is what happened: me, my boyfriend and a friend decided to play the boardgame ""The settlers of Catan"". After a few rounds all I could build was a road, while the other two had a couple of settlements and towns. I only collected about 4 or 5 resource cards while the other two were having so much more. My friend was on his way to build a settlement at the only place were I could have built one (and he would have made it before I had the chance, because I was still missing half the necessary cards and he was having a handful) and on the other side I was basically trapped by all the other roads, settlements and towns of my boyfriend and my friend. So nowhere else to go for me. 
After my friend placed the robber on one of my terrain tiles, even though I was so far behind and I only had 5 cards while my boyfriend had more I just snapped. I had zero chance of winning anyway so I got pissed and threw my cards on the table and said that I didn't want to play anymore.

They got super pissed at me and said I should continue and it is a super shitty thing to just quit. I told them that I have no possibility of winning anyway and they only want me to continue and basically force me to watch me get crushed by them even further because they were doing so good.

Another thing is that they could have easily continued without me. Normally you can only play it with 3 or 4 people. But they invented a version were you can play it with 2 people. They played this version two days before a couple of times and enjoyed it. So all they had to do was to put my stuff away from the board and continue. It would have made no difference for them if I stayed or left. But they stopped too, blamed me, were pissed and told me that ""you just don't stop when playing a board game"".

Yesterday, I saw he had requested to follow me on instagram, so I accepted and followed him back. Going through his posts, I saw a few photos at pride. I figured he might be gay, but he may also just be a straight guy going to pride, so I decided to ask. He replied that he was in fact gay.

This really got me thinking about whether I was comfortable with a gay roommate. I tried to put it in perspective from Chase's point-of-view by imaging I was roommates with a girl. If I was attracted to her, I definitely felt it could get weird and uncomfortable if she didn't reciprocate. And I saw the reverse as true: there's a chance Chase might be attracted to me, and I definitely don't reciprocate, so it has a chance of getting really weird. At the end of the day, I'd just feel uncomfortable rooming with a guy if I had to constantly wonder if he was into me. It would just be really weird.

Yesterday my mom set up an easter egg hunt around our house for my lil sis and my lil bro (11M), and they made me play along too so that my siblings could get excited ab it.

It was actually really fun, I found about 3 eggs, and my sister and bro found collectively 20 eggs in total.

Afterwards, my sister opened one of the eggs up to eat the chocolate and my mom snatched it out of her hands and took away all but 1 of the eggs she collected and told her ""uh uh uh. we gotta watch what you eat"".

When I organised the shop I told my dad and brother that I'd be baking when it arrived, so was there anything they wanted. My brother asked for cupcakes, and I said we were planning on making cupcakes so that worked out perfectly. Dad wanted turnovers, so I gave my kids the icing, decorations, and a stack of cupcakes while I made the turnovers, and as predicted only half the icing made it onto the cakes and visually they leave a lot to be desired, but the kids were very proud of their decorating skills and they had fun, which was the goal.

Between the baking, cleaning up, and me making dinner, me and my kids have been in the kitchen all day and no one has come in, probably because of them watching Frozen 1 and 2 on a loop.

After dinner I gave cupcakes to my kids, gave dad his turnover, then went to my brother's room and gave him a cupcake. As I'm leaving I hear his girlfriend (they were facetiming) going ""awww"". I then hear my brother go ""what the fuck is this?""

I turn, he's holding up the cupcake, I tell him it's a cupcake. He tells me not to get smart, asks why it looks like that. I tell him it's from a kit, I baked it, the kids decorated. He tells me that when he asked for cupcakes he meant ""normal"" cupcakes. He asked me to make normal ones tomorrow (from scratch, not a box, with better decoration) and I said ""no, we've got cupcakes, when we've finished them I'll make more"", then left.

Later, after the kids and I have gone to bed, my brother comes into my room. I'm not fully asleep but nearly and he asks me if I can come with him to the kitchen and help him bake cupcakes, as he doesn't know the measurements or temperature and wants my help icing later. I tell him I already said I'd bake some but he says he wants them now. I tell him to google it.

It's been an hour. I can hear him swearing from here. It sounds like he's burned himself more than once and I can smell burning cake. Dad (who's usually in the room next to the kitchen at this time) texted me. He said my brother has been in the kitchen for the last hour and keeps fucking up, and this would be over with sooner if I could come help. Dad doesn't know I've seen/read this text, I'm tired, and I think this whole thing is stupid.

576,Not the A-hole,"I apologize in advance, this is quite lengthy.

Background: I (18f) have had my dog for 8 years. While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I’m the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I’m perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I’ll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.

While I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I’m gone, I don’t think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn’t interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.

I talked it over with my parents, and although they aren’t super happy about it they understand and say that it’s ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I’ve given her multiple trial weeks where I’ll ask her to be responsible for the dog’s basic needs, and every single time she hasn’t put in effort. I’ll have to remind her multiple times when it’s walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I’m worried when I’m not there, it’ll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn’t have to suffer.

Right now I’m pretty convinced rehoming will be what’s best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I’d be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she’s had for as long as she can remember. I know he’s entirely comfortable with the family/home he would be going to, but I would never want him to feel abandoned. And I do love my sister and I know she loves my dog, but I just can’t bring myself to trust her to take care of him after she failed to prove to me that she could during the various opportunities I gave her. Am I in the wrong here?",25,47,0.92
577,Asshole,"So some context: In the UK, if you fail your maths or English GCSE, you need to retake it in year 12 alongside your A-level subjects. I am a maths teacher. I teach GCSE and maths resit classes. My current resit class have done one resit so far as well as their original GCSE exam.

One of my students (T) was 1 mark off from a passing grade in both exams and both times the school sent it off for remark but nothing went up so she is still in my class. She has a very weird work ethic when it comes to maths; she does all the work (to the point where I run of out sheets to give her, all correct, too) and gets full marks on mock papers we do in lessons but in exams she seems to freeze, but that is normal.  However, T never does maths homework. We set the homework on a maths website where we as teachers can check who has logged in, how long they logged in for, how many questions they have done, etc. I ask for a minimum of 85% complete. It's frustrating and I've spoken to her about it but I can't do much if she's getting full marks in lesson and 1 marks of a passing grade in exams.

Well, my class is supposed to have another resit in June but I am being asked to consider grades. If I give T a 4 (a passing grade) she won't have to take maths next year and she will have her maths GCSE. T was devastated when she failed her resit and it took a toll on her motivation. But here's the thing: one of the things we as teachers need to look at is homework completion and like I already mentioned, T does no maths homework that has been set. This is having an immense impact on the grade that I can give her. I should also mention that she doesn't even log on, or if she does, it's for 10 minutes. If it was for an hour, I might have considered the fact that she writes the questions on paper but 10 minutes is no where near long enough to complete 30 questions.

I've been thinking about this for a couple of days. My wife (who is also a teacher) said that I should just give her the grade and that I am making it harder for T in the long run, but I am conflicted so I came here.

WIBTA?

EDIT: realised I should have mentioned this before I posted, but oh well. I really want T to pass but I feel it would be unfair to other students if I ignore the fact that T is missing a criteria to pass. To me it's like 4 kids being in a water drinking competition. Kid A didn't practice before hand but she wins anyway because she can drink apple juice like a pro. It's a weird concept but that's how it is for me.

EDIT 2: No, she doesn't have any issues with learning/focus. It would be made very clear by the upper staff and yes, she has access to the internet. Her other teachers have been receiving work from her over email

EDIT 3: Ok, so I actually managed to get a Zoom call with T and cleared a few things up for me and for the people asking questions on this post (everything that I note here was told to my by T). 

\-Yes, she has full access to the internet and has her own laptop.

\-I asked if she did any written maths work that I could look at. The answer was no (if she did, than I would have passed her automatically).

\-I asked why she hadn't been doing her maths homework and she told me that she thought she was doing well enough in lessons so she didn't have to do it (even though I had told her multiple times that she needs to)

\-I asked her if she knew the importance of homework on her grade. She said yes but again assumed I would pass her because of her class work. 

\-I asked if there was a reason why she was focusing more on other subjects and she said she felt that her A-level classes were more important than her maths GCSE. 

So that was that and honestly, I am even more conflicted. She admitted that she just didn't feel like she had to do the work and even my wife has changed opinions after hearing that. I'm going to give T a week. If she does even 1 hour of work, then I will pass her. I will try and give an update post if the mods let me. ",59,28,0.82

My wife of 12 years and never been one to go out of her way to help me.  Not really a big deal in our marriage because normally I dont like help.

I have sleep apnea and finally got a cpap machine delivered on Thursday.  For those that dont know it is a mask you wear with a hose going to a device that pumps air into your mouth so you dont choke in your sleep.  

I was super bummed out and depressed that I now need to sleep with essentially  scuba gear on.  I asked her to please make sure to help me with it that night.  She said she would.  I even clarified and said,  ""you promise you will help and not be a bitch about it"".  I know not the nicest way to put it,  but we talk like that.
It is important to point out I never said how I expected her to help me.

That night we are watching tv downstairs as is our routine.  She said she was going to go upstairs and watch a show with our daughter,  i said fine.  I then fell asleep on the couch.  I woke up a few minutes later and walked upstairs to find her in our bed watching tv with our daughter (this is normal).  I laid next to them and started figuring out the machine so I could go to sleep.  I was expecting her to see me needing help and offer,  but she did nothing.  As I struggled I said I guess you weren't going to help then,  or something along those lines.  She then proceeded to get very upset which got me upset and now were not really talking.  

She says I never told her how to help and I say she clearly had zero intention of helping me when she promised to help.

579,Not the A-hole,"Last year right around this time, repressed memories I had of something traumatic were recalled and it really destroyed me. I had panic attacks every single day, which made me lose sleep, and I couldn’t leave the house because I was scared. I had to get therapy and my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD. 

Flash forward maybe a month (still very new to therapy, making slow progress, still very much affected by this trauma), my sister and I got into an argument. This argument didn’t have anything to do with my trauma, I was defending my mom when my sister(24) was making her cry. She soon started attacking me and my character. She came after me for not having a job and I explained to her that I was waiting until after high school to get a job but right before graduating I remembered the trauma and the PTSD made it hard to function. She then told me I was faking it, it was all in my head, etc. I flew into a panic attack and cut off all contact with her that night. 

Present day, I still don’t speak to her. My mom insists I drop it because “she’s family”, but what she said to me was unforgivable in my opinion. Whenever I’m around her, it makes me relive everything. The shame, the panic, the feeling of people not believing me and making me feel small. My parents will invite her over to the house without giving me a heads up which half of me understands they don’t have to get permission from me but the other half feels hurt because her presence really screws with me mentally and having a heads up would make it easier to avoid the panic and depression. 

AITA for both not forgiving my sister and also for wanting a heads up when she comes by?

Yesterday, while I (19F) was on a walk with my little brother (10M) and I told him that he has ADHD. My parents got him diagnosed last year and while they have been making efforts to help succeed in school, they get mad at him for exhibiting textbook symptoms of ADHD. I moved away for college last fall and haven't seen the full scope of things, but since I've moved back home, my parents have been yelling at my brother for not being able to finish tasks, calling him stupid, and grounding him for weeks over trivial issues. I talked to my brother about it and he's told me that while I'm away the yelling is more frequent. I decided that I would give him an explanation behind what was going on, mainly because I feel like he deserves to know, and it would explain things to him, rather that keep him thinking that ""mom and dad hate me and I don't know why"". I explained to him that having ADHD doesn't make you a bad person, it just makes your thinking process a bit different.

Fast forward to today,  and while I was out on a walk, my brother confided  to our parents about what  we talked about on our walk yesterday. My dad told me that I was selfish for telling him and undermining their parenting and yelled at me for half an hour, and my mom won't come out of her room to even talk to me. So AITA?

I (17F) am the oldest of three daughters. My sisters are 13 and 10 years old. I have a good relationship with my middle sister, R. 

I can’t stand my youngest sister, S. 

S has a nasty mouth that our parents have let her run for as long as she could talk, and I’m sick and tired of having to deal with her mean comments all the time, some of which are petty jabs, and some of which are bordering on problematic.  

The biggest issue I have with her is her comments towards me. 

I’ve had body issues since I was her age, that have continued up to the present day. I’ve starved myself, I’ve forced myself to throw up a meal, I’ve pretty much suffered over my image in every way you possibly can. My parents know about this, and so does my entire family, thanks to an extremely awkward Christmas Day blowout from when I was fourteen. S uses this against me whenever I piss her off in the slightest. 

I tell her she’s being annoying? “At least I’m not fat.” 

We argue at the dinner table over something? “At least whenever I walk the ground doesn’t shake” 

S is also nasty when it comes to our differences. Our dad is black, and our mom is white, so we’re mixed. I’m the darkest, and S is the lightest, which she believes makes her prettier and better than me in every way. I think this is disgusting and horrific that something like that is coming out of a ten year old’s mouth, but my parents have seen no issue with it. 

They’ve said that she doesn’t understand how serious those matters are, and that she’ll learn, just like I did. I haven’t ever said anything like that, and it frustrates me to no end how they refuse to do anything about it. 

In a recent talk with my parents, I’ve told them I want nothing to do with her until she stops talking like that, and when she does, then I might be willing to build a relationship with her. They told me I was being ridiculous, and that it would hurt S that her “role model” was freezing her out. 

I’m not perfect, and I’ve said some stupid things too, but I think this is just horrible. AITA?

- UPDATE - 

Hello again! I’d like to thank all of you for your kind words and advice, and for giving me so many different perspectives. I haven’t spoken with my parents yet, due to their schedules being unpredictable as essential workers. I’ve been around my sisters more and taking care of them as a result, which was what prompted me to make this post. 

Today I was home alone with R and S - we didn’t have school today, perk of attending catholic school - and suggested that we go out and play with our dogs and get some fresh air. Both of them agreed and we spent some time outside before S began to warm up to me. 

We spent a long time talking about a lot of things, but eventually we got to our relationship and how the things she said has hurt me and how wrong it is to say things like that. We bonded a lot, I even managed to bring S along with me in the car to pick up lunch. I also gave her an in-depth talk about eating disorders, body image issues and colorism, and what I found was that no one had ever taught her how severe those issues were.  

S was really upset when we talked, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen her show that much remorse for as long as I’ve been her older sister. She has been apologizing nonstop, and wrote me a long apology and slid it under my door at some point today.  I know that I wasn’t originally going to talk to her - that was not anywhere in the plan at all. But it kind of slipped into the conversation we were having this morning. 

This doesn’t mean that everything is solved now. I’m still trying to address my issues with my parents, and I think I’ll try to get S to see a therapist separately, and with me. I think my parents will be happy that we’re getting along, but I don’t think they’ll be happy with me for talking about sensitive topics with their youngest. 

Thank you for both the supportive and critical comments, and I’ll do my best for the next year I have.",283,2665,0.96
582,Not the A-hole,"My (25M) wife (29F)  has always been against our daughter wearing clothes she deems too ""adult"" meaning crop tops and certain shorts and skirts (NOT  all shorts/skirts just the too short ones, unsually common for children's clothes) 

My wife loves shopping for new clothes for our daughter, at this stage she has so many clothes and shoes that she has a whole  wardrobe and some under her bed, usually separated with ""casual"" clothes and ""nice"" clothes (all clothes that she outgrows end up being donated) - we've been meaning to get new summer clothes since she's outgrown hers but delivery isn't due for another month or two.

584,Asshole,"This has been eating me up for weeks and I just want some unbiased thoughts about it.

A 'friend' of mine, C, drunkenly confessed that she cheated multiple times in her math exams in college. She would bring two blue books (we are allowed to bring multiple) and write the problems and her answers on both, then submit one to the proctor. She would finish the exam and leave early, then go to the restroom where she would review the answers she wrote in the second blue book. She would make the necessary corrections or answer the items she couldn't during the test. After the exam, as everyone is submitting their blue books or going out, she would go back to the proctor and say that she submitted the wrong blue book. It worked every time, I guess because she's easy on the eyes and has a way with people. She is intelligent but is weak at Math, which we had to take a couple of units of in freshman and sophomore year.

The thing is, in freshman year C and I both applied for and were among the final candidates for a full scholarship from a private donor. The scholarship would go to the candidate with the highest GPA at the end of the year, and it went to C. I was devastated because that scholarship would have made a world of difference for me - I come from a humble background and am the first in my family to go to college. I struggled to support myself and took on part time jobs to pay for expenses that I couldn't get subsidized while C rode a full scholarship that she got by cheating.

I was furious when C told me what she did, and until now I am thinking of reporting her to the university which has a policy of taking back degrees if the person is proven to have cheated, no matter how long he or she has been a graduate. My best friend, who is also friends with C, says I should let it go because it's been so long and it would be hard to prove that C cheated. She said even though what C did is wrong, she is our friend and has done a lot for us (she did help me financially after college since she got a high paying job and doesn't have student loans to pay) and everything turned out well in the end. She said that my hard work in college taught me important life lessons that led to me being successful today and that's what matters.

But I still think that C did something wrong and shouldn't be able to get away with it. So would I be the asshole if I report her?

Some clarifications:

1. How do I know that I would have gotten the scholarship if she didn't? - The scholarship would go to the person with the highest GPA among the 3 candidates. She got 4.92 by cheating on two math subjects. I got 4.90 clean. The other candidate got 4.86. If C hadn't cheated, I would have had the highest GPA.
2. Did she need the scholarship as much as I did? - Her parents were willing to pay for her education if she majored in what they wanted.  She wanted to major in something else so she applied for the scholarship.
3. What was the financial help that she gave me? - $5k loan, which I have repaid, sometimes paying for my meals when we go out (I would only let her do this when I was really tight with money because I didn't want to take advantage), giving me $1K for rent which I offered to repay but she would not accept.",236,199,0.82
585,Asshole,"Update: the situation has resolved itself!

I (22F) am a college student. I am also white. This is important later. I study International Trade and Criminal Justice. At present, I am taking a class on international crime, and have to write a paper that could be published in the school magazine if the professor likes it. This paper is on a subject I'm not allowed to mention in this sub (I've done it before and the post was removed). The subject of the paper is this particular crime in comparison with chattel slavery of the 1800s. In my paper, I argue that this crime disproportionately impacts the black community moreso than other communities due to certain socioeconomic factors, one of which includes differences in cultural emphasis on familial ties. One assertion I make is that the black community is more affected than the Latino community by this crime (as victims, I should point out) because the Latino community typically has stronger cultural emphasis on the family unit and preservation thereof, whereas individuals of the black community are more likely to go off independently with a looser connection to the family unit due to cultural differences as well as the negative impact of disproportionate incarceration rates on the average black family in America. None of this is at all to say that the black community is doing anything to provoke these crimes or that they ""make themselves a victim"". I do, however, acknowledge that I am a white woman from the upper middle class, and have absolutely zero experience in the black community or what they may feel about what I have said in this paper. Everything I have said has come from sociological papers and criminal justice resources, and the black community may feel that this is a bad representation of their community.

WIBTA if I asked a black classmate to ""sensitivity-check"" my paper for things that could come off as insensitive, whether in the content or simply the wording, so I don't look like another white college jackass who thinks I can speak for the black community? I asked a friend of mine who is black, and while he said the paper sounded fine, he is also one of my friends and knows exactly what I'm trying to say because he's known me for years and understands the intention behind my wording without question. He said it would seem uncouth to ask a black classmate out of the blue to proofread something like this. I can also understand how this would be offensive, as if I'm saying ""hey, you're black, you can speak for the black community as a monolith, help me"".

Edited to add: I did NOT choose the topic of this paper, the topic was assigned to the class itself. I can assure you, I wouldn't have chosen such a sensitive topic on which I am no expert if I had a choice.

TL;DR: white chick needs help deciding whether she would be an asshole to ask a POC to proofread a paper about something that affects their community so as not to come off as an out of touch college douche",82,65,0.85

I don't know much about my actual father, but what I do know is that he passed away from a heart attack when I was 2, and he wasn't a great parent. My siblings and I still have his last name (let's say Miles), while my mom has my stepdad's name (let's say Brown).

I've come to really like my last name. It's rather unusual, yet it pairs nicely with the rest of my name, and I've gotten several compliments on it. I feel it's part of my identity, and I would hate to change it.

My mom specifically states that I need to share a name with those I love, instead of someone I have no connection with (my actual father).

The only thing that I believe my parents are entitled to is the $15k Parent Plus Loan that my dad took out for me because I was unable to take out the loan myself. I don't intend to ask them for more and I already have plans to repay them (including interest). But she seems to think I owe them much more, and when I ask her reasonings are usually involving the fact that she provided me with food and shelter growing up.

I’ve blatantly told her that I’m not going to buy her all the things she demands and she got upset. She started asking things like, “What, you think I don’t deserve to have a good life?” and talks about how she supported me growing up. But she never let me do fun things, sports, clubs, or generally do/have anything involving money. She did the bare minimum. 

Plus, she hasn’t even supported me in college; she had initially agreed to give me $30 a week for food but stopped that only a few months in. And then when I got a refund check that was supposed to go towards college expenses she said she wanted to hold on to it for safekeeping but spent it all and lied when I asked her about it. 

She’s a classic narcissist and usually I’m able to separate her delusions from what makes sense, but in this case I’m unsure. I don’t know if I’m being ungrateful or stingy or just frustrated because of the issues we’ve had with finances in the past.

591,Everyone Sucks,"    I(71M) am a modestly a really wealthy man. I am now suffering from kidney failure. I have extensively looked for a donor but have not found one. In my will, I dictated that my children will receive my assets. But certain events have happened that caused me to reconsider my will.
    When I was younger, I worked hard to make it to where I am now. This caused me to have a larger than life ego. I married and had one boy and then another girl. As the children grew up, I held them to unreachable standards. I restricted their access to any social activity and anything else that I considered a distraction.  My wife saw this and was horrified. She told me to change my ways. I refused and this lead to a bitter divorce. My children were 17 and 15 at that time. I blamed my children for this and refused to see them anymore. 
I turned into a very heartbroken man. This caused me to dive into work to avoid all this pain. In turn, I became very successful. As time went on, I realized how horrible and abusive I had been. I decided to reach out to my children and try to mend our relationships. 
They saw how I had changed and decided to forgive me for what I had done. I thought we had good relations now. As my time was coming to an end, my children decided to meet for a few last times. During one of these meetings, I had to excuse myself to the bathroom. As I was walking back, I heard them talking about me. I decided to listen to what they were saying. I was shocked to hear that my daughter saying that she was capable of donating her kidney to me. She had chosen not to donate to me as she wanted me to die and get all my assets sooner. My son only agreed with her. I immediately burst into the room and told them to get out. It seemed to me they had only started a relationship with me so they could receive my money. I decided to change my will so charities would be able to receive it instead. I thought they didn’t deserve it anymore. After they had left, I was getting tons of texts from them about how their actions were justified because of how much of an abusive father I had been. I felt bad but still did not consider this enough to change my mind.

593,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I stopped making food for my family because they don’t treat it with the same respect as they do when my mom cooks?

So my(16F) mom isn’t home currently due to the situation going on, and she’s been expecting me to cook dinner and lunch for my sister (14F)and my dad when she isn’t there, which is fine, but then she yells at me for being lazy and sleeping all day (granted I stay up late on these nights and wake up around 11 because I like talking to my friends since we never get to see each other) 

My sister does not get the same level of shouting because she exercises, even though she puts in minimal effort into her schoolwork and just asks me to do it. I like playing video games, and I like reading and watching tv in my spare time, while my sister likes running. Good for her, but I don’t see why I have to follow that same standard when I am a reasonably healthy person. 

When I cook, I leave a few dishes in the sink while I do half because I want my sister to do the rest, given that she’s eaten as well, but her defense is that because she’s going to work out and that she didn’t make the meal, so she shouldn’t have to do the dishes. 

More than once have I had to sacrifice my spare time just to make her dinner, which doesn’t even align with when I eat because I eat at 7 and she eats at 5. I told my parents this and they told me if I didn’t want to do the dishes, then I shouldn’t cook, and that I’m being lazy by not fulfilling my responsibilities. 

I just don’t see why I have to suddenly drop everything for my family when my sister gets off easy because she exercises. Now that she’s stuck inside the house, all she does is berate me for being lazy or for doing something as unproductive as video games. I feel like I’m entitled to my free time just as much as her, particularly because I’m currently preparing for 5 AP tests and an still hearing it from my mother about studying for the SAT, even though I’ve already taken it 2x. 

WIBTA if I stopped making food for my family until they actually begin to respect me sacrificing my time the way they do for my mom? 

(Btw it’s not like I’m making instant meals I’ve constantly had to learn things for myself as the older sibling and am very capable of making dishes of equal caliber as my mother. It’s not like I’m forcing them to eat instant ramen every night, I just want them to stop calling me lazy when I feel as if I’m doing a lot of work inside of the house compared to others)

EDIT: the only reason I’m more mad than I should be is that on the flip side my sister makes baked goods for her basic foods class that I do not eat because I like different things than her, but her neglect has caused me to just do the dishes rather than both of us get yelled at by my parents.",24,64,0.89

I made what I thought was a harmless joke, that should’ve stopped when she told me she didn’t find it funny the first time. I did apologize to her before but it was only because she was annoyed with me, I apologized again last night when I got home from work because I can see how what I said could completely shatter her gaming experience and any chance of her wanting to keep trying games.

596,Not the A-hole,"I’m a stay-at-home mom with four kids, ages 3-9. Husband has been working from home for the past few weeks. We didn’t have a home office set up before this. He could have chosen the guest room at the back of our house for his work space, as there’s a desk in there. But he said it was too small for him, so he set up in the dining room. He tried to block off an area with room dividers, but it’s not the same as having actual walls. Also, the dining room is (obviously) right next to the kitchen, but also next to our designated playroom for the kids. 

His job is fairly flexible, but we try to stay out of his way while he’s working, especially when he has conference calls. I’ve taken the kids to the back room at times when he’s asked for quiet, or we’ve gone for walks. 

On this particular day, his call was close to lunchtime and I was making food in the kitchen, while the kids were in the playroom, where I can see them from the kitchen. I did have to keep reminding them to keep their voices and playing quieter, but I actually thought they were doing a good job. 

When the call was over, husband came out of his “office” and said, “well, that was the worst meeting I’ve had. They couldn’t be quiet for one hour. That’s all I asked for: one hour.” I couldn’t even respond. I felt like it was all my fault and I was a terrible person for not taking the kids out of the house for that hour. This feeling was made worse by the fact that there was nowhere to escape in the moment. We’re all stuck at home together. 

I have friends who’ve made work-from-home spaces in garages so that they’re away from the noise of their kids. I understand that it’s stressful to change his work environment and that the kids are distracting, but my job has also changed a lot, with no school or activities or friend visits to distract the kids. 

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: thank you all for your input. I wanted to reply to everyone, but I let the comments get away from me. 

Also, tonight he told me that the kids are too loud in the backyard, too. So, that leaves the back bedroom, the driveway, or leaving the house. I just can’t.

597,Not the A-hole,"A couple of days ago, my room mate asked if there was a time she could use my laptop on the weekend. I told her that on Sunday (today) I don't have any plans except D&D at 4pm so she could probably use it. I let her use my laptop that day as well, after she said ""It would only take 30 minute to an hour"" I then let her use it for 2 hours.

Anyways, today arrives and while I lay in bed contemplating my existence, I hear a knock on my door. I hear room mate say through my door, ""I need to use your computer.""
I say ""Okay?"" confused, because I don't think that's the right way to ask to use someone's property.
So, I tell her she needs  to ask to use it rather than demand to use it. She replies with, ""I already asked and you said I could!""
I try to explain to her that I don't mind her using it, and I said a couple days ago she could, but that doesn't mean she can just demand it from me in such an entitled way.
She then called me ""Power hungry"" and ""Wanting to control everything"" - she did (very condescendingly) say ""OP, Can I *please* use your computer?"" and I was going to let her use it but then she continued to insult me and attempted to unplug stuff from my laptop and take it. I stopped her, told her ""You know what? You can't use it. Learn some manners."" and began plugging my laptop back in.
She left in a huff and said, ""Fine. I don't need you.""

I know it's not my place to teach her manners, but I also don't have an obligation to let her use my property. She does this quite a lot, demanding things or saying ""I need to use this."" rather than asking. She uses the excuse ""I'm just direct/blunt"" but I try to tell her you can be direct but still be polite. Problem is, I feel bad because I want to help her, but I don't like being treated  that way.
Anyways, am I the asshole?

598,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not cooking for my boyfriend? My boyfriend and I agree that I am NTA but my mom is fierce in insisting that I am TA. Sorry if this is a long one.

I (21F) am vegan and have been vegan since I met my boyfriend of almost two years (24M). My boyfriend is very much not vegan but will happily share vegan meals with me. We have not considered this to be a problem in our relationship as we live in a pretty vegan-friendly city and I prefer cooking anyway, so eating together, whether in the house or out, has never been a problem. Nonetheless, he has his own fave vegan restaurants in the city that he'll beg to go to sometimes, or he'll even send me recipes that I could try out for our nights staying in. What I'm trying to sum up is, our different eating habits have never been a sore issue between us.

Here is where I want to find out if I am TA. I was on the phone with my mom one night while I was cooking dinner for my bf and I. She asked what he was going to eat and I was a little bit confused at the question because I had just mentioned what I was cooking for us. She then asked if he was vegan and I said no, he is not. That's when she started berating me. She said that I was forcing my eating habits on my bf and that I should start cooking meals with meat in it for him. I told her that I refuse to contribute some of my money to buying non-vegan products and plus my boyfriend has never complained about eating vegan with me and even loves it. I also said that if he really wanted a meat-based meal, that he was more than capable of cooking it himself, I just would not be the one making it for him and I would be more than willing to share my kitchen for him to cook himself a meal. She said that he only agrees to eat vegan because he loves me and I am making the relationship dynamic really unequal by refusing to cook him a meat-based meal, and that I was being too forceful with my eating habits. She said it was my job to cook him some meat occasionally because he was being more than accommodating about dating me and my vegan lifestyle. ""That's how loving relationships go."" She made other comments I won't go into that implied that I was being borderline abusive because of my eating habits.

I rationally know that I am not TA but it really threw me for a loop when she said that I was making the relationship unequal and now I'm stressed that I am doing exactly that and my bf is being too nice to admit so. He said it has never been an issue. We regularly go to non-vegan restaurants that have veg options on the menu so we both can eat and I have never once policed what he eats. Plus, we don't live together right now so it's not like we share every single meal of the day together. So, AITA?",44,105,0.93
599,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend gets mad at me when my panic attacks wake him up at night

Sometimes I have panic attacks and they mostly happen at night in bed when I’m just stuck with my thoughts in the dark. In the past 2 weeks or so, it’s happened twice, but it usually isn’t that common. I’ll go 1 or 2 months without it happening but sometimes it will happen 2 or maybe even 3 times a month. 

When I lived with my mom and also with my ex boyfriend, they were always there to comfort me and help me, which always really helps calm down. They did this even though I often had to wake them up at 1,2, maybe 3 in the morning. 

Now living with my current boyfriend, I don’t even expect him to help me when I’m having an attack. He wakes up from the noise and tells me to go to the other room or to stop. It’s usually in a really mean and hostile tone too, so it always makes me feel even more panicked and scared. 

He says that when that happens I should calm down on my own or go to the other room if I’m going to make any noise so I don’t wake him up. If I do wake him up intentionally he says I’m being selfish. I don’t think he understands how hard it would be for me to stand up and walk to the other room and sit there alone in the middle of a panic attack. 

Am I an asshole for expecting him to wake up and comfort me when this happens to me? Should I do something different? 

Also I hope this doesn’t sound biased I am personally really hurt by this happening but he is very adamant about what he is saying.",140,235,0.86

We went to his parents house just to see how’s everyone is doing since it’s been awhile. He’s an amazing cook, so he was helping his brother with dinner  I was setting the table. We were talking about how our day was and the conversation follows B= boyfriend BB= boyfriend’s brother Me=.....take a wild guess lol



B:The food is great 

BB: thanks I even made cake 

B: yes I love your cakes 

Me: I do too 

BB: well with your eating disorder I’m sure you can eat the whole thing Me

I looked straight at B he was red in the face probably from embarrassment and angry. Dinner quickly finishes after that. Before we leave mom (she’s basically my mom too at this point guys I really love her) apologize like crazy I said it’s not her fault and we leave and go home then I told him I’m going to stay the night at friends and of course he thought it was the end and I assured him that we are not breaking up but what he did really hurt me. When I first told him and he swore up and down he would never tell anyone cause some of his other family already picks on my appearance (I’m black and he’s white) I just went to my friends and cried I’m not gonna leave him but he tends to overshare with his family sometimes we have talked about him over sharing countless of times but nothing works

Update: thanks for the sweet comments guys. Soooo some shit has hit the fan. Turns out that B went to BB house and beat the crap outta him to say the least. And all hell broke lose in his family. Turns out B told BB went they both gotten so drunk because he was worried he couldn’t help me ( which is understandable) but BB apparently has gotten wronged by a few black people his life which is why he dislikes me. And he refuses to apologize to me because “it’s not my fault that monkey can’t control herself” which I sorta expected. BB is no longer welcome into the family except for those who welcomes this behavior. B actually cried for the first time when we talked and we are okay now. I’m pretty much getting breakfast in bed for the rest of my life and we have gone NC with BB include his mom, dad and their younger brother.

601,Not the A-hole,"My lease expired end of March. My new place fell through, so I asked my parents if me and my 20 month old son could stay with them until we found a new place, which I am currently trying to do. It's them, me, my son and my brother (15) all living at home.

My job has always been done from home, mostly video calls. Mum's job is almost entirely phone calls, and dad's also requires video calls, so the only person free is my brother. I hadn't asked him to do watch my son, and I have been having sessions with my son in the room with me. I'm able to keep an eye on him, but due to a bar of his playpen snapping I've not been using it, so he's able to wander the room and has appeared on camera a couple times, and he makes background noise. I put a preemptive statement on my profile, saying that my son will be with me. Of all the clients I've seen since adding this statement, most were fine about it and understood, but a couple got shitty. I got a terrible review from one, and I complained about it at dinner last night. My brother then said he would babysit for £10 an hour. I agreed.

Today was the first day of this. I had 5 hours of sessions, my brother had my son while I had my meetings, and at the end of the day I came out to see that my son's playpen had been positioned so the broken side was against the wall, my son was inside, and my brother was nowhere to be seen. I took my son out of the pen, fed him (the lunch I'd made was still in the fridge) and then found my brother in his room, headphones on, on his xbox. The headphones were so loud that he didn't hear me until I took them off him (though he may have been ignoring me). I cussed him out and asked what he was thinking. He claims that of the 5 hours I was on calls, he'd been with my son for most of it, and had left just before I came downstairs, so he deserved to be paid anyway. I don't buy this, but the only witness is my son, who can't give us a time frame.

I've said I'm not paying, he left my child alone in his pen for fuck knows how long, but he insists that he was there for nearly 5 full hours so he deserves to be paid for the first 4. Mum and dad both told him he was an idiot, but mum says that if he says he was with my son for almost 5 full hours we should believe him and he should still get paid. I asked if she was joking. She wasn't. Dad is on my side but mum and my brother are both insisting that he should be paid for all 5 hours. This whole thing is causing a serious division in the house because mum believes that we should trust him and give him the benefit of the doubt considering I can't prove he wasn't with my son.

Anyways my gf is staying with me because of events happening around the world. I cooked some steak for us last night and she did the dishes. I asked her to set aside the skillet that I’ll do it myself. She asked why and I told her why and she wanted to do it I said no I’d rather I just do it so you can see then next time you can clean it.

i excuse myself to the loo and come out to see Tracy furiously scrubbing it with soap and I swear to god I almost had a stroke. Years of intra-skillet seasoning gone...just like that 😣😣 I shouted stop what are you doing (ok admittedly not my best moment) which caused her to drop it in shock and she got mad at me for yelling at her. I have very simple instructions and she still disregarded it but she feels as if I should’ve just taught her. The problem is I’m not good with verbally teaching I’m way better at showing you what I’m doing then explaining as I go along. anyways AITA for this?

E: since everyone’s getting their panties in a twist about how I treat the skillet, I’ll spell this out for y’all since a lot of you are too slow to get it. First of all when I say seasoning, I don’t actually “season” the pan. It’s just a term for the flavour that the pan gives the meat. As for how I clean it, I make sure to rinse out the pan to remove all the food bits. I then take a paper towel and wipe down the pan to remove all grease and stuff but I don’t wash it with soap and water. I then take a brush and lightly brush the pan with olive oil which locks in the flavour. If you think I’m wrong for doing this then you’re free to think that but don’t take up your issue with me; instead you should take it up with world famous chefs and amazing cooks all around the world who practice the same protocol. It’s so god damn tiring seeing people on reddit be confident about topics they have no clue about. Like seriously people, it only takes a quick google search.

E2: I explicitly told her that I’d show her how to do it but I gotta go pee first but she didn’t wait for me to be finished before she started on the skillet. And she was using a thick scouring pad to wash the skillet.

My family is from Asia, where commenting on other people's weight is normalized. The sick part, though, is that nobody comments if you're ""too thin"" but **everybody** thinks it's okay to comment that you have gained weight or are fat. 

This completely twisted my perception of body image. In college, I was both anorexic and bulimic. My weight dropped drastically, but I was miserable. When my period stopped because I was so underweight, I finally sought help. I'm now at a healthy weight--not ""thin"" by Asian standards though. To this day, I have severe body image issues.

There is one particular family friend who **always** commented on my weight. It was like he had nothing better to do than note every weight fluctuation he ever saw. My parents had a party over the holidays and I was home from grad school. When they were going over the list of guests, I **begged** them not to invite him. I had not seen him since before I became anorexic/bulimic, so I was still obese as far as he knew. I didn't feel emotionally stable enough to interact with him. My parents swore that he knew about my eating disorders and would not bring up the topic during the party. They invited him.

Fast forward to the party. He saw me for the first time in years, and immediately raved about how much weight I had lost. I didn't respond and avoided him until it was time to eat. The dinner was potluck style, and as I helped myself to noodles, he commented, ""Are you sure you should eat those carbs? You don't want to gain that weight back again.""

My parents gestured frantically for him to stop, but I lost it. I slammed my plate down, screamed that it was none of his business and that he should just shut the fuck up, and stormed out of the house. According to my sister, the party basically ended then and there. 

I didn't come back until 2am. My parents were up, and even though they knew they fucked up, they were also angry that I was ""rude"" to a guest and ""ruined"" the party.

Since my best friend (33F too) got married last year, my sister and her boyfriend have started to tell my parents how sad it is that I haven't found anyone yet and who knows when I'll find someone now that I'm back in academics and that they wish to see me happy. My parents too have started to make comments like these.

The thing is, I AM VERY HAPPY! I have my family, my friends, a job I love and that makes me good money, I haven't had bouts of depression in years!

Anyway, since I know this is an important subject for my sister and her partner (they're crazy in love, celebrated their 11th anniversary this year) I have told them I might try to date someone, for their sake.

They've since taken upon themselves to introduce me to every single friend they have and I have obediently gone to dates with them, even some double dates with my sister and her boyfriend. 

Some were good, some were bad, but they all had the same problem: they are all part of the working class; one girl was a hairdresser, one guy was a colleague of my sister's boyfriend at the garage, and so on. 

This is the bad part, I know, but I'm really proud of my academic achievements, it took me years to get my bachelor's because I had really bad depression at the time so now that I'm a PhD candidate I'm over the moon and I can't stop talking about it.

I felt like I couldn't talk about my studies with these people, some of them were rude about it, some of them simply weren't interested and I get that absolutely, it can be boring for someone who is not interested. Also I couldn't find connection with most of them, because we were interested in vastly different things, I love to discuss politics and philosophy and I have a low tolerance for football and gossip. 

I have come to the conclusion that I don't want to date and even if I wanted, I'd like to be with someone who has at least a bachelor's, preferably in a field different than mine, so that I can learn about things I don't know. 

So, WIBTA if I tell my sister and her boyfriend the reason why I don't want to meet anymore of their friends, which is that they have a lower education than mine? 

I think she will get angry because this was an old argument between us during our teen years, and I used to be really snobby with her because she went to a trade high school. I am NOT like that anymore, I love my sister and her boyfriend dearly and I respect their jobs and I don't want to offend them in any way. 

P.S. In my country higher education is really affordable, so this is not a jab at poor people.",252,288,0.9
609,Not the A-hole,"(On Behalf Of My 26 Year Old Brother Who Cannot Log Onto His Account)

Yesterday on Easter Morning (Australian Time keep in mind), I (15m) was woken up by loud crying and rolling downstairs, living in a house with my 3 Year Old cousin this is a normal occurrence, however, today it was different. It was our 14 year old cousin rolling on the floor balling his eyes out, when I first saw the way he was crying, I thought that our Grandmother must’ve passed away or something, but no, he was crying because my brother told him, a 14 year old kid, that the Easter Bunny isn’t real.

Before you instantly say YTA here are a few things to keep in mind here:
1. He isn’t intellectually disabled in any way, and is actually one of the more popular kids in his grade
2. He is a really smart kid, he gets at least 75% or more on all his exams
3. He’s sociable and has many friends his age
4. He has never had a breakdown like this 

In my personal opinion, I think his parents are the biggest assholes, who would let their kid believe in a tale made for children when they’re literally transitioning into adults? people are strange. But let me know what you think.",59,71,0.92
610,Not the A-hole," My BF (30M) and I (26F) received our tax refunds last week. He received $5k and I received $11k. His PC is 7 years old and he's been wanting to upgrade for a while so he can play new games at high resolutions. I'm also a gamer so I understand the frustration of low FPS and ugly graphics however we bought a house last year and two months later he got fired so he wasn't eligible for employment insurance. I've had to pay for the bills for 6 months before he finally got a job again this year. During that time I paid for him to take a supplementary course to be more employable while paying for mortgage, his car payments, and literally every other bill. Luckily I have a good-paying job and an emergency fund so I was able to handle the financial burden. I was never mad at him for losing his job but I was upset and stressed that I was barely breaking even.

Anyway, he started working again on January and I told him to keep his earnings for a few months so he can start paying off his car (4 years left) and start saving. He makes around $2k/month and his only bill is his car payment of $500/month but he still only had $1k on his account before the refund was deposited. I don't know where the fuck his money goes but I didn't want to be controlling so I didn't push it.

Now with whats going on in the world and the industry we work in (oil) struggling, we're both at risk of losing our jobs. I asked him to hold off spending $2k on a new PC since we both might lose our jobs any time but he got mad at me because I spend my money however I want. This is kind of true but I also pay for all the bills, have zero debt, maxed out my registered accounts and set aside money for savings. I focus on our priorities first before I spend the excess on myself. If it's relevant, I make 3x what he makes and I spent $1k of my return on an exercise equipment (I've wanted to buy it for him) before I knew he wanted to make a new PC; the rest went to emergency fund. I just want him to have a cushion of savings for himself so that he doesn't need to rely on me financially if he were to lose his job. I do feel that it's unfair to him that I'm restricting how he uses his money but I think it's justified due to the current circumstances and I think that the refund is a great head start for him to save. He would still have $3k left to save but I don't trust that he won't use that because he's never known how to save.",31,42,0.92
611,Not the A-hole,"I grew up a Hindu, she grew up Muslim. My family never pressured me into following any faith (only thing they did was not allow beef inside the house) while hers were a lot more devout. I’ve maintained a laissez-faire attitude to it but my wife, ever since I met her has been vehemently against religion. 

As neither of us are religious, we agreed we wouldn’t raise our children (6m and 4f) in any faith.  That was working fine until a couple of months ago when my grandfather died. I realised most of my great memories of him came from my childhood where he would tell me the myths and legends from Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, so I decided to use them as bedtime stories I’d tell them to my kids. In my view, they aren’t overtly religious and if you replace the word ‘god’ with ’king’ you’re pretty much set. The stories have morals, like telling the truth and being generous and kind, which are values I think the kids should learn. However, when my wife found out she firmly asked me to stop with the Hindu legends because she felt it went against our agreement, and I said I would. 

Now yesterday, she walked in on me reading to our kids from a child’s version of Greek Myths and Legends. She got far more upset saying that I was doing the same thing I’d agreed to stop doing. 

At this I said she was being ridiculous. First, I thought she objected to the Hindu stories because Hinduism is still a very popular religion and that might influence them, while with the Greek myths it’s a dead religion and no one is encouraging them to worship Zeus. Her next point was that she didn’t want mentions of God at all in the house, which I said was ridiculous. The kids were probably exposed to the concept of deity by now, either through speech, or films or tv. Besides, in my view not raising them to be religious is not the same as completely ignoring the idea of god. Finally, I said that her reaction was perhaps too severe because at 4 and 6, they probably thought it was a cool story about a bloke fighting a lion and not about a power to which they should be obedient.",143,793,0.96
612,Not the A-hole,"My 14 year old niece loves to sing. She isn’t going to be the next America idol or anything, but she isn’t under the illusion that she is, she just has a lot of fun performing for the family and making videos on YouTube. 

I’ve always encouraged her, (by watching and commenting on the videos, asking her to sing for us when I’m over, etc.) because it was a chance for her to be create and outgoing and have fun. 

Lately her parents have been hounding me to stop encouraging her. They say it’s not a good use of her time if she isn’t going to take it seriously and since she doesn’t have the capacity to become any kind of great performer, that she should really be focusing her time on other things. 

That’s their prerogative at home how they want to do it, but I didn’t feel right suddenly stopping asking her to sing for us or stopping interacting with her videos.

613,Not the A-hole,"So, I  was reading a post here and it made me remember something that happened years ago, and it really gets me thinking.

It's my first post, I'm writing on my phone and English is not my first language.

I live in Brazil. Back in 2012 I was accepted into college, and had to move out to the other side of the country, in São Paulo, away from my family and friends

I had lived with my godfather and godmother until 2014, when they were about to move to a city far away. So, I needed to find a new place to live. In about 2 weeks, I found a place, with a couple of landlords and their 2 sons living in the apartment above. At that time I was 21years old.

It had a good price and was near the house of my godfather, so moving in was easy.

The landlord couple seemed fine, and all was good.

Then came the depression. I had a boyfriend at the time. He was worried, so he spent the next 2 weeks in my place, to be there for me. He was trying to be supportive.

After these 2 weeks, I was feeling a little better. But then came the the landlord's wife. She asked me why there was someone else living there with me, because when they rented me the place it was agreed that would be only me going to live there. She also asked who he was.

I told her, that he was my boyfriend, and was there to help me out through a tough time. But he was only a visit, and he was not going to live there with me.

She got upset that I didn't told her that I was gay before. She said that I should've told her, that it was important information, that she was worried for her family and all.

I was shocked! I couldn't say anything. I was literally paralyzed. I just agreed and ended the conversation.
Things got really awkward with them after this, but still I lived there for one year and a half.

I told my boyfriend all of this, and he was furious! He said that she had no reason to go demanding to know things so personal like that. We ended up having a fight, because I really didn't want to make this matter bigger and make a mess with it. I was still sensitive with all that I've been through.

So, what do you think? Am I the butthole for not telling my landlord that I'm gay?

Sorry again for bad writing and long text.",29,51,0.83
614,Everyone Sucks,"My [M33] girlfriend [F32] is curled up under the blanket right in this moment. We just had an argument about me being the strict parent, the one that says No and her being the Yes cool parent. 

It all started yesterday. We took a little walk with our toddler [M2]. It's cold outside (3 or 4 celsius) mom says she cold, I think it's okayish. We pass a puddle of water, kid wanted to play in it. I say No and we move along just fine. 

Edit 2 : when I say No, it is always followed by an explanation. I don't believe in the authoritarian style of parenting 

Heading back home, he wants to go in the puddle and mom says... you get it, yes. He's been playing in the puddle for 4 or 5 minutes. I'm starting to get cold, and if I am, the kid is also.

Edit 1 : it's a private property with a lot of trucks and he wasn't dressed properly (our mistakes) for the temperature.

She's trying to end the activity, but he's having fun. A meltdown occur screaming and kicking. She's trying to talk to him about his emotion, to reason with him. It goes about 2 or 3 minutes. I got to sweep in, pick him up and end this situation that goes nowhere. I'm not happy, it could have been avoided and I feel she undermined my first decision.

Back to an hour ago, I'm trying to explain my point of view. I feel that your undermining my decision. I feel that I always have to be the one ending the meltdown. I feel that I'm the only one here saying No.  Our views on parenting are not so far appart, but me always having to say No is starting to affect my relationship with my kid. She says that she can't start saying No because it would be against what she believe in. I had enough , I told her that she need to start acting like a mother.

She's under the blanket in our room sobbing.

I do feel like an asshole, but am I?

P.s. sorry for bad english, not a native speaker. 
P.p.s. our relationship isn't usually rocky. We've been together for 5 yrs.

Edit 3 : SO is F, not M. Mistake.

[FOLLOW UP] : I apologize for acting childish. She apologize for undermining me. We talked about the situation that require a solid No. She did mention as some of you also did, that we were going back home, so it was in her eyes a different situation. I explain that for me, it was the same puddle, so I wanted to be consistent. We both agree that it would always be follow up with an explanation and be respected by the other party.",355,1070,0.95

616,Not the A-hole,"Ok so when I was a freshman in college I lived with my mom. She ran a small (1-2 kid ) day care that we relied on for income. I was a full time student. I would get financial aid every 3-4 months which I used to pay my half of the rent and groceries (we didn’t pay utilities) plus books and transportation. I didn’t have a job so this money, about 2,500 would have to last until the next aid check came. 

Things were good until my mom got hurt. Our kitchen cabinet quite literally came off the wall and fell on her. It injured her chest,arm, and breast. She had to go to the hospital and eventually stopped working. That left me to take care of us financially. So I got a job and cut back on my classes. 

Also during that time my aunt would give us money every now and then. And my dad would loan us money when things got tight. But we eventually got to a place we’re we were steady financially. My mom after two years she got a settlement and started going to online school which allowed her to apply for financial aid herself. 

Now also during that time I was 19-22. I’d never l had any real financial responsibility and all of a sudden the burden of taking care of us was on me. I had to work for the first time in my life (a whole other story. Retail is hell) and manage my money very carefully or we’d be either without food or late/behind on the rent. My mom didn’t help at all. It suddenly felt like I had a toddler on my hands. She’s demanded an allowance, a significant portion of my financial aid, mostly for cigarettes but I suspect mainly so she didn’t have to ask me for money. She hated the fact that now that I had taken over financially that I had a say in how the money should and would be spent. Whereas before it was her way or no way. She’d always been a control freak and a bully so this new situation really rubbed her the wrong way. She’d always inevitably spend all her allowance before I’d get my next financial aid check (she got hurt in April I didn’t get a job until September) she’s throw tantrums when I’d refuse to give her the money if set aside for books or bills so she could buy cigarettes. She’d take everything she’d ever bought me from my room (my tv, my phone, my tablet) and refuse to give then back until I gave her the money. Is usually just pick up a book and read until she calmed down. ( she told me later that despite how mad she was she just never felt right taking a book from me). 
 
Like I said eventually we were financially stable but from then on until today she never acknowledges that if not for me stepping up we’d have been fucked. She always says it was either my aunt, my dad, or god that got us through but never me. I was apparently just there and did nothing to help. She denies she ever threw tantrums or relied on me for anything. 

So with all that background Redditers here’s my question. AITAb for reminding that I actually did a lot? I don’t expect her to kiss my ass but some kind of acknowledgement for what i did would be nice. At least not acting like I did nothing.",43,32,0.86
617,Not the A-hole,"**BACKSTORY:** My parents have been living in England for around 25 years, more than they've spent in their country. They both fled at the age of 18 and they haven't seen their parents, friends and family for 30 years, so a return to their native country was inevitable.

When I was 13, in the summer of 2017, my (16M) parents took me to their home country for what they said was ""a holiday"". This ""holiday"" turned out to be extended from the duration of the summer to mid-2018. I begged for us to return home and that I'm homesick but they kept on saying ""This IS your home"".

This set me back on everything I had going on back home in England. I was set back academically and life turned from nice & easy to painful & hard. All of a sudden, I was struggling and still am. And I put 100% of the blame on my parents and their stupid decision to keep me there.

So my parents, out of the blue, joked to me about a return to their country and staying there. I didn't like it and vowed that I'm not stepping foot in that place ever again. They got all sad and asked ""Why not?"". I told them straight up what problems I had with it. People there called me a foreigner, I kept on getting stared at, it's a shit place to live in and it practically ruined my life. 

(FUN FACT: They knew about all this)

They were visibly upset and asked if I wouldn't visit even if they were old and decided to live the rest of their lives there. I said ""only for a couple of days."" If my (future) wife and kids wanted to go? I said that that won't happen since they probably would love it better here in England than over there.

They didn't say anything but I could tell I hurt them. Older brother said that I'm being too insensitive and I shouldn't have to be so rude.

618,Not the A-hole,"I am 16 and my sisters are 13 and 10. They keep bringing lice to the house, I guess they get it at school or pass it back and forth between each other; for nearly the last year there has been lice on one or both of them more often than not. 

I've gotten it a few times and it's so hard to get rid of, my hair is thick and curly. My sister's are also so gross, they won't be careful what brushes or hats or scarves they use, they'll lay down on anything, even the shared sofas or sometimes my bed with it. It's fucking nasty. 

My parents get us shampoos and try to comb out my sisters hair, I do the treatment on my own, but it just won't go away. Even now when my sisters aren't even going to school anymore, lice is back and I'm so done. Each time they promise it's gone, it isn't, and I'm so fed up.

I took my dad's hair clippers when the rest of the family had gone for a hike and gave myself a buzz cut, I mainly did it because I am so grossed out by this lice thing.

But I also think that it's gonna be a long time till I'll be seen by anyone; schools cancelled for the year and only restarts in September now. So who cares how I look?

I think I look badass for the record, but I know short hair on women isn't a super common look and a lot of people don't like it.

My parents were so mad, calling me dramatic, impulsive, stupid, etc.

They also found out I put a picture on Instagram saying I'd buzzed my hair, and mentioning it was because I was stuck in a house with sister's who couldn't stop spreading lice, and I'd needed a new look anyway. And they were so mad I was publicly bringing shame to the family's reputation.

They are so mad that I did it because I'm supposed to get a job this summer, whenever businesses open again, and I'm ruining my chance of getting a job with that haircut

621,Not the A-hole,"Back story: 2003 I had two lines of cell service one for my mother and one for me. For 6 months never went over the minutes on the lines. Fast forward a few months my sister moves in and starts to take my mothers line from her and uses it. The next bill comes in and is $600 above the normal fees do to sisters use. I am unable to pay the bill and lose both lines. Some context: a few weeks after my sister goes crazy and commits crimes against both my mother and younger brother, police are called and she ends up arrested. 

Fast Forward to 2007: This is where the story takes place. A year prior I had gotten a cell plan witch included four lines of service, another feature was the plan had roll over minutes that built up for a year. Any unused minutes were saved and used in case I went over and I would pay no extra fees. My brother, mother and I each used a line and the other one just sat around with out use. One night my cousin comes over and I tell him how wonderful my plan is and how I have a crap ton of roll over minutes and even have a extra line sitting around. Cousin wants that extra line, so I think about and say you can have it for $30 a month till all the roll over minutes are used. Cousin takes the phone.

A week later I find out cousin gave the phone to my sister, as soon as I find I make contact with cousin. I tell cousin this isn't happening and he needs to get the phone from sister and return it. Cousin says I am being an a-hole and have no reason not to let sister use the line. I don't like bringing up peoples dirty laundry but had no choice at this point. I tell cousin back in 2003 sister took and used my mothers line of service I was paying for and caused $600 of overages and this isn't going to happen again.

Cousin then say, you are just doing this cause your mother and brother falsely accused sister of committing crimes against them. At this point I am furious and say, you have some nerve making lies up and for your information mother and brother both had evidence after the crimes were committed which police used to convict her. Cousin then says, your mother and brother fabricated the evidence before police arrived and sister told him this so it must be true. At this point I had enough and say, you are delusional cause my mother called me and asked for the police stations phone number and while on the phone with my mother I could hear sister committing these crimes. I tell cousin he has two options give the phone back or I cancel the line. In the end I get the phone back.",20,172,0.89

Now reasonably there's no reason why me and T can't be friends, she's smart, we had the same kind of upbringing, both went through a lot of the same struggles, we both left home at 14. So in reality we should be friends. 

The issue lies in me. I recently had my first kid and while I didn't gain a ton I gained enough weight to have my old eating disorder rear his ugly little head and sink his teeth in. I've been struggling for weeks already to eat enough and not work out too much. It's a constant struggle. 

After hanging out last night I really liked her, but as soon as I got in the shower all I could think about was how much I would need to throw up to look like her.

There have been a couple (what I feel to be important) instances over the last couple years where I felt neglected. I was in the hospital due to surgery complications and he didn't pick up his phone (I'm fine now). He didn't respond to the news of his first grandson until the next day. Today, he wished me a Happy Easter... when my 30th birthday was on Friday and he had said nothing.

So I called him out about how he missed my birthday, but I'm sure he has Easter plans with his new family so don't worry about it. (Super petty, I know.) He replied that he was sorry, but I needed to cut him some slack. I'm tired of being brushed off so I got pushy and he ended the conversation, more or less calling me TA.

For the sake of both sides, he does have good moments. He loves his grandson. When we do talk, he is always expressing how happy he is to hear from me.

He refuses to talk to me about our issues and wants me to just get over it. Maybe I'm expecting too much from someone that owes me nothing? Maybe I'm too old to be whining for dad's attention? AITA???",39,251,0.95
628,Asshole,"So in the past few months my (21M) living situation has changed quite a lot. I moved out of my abusive parents’ house, and when I was moving all my stuff into my friend’s flat, where I now live full time, I brought the family cat along. Although the other members of my family could take care of him, we both liked each other the most so I brought him down.

For context, my girlfriend has some inflammatory conditions that make prone to corneal ulcers. She had one at the start of 2019 and it terrified her as it left her with a corneal scar, so now she’s vigilant about cleaning her eyes and keeping away from triggers. One of which has turned out to be my cat.

Whenever she’s up here she sneezes all night, rubs her eyes and makes a mountain of tissues as she blows her nose every two minutes. She constantly complains of dry, itchy eyes, and even though I’ve recommended antihistamines, she’s tried them and says they don’t do much for her. Since then, she’s begged me to take the cat back up to my dad’s (with whom I still have little contact) as it’s not good for her or the cat. First, her argument for herself is that she doesn’t want to come up anymore because she’s worried about her eyes, and she spends the whole time miserable. She says she can’t even hug me anywhere else because of the cat hair on my clothes will trigger a sneezing fit or irritate her eyes (and he is a long-haired cat so he sheds everywhere). I’ve recommended trying another type of antihistamine, but she refuses.

Her argument for the cat is that this situation isn’t good for the cat. I’ve moved from a house in a secluded council estate to a top floor flat right on two main roads. My cat is very much an outdoor cat, he’s always wanting out to hunt mice and birds. He’s always preferred being outside since he was a kitten. I can’t let him out here as the drop from my window is too high, or let him out the door as he can’t get back in. I don’t want to let him run around because he doesn’t know the area as well as my parents’ area that he’s known all his life, and I’m worried about the roads. He cries to get out at night for hours on end, keeping me up to the point where my uni work is starting to get affected from lack of sleep. My girlfriend is insistent this isn’t a good life for him, although the attempts to train him seem to be doing ok, where he uses the litter box instead of going outside, and I love his company even when it’s just the one room.

My girlfriend is now threatening to stop coming down to my place entirely, which I don’t really want considering we both consider it a safe haven away from her family. She argues that my parents will keep him fed and watered, and he’ll be back in a familiar environment, going out whenever he pleases. But she’s never had a cat herself, and I don’t think she realises it’s not easy to  let go like that, especially when I barely see my family anymore.

630,Asshole,"I (35f) have an unorthodox relationship with my roommate (24m), being that we were FWB and are now co-parents to a very beautiful and healthy 6 m/o (f). I decided to keep our daughter after I found out I was pregnant as I was previously told it was next to impossible for me to conceive with my ex-husband.

We live in a very nice and expensive area that I wouldn’t be able to afford by myself. I needed a place to live after quitting my job and no longer being able to afford my apartment, after telling him he asked me to move in with him. I must admit I was a little uneasy moving in with him at first, but so far everything has been going well. I cook and clean for him whenever he’s at home, which is about 3 days a week, and in return I get to live here rent free and spending money that is equal to my previous wage. We have now been living together for 18 months.

I have access to all the rooms in the house bar the gym. This wasn’t a problem for me as I previously used my local gym with his sister (35f), then I was pregnant, so I didn’t need to go gym. Recently I have decided its time to lose the baby weight and start going to gym again, when I mentioned to him that I would like the access code to the garage he asked why and after telling him I want to use the gym he refused. When I asked him why he said that there’s thousands of dollars of equipment in the gym that he doesn’t want me to use in case I damage it and that its pretty dangerous as he has a lot of car parts and tools lying around, I got pretty mad and kind of shouted at him that when I moved in we agreed I have total access to all rooms but now he’s refusing me access to the garage, its pretty stupid that just he thinks I might damage his equipment even though I’ve been lifting weights way longer than he has and that I can take care of myself. 

I feel kind of conflicted as I know that I’m in the right, but it is his house and I am grateful of the relationship we have and all he’s done for me, but I feel as if all my life I’ve been told no or you can’t do so and so and I thought he was different.

We haven’t spoken about anything other than our daughter for the last week, I haven’t cooked or cleaned for him as well as I feel that if he doesn’t hold up his end, I shouldn’t hold up mine. So far, he is avoiding me and spends most of his time in the garage. His parents and sister and my family and friends are with me on this but say that we’re both being immature and need to find an agreement.

A few weeks ago a mutual friend who I don’t know really well hosted a dinner party and invited me and a couple of our mutual friends. I’m just going to throw it out there but I don’t eat vegetables, yes I’m an adult. I’ve never liked them and growing up my parents never forced me to eat any so I never developed the appetite. 

Fast forward to the dinner party we are all at the table enjoying the meal and I am eating around the vegetables and admiring my hosts garden and she tells me that she grows all her own vegetables and I tell her how cool that is and she looks me in my eyes and says the following “I use my bath water to water the plants” and then she giggles. Everyone at the table look uncomfortable and I asked her if she was joking and she looked puzzled and said no and went on a little rant about not wasting water. Anyway to cut a long story short I called her disgusting and that I didn’t appreciate being fed her bath water veggies (okay I didn’t eat it but she put them on my plate) and that she’s a unhygienic inconsiderate person and that she can’t be trusted to prepare food for people and then I walked out

Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with.

 I have been dating my (33) bf (42) for nearly 4 years. Since we also work together at different levels (he is above me) no one at work knows we are dating. Which I'm cool with, as I also don't want people to gossip and all that. So we are not ""officially"" out as a couple in the workplace.

My family and friends know, but my bf's father don't. I'm often invited at their place (he lives with his father since the mother passed away few years back) and I often spend holidays lunches/dinner there too. As a friend.

My bf refuse to tell his father we are dating, claiming he is too nosy, that he doesn't want to tell him anything, that they don't have a good relationship and all that.
But every time I visit them for lunch or something, they seem very cool, we talk a lot (mainly his father telling stories and all) and bf interacts, laughs...I mean they are normal I don't see that much of a ""bad blood"" between them.

Still he refuses to tell him we are a couple. I told him I'm done with this, don't wanna go to his house anymore without the truth being out there, he thinks I'm over reacting and that ""who cares what he knows"".

Okay so for context I guess, I will explain the layout of my house. My house has 6 bedrooms but is still quite small, there's 2 rooms that are medium size (one of which is mine) and the other is my parents ensuite, the other four rooms are fairly small (can fit a Queen size bed leaving a small strip of walking space).

Alright, now my(f20) sister(f31) has decided that due to current events that she will be moving back home along with her husband (M36?) and her two daughters (2&3) once her lease is up in June, we already have 6 people living in my house so once they move in there will be 10, so it will be completely over crowded. 

Currently only 4 of the 6 bedrooms in my house are being used the other two (smaller sized ones) are used for junk and a gaming room, so obviously i thought that those two spare rooms would become my sisters room and my nieces rooms, well the other day my mum told me that I’m going to have to move rooms so my sister can have the bigger room since she has a king sized bed (I know this is a bullshit excuse and either my sister demanded the bigger room or my mum is just playing favourites)
I straight up told my mum I’m not moving and that I don’t think it’s fair of her to try and make me move to accomodate her other child when there’s already room free for her and just because she has a bigger bed doesn’t entitle her to my room, I also said that if she’s so worried about space she can get a smaller bed or use the double bed she has for her daughters, my mum then said that if I don’t move she will forcibly move my stuff out of my room and that I don’t get a choice and if I don’t like it I can move out (literally can’t move out Rn and she knows that)

I also want to add that I am the youngest of 5 (in this family, long story), so as the youngest I always got last pick of the bedrooms, I waited patiently for YEARS to finally get the big bedroom and I only got it in late 2017 when one of my brothers moved out of home, so it really pisses me off that they’re ripping this away from me when I waited my fucking turn and didn't complain once, especially when I was short changed over ALOT of other things growing up

Anyway back to story, I basically told my mum I'm going to keep fighting her on this and I plan on just not moving my shit out of my room and getting a lock on my door so they can't get in there. 
But I keep wondering am I being petty? Should I just move rooms to accommodate my sister? am I the asshole or is my mum and sister? Lemme know Reddit

INFO: I pay $150 a fortnight in rent

EDIT: for y'all having a sook about calling it my house, I I know I dont own the house it's obviously a ”cultural” difference, everyone I know that still lives with their parents refers to it as their house not their parents house, get the fuck over it 🙃

EDIT: I'm just gonna quickly add about the door know since a lot of people seems pissed about that, I HAVE to get a knew door knob anyway since I accidentally broke the last one, I'm just gonna get one with a lock this time but I'm not just getting it for the purpose of keeping my parents from moving my stuff out, I've had privacy issues here in the past and also so my nieces don't go in my room when I'm not there (for their safety). So regardless of weather I stay in the big room or I move rooms my bedroom door will 100% be having a lock on it. I'm also not the first to get a lock on their door in this house.",159,525,0.94

I (19m) came out as transgender when I was eighth grade. It’s been nearly 6 years. I feel it should be obvious I am not ‘in a phase’. I started going by my preferred name (let’s go with M for the sake of the story) my freshman year of high school, and made it explicitly known to my family in my sophomore year. It wasn’t until the summer after my senior year that my mother FINALLY started calling me the correct name, but I don’t hold it against her, because she went through a LOT to get where she is now. The problem lies in that my cousins (who unfortunately live near me so I cannot just stop seeing$ and grandparents (who are our neighbors) absolutely REFUSE to call me M. Friday I sat my grandmother down and told her she needed to call me by my preferred name (soon to be legal name) and that is it. She made a big deal of “I’ll think about it, but it’s my choice and I don’t know if I will or not.” And then proceeded to absolutely mock the name M. My mother does not push them to call me M, and calls me my deadname to them when she’s speaking to them and I am not around. (Somewhat angering.) I told her I plan to completely cut them from my life if they cannot respect something as simple as my name. She had a fit, saying that they’re old and don’t understand, it wouldn’t be fair to cut them out of my life for that, etc etc. (my other sets of grandparents had no issues calling me by my preferred name, so that’s a load of bs). She ended her rant by telling me that If I cut them off I’ll be the one in the wrong because they’re family, and I can’t just cut off my family. But they’re making me absolutely miserable, and it’s significantly impacting my mental health whenever I’m home from uni.

639,Not the A-hole,"In January, I met my boyfriend (J) at his housemates (K) house party. Long story short: we hit it off and I'm staying at his at the moment. I also work with K.

The other week K came into work and said ""I'm just letting you know I can HEAR you and J when you're talking"". I assumed it was about being too noisy thinking that we need to keep it down. He said no but that he could hear us (more specifically, J) calling him gay... which we didn't. We didn't even talk about him that night. He told me not to tell J because ""he'd just deny it"" but obviously I told J anyway and we just brushed it off as a weird one time thing.

Over that week whenever I go into work I'm hearing how hes talking about us to people saying we're calling him gay. He even texted our boss saying he's going to call the landlord on J for always calling him it.

Fast forward a week, J and I are in his room talking about J's sexual orientation and transsexual people etc. We hear a door slam pretty hard upstairs and then again a minute later. J gets up to go check if everything's okay but the first thing K says when he answers his door is ""I'm not gay bro"" and is immediately defensive and saying things like we always talk about it (we don't) and how its brainwashing him? Things get heated and the argument basically ends after J shouts that he wasn't talking about him, he shouldn't be listening in on our conversations and that he can talk about whatever he likes. I've been locking the bedroom door since then because the situation is just too weird and I  don't trust K at all now.

Yesterday, I get into work as K is leaving. He just tells me he's really not happy with J because he can ""hear our whole conversation"" and I just tell him that J is back at the house if he wants to talk. But K gets home and he's... fine? J said that he even seemed cheerful. 

This is why I think we might be the assholes a little: I don't think K is mentally well. I've known him for just over a year and, despite having lived in the UK for 20+ years he doesn't seem to have integrated well culturally, he's from a islamic country and uses it to justify his own homophobic and sexist views, he does not understand social queues very well,  crosses boundaries all the time and can have massive mood swings where he gets pretty angry. If theres no men around he just gets more and more angry until someone really shouts at him (a girl at work had to do this once) But he's fine as soon as J,  my boss or any other man confronts him.

My question is: are we the assholes for still talking about it knowing he can (to some extent) hear us and aggravating this weird paranoia he seems to have about people thinking he's gay? It's his home and I don't wanna cause any more arguments or make him uncomfortable, even if his views are messed up.",19,50,0.94

642,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together 9 years and married for 3. Sometime after getting engaged and before getting married, we went to the local mall and I picked out a beautiful and affordable ring for us at the time. The issue is not the style or look of the ring, but the materials. Affordable for us at the time meant lower quality metals. To keep the ring nice, it came with instructions not to sleep in it or get it too wet too frequently. The manufacturer of the ring included a warranty that they would replace the ring one time should it get damaged beyond wear. We used that warranty about 1 year after having the ring. 

Nowadays (well, before the current world situation) I'm a preschool teacher. I'm constantly washing my hands and getting sticky, and other not-good-for-the-ring things. Not to mention that I've owned it for years now and worn it regularly. The rose gold tone is wearing off (like it did before replacing) and the metal underneath makes me itchy and turn green. The stones have lost their luster so it looks permanently dirty. All of this means I can't wear it much anymore. 

I found a ring online that was similar in style and made with more quality materials. It is affordable for us (I would be paying for it myself anyway) and I asked my husband about getting it. I told him the issues I have with my current ring being careful not to mention its ""lesser quality"". I tried to explain from a place of ""I'm currently not able to wear my ring frequently and I dont like taking it off"". 

He was less than thrilled. He asked if I wanted to replace all of the jewelry he's gotten for me which is ridiculous. I told him I was looking for an everyday ring and wanted to save the current one for more special occasions. I maybe TA for that because it's not 100% true. If I got this new ring, I dont know that I'd wear my current one anymore. 

I feel like he's blowing this way out of proportion. It's not like I said the original ring was ugly or terrible. I picked it out for fucks sake. I dont think it's crazy to want an upgrade now that we can afford to get one.",71,118,0.95

I (17f) get uncomfortable around my father often as he is very touchy and (in my opinion) often inappropriate. He will often playfully smack my butt if he is walking by me in the house, put his hand on my hip or butt if we are taking a picture, or pat my butt if we are hugging. He also implies that I am sexually involved with all of my male friends. 

I’ve outright said to him that this makes me uncomfortable months ago but he is unrelenting with being touchy so now I just push his hand away or avoid him in the house. 
Now that we are all stuck at home, it’s difficult to avoid him and if I push his hands away or move when he’s close to me he becomes upset, leaves the room and will either not speak to anyone or be rude to other members of the household. 

The very few times I’ve had friends over he’s implied that I am trying to have sex with all of my male friends and it is uncomfortable for everyone involved. 

My mother knows he makes me uncomfortable but thinks it’s my responsibility to make sure he doesn’t get upset and thinks I should put up with it. His presence has made me increasingly anxious and upset for about 4 years and now it’s exacerbated by the current situation.

I also pay for other subscriptions like Amazon and Google Play Music, both of which she uses. We used to have a family account my parents paid for but it only had one screen, so I offered to take over and upgrade it. 

I work strange shifts and the other night I get home about 11pm. All I wanted to do was mong out for an hour with Netflix before going to sleep. I load up Netflix on my TV and pick something to watch. Only an error message comes up saying that my sister's user was logged in twice watching 2 different things. 

I confront her and she tells me that she gave the password to her boyfriend. I'm not happy it turns into a full blown argument. Her boyfriend's family are rather wealthy and could easily afford a subscription of their own and they live nearly 100 miles away from us. I don't necessarily mind him using the account if he chips in to upgrade the screens. But the fact she just gave him the password without asking pissed me off. Especially since I pay for all the other subscriptions that she uses and doesn't contribute to. 

So I changed the password. I only changed one number but it locked her out regardless. My Dad is very much on my side but my Mum is still on the fence.

648,Not the A-hole,"I have two younger cousins, both about ten years younger than me. They were pretty young when our grandmother passed away and I doubt they remember her very well. I on the other hand, had a very good bond with her. 

I was named after her, we shared our first name. This is relevant, because it’s the name of a flower. My grandmother always wore a necklace with that flower made of gold, that had been made for her when she was born. When I was younger I was always envious of it and she promised me I would inherit this necklace from her because I was named after her. 

Only one of my cousins was also named after her, but only as a second name. As I mentioned before, they were quite young when she passed away. 
I did receive the necklace and have worn it proudly every day after she died, I’m very attached to it.

When my aunt’s husband saw the necklace, he immediately got enthusiastic about taking it to a jeweler and getting copies made for his daughters. My aunt thought that was a great idea. 

I was less than excited about it. This necklace is truly one of a kind as it was specifically made for my grandmother when she was born. It was always our thing, and now my uncle wants to get copies made just so that it’s “fair” to my cousins, who don’t even remember her all that well. 

Now, every time I see them for Christmas or Easter I make sure to take the necklace off so that my aunt’s husband isn’t reminded of his idea. After all these years he still hasn’t let it go though. The one time I accidentally forgot to take it off when I saw him, he immediately made a strange comment about it. 

So, long story short: AITA for not wanting to share this necklace with my cousins?

Edit: People make some good points about my necklace not losing the sentimental value if copies were made, and I think they are right, I hadn’t thought about it like that before. 

What mostly bothered me is the fact my uncle never even asked me whether I was okay with it. He just about snatched the necklace out of my hands as it was given to me on my grandma’s deathbed before I had a chance to say anything about it. I know he didn’t mean it like that, but it just felt insensitive to me at the time, and I think that’s why I grew bitter about it.

Edit 2: Damn, this got more attention than I thought it would! Thanks to everyone who shared their thoughts and gave their advice! 
I’m glad it seems most people agree with my sentiment, but from reading the comments that didn’t, I came to the conclusion it would indeed be a nice gesture to share the bond that I had with my grandma with my cousins somehow. I would like to grow closer to them in that way and tell them about our grandma, I bet she would have liked that as well. :)
So while I might not get exact copies made, I think it would be nice to get a copy in a different color, or some type of jewelry with the same type of flower.
I do still think my uncle was a bit weird about it, so I’d be doing it solely for my cousins, not for him.",272,2577,0.96
649,Not the A-hole,"We have been together for many years. I've grown to enjoy many of his hobbies and while I'll never be good at video games or know the Silmarillion like the back of my hand I make a real effort to learn and participate in his interests. We often watch/ play things he enjoys together or he will play/watch while I'm near and I'll talk to him about the game/movie. While I do enjoy these things I wouldn't have much to do with them if it weren't for our relationship.

When it comes to my interests however he makes no effort to learn about them and when I try to share them with him he gets upset. I understand he has very little to no interest in what I like however I don't feel watching a few minutes of videos or a few movies would be that horrible.

Yet he fights tooth and nail to avoid them and shows no interest in them at all. He could not tell you 5 things about my favourite childhood movies yet I can name how many bloody pokémon? 

When we discuss he says he doesn't care if I don't know about things he likes. And that's why he doesn't try to learn about things I like, he doesn't care, it's just who he is. But I do.

What I want to know is, is it unreasonable for me to expect him to make an effort?

TL;DR; My partner says he's not the kind of person that cares about sharing interests. But I am, AITA for wanting him to make an effort?",61,220,0.94

651,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my sister has an affinity for baking and cooking, she’s great at it, all her food tastes awesome and. On the flip side, I’m not a talented baker or cook at all. I can only follow recipes, and most of the time they don’t turn out fantastic. I bake sometimes as a stress relief, and for the joy of making something, but every time I make something, my sister has to make a jab at it. 

I made a pumpkin risotto as meal prep, and my other family members said it smelt amazing, so I was feeling pretty good. Then my sister said ‘Man that looks really weird. Why didn’t you make mushroom risotto, it tastes better.’ and that it ‘looked really greasy’. Well that didn’t stop her from eating it from my container in the fridge.

She asked for one of my fresh baked cookies and when I gave her one, she said that she ‘prefers chewy cookies’ and ‘you overbaked them’. Again, did not stop her from eating them anyway. 

This has been happening for a long time, anytime I make something, she only ever gives cocky criticising comments.

Today, I made meringues, never made them but I just wanted to use my leftover egg whites. They went fine, came out pure white and crispy. My sister was waiting around for me to take them out so she can have one. I left them on the counter to cool (a mistake). 

When I came downstairs a few hours later, as soon as my sister saw me she called out ‘your meringues failed.’ with a smile on her face. Turns out I forgot to put them in an airtight container so they got a bit sticky. 

But I was getting pretty annoyed with her jabs at my baking and her happiness at my mistakes. Here’s how the exchange went down:

Me: Can you stop doing that?  
Her: What?  
Me: Making rude comments about the stuff I bake. You do it with anything I make.  
Her, indignant: I wasn’t doing anything! You’re so sensitive. Right? (to my other family members). 
Me: You shouldn’t say it like that! It’s pretty rude.

And that’s when my whole family jumped in to defend my sister (as usual), saying that I’m too sensitive and it was rude of me to speak to my sister like that.
Am I the asshole?

Each of the cats have bonded with each of us respectively, so it seemed logical to split them with other their respective ‘owners’. My ex is moving from Colorado to Virginia next week and informed me that they would like to take both cats to keep them together yesterday, and I need to make a final decision by Monday.

I love my kitten very much, and really want to keep her. She is very connected with me, she likes my ex but they tend to irritate each other. However, my ex’s kitten is very attached to my kitten, and my ex is an experienced cat owner, so she believes she will provide a better quality of life for my cat. I think my kitten will have similar overall qualities of life with or without her ‘sister’, because she’s more independent and explorative. My ex’s kitten is lazier and, according to my ex, gets anxious when my kitten isn’t in the house.

I had a blow out gap year and I've calmed down, and am now a veggie patch growing, in bed by 10:30 grandma. 

My housemate knows all this. He's got a long history of not really caring about my needs or wants. I've been very vocal about not wanting a party. The Saturday after my birthday (it fell on a Thursday) rolls around, and my parents take me out to dinner. I come back home, happy, well fed, drunk on nice wine and...my housemate has decided to throw a huge surprise party. It's everyone we know, except for a collection of my really close friends (who later told me they didn't go because they knew I'd hate it). There are also a bunch of people who are his friends, and who I barely know. 

The party goes on for HOURS, and even though I retreat to my room around midnight it's so loud I can't get to sleep till 5am. 

The next day, my housemate asked how I enjoyed it and I was honest, and said I really, really didn't want a party, I didn't enjoy it, and I'm pissed off he didn't think of what I would want on my OWN birthday. 

He then called me boring, and said he thought I was hinting that I wanted a party when I said I didn't want one, and that he was trying to be nice. Told me I ""used to be fun"" and he wanted to get me out of my shell again. He drove off to see a fuck buddy and barely helped with the cleaning.

Since living with them I've noticed a few things. Like when my brother cooks he always sets aside some of the leftovers for his boyfriend to have for lunch which means it's off limits even if I want more. He told me after a few days that I had to limit my shower time to under thirty minutes and after I told him I needed extra time because I'm a girl he laughed and said that's a stupid and untrue. He also does his boyfriend's laundry, evening ironing his things. When I asked him to do mine too he said I was grown and could do it myself. Well, if I'm grown so is K.

I hadn't noticed that the bottle was marked with my brother's name or obviously I wouldn't have drank it which I told him. He rolled his eyes at me and told me to pay more attention next time.

658,No A-holes here,"AITA for telling my dad he’s being creepy?
So this happened before the world became weird but I just want to have some perspective on what’s going on here. It’s been bothering me a little bit.

I’m 20. My dad came to visit me in the city where I live. He spent a lot of time talking about his break-up which had happened a few months before. We also discussed my sister, who is 31 and dating a man who is 23 years her senior. We agreed to go to a nice restaurant one night and we were both looking forward to it. I got dressed nicely for the restaurant while my dad wore shorts and sandals with a Hawaiian shirt. This wasn’t the restaurant’s normal look for clientele, but I didn’t say anything because who cared.

We had our meal and it was nice. I didn’t think anything was wrong and it had been a pretty normal dinner. Then he said, “I think everyone was glaring at me because they thought we were on a date.”

I thought this was a kind of creepy thing to say and gently told him so, that they were probably just judging him for dressing so casually. I was really creeped out that the thought would even cross his mind. I’m 21 and I look younger than I am, like 13-16 according to most estimates.

My dad and I got into a big fight the next day when he kept talking to me about his relationship and his tinder activity. I told him I felt like he wasn’t respecting appropriate boundaries between a parent and child. When I try to have conversations with him about things like this, he interrupts me and says, “fine, then I won’t talk to you about anything” and sulks until I apologize. 

AITA for telling my dad that it was a creepy thought to have? It felt like a gross, creepy thought to cross his mind and it made me really uncomfortable. On the other hand, I recognize that it might just have been on his mind after hearing the news about my sister.",38,73,0.9

To get to the shower, I have to walk up the stairs and through the living room. Each time I have a shower, I wrap myself in a towel and walk through the living room to go downstairs. It’s a bath sheet, it covers everything down to my knees. The only thing really showing is my shoulders.  My Dad has said things a couple of times but I didn’t know it was a real issue. Today I was walking through the living room after my shower and he glared at me. I asked what was wrong and he said, “I guess I don’t have naked women in my house very often.” I said I wasn’t naked and I have worn dresses and other outfits more revealing than a towel. He just scoffed at me.

I can’t really get a bathrobe now. But too be honest I don’t really like them, and I don’t see why I should have to get one when a towel is really sufficient for a 5-sec walk through the living room. I never do it in front of company or anything. I guess I could get dressed in the bathroom but I like to lounge a bit and do skincare and hair care in my room before getting dressed.

661,Not the A-hole,"My parents divorced when I was young and my relationship with my dad has always been distant. Shortly before the incident in question occurred, my dad asked me what my intentions were with my then girlfriend (now wife). He suggested in no uncertain terms that I should wait to have children (I was 23 at the time), saying that he wished he had waited longer before having me (in his 30’s) so that he could enjoy more of life before settling down.

Shortly thereafter, my girlfriend and I were surprised but delighted to discover we were expecting a child. I texted my dad the news - a perhaps unceremonious method of communication given the circumstances but not out of the norm for our relationship - and he didn’t respond. I texted him again the next day and he responded this time, admitting that he initially didn’t know what to say. Not wanting to subject my child to the same uncertain relationship I had with my dad, I responded that he should let me know when he is interested in caring. It was an emotional albeit, in my opinion, necessary plea for him to let me know when he was committed to being involved in his son’s and grandchild’s lives.

In the next few months, my girlfriend and I would get married and have our wonderful child without again hearing from my dad. I didn’t initiate any contact, including inviting him to the wedding or letting him know of the birth of his grandchild. Some nine months after last speaking to my dad, he sent me a package in the mail of old duplicate photos of me with a short note saying that he thought I might want them.

I then go to answer the ringing phone to place them on hold so I can service the next person at the counter when she yells out ‘actually can I have a bag?’ Because everyone else is busy getting deliveries or making pizza I grab a bag, open it, and hand it to her over the counter where she’s standing.

My brother is currently getting his masters with plans to go on to pursue his PhD. I got an entry level job in biotechnology research because I'm still unsure about what I want my career to be.

&#x200B;

My relationship with my parents is rocky at best and a lot of it stems from the fact that I feel my parents have always favored my brother over me. It's hard to explain why I feel they favor him more (because I'm sure my parents aren't intentionally trying to) but it has been building up since we were kids. It's just always felt that they're more proud of him and his accomplishments. Trying to explain that I feel they favor him more always starts a really emotionally charged fight that is never resolved. I am also aware that I have a certain level of bias or jealously that could be swaying my perspective.

&#x200B;

This situation has really only deteriorated since moving home- and especially under the new stay at home orders. I'm working full time remotely and my brother is doing his classes online. Tension is high and my parents and I keep having fights about how I ""don't do anything to contribute to the family"". My parents accuse me of being self centered because I don't do things like cook dinner for the whole family or contribute anything of value. Which to me isn't true. Despite working I do some shopping for the house and I also clean about 2-3 times a week along with daily things like cleaning up my own clutter, doing my laundry, keeping my room neat, and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces . Meanwhile my brother spends his days locked in his room not helping out really at all. He doesn't clean our shared bathroom or any shared spaces in the house.He hasn't even taken out the trash once since the stay at home orders. But my parent's have never nagged him about his lack of contribution. 

&#x200B;

This brings me to my original question.My parents are angry that I don't contribute enough or spend time with the family and have said they are going to start charging me rent but they won't be charging my brother. They want to charge me rent at market value, and because we live in the bay area, its steep. I only recently got hired full time at my company and I may not even have this job if the economy continues the way it is. So they would essentially be taking a majority of my paycheck every month. Their justification is that because my brother is in school he doesn't need to but because I work I should pay up. To me this is just an even stronger indication of their favoritism. And now it feels like its been taken even farther and they're saying that the path my brother chose is ""better"" or more worthwhile than what I am choosing to do. This whole conversation sparked a heated fight and I've been feeling guilty and like I am an ungrateful daughter ever since.

Over the years I've heard of D acquiring multiple diagnoses of mental illness. He definitely has ADHD, and was diagnosed schizophrenic, but that diagnosis was apparently abandoned in favor of Bipolar. He's had substance abuse issues in the past as well. 

Ex and I are now long-divorced. Our youngest daughter is 16 and alternates weeks between our two households. Ex and his wife are home with my daughter 24/7 currently.

A month ago his partner moved in, right before everyone had to stay inside. We were fine with it even though it was a tight squeeze. But a few days after she moved in they were both complaining about how small their room is and ""joking"" about how I should help them out and swap with them. The first couple of times I joked along going ""hahah nice try"" etc, trying to keep light hearted. But over the weeks their ""jokes"" have moved to insistence. They don't have any space apart from each other and we have to hear them fighting.

Today they both confronted me, saying that I have to swap rooms with them because it's not fair that I have so much more space than they do combined. I reminded them that when they moved in they were fine with the arrangement and it's their fault that they didn't think it through. They were PISSED and started yelling at me.

 Fiancé hasn’t been able to get a temporary job, therefore I believe at the very least his job, for the time being, is to keep our place in order and clean. He says it’s both our job.

 I’ve pretty much have gone through every possible pregnancy symptom, and there is not one day of complete peace, once one symptom finally goes away another pops up to replace it. I believe he is being selfish, that he truly doesn’t understand what I’m going through. 

 Why is so difficult to keep our place clean, even when it comes to cooking, I HAVE to help him. I get off work and I still can’t relax. Meanwhile when I’m at work I’m sure he is online playing video games with his friends. It’s so infuriating.

 It’s come to me constantly snapping at him because he is in his care free world. According to him I’m an asshole, just because I’m working everyday and pregnant doesn’t mean I can’t help him clean.

Update: We are both hard headed. I take things more seriously and he is the laid back one, so I knew we couldn’t have this conversation in person. I gave him a quick text that we had to “talk” but seeing how we both are we had to do it through text in order to remain calm and as stress free as possible.

He was extremely apologetic, once we were face to face he said that he became emotional with how I described my pregnancy. He apologized for not taking me seriously when I would tell him what I was going through and seeing all there in text hit him. 

I’m hopeful. Thank you everyone. I was starting to feel like a was a complete ass, not only for this but pretty much everything I thought I was “right” on. Not that I’m always right, I have my faults. Our engagement thankfully has been extended due to baby, no rush in getting married here. We definitely have some work to do on how to properly communicate. 

And no I don’t regret my baby, ever. She is a miracle and he is a great father (two kids from a previous relationship, and they are amazing loving kids).",104,464,0.94

I''m an account manager for restaurant audit servicing companies, and my project load has been cut down to almost nothing.  I'm literally pulling projects out of thin air to stay busy. My boss emailed me on Thusday a few weeks ago at midnight, asking what I had gotten done that week. I gave him a list, told him that Wednesday was a tough day for my daughter, and she was home with me, so I didn't get much done. He thanked me for my honesty but docked me half a day of pay. He owns the company so there's not much I can do.

That was enough to motivate me to do the bare minimum and start networking to secure a new job once this is over. Maybe I'm overreacting, but that really rubbed me the wrong way, especially since I was incredibly transparent about having my daughter home with me during this time, and they assured me it wouldn't be an issue.

We don’t live in an area where oranges grow, so clearly someone dropped or threw it out of their car. Over the protests of my Mom, he picked it up and brought it home because it’s a “perfectly good” orange. My Mom was upset about this but didn’t want to confront him, instead talked to me about how she’s worried about bugs and fruit flies and also the orange is gross. Which I agreed with. My brother, my Mom, and I all separately talked to him about how the orange is gross, he got angry and said, “that’s a perfectly good orange, if you don’t want it you don’t have to eat it.” 

Two days after he picked it up, I walked into the kitchen. And saw it in the fruit bowl with all the good fruit. He keeps picking it up and putting it in the fruit bowl when I remove it. I saw that it was turning brown and I touched it and it was mushy. I couldn’t take it anymore and I threw that fucking thing down the garbage disposal. 

I got an earful from my Dad, who was furious. I also got an earful from my Mom and my brother for making him furious when we’re all trapped together, and it’s just an orange.

She wants me to let her know if I’m inviting more than one person into her “safe space”. She says she gets “overwhelmed” if I suddenly force social interaction on her without warning.

683,Not the A-hole,"I feel really bad about this but I couldn't take it.

Basically, I (17f) have known my friend (17f) since we were three. However, her family moved away when we were seven, but we've kept in touch. We don't get to see each other in person often (maybe once every two years) but we both talk regularly and try to facetime once every two weeks.

Since we've turned 16 though, we've both sort of got different lifestyles. She goes to parties, hooks up with boys and chooses to eat out more than in, while I've gotten into fitness, prefer to eat at home and attend social gatherings less often. And this is fine! Everyone likes different things!

Last year was a very bad year for me school wise. I really struggled with focusing, and fell into a bit of a depression. My friend wasn't doing too well in school either. We decided to help each other through the next year so we could both attend our dream school.

I worked my ass off in chemistry, my worst subject. I did nothing but school, extracurriculars and home for four months (I'd call my friends on the phone for fun). My friend went out to parties, and was still struggling. I started tutoring her on facetime for calculus and biology. I did my best not t talk about my own successes in front of her because I knew that sometimes it made her upset. When we were calling, school came up. I mentioned that I was proud of my progress. in chemistry, as I had went from a 54% average in junior year to a 97% for senior year.

My friend blew up on me. She said that she couldn't stand how perfect I was, how her parents always compared her to me. I was shocked. This was the first time I had heard about this.

She said she deserved to go to the school more than I did, and that her problems were worse than mine, etc. I got pissed off at this point, and in a moment of anger I told her that it wasn't my fault she chose to blow off her extracurriculars and go to parties instead of apply herself, and that it isn't my fault she doesn't have the discipline I have.

I felt bad as soon as I hung up, because her problems last year were objectively more difficult than mine to deal with. But at the same time, I feel justified in my anger because I worked hard.

AITA? Looking for unbiased perspectives.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments. I would like to address the notion that I come off as judgy in this post. I apologize for that, that isn't my intended tone. As for the people suggesting I feel that my friend is a fuck-up, I don't understand how that conclusion was drawn - why would I spend time tutoring, talking to and keeping in touch with someone who I could easily ""drop"" if I thought they were a fuck-up? I understand that strangers on the internet cannot see the friendship we've shared and the things we've helped each other through, but I don't think it is fair to make such conclusions about my personality.

My friend and I have called and spoken, and we had a heartfelt conversation. She apologized to me because she said it wasn't fair to blow up on me for something that isn't my fault, and I apologized for kicking her while she was down. She's looking into starting therapy once she turns 18, which is soon, and has recently gotten acceptance to the college near our university - where she will be eligible to transfer if she keeps up a certain grade point average. She's asked me for tips regarding self discipline, and finding work-life balance, and we had a heart to heart about being honest with each other regarding jealousy.

I have some health issues that could put me in a deep hole quick. I reached out to my Grandma and asked if I could maybe have an early inheritance because I need to still be able to make mortgage payments on my Condo I bought 3 years ago (it’s only worth $45k so not an amazing place but cheaper than renting). She replied back thinking I was my sister that’s she’s already helped me. I accidentally found out my Mom and Grandma gave my sister $50k to get out of debt last year. My sister makes almost 2x as me a year. My mom found out and my Grandma and Mom said no that there wasn’t any money left to help me and that she’s helped me and my sister. (My grandma gave me 4K to help with the down payment on my place). I also found out my Mom bought my step brother a nice house. 

When I confronted my Mom about this family secret she said every kid is different and gets treated differently. I was like yeah but that’s a huge difference. How does a step kid that came into the family at 17 get a house and my sister gets out of debt and I could be losing my job and be told nah sorry there’s nothing for you? My mom was super angry when I said it’s no wonder I don’t have a great relationship with family when there are secrets like this. 

I don’t get along well with my Mom because she is basically a Christian nationalist and I’m agnostic. And when we talk she talks about the end times and all that drama. She basically told me I need to rely on God for help. I said I’d hope I could rely on the family god gave me. :/

My sister said yeah it isn’t fair but she’s happy she doesn’t have to have this secret anymore but didn’t really go to bat for me. She said the money comes with strings I wouldn’t want. Idk what she meant by that. I assume something to do with religion or lifestyle. She is agnostic too but pretends to be whatever for our Mom in the moment.

Edit, okay I guess I didn’t realize so many people treated their kids this differently. I don’t feel entitled to their money, it’s okay that they said no. I don’t care that they helped out my sister. I thinks is good that they helped her. I’m surprised at the difference in treatment. Part of the reason my Mother and I have such an tough relationship is she can’t accept me for who I am. I’m just agnostic and that’s it. I don’t argue with her about religion I just choose not to engage in the topic. I call almost everyday and text daily. I just have to keep it very light. I help her with all her Tech problems since that’s my line of work. Which is often.

Edit, more history of My mom and I’s relationship growing up. When I was growing up she was abusive and would control food in the house and make my sister and I pay for making phone calls, gas, car insurance, buy all of our own clothes. Pretty much gave us a place to live but we had to ask permission to use the TV or phone. My mom didn’t/doesn’t work.

My sister and I started working at 15 getting paid under the table at a restaurant because we had to buy our own gas to drive.

So, back in June I signed up for a 4- bedroom apartment with random roommates. Only two other people ended up signing for it also, we’ll call them Sara and Jean. We’re all in college, also.

So one day Sara asks us if we’re okay with her making a spare key for her boyfriend. Her reason is because he’ll be visiting on weekends, but don’t get off his job until like midnight, so he wouldn’t get to our apartment until like 2/3am Our school is about two hours from where he lives). Jean says yeah, no problem she doesn’t care. I immediately say no, because this is my first day meeting her and I’ve never even met this guy before. I tell her maybe after I’ve met him a few times and we’ve all lived together a bit longer we can talk about it again.  Sara tells me she respects my decision, it’s totally fine, and we can revisit it later and they’ll figure something out.

Well Sara ended up moving out towards the end of the semester and transferring schools. After this, I find out she actually made her boyfriend a spare key and gave it to him anyway. I was PISSED and expressed this when she came to pick up her stuff and it became a big deal. I requested the company change the locks to our apartment. Jean stayed out of it for the most part, but she knew about the key thing, and a few of my friends have said it’s not that big of a deal and I should’ve just said yes to the key anyway.

So, AITA at being pissed? Should I have said yes to the key?",48,47,0.9
689,Not the A-hole,"I (24f) am an expectant mother of triplets and recently widowed. My late husband passed away at 28 suddenly 2 months after we found out I was pregnant. I can honestly say he was the love of my life and it devastated me losing him. He was the kindest, loving, most compassionate man I've ever met.

My inlaws though are a different story. My late husband came from money whereas I didn't, they were harshly judgmental from day one because I come from a very poor background and was working a minimum wage job while supporting my siblings and parents. In their minds, I was some gold-digging whore. They had even gone as far as to suggest that our children aren't his. I did everything to assuage their fears to no avail even insisting we signed a prenup before we got married. To put it frankly these people if they even acknowledge my existence are cold and extremely passive-aggressive. 

When my husband passed they tried to blame me for the accident (I wasn't even there), they tried to contest his will that named myself and his children as beneficiaries, they even tried to usurp his funeral and steamroll me into accepting what they wanted. But oddly enough in spite of the actions they say they want to be involved in their grandchildren's lives and that family is the most important thing.

The only saving grace through all of this has been my late husband's sister who has tried to keep the peace. She insists her parents are just grieving and they will come around especially after our children are born. I've told her I do not think that I want them involved especially if they are going to continually bad mouth me.

As spouse was going to bed (before I fell asleep, still working on computer) spouse asked me to wake them up for breakfast so we could all (w/4 year old) have breakfast together. I said OK, and said just so you know it will be early, you may be tired. Spouse said OK. In morning approx 9AM, 4 year old made breakfast (cereal, 4 year old is very into making breakfast for everyone) and then went to spouse's room to wake them up. 4 year old came back saying spouse gave them a 'thumbs up' when 4 year old said it was time to wake up. We started eating breakfast thinking they would be out shortly. Finished breakfast (again, it is cereal, which takes approximately 12 seconds to eat). Get dressed to go play outside, and I tell spouse their breakfast is waiting for them on the table. Spouse is immediately enraged that they missed breakfast, asking why I did not come and make sure they were awake so they didn't miss it. I said, ""that's on you, child woke you up, you need to know that 4 year old needs breakfast right away in the morning or they get hangry"". Spouse calls me some names and says I'm heartless for not realizing they were still asleep and needed to be woken up again, and how unfair it is that they missed breakfast. I feel I am right and NTA because spouse needs to be an adult and doesn't need to be woken up multiple times like a child. Spouse obviously thinks I am TA. We went to go play outside. Spouse slept basically the rest of the day. When I popped in to see if they wanted me to wake them up so they could actually fall asleep at a normal time that  night, spouse told me to go away, clearly still mad.

More context that makes me feel like I am extra not the asshole, even though spouse thinks I am:

Spouse is stay at home parent under normal circumstances. Because of working from home and no childcare, I am basically stay at home parent during the day now and I work all night because I need to get work done from home, but can't because of constant daytime interruptions and childcare needs. I get 5 hours of sleep a night max and literally do everything else that needs to be done (housework, pay bills etc.). Spouse plays video games almost all day, plays with our child maybe 1-2 hours a day, and regularly sleeps 12 hours. If spouse cannot wake themselves up one morning to eat breakfast with us, that is their problem, I think.

Some weeks ago I had to take my cat to a follow-up vet appointment to check on some pretty big scary surgery. 

Unfortunately my car wasn't working so I had to get a ride from an app similar to Uber. I'd done this before for an earlier vet appointment, so I thought it was no biggy. 

Firstly the driver was 15mins late, which was annoying but I acknowledge traffic is a factor beyond  control. When he finally shows up, he then refused to  let me in the car - because he's scared of animals. At this point the cat is in a solid plastic carrier with a towel over it, he can't see or be seen by the outside world.

At this point I'm going to be late for the appointment and get charged a cancellation fee (it's a specialist hospital, which was in the address so maybe should have been an indicator to the driver before accepting the ride). I tell the guy I'm really not impressed after trying to persuade him and he leaves. 

I manage to get a taxi last minute for a lot more money, but we get there with 2 mins to spare. I then call customer service to let them know about his refusal, and they say they'll feed it back. 


AITA fit reporting this guy and not giving a shit about his phobia..? I get that it's a legit issue but if it stops you from doing your job I'm less sympathetic.

I tried to explain it because we have more people and we got 5g first because we’re a big city. She did tried to argue with me about this, pulling up more and more Facebook videos. For reference, she got pregnant after highschool and never went to college and I’m studying biology so I clearly know what the fuck I’m talking about! Eventually I didn’t want to argue because she’s clearly a moron but I’m worried about my niece getting sick so when she went to the bathroom, I went on her computer and blocked as many conspiracy pages as I could. I downloaded the website blocker and blocked her favorite conspiracy sites and made it redirect to the cdc website.

702,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been married for 5 years to my husband. He came from a pretty dire financial background but he’s got a heart of gold. currently we are living in my mum and dads second home which only has 2 bedrooms while we try and save up money to pay off credit cards, debts, save for a deposit on a house etc. Obviously this means we are under a lot of stress for most of the time let alone under current circumstances. 

One bedroom is for the children and one bedroom is for hubby and I, but the house is frankly too small for everybody and we are all getting under each other’s feet since we’re all home basically 24/7. They’re living with us full time and have been since the 17th of March for the moment. This has been a big adjustment for me considering they used to stay once or twice a week but I’m glad they’re here and it’s a nice insight into what our future might look like when we get a bigger place. 

One of my guilty secret pleasures is I buy a lot of bath bombs, and bubble bars. They’re not financially the ‘best’ thing for me to buy, but while my hubby might unwind with a nice red wine, I’ll unwind with this. 

It’s also sort of hard because I’m adjusting to doing a *lot* more housework even though hubby is doing his fair share, I feel like I’m always in the bloody kitchen doing the dishes or clearing up etc. The kids are generally a bit slobbish but that’s a conversation I’ve had privately with hubby and he has agreed to be a lot more strict with the kids and I’ve seen Improvements, but the reason why I mention it is because my baths are sort of a sanity thing for me and I really look forward to them every night. 

The kids have recently found my secret stash which is quite upsetting because they weren’t meant to be rifling through ‘my’ bathroom drawer to begin with (it has my personal items in there) and they obviously discovered the bath bombs. 

They’ve been begging to use them and I hate that I keep saying no, they’re mine and for my use not the children’s. 

I purchased some bubble Bath from Tesco, just the cheap and cheerful stuff, but obviously it’s not as fun and they keep asking for my bubble bars. I can’t go and buy them any since the shop that sells them are shut and I’m not going out unless I *really* have to. 

My husband thinks I’m being a bit of an arsehole and that I should share them, and has pointed out that I’m showing favouritism because if he asked for a bath bomb I’d probably give him one. I didn’t really know what to say to that so I’m wondering if IATA here?",219,892,0.95

707,No A-holes here,"Myself (28m) and my gf Haley (23f) have been together for 2 years, live together, and have an amazing relationship. However, we come from very different families. Her family is pretty traditional, everyone marries, settles down, then has kids. (not to say she firmly believes this is the ""right"" thing to do, though. She had a pretty fucked up childhood, if that's at all relevant). My family is extremely blended, with many divorces and teen pregnancies and kids with various partners. Haley has always gotten along really well with my family, they love her and vice versa. She has always accepted the way my family is, but something happened this morning to make me think otherwise.

My cousin Jared (23m) and his girlfriend Amy (22f) just had a baby boy September 2019. I should also add that his younger sister, my cousin Shania (21f), has 2 boys with two different guys. My girlfriend loves these kids dearly and spoils them. So when Jared called this morning to tell me that he and gf are having another baby, I was surprised when Haley responded with a stone face and said nothing. I asked her why she didn't seem happy for them and she said: ""Jared still owes your grandma thousands of dollars right?"". I said yeah. ""And Amy is still waitressing? And smoking?"" (they both smoke cigarettes) I said yeah. She just said K and continued making breakfast. I asked her what that was supposed to mean. She got really agitated all of a sudden and snapped back with ""I'm sorry, I love your family but sometimes their stupid fucking decisions get under my skin. I just hate seeing kids keep having have kids"" then went on to bring up other things about my family having lots of dogs and not training them properly and swearing in front of the kids and how none of my cousins have proper jobs to support their kids and dump them off with grandma all the time and live in trailers. She had NEVER expressed any of this before and I was shocked; it made it seem like she sees my family as inferior and trailer trash.

I've been reflecting on the things she said and yeah, they are true. I guess I've always just seen my family as normal because I'm the son of a teen mom myself. She approached me a couple hours later and said sorry, and that she just really believes that people shouldn't take having babies lightly because her parents had major unsolved issues throughout her childhood, which stick with her to this day. I accepted her apology, but I still feel hurt and bitter about what she said about my family. AITA?

UPDATE: 

To answer a couple questions: Amy did smoke throughout her pregnancy. Haley has been in therapy for her own traumas for a couple of years now.

So Haley and I had another talk, and we feel as though the situation is resolved. Btw, she does not know about this post. A lot of you guys really hit the nail on the head. On her side of our convo, Haley said she doesn't look down upon my family (and honestly, she's just not that kind of person), she just gets frustrated sometimes watching the kids have to grow up in environments that are not ideal for them. She's emotionally attached to my family (and really, really loves the dogs, haha), and the reason she got so heated was because she cares. Something she said verbatim was ""it's not like I've been carrying around this giant resentment for them, I love them, today it just hit too hard"".

On my end, I now understand where she's coming from. You guys helped bring me a lot more clarity on that. I guess I was in denial about my family, and I feel like I was being a bit of an ignorant baby about the situation. Quarantine is making me a little weird, man. Just because they're my family and I love them doesn't mean I have to celebrate and turn a blind eye their poor decisions. I've realized it also doesn't mean that she was attacking them by expressing her issue with their decisions. Special shout-out to u/conditionalinterest \- thank you for your time and caring response. Your comment is very important.

708,No A-holes here,"For the context, i’m 17F

Last year, i went to the USA for an exchange year. It was one of the best years of my life, i quite enjoyed it, but I had to return back to my home country early. Obviously, i was sad to have to leave my host family, as well as all my friends and teachers there. 

Since i got home, i noticed that i am more irritated at the sounds, and just being close to that many people at the same time.(always 3). I think a part of this is because, in America, i had the luck to be hosted by a considerably wealthy family, at least in comparison to my life. There, i had my own room, a lot bigger than one i have at home plus my own bathroom. I would spend most of my days alone, and everything was quiet and peaceful. They didn’t have any other children so most of the time, the house was empty and quiet. I feel like i have gotten used to this and now when i came back to a loud, smaller place it’s just hard.

So, naturally i spend quite some time in my room(another reason for this is because i am literally went home a few days ago, so i am at risk because i was at 4 different airports)

My mom however is not happy with this. She constantly makes comments about it like “You like them more than us” or “This is not America anymore, you have to spend time with us”. But, even when i do, she doesn’t know what to talk about or doesn’t want to, so she just looks at her phone. She’s addicted to her phone, but as soon as i want to leave the room, she says “where are you going? Sit with me” and proceeds not to talk to me. 

Am i wrong for simply wanting to be alone ?",10,92,0.92

She likes making dinner into a whole production. Like baking bread from scratch and cooking in bulk so we can freeze that food for later. 

I, on the other hand, tend to go simpler. I'll cook up a steak and roasted veggies, or maybe a light soup and some croutons. Last night I was really tired so I defrosted some of the soup we weren't saving for anything and cooked up some sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches.  

I thought it was nice but mom got really pissed and told me I was lazy for not coming up with something new. She said that she goes through all of this work on her nights to put together a nice dinner for us but I can only do the bare minimum for her.

I tried to argue that we don't need to make something new every time if we have leftovers, but she kept raising her voice. I then said, ""if you don't want to use what you freeze then stop making so much damned food!""

712,Not the A-hole,"I’m (23F) the youngest in my family with two older sisters, A (27F) and M (26F). In general, I’ve always felt my sisters were raised differently than me. They’re only a year and ten months apart, so they were only one grade apart in school and much closer than they were with me growing up. They got to do all the same activities together, hung out with the same friend groups, and got to travel together once they were both in college. However, I was just the ‘little sister’ that they didn’t want around growing up. For instance, I was literally kicked out of the house during M’s 16th birthday because I was still in middle school and they thought it’d be weird if I was there at the party (still had to clean up their mess when the party was over!). 

Anyway, my sisters got to do a lot of cool activities that I didn’t get to do when I was growing up. They got to do ice skating, horseback riding lessons, all these cool summer camps, etc. Growing up, all I did was sit at their lessons and wait for them to be over. The only activity I had was tennis for a year and a half before my parents canceled it. When my sisters left for college, my parents kind of checked out and didn’t really care I was still in high school. I was pretty much just doing everything on my own. When they got older, my dad bought A three cars (over the course of 5 years) and my mom bought M a car. When I was old enough to drive, my parents said they didn’t have enough money to buy me a car, so I had to finance my first car. My parents even helped them out with rent during college, car insurance, and any other expense. However, I have been pretty much supporting myself since I was 17. 

Today, my sisters are both married with kids. A has two kids and M has one. My mom looks after all the kids while my sisters are working. Meanwhile, I’m in grad school very far away from my family. Anyway, my mom has been complaining how she can’t handle watching 3 kids under the age of 2 at the same time, and has been bugging me to quit school to come help out watching the kids, which pissed me off because it feels like it’s just me revolving my life around my sisters again. She was also pointing out how A has saved up enough money to buy a house which they don’t see me doing at  her age cause I haven’t been saving as much as her (A was living at home until 3 months ago and didn’t pay for anything).That’s when I pretty much snapped and told her that maybe if they treated me equally as them financially, then perhaps I’d be buying a house at 27 as well. She started going on about how it was difficult raising 3 kids, and I told her that she shouldn’t have 3 kids if she couldn’t handle it and treat all 3 equally. My mom got really upset and hung up the phone and hasn’t really reached out to me since. I do feel kind of bad now though because they did provide me food and shelter growing up.",1369,21002,0.95

He will eat the plain shredded cheese out of the bag, often as I am plating our meal. This drives me insane for multiple reasons. One, I use that cheese to cook with, when he snacks and finishes it, I won’t know and not have it for what I need. I expect the cheese to be in the fridge so it is very annoying when it is just not. Two, we have little single servings of cheese! The individual wrapped cheddar and string cheese, and plenty of it! Yet he will still just eat shredded cheese out of the bag. Three, it really happens so often when our dinner is finished cooking! I wouldn’t be near as annoyed if it was still going to take 20-30 mins, fine! Grab a snack! 

I plan our meals for a whole month, and try and keep grocery shopping to only once every two weeks and it making me nuts to expect ingredients in the fridge and then they are not! 
So Reddit, am I justified in my annoyance? AITA for blowing up about it?


Edit for some clarification: 

1st- I buy so much cheese! The 5lb bag of shredded cheese won’t last 2 weeks. We I am not getting upset over a tiny bag not lasting. However I do see the er in communication because perhaps when I see a small amount left, I think this will be perfect for what I planned on cooking tomorrow and he thinks wow I should just kill off this bag

2nd- I am not contemplating divorce over this, it’s annoying and I wanted insight. I completely agree and understand this is mostly silly. However there is not a deeper meaning... I just pointed out I was the person doing the majority of the cooking and planning because I expect the ingredients to be ready for me to use, as I am the one that cooks.

When we got together I told him I had a cat, and he said he didn’t like cats but since then whenever he’s over he pets her and will even bring her toys and treats and he cuddles her and calls her into sleep with us when he sleeps over. I assumed he liked her and we never discussed her leaving. 


A few days ago while talking about him moving in he asked what I was gonna do with Morwen and I asked him what he meant and he said “Well if I’m moving in we’re not having a cat. I told you I don’t like them.” I told him I wasn’t rehoming Morwen and he said “If you want to move in with you we all have to make sacrifices. I’m transferring jobs and moving an hour away.” 

I told him I wasn’t willing to rehome my cat and it wasnt up for discussion and he essentially told me then we weren’t moving in together and that he couldn’t believe I would choose a cat over him and hung up.

So my friend and I have this history of making fun of each other. We both know it’s light spirited and laugh about it. It has never gotten super serious. 

Over the past winter, this friend and I went skiing. This was her first time and stuck to the bunnyhills. I haven’t been skiing long, but graduated to the Blue Squares. I saw that my friend was doing really good. Took turns where she wanted to turn, stopped when she wanted to stop. She seemed like a natural.  Anyways, long story short, I told her not to “pussy out” (I’m a guy btw) and try the Green Circle. Again, joking around is what we do. So she tried it but ended up taking a bad fall, twisted her leg, and tore her ACL. She JUST got surgery and said she won’t ski again. So the conversation went like this:

Me: Why won’t you ski? It’s sooo fun! You did a good job last time. 

Her: Bro, I got jacked up and my leg will never be the same... I’m super depressed because I’m sedentary at home... i can’t do what I want to do... (yadayadayada she just went on about being hurt)

Me: Oh, well, you’re already depressed so why would it matter if you get hurt again? (And I added a laugh to lighten it up)

Her: Dude not f***ing funny. Listen, I know we’ve joked around in the past about each other but I can’t do it anymore. Can we not do this from now on? If not, then let’s take a friend break. 

Honestly, I’m hurt that she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. All I was trying to do was lighten the mood. I felt like she was being a little over sensitive and given our history, it should be expected.

720,Not the A-hole,"So I (34M) am currently in a dilemma where my mom (62) has to leave her place due to her tenancy running out and she has basically expected me and my siblings to be one of us to take her in. I have an older half sister Claire (44), a full brother Frank (35) and a younger full sister Daisy (31).

Some context. Claire was given up for adoption as my mom was 18. They reconnected later in life, but my mom has always blamed Claire for being up for adoption even though it literally wasn’t her fault. My mom is a typical narcissist and this has been prominent in my childhood and to my other 2 siblings. She constantly made everything about her, always pointed out our faults, was pretty much emotionally abusive and it’s led to us all having relationships of distance with her. Claire was an adult when she and my mom developed a relationship, but my mom pulled the same shit on her.

Anyway, the four of us as siblings are pretty tight and we only talk to our mom on dire occasions, so we can go months without talking to her. Recently, she got in contact via our uncle (her brother) who told us about her tenancy. She had been given a very long notice period (before everybody has to stay inside etc) to find another place. I initially thought she had been looking, but turns out she refused and just expected one of my siblings and I to take her in.  

She did a typical narc move by trying to emotionally manipulate and guilt us by staying stuff like “oh but I’m old”, “I’m your mom” and “I have nowhere to go.” It didn’t work and we all angrily told her that she had plenty of time to find a new place and we have no obligations to take her in. Claire has 2 kids, Frank has 3 kids, I have 2 kids and Daisy has 1 and we’ve all collectively agreed we don’t want our kids exposed to our toxic mom. They don’t even have a relationship with their grandma so she’s a stranger to them.

However, my mom has turned it all around again accusing us of being AH’s and leaving an old woman out on the street, completely disregarding how horrible she’s been to us over the decades. She even somehow our uncle involved in this and he has branded us AH’s even though he could take her in! My siblings and I are definitely refusing to judge but due to us being victims of emotional abuse and so on, were beginning to doubt highly about our decision and have come to Reddit asking who is the AH and who isn’t.",88,481,0.96

722,Not the A-hole,"I'm going to preface this by saying I don't think I'm TA, and neither does my wife, but my in laws all think we are hypocrites and we want to see the other side of this and hopefully use that to figure out a way forward.

My wife and I are both women. My wife and I want kids, and we would like it if they could be related to us, but obviously there's an issue there as far as making babies goes. We were considering adoption when my wife suggested asking her older brother to donate sperm to us. I know this sounds batshit crazy but they're siblings, so they look a lot alike and they're really close, and this is the closest we could possibly get to having a child that's biologically both of ours. The brother said he'd be willing to donate when we're ready and can't wait to be an uncle.

Since the brother agreed to this he and his wife have found out that his wife can't have kids. Recently the brother told us he wants to renegotiate the sperm donor situation. In short, he wants to make 5 babies with me. Again, I know how this sounds, and I wish this was fake. He and his wife want 3 kids, me and my wife want 2. He wants me to go through 5 pregnancies, and he'll provide the sperm for each one, so biologically all 5 kids will be full siblings, but raised as cousins.

We get how big a favour he'd be doing us by donating, and we were honestly thrilled when he agreed, but the thing is the amount of time he'd spend creating 5 babies is about an hour or so, and the amount of time I'd spend is nearly 4 years (without recovery time). I was fine with 2 lots of 9 months when I was keeping the babies, but the idea of carrying those 2 plus 3 additional pregnancies where I didn't keep the babies is a whole other thing.

When they asked my wife and I said no. They asked why not, and our response was that he was asking me to go through 3 more pregnancies on top of the 2 we'd agreed on. He then said that if we weren't willing to give him children, he wouldn't do the same for us. We said that was his right to change his mind, but he was asking too much from us.

So now no one is having biological children. My wife and I were seriously considering adoption before the brother suggestion ever came up, and we do still want to try that, so at the end of the day we'd be just as happy to have a non biological child as a biological one, however the brother, who doesn't want to adopt, has told their mother who has told the extended family, and it appears that just about everyone in my wife's family believes that we should agree to it and ""return the favour"", so basically if he gives us children then I should do the same for him, and by the time I'm done everyone has their desired number of biological babies. The brother and his wife are similarly pressuring us, telling us they'd give us children so why won't we give them kids, and that the two things are the same, and called us hypocrites because we'd have kids with their help but won't help them have kids.

Like I said at the start, my wife and I believe we're in the right, but we want to hear if we actually are or not and what the other perspective might be in order to know how to proceed.

AITA?

Info: neither wife in this scenario (my wife or his) is able to produce viable eggs or carry to term, so some form of IVF/surrogacy wouldn't be possible involving either of them, and I'm basically the only chance at biological children for any of us. The brother and his wife can't afford to pay a surrogate. My wife and I are going back to adoption as our preferred route in the hopes that this will stop any further tension.

We have tried to negotiate the number of kids but they want exactly 3 kids, and they want them all to be full siblings because they're worried if I gave them one child with the brother's sperm and they adopted the rest then they'd subconsciously prefer the one who was related to the brother.

To clarify: of the 2 biological requirements of creating children - producing viable eggs and carrying to term - I am the only woman in this scenario that can do both, while my wife and my brother in law's wife can't do either. The only people in this situation capable of having children are myself and my wife's brother.

Anyway, today I was watching TV and downing a few beers. My son asked me if he could try some. I said no. He asked why, and I said “because beer is an adult drink.”

He asked why. Now my wife and her family normally say things like “that’s Daddy’s juice” or “Mommy’s juice” if it’s wine. I think that’s stupid.

So I said “because beer makes you feel funny and then it makes you puke.” My son doesn’t like throwing up so I figured this would turn him off.

He asked why I drink beer if it makes you puke.

I said well grownups drink beer because when you get older, life is really hard and sad. Beer makes you happy and makes you forget about your problems. Beer makes you stop thinking because you have so many bad thoughts.

My son just kind of said “OK” and went away at that point. My wife overheard that last part and is PISSED, says it wasn’t age appropriate. I think I told him the truth and I wasn’t overly graphic.

He is going through a lot of stuff at school and he is used to seeing me every single day because I used to pick him up from school and spend time with him. He’s working through some anger issues and I can get through to him where his mum can’t.

Basically what I’m saying is, 7pm works best for him and since he’s the child, I want to help him out as much as I can. 

I asked my girlfriend if it would be ok if we ate dinner at 8 instead. She said no. She didn’t give me a reason. I told her she was being unfair to me because I need to juggle my sons happiness at a vital time and I’m trying to make her happy too, and since both of us are working from home at the moment our schedules are all messed up anyway and eating at 8pm isn’t too out of the ordinary for us. 

Needless to say my girlfriend said I was being selfish and dramatic and that it wouldn’t hurt to tell my son ‘no, 8pm is better for me’ because ‘standing in the garden looking at the sky is a weak excuse’ to not want that time utilised.",899,5994,0.97
728,UPDATE,"\[Original post\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/emfzof/aita\_for\_not\_caring\_if\_my\_brother\_has\_changed\_and/?utm\_source=amp&utm\_medium=&utm\_content=comments\_view\_all](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/emfzof/aita_for_not_caring_if_my_brother_has_changed_and/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=comments_view_all))

So it's been a few months since my first post and since a few people were asking I thought I owed you an update. I would have provided one sooner but this is a throw away and I had logged out earlier (the fact I remember the password is itself a miracle).

The tldr of the last post was I had ignored my brother's attempts to have a relationship with me after the homophobic shit he threw at my when we were younger. I'm glad to say that's no longer the case.

A little after my last post I texted him that I appreciated his words but that his actions had really hurt me and that I needed time. He texted back he understood and to take as much time as I needed. He also thanked me for reaching back out to him.

I spent a lot of January and February in self-reflection and trying to figure out what I wanted. Lots of people in the last post said I needed therapy and I agree I likely did. I never ended up seeing a professional, but I got really into some guided meditation and calming exercises I saw on YouTube. Making a habit of it helped me realize how much weight I was carrying and has helped me start to let that weight down. I still have some ways to go but I can feel my empathy growing and I like that.

I went home for spring break and saw my bro for the first time since Christmas. Long story short, we spent a lot of time hanging out and our relationship is recovering. We've had some hard conversations, cried, shared a couple joints, etc. and I came away from the break feeling much better about everything. And since each of our schools have closed down due to the pandemic, we're both at home and doing our classes remotely and hanging out on the down time.

I want to thank those of you who said I'd probably regret cutting him out because I can tell you were right. My brother isn't perfect and did many things to purposely hurt me, but people can change if they want to and he did. I wouldn't want to be judged by my lowest point and I'm working on not judging him by his. I finally have my brother back and forgiving him has helped me feel better in ways I didn't realize I needed. Thank you.

Tl;Dr: forgiveness is a hell of a drug

**EDIT:** Holy what??? I step away from this to do homework for a couple hours and y'all gave me awards? Thank you so much

To answer some common questions: no, my bf from the OP and I are no longer together, but for separate reasons unrelated to the original post. We just wanted different things and were at different stages of our lives but it was a parting with minimal hard feelings. I don't consider his reaction to be manipulative - it wasn't a hard ""do this or we're through.""

Why my brother did it? There's no one reason. He was in a dark place and dealing with a lot of issues in a bad way. He was ignorant about a lot of LGBT stuff and relied on that ignorance when it came to me. It took a while and going off to college/meeting new people for him to begin questioning a lot he believed, and since getting help for his unresolved issues it was a step by step process until he saw how wrong he was. He said he didn't even realize how what he was doing was hurtful a lot of the time because he was so in his own head and had some really bad influences on the internet reinforcing his mindset. I can understand that and I love how far he's come.

Why didn't our parents intervene even though they always had my back? They did a lot of the time but most of what he said/did wasn't in their presence and I was not one to go running to them each time I was the victim of something. They are good people and I hold no animosity towards what they might have done instead.

I'm thinking about showing my brother this and the previous thread so he has a better understanding of how I felt about this and may update later on how that goes.

Also, I just want to say to others out there who feel they've been repeatedly wronged by someone to the point they want to cut them off that I know exactly how you feel. But the fact is people CAN change, if they want to. And even if they do, you're under no obligation to welcome them back in your life. But if you can find it in your heart, I'd strongly encourage you to give them a fair shot at doing so. People do fucked up things, sometimes many times or for many years before they they realize it and feel remorse. We're all only human<3",301,19005,0.97
729,Not the A-hole,"Okay so long story short, I'm basically flat chested A cup. My boyfriend and I argue alot, and one of the things he constantly points out it that I don't wear a bra. 

They're uncomfortable for me because they're always too big, they look and feel stupid on me and I just hate them. He commented in an argument that I wore one when we first dated. (I wore a pushup to look good in the dresses I had) 
...Which I stopped wearing after he saw me naked. By then theres no point. He'd seen what I really look like. 

I lack alot of confidence when it comes to my body, and every time I want to go out he demands I wear a bra, nothing low-cut, nothing tight. He makes comments about not wanting people to stare at my nipples.

I wear baggy clothing around him all the time, and he still complains. 

Reddit, am I the asshole for not wearing a bra?

730,Not the A-hole,"My GF Anne (25F) and I (25M) have been dating the past 5 years, since college. After graduation, we were semi-long distance, living close enough that we alternately visited almost every weekend. In 2018, Anne got a job in my city, and we found a place and moved in together.

Now’s a good time to mention the security cameras in our house: break-ins are unfortunately common where we live. We thus got some motion activated cameras, one of which has a view of our kitchen (to monitor the back door). The cameras only record when there’s motion so they can retain footage for a very long time. Anne of course knows this.

About a year ago, Anne started complaining I wasn’t contributing equally to chores. I’ve been obsessive about chores my whole life; growing up, not doing the dishes meant no videogames for a week. When I lived with roommates, I was always the chore Nazi, making damn sure we all stuck to our chore wheel. Anne is just as fastidious about chores, so we just naturally alternated who did what.

I’d just been brushing her remarks off, but over the last few months they’ve become much more aggressive, e.g. I was vacuuming and Anne said “look at you finally cleaning up around here!” I replied that we alternated vacuuming, to which she retorted “no, you’ve vacuumed maybe twice since I moved in.” Exchanges like this have been happening so frequently that I began to doubt my own recollection; am I not as clean as I thought?

Finally, she exploded at me last week. She said that having to stay home constantly over the past weeks exposed how little I do around the house, and that she didn’t move in just to be my maid. Questioning my own sanity, I spent a few hours going through the entire 1.5 year archive of security camera footage, and tallied the exact number of times the kitchen cam caught each of us doing dishes. Our cleaning supplies (vacuum/mop/etc.) are in the kitchen pantry, so I also tallied up how many times we grabbed cleaning stuff.

To my vindication, the tally showed that we indeed split chores equally. She vacuumed/mopped \~5 more times than I did; I did dishes \~20 more times than she did. Given that we vacuum/mop at least once a week and do dishes at least every day, these are insignificant differences over the year and a half we’ve lived together.

When I confronted Anne, she shrugged off her behavior as “remembering things differently,” but the real sin here was what *I* did, which she called an “unforgivable violation of *her* privacy,” akin to abusive stalking. She has broken up with me and is trying to move out, although obviously this is difficult due to current circumstances.

I’m totally heartbroken - Anne was the love of my life and I can’t believe she destroyed our relationship like this. To make matters worse, she told many of our friends, who are mostly siding with her! They’ve been texting me that what I did was creepy, abusive, controlling, invasive, etc. I’m at a loss; I’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s off base here.

Edit: some people thought I vacuumed ""5x more"" and she did dishes ""20x more,"" I clarified the wording that it was literally 5 _more times_/20 _more times_, total, over 1.5 years.",2732,21814,0.95

736,Not the A-hole,"Ok. So, for reference this happened a couple of months ago. I never really thought I was TA but yesterday I was talking about it with some friends and they told me that it was fucked up, and of course reddit always has the answers so here I am. 

So I was born with spina bifida and usually use a wheelchair for movement. I take a public bus to and from school, and for me to be properly secured in the bus the front two seats flip up and if anyone’s sitting there they have to move. On this particular day, there was a very visibly pregnant woman who yelled that she was here first and she wouldn’t be moving. The driver eventually had to ask her to get up or get out, and she moved a few seats over. For the rest of the way to school she continued to stare at me, at one point commenting that they make special busses for people like me (they do have an ‘accessible’ program that has smaller busses on request for disabled users, but I can use the normal bus just fine as the schedule and route works out great for me.) 

Anyways, at the time I didn’t really think I was TA. After talking with some friends they pointed out that I could’ve just gotten off and taken a later bus (which is true, I usually get to school half an hour early and the bus comes every 15 minutes) and that I also can stand and could have gotten into another seat (which is also true but very tiring, and I would’ve still had to store my wheelchair somewhere.)

737,Everyone Sucks,"I know that the title reads poorly, but please hear me out.

About a month ago, I (25M) was approached by my fiancée's (23F) best friend, we'll call her Sarah. Sarah has always been the wild friend of the group. I'm not the biggest fan of having her around because it usually results in her saying or doing things that make other people uncomfortable. Sarah sent me the following text: ""Hey (OP)! The bachelorette part is coming up next month and after talking with the other ladies, we thought it would be funny to have one of the gifts be a customized dildo that you make for her"".

Now, after reading that text multiple times, I had major reservations given what I know about Sarah. However, she protested and said that it would be good natured fun for my fiancée so I agreed.

Sarah came over to my apartment about a week later with a slightly different plan. She wanted to give four, yes four, different color molds of my member to my fiancée. She said she spent around $200 on the DIY kits and asked that I split it in half. At this point, I had been working up the confidence so I was all in. Thankfully, it was a relatively painless process. Sarah prepped the molds and I went to another room to do the deed. The molds turned out great and I thought the plan was actually working.

This past Friday, the bachelorette party was nearly called off (they cancelled most of their plans due to what's currently happening) so they spent the evening drinking in my fiancée's apartment. I had texted my fiancée earlier in the night telling her to have fun and expect a special surprise from me that Sarah would give her in private. I could not have been more wrong.

Apparently, Sarah had decided to change her plans and pulled out gift bags with party favors for each of the guests (who included both of my sisters and my fiancée's younger sister). Sarah had placed the customized molds of my johnson in four random bags out of the 8 girls present. My fiancée did not receive one and has to watch my sister holding a skin colored mold of my penis while Sarah drunkenly tells everyone that it was, in fact, mine. She tells everyone that it was my idea. It also turns out that no one else was consulted, so it is Sarah's word against mine.

It's been nearly 48 hours and my fiancée will not speak to me. My own family has now heard the story and both my sisters said that it was a stupid prank. Literally the only person who has texted me was my fiancée's sister who thought it was funny....

So verdict? I do feel some sense of responsibility for not thinking of this outcome.

TL;DR: I mistakenly trusted my fiancée's maid of honor and she distributed molds of my dick to my fiancée's friends and sister and accused me of planning the entire thing.

738,Not the A-hole,"So little baby ""*J*"" was born 16/5/17, his dad had broken up with me during the pregnancy, I didn't hold a grudge and wanted him to be involved, he promised me he would be but was never there- he was almost immediately in a relationship again and last I heard she was pregnant within 3 months, his life and his choice.

He was never there for J, he has seen him literally 3 times all adding up to a total of 3hrs and 24 minutes, he does not pay child support, I do not want child support from him.

So, I have a friend who is friends with my ex on fb and he recently texted me a screenshot of a post on exs wall.

It was a picture of J, the day he was born.

It was captioned ""Happy 3rd birthday, K, I wish your mother wouldn't keep us apart anymore, I wish you could meet your sibling but that isn't happening, I hope in the future we will meet just know you are my world""

(He had wanted to name our son K)

I do not keep them apart, at all, I encourage visits, I even bought him a carseat and something for J to sleep in when he visits.

People were sympathising with him.


So, I know this is tacky, I commented screenshots of texts of me offering to bring J around, of asking him when he would visit etc.

I was blocked 3-4hrs later but damage had been done.

He texted me  calling me an AH and apparently his girlfriend had  broken up with him over it and now he looks bad in front of his family.

I don't really care what he thinks but my friend thinks I was an AH too and what I did was in bad taste.

When I go to the gym i'll wear a sports bra so nothing is noticeable if you know what i mean. I don't need to wear one. I can jog comfortably without one so when i'm running around my neighborhood I don't put one on.

At the end of the street I turned and ran up the next street over and at the end of that street I ran into the family again. I had my earbuds in but I could tell they were talking and wanted my attention. I stopped, paused my music,  and listened and the parents were quite irritated. They said I should have some decency and run with a bra on because a lot more families are out and walking around now and they don't want to see me running like that.

I was definitely taken aback. I could only say ""you've got to be kidding me?"" before I left and started to run again. For context, I am not resembling Pam Anderson doing a Baywatch run.

744,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone, I'm using a throwaway, and I just want to hear other views on this. (I have 2 cats that I got 4 and 5 years ago, respectively. Hence the username)

My wedding is scheduled for Saturday, February 15. I am 28M, my girlfriend is 26F. My brother is 26M, and I (obviously) invited him to my wedding, along with his 25F girlfriend. We have already gotten back all RSVPs, and both of them confirmed that they plan to go (Side note: my brother is NOT the best man; my 28M friend is. I just wanted to clear that up).

OK, so three days ago, my brother texted me a photo of him holding an engagement ring with the word ""Soon"". He has been dating his girlfriend for the past 3 years or so, so I was very excited that he was finally going to pop the question. I told him that I was happy for him, and I asked him if he intended to do it within the coming days. He responded, ""I'll probably do it at your wedding.""

I was shocked. Are you kidding me, dude? I thought it was common knowledge that you're not supposed to propose (or announce pregnancies) at someone else's wedding. I asked him if he was joking and he said no. I told him that he should definitely not do it, as it would be seen as disrespectful to me and my soon-to-be wife. He told me that it ""seems like a good time"" because they would be together with the rest of his family.

I was worried at this point, so I warned him that if he kept saying that he would propose AT MY WEDDING, then I would have to uninvite both him and his girlfriend. He said that that was extremely rude. I responded that I will allow him to go if he promised not to propose.

That should've been the end of it, but he kept insisting that it would be a good time to propose. I called him and told him that I would seriously uninvite him and take him off the list. He said ""OK fine"" while sighing. I asked him not to bring the engagement ring to the wedding. He said that he would bring it ""just in case.""

When I woke up the next morning, I contacted my wedding venue and asked them to take my brother's name, along with his girlfriend, off of the list of their table. The next day (yesterday), I told him what I did. He was shocked and angry. He told my parents, and they almost immediately called me and told me that they were disappointed.

745,Not the A-hole,"My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.

My ex and I married when my (step)son was 4. His biological mother had passed away. My ex quickly turned into a deadbeat, but I stayed for his son. I felt horrible that his dad was so uninvolved and I didn’t want him to be abandoned by 3 parental figures. My ex gave me legal guardianship over my stepson but would not let me adopt him. We stayed together until my ex up and left when my son was 16. He emptied all the accounts, including my son’s 529 account, and just left.

I spent the next two years trying to get back on my feet and trying to put money together for my son. I ended up getting about $20k for his education, but that wasn’t nearly what we’d promised him before my ex left.

My son was in therapy through all this and we also did family therapy on and off. He did not want me as a mother and rejected me. He wanted his father, but his father was unavailable. It was terrible and sad, and my son grew up angry. I can’t blame him for that.

My son is now 25. He is mostly financially independent aside from me occasionally helping out here and there.

Last year, my close friend passed away and left a 5 year old daughter. I adopted her, which we had planned together before her passing. That has also been a difficult transition. 

My son was visiting and asked me if I was putting money away for my adopted daughter. I told him I was saving for her college and he exploded. This isn’t the first time he’s yelled, and I’ve told him not to disrespect me in my own home, but this was the first time he did it in front of my daughter.

While we were putting our daughter in her carseat my husbands mom asked us if we wanted to go see a movie or something and she can babysit our daughter.

I wanted to confront MIL with a ""Sorry, but we will not be participating"" but I have had issues with her in the past and prefer to keep the peace.

Right before the priest showed up, we had to change our daughters diaper so we went downstairs to do it. My FIL did come down to tell us the priest will come downstairs but I said ""no"" and shook my head. He said ""no?"" and then ""okay"". We heard the priest do his thing and we hid there until he was gone. My husband then went upstairs and when he came back down he told me his Mom was crying.

755,Not the A-hole,"I work as a nanny for two kids. Both parents work 12 hour shifts, and the kids are 6y and 6mo. The 6yo is autistic, and has been a handful since the baby came along as she is not adjusting well to not being an only child at all. The baby is a handful because she’s, well, a baby who’s teething and exploring and learning that when she smacks people and pulls their hair they make funny noises and faces. 

I love kids, I love my job, and I love these two specific kids to death, but my god it is exhausting and the hours are long. Both parents commute 45 minutes to work so I have to be in their home an hour before their shifts begin—my workdays begin at the lovely hour of 5am. They end at 7pm, sometimes later depending on whether they actually make it out of work on time. 

I worked today. I’ve been up since 4am, and the kids were both particularly cranky and difficult today. The 6yo is getting frustrated with the lack of routine from being on holiday for so long, on top of already being frustrated with the baby. The baby is teething and had an upset stomach all day, accompanied by copious amounts of spit up and blown out diapers. 

By the time I got home at 8pm I was exhausted, sore, and smelly from being puked on and dealing with a poop-splosion. All I wanted to do was shower and curl up in bed with my BF and I’s puppy. But, my boyfriend tempted me with the offer of a pizza—on him. We ordered the pizza, I thanked him, and then headed off to go take a shower... until I was stopped.

He asked what I was doing, and when I said taking a shower he said, “But you have to go pick up the pizza?” Record scratch, what? 

I told him I was tired and asked if he could please pick it up because I just needed a quick shower to clean up and unwind. But no, that’s not fair, he buys I fly according to him. 

We argued a little bit about the fact that I’d worked all day while he’d gotten to sleep in and spend the day kicked back playing video games. He dug his heels in on the fact that “it’s only fair. I buy, you fly.” Eventually I got fed up and went and got the damn pizza. I didn’t even eat any, just dropped it on the counter and then resumed my plans of showering. 

After awhile we did talk and I expressed that I found it a little hurtful he couldn’t just make the short trip outside to get the pizza since I worked all day, and had to be up for work again tomorrow. And the next day. He apologized but still believes that it’s “the principle” of being fair. I think it’s bullshit he couldn’t go get the pizza to  let me relax a little bit, considering I always go to pick up takeout or cook when he’s worked all day and I haven’t. 

Now I’m wondering, AITA for not wanting to pick up a pizza my boyfriend paid for because I worked all day and he didn’t? He did pay for it so I can see the standpoint of it being “fair” but I feel like it was his offer, and sometimes being kind should take precedence over being fair.",149,440,0.94

759,Not the A-hole,"My ex left me when my daughter was 3 weeks old. I was unable to track him down for any sort of support. I married my current husband when my daughter was 3 and after a long legal process, I was able to have my ex’s parental rights terminated and my husband adopted my daughter. In the last 8 years, I have only heard from my ex a few times per year, via email, and my responses were never answered.

I got a call at work yesterday (my work number is available online) and it was my ex. He wants a second shot and wants to get to know my daughter. I told him that his rights had been terminated, which he already knew (I had emailed him about it). He argued that I should let him meet her because they still have a blood connection and because I started dating my husband soon after my ex left, it wasn’t as if my daughter was ever unsupported or didn’t have a father figure. However, I refused to let him meet her and told him I would let her decide for herself when she is capable of making that decision on her own.

My daughter is only 8 and is extremely sensitive. She certainly has issues with the fact that her father left and she never knew him. We’re looking into therapy options, but for now, I just don’t think she’s capable of handling this, so I haven’t told her and probably won’t for a while. 

I offered to tell my daughter at some point in the future (could be years) and said if she wanted to, I would have her reach out if my ex left his number or something. He refused and accused me of keeping him from his blood when he was making an effort. 

I talked to my parents about this and my mom is on my side, but my dad thinks I should let him meet her since he is her biological father. He thinks I’m doing this out of spite and that “a good mother would put her feelings aside and introduce her child to a father who wants to be involved.” My husband is on my side and thinks I’m doing the right things.

Am I the asshole for refusing to let my ex meet my daughter or even telling my daughter about this until I think she can handle it emotionally?",257,779,0.96
760,Not the A-hole,"Birthday is coming up soon. Still live with my parents (18F)My parents have a “New Years resolution” about losing weight, for like the 5th year in a row.  So far I am the only one losing weight out of the three of us. 

I don’t have a problem with their resolution. But because of that, they don’t want to go out anywhere or anything. I haven’t been with my parents to the movies for 8 years and I really wanted to go but my mom says that “it’s torture for her,” and my dad says “I need to lose weight including you.”

I told my dad that we don’t even have to get any food or drink and he still says no. They said we can have dinner tomorrow but they’re choosing a “healthy” place, which is a place I dislike and have told them before That I don’t like. I asked about sweets to which my dad tells me I’m fat and I don’t need it. A small piece of cake (we don’t get huge cakes, just the tiny slices) isn’t going to do anything. 

I already know I don’t get gifts for my birthday since it’s close to Christmas. I don’t care about material stuff or food or whatever. I’m just upset that my parents seem to just not want to hang out with me or do anything. I’m more upset about the movie stuff. My dad likes movies but doesn’t even want to go with me, even though my parents have been to the movies together (either didn’t tell me until after or told me right before they left) and I just feel kinda left out. I thought my birthday was going to finally be a day we can have fun and do things together but no because for my mom it’s “torture” and I need to “lose weight”.

I’d just rather stay in my room and play video games and talk with my friends and study for my college classes that are soon to come back up. I really don’t want them making negative comments about my body tomorrow on my birthday. But I could see how hiding in my room like a goblin might be childish. WIBTA?

762,Not the A-hole,"Me and my bf dated all throughout college. I got along with his family okay. I say “okay” because they always had trouble with my weight/personality (I’m thin, introverted. My bf is handsome, life-of-the-party type). They have basically been telling him he can “do better” our entire relationship. 

I graduated after my boyfriend and moved in with him (who was an engineer already living on his own). I had a spell of “unemployment”. Although, I was generating $$$ online- sometimes even more than my bf. I also used this time to deal with something personal. Of course, this whole time his family used my employment as something else to shit on me for. 

Well I eventually got a job- a great one. I told my boyfriend not to tell his family that I got an actual job unless they specifically ask him. I also told him not give details about my title or my salary (because I know they’re dying to know). “She works with electronics. She doesn’t want me to disclose her personal details” is basically what I told him to tell them. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m a major asshole for this, but I’m just done with his family at the moment. I spent so many years trying to please them, only to have them make me shed lots of tears. I know I can easily tell them what I do/how much I make, but it’s oddly satisfying having them think I mooch off my boyfriend, but then see what I’m doing on social media and thinking “wait how would they afford that?” (Yes my bf is an engineer, but this is in California lol. He can barely afford to live by himself.) 

BUT I also can see my boyfriend’s side of things. 
Would like to hear other opinions! Am I an asshole for this?

767,Not the A-hole,"My grandmother was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, but has a 70% chance of surviving with the treatments the doctors are going to be administering. She won't lose all of her hair with this, but is going to cut it short anyway and just wear wigs everywhere because she's always wanted to wear wigs and this is as good a time as any to do so.

My mother and aunt are getting the same haircut as her to support her in her fight against the cancer. My mom told me I *need* to cut my hair like them to support my grandmother. I told my mother that I want to support her in other ways, like doing my grandmother's chores and taking her to doctor's appointments. My mom got pissy and said that isn't enough support, then shoved her phone in my face and waved it around, showing me the haircut she's getting. 

I think supporting my grandmother at home and at the doctor's is far more important than getting matching haircuts. I help my grandmother out with household chores more than anyone since my parents work more than me and my sister can't bend due to rods in her back. I also take care of our animals daily. We have 4 ducks, 3 chickens, and two cats. The birds have to be tended to twice a day and can be a pain in the ass at times. Despite all of this, my mother acts like I do nothing around the house and just play video games all day. Sure, I do play a lot of video games, but I also make sure things are taken care of first. I have my priorities straight. 

I also don't want to look exactly like my mother because no one would be able to tell us apart. She and I have the same height, same build, same hair color, pretty much the same face, and matching glasses. I want to be my own person, and not just a carbon copy of my mother. We work at the same company as well, so our coworkers would probably confuse us for one another a lot more than they already do.

768,Not the A-hole,"I am a temporary intern at a place in the US and at this position housing is provided. It's an apartment style place with shared bedrooms and one large living room / kitchen area that all the interns share. There is also a camera in the corner of the living room. This camera can move and turn and it's controlled by my boss. Apparently some past interns got into some trouble and this camera was installed. For a while it was facing away from the living room and didn't move so I gave it no thought, assuming that since none of us had done anything to warrant supervision, I figured the camera was disabled. A few days ago however, the camera started moving around and now a small light is blinking which I assume means it's active. When I was sitting in the living room today I heard talking and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Then I turned and saw the camera was on so I gave it an awkward wave and then I heard some laughing, so I guess there's a speaker attached too?? This makes me very uncomfortable. There aren't any cameras in our rooms but I feel weird that I could be minding my business on a day off and someone could be spying on me! I'm not sure if they can hear us talk either - what if I had a bad day and want to vent and my boss hears me? However I'm only here for 4 months and I don't own this place or pay any rent. I have privacy in my room too. Obviously if we are doing something against the rules or illegal I can understand why they would want to know about it.

769,UPDATE,"Firstly here's my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e3vfsc/aita_for_trying_to_help_out_an_expartner_whos_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

So after my AITA post it was clear that you guys all thought I was TA, the situation bought up quite a bit that I didn't think about.

I had sent a cheque for a huge amount of money to my ex who I had badly mistreated financially due to an addiction that I'm now in recovery for. She sent me a message telling me she wasn't interested in my money and rightfully so.

Last Monday (16th dec)  I checked my online banking and saw that the cheque had been cashed and I thought to myself I'm happy she has the money and that was that I wouldn't attempt any further contact. 

On Saturday just gone, I got a message on Facebook from her, complete uturn from her original message. She explained how when we were together there was often broken promises about money and how money was coming soon and she thought immediately upon receiving the cheque that it would bounce when she paid it into the bank and was very shocked when it actually cleared and she still waited another week before she believed it was real. 

We've ended up lots of talking about our relationship and how it ended and the broken promises and mistakes upon my part. But also reminisced on some of the good times we had together. We're never going to be close friends but she seems to have accepted my apology for my actions way back when.

She told me about her current financial situation and how much the money i repaid her will improve her current quality of life.

Although realising that I was TA didn't cause me to do any different actions. I just wanted to update the situation. Although I'm still TA for how I treated her during my relationship with her. I'd like to think I'm not TA for my actions in my previous post now.

773,Not the A-hole,"Ok. I fucked up.

My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.

I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.

Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.

My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?

My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.

He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.

I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.

Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.

And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.

&#x200B;

Edit.

I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.

1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.
2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.
3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.
4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.
5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.
6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.
7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.

In retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes.

I decided to give some to my neighbors. One of my neighbors is a young woman around my age (I'm also a girl) and she has a 4 years old kid. So she opened the door with her kid and as soon as he saw the envinado the kid started crying about wanting cake. I explained to the mom that it was not cake, it was envinado and it had a lot of rum so her kid couldnt eat it.

She got mad at me and rudely told me that I should have brought something that her kid couldn't eat because now she'll have to deal with a screaming kid all afternoon.

When that just happened I was convinced I did nothing wrong so I posted a rant here on Reddit on another sub (that was later delete because I was told that it didn't fit the sub). But before it was deleted I had like 18 comments and like 15 of those were telling me it was my fault.

Edit 1: English is hard and I said his when I meant to say her.

You made a syrope with a little water, tons of sugar and fruits. Then you mix the syrope with the bottle of rum. And you drench the cake in the syrope+rum mix. It doesn't have a tiny bit of rum. It's dripping rum+syrope.

Edit 3: Just to clarify, I didn't try to give her the whole envinado. I shared it with several of my neighbors. I didn't showed with a full envinado to her house. It was more like a huge slice. I didn't make the envinado with the intention of giving it to her. I made envinado with the intention of using that bottle of rum for something tasty and then I decided to share it with my neighbors.

778,Not the A-hole,"My ex-gf broke up with me in june last year. She had bad credit and couldnt get a contract with any of the phone providers. Because of her credit history i decided i would get a second line on my bill so she would have a phone. We dated for about 2 years and in that entire time never once paid for any of the phone bill.

When we broke up i told her that if she paid the phone bill she could keep the phone. I gave her some leniency for the first couple months, reminding her everytime the bill came in how much she owed me for it. Every month she had a different excuse about why she couldnt pay me but promised to pay me next time.

Before the third bill came in i suggested that she give me the phone back if she cant afford to pay it. Her response to that was that the phone was a gift and therefore belongs to her (it wasnt a gift, i never once hinted or implied that it was). When it got into the fourth month with no previous payments i told her that i would cut the phone off if she didnt pay me soon. She went on a big rant about how she wont be able to find work or do anything without it so i felt bad and decided to wait a bit more.

Finally during christmas break i decided i have had enough. I waited until the end of december and called my phone company to report a stolen phone and cut it off. Its been about a week since then and one of our mutual friends is now telling me what she and her friends are saying about it. Apparently i am a piece of shit and ruining her life by doing this.

I have had a few mixed responses about it so i wanted to ask here. Am i the asshole for reporting a phone on my bill as stolen after 7 months of no attempt to make a payement?

Edit:I guess i forgot a detail in there. This was the second phone i got her, the first one was a gift and i told her that but i was specific with the second one that she would be expected to pay the bill as soon as we got it and if she didnt pay the bill the phone would still be mine and she would be simply borrowing it.

It is technically only been reported as lost/stolen because that is the only way to cut off the phone usage with this company (excluding cancelling the plan and paying $600 still owed for the device) so i havent actually made the claim yet merely cut it off and flagged it so it cannot be used",156,525,0.94

782,Not the A-hole,"So, my wedding was a week ago and I’m still hearing about this “horrible thing” I’ve done. I need some final closure on it before I break somebody.

My MIL and her sisters have “a song” that they play and dance to at every family wedding without fail. I don’t know the name of it, it’s some deep water rap song from the 80’s or 90’s and every other word is a cuss word. It talks about graphic sex and drug use and I hate it. I’m not into music like that, and neither is my fiancé, but he doesn’t say anything to her about it. I made sure to put it on our “do not play list” for the DJ to double check that we wouldn’t be hearing it.

My MIL and her sisters run to the DJ about half way through and ask him to play it. He tells her no, as it’s on our DNP list. She comes over to me and asks why I would do that. I told her that the lyrics weren’t appropriate as I didn’t want my young cousins/siblings and my super Christian grandmother to have to hear it. Her and her sisters told me it wasn’t fair to them, and that they always play it and I don’t have the right to cancel their tradition. I told them I wasn’t going to argue with them at my wedding and that we could fight about it in the morning if it was so important. They sat down and didn’t dance for the rest of the night.

The only reason I feel bad is because we played other songs with swear words, but none nearly as graphic as the one they wanted. And, it ruined the rest of their night because they were upset.

However, I have gotten texts nearly 24/7 from them since the wedding saying stuff like if I wanted to be accepted into their family I needed to accept them, and I have no right since the wedding isn’t just for me and my husband but for everyone else to celebrate too, etc. Finally today I told them that if they texted me again without apologizing for harassing me this past week, that they would not be welcome to stay with us in our home again. They haven’t responded nor have they contacted my husband. He seems to think I overreacted by not letting them play the song, but says they are in the wrong simply because they haven’t left me alone about it.

So, give it to me straight: AITA for not letting them play the song?

783,Not the A-hole,"When my wife and I met I was wearing a vintage style knee length navy dress.  [This isn't the exact dress but it looks similar to this.](https://www.lindybop.co.uk/vicki-navy-blue-swing-dress.html)

When my wife and I got married we didn't want a big white wedding for a few reasons. We eventually decided to wear the clothes we were wearing when we first met, and went with a tiny wedding, of exactly 11 people. Attendees were my son, my mother, my brother, our 4 best friends, and my wife's uncle and his husband, and us. We announced our marriage to everyone else by posting some pictures on facebook at the time (3 years ago). To this day the dress is my favourite piece of clothing that I own and I still wear it all the time.

I got back in touch with my dad after the wedding. My cousin on dad's side is getting married tomorrow. The theme is Romeo & Juliet. She's got this colour scheme going where her guests wear blue and his wear red. I don't fully understand it but she says it's going to look great in the photos, and everyone attending needs to stick to their assigned colour. I had a blue dress picked out and ready to go but my son spilled an actimel on it (total accident). It's in the wash but it's not going to be dry in time.

I don't have any smart clothing on hand that I could wear and still be in accordance with the dress code.

I put the first dress in the wash, told my wife what happened, and asked if I could borrow one of her pantsuits. It didn't fit so I then turned to my wedding dress. My wife said she wasn't sure wearing my wedding dress would be a good idea, and that tomorrow we'd go looking for another.

I responded that the wedding starts at 12 and is an hour drive away without traffic, and the shops don't open until 10, so we'll be diving about last minute and I'm worried about the logistics of buying the outfit less than 2 hours before the wedding starts. She replied that I should ask my cousin but as this is the night before her wedding and she's currently on her bachelorette, I don't want to bother her right now.

The last thing I want to do is be that bitch who wore her wedding dress to her cousin's wedding, but the way I see it is I wasn't in touch with my dad's family when we got married, I wear this dress all the time, and the only people who know I got married in this and will also be at the wedding tomorrow are me, my wife, and my brother, and none of us intend to tell people. It's not a big white ballgown like she'll be wearing, it's a knee length navy dress without a stitch of white on it. However, my wife is saying that *we* know the significance and if someone remembers the pictures then I *will* be that bitch who wore her wedding dress to her cousin's wedding.

With this in mind I am turning to this forum. If I am TA then I will go to the high street as soon as the shops open tomorrow and get another dress, if not then I'll just wear this one.

Parents passed in a car accident Sept. 2019, they left a will behind. I got the house and land (worth ~2 million), siblings split the 10% share of my business (worth ~0.5 million today). They each get $8000 every month doing nothing. They don't even know where my business is. 

I know for a fact within 5 years my business will be worth at least 15X more than it is today. I want to buy out my siblings because they do absolutely nothing for my business. I will pay them what it's worth today but AITA for that?

Basically, I was in a local cafe the other day.  Sitting working on some work for my university studies, minding my own business.  

I have my headphones in (noise cancelling) so I’m pretty oblivious to what’s going on.  Out of nowhere, a kid (10/11 max) must’ve fallen and the mug goes flying, yup, you guessed it, into my laptop, cracking the screen and completely destroying it.  

I only recently just bought the new laptop, it’s a MacBook Pro and I got it with Xmas money and some other money I had saved from working part time. It was my dream laptop and something I worked so hard to get. I didn’t get AppleCare or anything as I’m generally pretty careful with everything, to this point I’ve never broke anything before.

The parent of the child came over, checked obviously that they were alright (same as me). They notice that my Mac is completely done.  The parent explains that it was a freak accident and he’s sorry etc (at this point the child is crying hysterically).  I explain that I’m glad the boy is ok, but at the end of the day I was sitting here minding my own business and I’m at a great loss through no fault of my own.  He shrugs and says “what do you expect me to do? Pay for a new laptop for you?”

At this point he leaves the cafe with his son in a hurry, no further conversation with me and everyone is pretty shocked.  Luckily, I was able to get his contact information as someone in the cafe knew both of them as friends of a friend. 

So AITA for looking for complete replacement of my MacBook for this “freak accident”?

787,Not the A-hole,"My (33F) mother has a younger brother who she has a fairly fractured relationship with - long story short, my mum married out of culture (to my dad) which brought embarrassment to the family. My grandfather (my mum's dad) told my mother's brothers that if they continued a relationship with my mum, they would be cut out of the wills. The younger brother decided not to speak to my mum to ensure his inheritance. As time has gone on, the extended family is more accepting of us, we are invite to and attend family gatherings and are all cordial but we don't socialise otherwise, with the exception of my now deceased grandma who loved my dad and mum and me and my sister had a wonderful relationship with her.

Previously it had been about 7 years since we had seen or spoken to my uncle. When my grandma died we went to her house to pay our respects - there was maybe about a dozen people there. My uncle said hello to us but other than that completely ignored us (we were all sitting around a table). After about an hour, my uncle looked at me and said ""you've really packed on the pounds, you used to be so pretty"" in front of everyone. I'd always been very slim (50kg) but having gotten a bit older I'd started to struggle to keep the weight off, been diagnosed with an automimmune disease which causes weight gain and a few months earlier I'd had an accident which left me bed ridden for 8 weeks so I couldn't work out. I knew I'd put on weight already and didn't need it pointed out. I became tearful and my mum, dad and sister started defending me but he didn't really see why that had been rude he just said ""but it's true, look at her"". No other comments were made after this.
Fast forward a year later to my grandfather's funeral. I've lost 20kgs, am on medication that helps regulate my metabolism and I'm now in a happy place with my weight. My uncle approaches me while I'm with my parents and sister and immediately says ""you look great, see all you needed was a bit of motivation"". I was furious that again, the only comment was about my weight and we were at a funeral service, so I calmly and pointedly said ""why are you so fascinated by my body?"" He was like a deer in the headlights, stuttered and walked away. My mum and dad didn't care that I said anything.
No-one else heard the conversation but later on my mum got a phone call from my uncle's wife saying I'd been disrespectful and insinuated he was a pervert. My mum would like me to apologise just to put the whole thing to bed but I just don't want to.

My coach really appreciates hard work and toughness and over the years ive earned his respect by never missing practice, playing hard in games, etc...
Ill get to the point quickly; my coach frequently tells us that if we have a problem with playing time we as the players should speak to him about it. He gets very pissed off about this and he sent an email to parents to tell them not to speak to him if theyre unhappy about playing time for their child. Recently ive noticed my dad get very frustrated about me not starting. He was a football player in high school and is super into sports. Many times he has said “Im going to talk to your coach and tell him that you should play more” and each time ive calmed him down and told him not to. A couple days ago, my mom told me that two weeks ago she talked to my dad and they agreed for him to text my coach and tell him that i should be played more. So even though I told my parents multiple times not to do it, and my coach sent an e mail at the start of the season, they still went behind my back and did it anyway. Im pretty angry about this. Ive worked so hard and earned my coaches respect, and now thats ruined. Im just the kid who’s parents had to ask the coach for more minutes. My coaches answer was “I will do a better job of distributing minutes.” I dont even want distributed minutes.

794,Everyone Sucks,"I work at a nursing home in dietary. I am a 20 year old male, and most of the rest of the staff is older (30+). Recently, a new girl started working there around the same age as me and we became friends. I don't really talk much to the other staff because I'm younger and don't share much interests with them, so the people I do talk to are close to my age. One of my coworkers told my boss and other coworkers that the new girl and I are ""getting too close"" and she thinks something is going on between us.

&#x200B;

My boss (who I have a good relationship with) thought this was funny and he told me about what she had said. Apparently, when he heard her theory, he laughed it off and explained to her that I have a girlfriend and that I'm not generally the type to go around flirting with people. She defended herself by saying ""people cheat all the time"" and began ranting about how sexual harassment can occur in the workplace. My boss just shrugged it off because he knows me pretty well and tried to tell her that we probably just get along because we are similar in age.

&#x200B;

I was sort of upset that this coworker was trying to make stuff up about me. I barely know her and she definitely doesn't know me, and my boss said she was implying that my friendship with the new employee would lead to sexual harassment. So the next day, I told the only other young person there (who is also a close friend, let's call him John) about it all and asked him to play along and we made up a plan real quick. While we were working, I start having a very clear, sarcastic conversation with John, making sure that rumor-lady can hear me.

Me: Hey John, do you think there's any secret workplace romances going on?  


John: I don't know, that seems like a pretty crazy accusation to make.  


Me: Oh you're right, we shouldn't be talking about these people who we barely speak to and accuse them of ridiculous things.  


John: But couldn't a secret romance lead to sexual harassment?  


The conversation went on, mostly just clarifying things we had already said, but I don't remember exactly how the rest went. Rumor-lady looked visibly upset. My boss called me into his office about an hour later and told me that although he found it quite funny, my coworkers said it was an uncomfortable situation and a few of them wrote complaints.

Right after we got engaged we discussed it I very felt very open to taking her name. In fact I believe I was who suggested it. Of course she was excited to hear that because she has always wanted to keep her last name. And from there we moved on happy about our decision. 

I felt the need to at least warn my parents that I was doing this so they wouldn't be in shock at the wedding. Turns out they are very not okay with it at all. They are taking it as Im choosing to be in my fiance's family and not theirs. And my dad is very concerned that I will be ending his family line because I am the only son. 

This caused the biggest fight me and my fiance have ever been in. Because out of fear of upsetting my parents I was questioning my original choice. When I talked to my fiance about this she was upset that I had changed my mind just because my parents told me dont do it. We argued for weeks about this (my fiance and my parents) and I really hoped I could make everyone happy. But in the end I chose to do what we wanted to do with our lives and not what my parents want us to do. 

I believe it's just a generations disagreement, but I told him you shouldnt think that his family line ending just because the name is different.

799,Not the A-hole,"LATE UPDATE: my hair is purple and i’m looking for my own apartment :)


TLDR at the bottom, and obligatory sorry for formatting because mobile. 

when i (22F) first met my boyfriend (23M) (will call him A) of over 3 years, I had blonde hair (I’m naturally a brunette). About 6 months in, I went back to my natural hair color and A was very vocal about how much he loved it, and how he dislikes blonde hair. I was taken aback at first, but whatever, everyone has a type I guess. Since then, any mention of a haircut or dye has been met with worried looks and “but I like long and brown”.  Easy enough, so I just let it grow out. 

Fast forward to present day: we both just graduated college and live together. I landed an awesome job working with children. In the midst of all the change, I decide I want to put purple highlights in my hair, just the pieces of hair that frame my face. To reach the color I want, I have to bleach the hair and tone it, so I’ve had blonde highlights for the last week. Predictably, A is not pleased.  When he first saw, he was visibly upset and asked why I would do that when I know he hates it.  Since then, he’s made comments everyday about how blonde my hair is, asking why I did it and asking when I will be doing something else to it. This morning, it reached the boiling point when A expressed how he felt it was unfair of me to “do this to him” because, in his words, hair is the only physical quality that is make or break in a relationship. He claims that he doesn’t care if my weight fluctuates, if my skin is broken out, or anything else, but said that out of respect I should dye my hair back, darker this time. He also says that he is finding it hard to be physically attracted to me with this change, because not only is blonde not attractive to him, but that my hair just looks downright bad. 

I feel like that’s fucking ridiculous. I’m an adult and should not have to ask my boyfriend for permission to dye my hair. I can understand him disliking it, but telling me that it’s disrespectful and blaming me for our lack of physical chemistry is asshole-ish.  I feel like if A were to shave his beard or get a buzz cut, I wouldn’t go out of my way to make it about myself. 

Today, I’m heading to the beauty supply store to buy darker hair dye because I feel so humiliated. Reddit, I need your judgements: AITA?

800,Not the A-hole,"A little background, my(19F) sister (21F) (let’s call her Ashley) goes on a lot of first dates. She’s the kind of person who will go on a few dates and say the relationship has lost its “spark” and move on (no judgement here).

 Usually the guys Ash meets are from friends or blind dates and she likes to have me there as backup incase the guy is a creep. I genuinely don’t mind doing this. For the double date part she says it feels less awkward if I’m also “on a date” so Ashley usually finds a guy for me to go with or I bring a friend. I always like to make sure the people she sets me up with know I’m not interested in anything with them and I’m just there to support Ashley but lately they haven’t taken the hint and IM the one left dealing with creeps. I’m also talking to a guy and while we aren’t in a definitive relationship I know he would be uncomfortable with me going out with someone else even for the purpose of helping Ashley.

Ash: Double date on Sunday (place and time)

Me: Alright sounds good can I bring (my guys name)

Ash: Already promised another guy he would be your date maybe next time 

Me: I’m not exactly comfortable with going out with strangers anymore, would you mind finding someone else this time?

801,Asshole,"So I (21F) have been best friends with Nina (21F) since the sixth grade. We hung out all the time, watched movies, came over to each others' house, and she even met my grandma after trying to steal a pair of my pants. Our friendship has been solid for over ten years, despite growing, we still come back to each other. Usually, we'd interact often throughout the day but in November, I started getting left on delivered (like being left on read, but the read receipts aren't on; more insidious imo) more and more often, and on the rare chance that she would respond, it would be one word answers. I was increasingly concerned because her social media was barren, which was unusual. She struggles with mental health issues that are currently untreated due to her financial situation. She can isolate herself when she's feeling down, but my friends and I intervene and help her when it happens.

So in the middle of December, she texted our group chat and asked us to go out to dinner to catch up. Of course I was in there like swimwear, but when I got there she was making next to no eye-contact with me, barely talking, and not laughing at my jokes all while literally sitting next to me. Fast-forward two weeks, I'm still texting her every day or so and still being ignored. Later, I broke up with my long-term bf. It hurt as we were gearing up to move out together and I reached out to her and got silence. This hurt as every time she'd have a break up or a guy problem, it was me who'd get the call at 12 or 1 in the morning (the sadboi hours, as you may already know) and be with her. But when I finally need her? Silence. I later saw on a mutual friend's instagram post her living it up at a NYE party. I was enraged.

Yesterday, I lost it. I went over to her house and knocked on the door, and a male relative answered and told me she wasn't home. I went home and called her job. It rang and her coworker picked up, and I asked to talk to her. She asked me who I was and I said ""her sister"". So the call was transferred to Nina, and I was like ""it's not your sister, it's me, why are you avoiding me"" and I cried on the phone. She was upset and said ""you can't call me at work for this, it isn't that important, I could have gotten in trouble"" and hung up. 

About 20 minutes later, she texted the group chat (SHE FOUND THE TIME) and we ended up arguing. She told us that she wasn't ignoring anyone, but busy but I countered and said ""you weren't too busy to party"". I then said ""I'm mad that you haven't made the time for us"", and then she left the group chat. Now Reddit, I had a moment of pettiness and added her back in the group chat. I said ""You left because you know I'm right. Something is up and we're being ignored. If you really want to make time for someone, you will, and I see we weren't worth it"". Then she left the group chat again, and I didn't add her back.

I've been woken up by the loud thuds of their running. They've almost run into me in the halls when walking back to my apartment.

806,Not the A-hole,"I turn 21 next weekend and my parents were going to have a small family party at home with a dinner and cake on the Sunday.

I started eating a healthier diet when I turned 18 a couple years ago, doing all my own cooking and cutting out dairy (found out I was lactose intolerant). As a result, over time, I have found I can't eat certain rich foods as much as the rest of my family and as much as I used to. Meals I don't have a problem with unless I load them up with a whole bunch of vegan cheese but I can't consume large quantities of most desserts. For my dad's birthday 2 months ago, I made him a chocolate layer cake. It was vegan but still had oil, sugar, chocolate, etc and was super rich. My mom cut me a perfectly normal sized piece and it was just so rich I couldn't finish it.

I do love dessert but I'm more of a fruit desserts or simple desserts person. My actual favourite dessert is a bowl of coconut milk ice cream with caramel sauce. Since I figured adult birthdays are more about alcohol and spending time with people you love, I didn't think it would be a big deal if I skipped the birthday cake. I'm always the one who makes birthday cakes for all the birthdays in the family, including my own, so I thought I'd save myself the trouble and make a dessert for me I could actually finish.

When I told my mom I wasn't going to make a cake this year but instead make a homemade caramel sauce and buy some non-dairy and some dairy ice creams for the party, she was annoyed. She said 'it's not a real birthday party without cake' and 'how can you possibly think ice cream and caramel sauce is an acceptable birthday dessert.'

AITA? I don't understand the problem. I'm the one who makes the cakes. I don't stop anyone else from getting cake on their birthday, but this year I don't want cake. Is it really that big a deal?",59,89,0.93
807,Asshole,"Hello, fellow redditors, I need your help as I can’t decide who’s feelings are most justified in this situation. 

Context: I am 32F single living in my own one bedroom apartment.  The town I currently live in is close by my mom’s work about a fifteen min drive. This is not a crazy coincidence as my current town is also about 10mins from the town/house I grew up in that my parents commuted from to work every day.  My parents had 2 homes: the main house that I referenced above and their shore house 45 miles south. 

3 years ago, Dad retires. They decide it’s time to sell the main house and live full time in the shore house.  Mom decides to work for 1 more year then will retire. Her commute now amends from 10mins to 1hr plus drive each way.  Mom approaches asking if she can stay at my apt 3 nights a week and will pay me for it. (Although, I have no issue with her staying with me I don’t think I ever had a choice as I didn’t want my mom making that long commute every day either) 

I proposed 8K flat for the year (33% annual), she agreed and paid. FYI- my mom is an easy roommate. Nonetheless, she sleeps on a cot in my living room mon,tues,thurs. 

Fast forward to year three, Oct 2019 lease renewing. Mom still not retired so I ask if she plans to renew with me for same amount 8k. (My rent increases every year) She replies “yes” but with resentment. I brush it off. Month after month goes by with reminders and no check. 

I confront her one night asking what is going on. She said “I’ve been thinking about it and very disappointed because no one else would charge their mom’s rent to stay at their house and we never charge you to stay at the shore house every weekend. We have been too generous with our children and it has been detrimental to their independence. You make a lot of money now and I hope you save it. Furthermore, your father and I are spending A TON of money right now so it difficult”  
My response points:
1. So you and Dad convinced yourselves that you’ve been giving me 8k of charity every year?! I have saved you both money by you staying with me instead of getting your own apt. You were supposed to leave after year one, but I made it too comfortable I guess! End of day it’s mutually beneficial economically for both parties.
2. Any argument you attempt now is not valid b/c rent is 3 months past due. Were you just hoping I’d let it go and not approach you about 8 GRAND!
3. I don’t care how much money I make, $8k is a lot of money that I budget for every year. 

INFO: parents are spending “A TON” of money right now because they started building their new $$$$$ beach home w intentions to sell the old one once finished. Oh and they are going to Israel on vacation Monday for about 10k. 

So the above is my argument but I can’t help but still feel like a moocher off my parents. If they didn’t have money I would never expect payment. I think my arguments make a lot of sense on paper but I still feel like a loser after my mom said that no one else would charge their parents rent.

EDIT: there seems to be some confusion going on around what my mom actually sleeps on. I think cot is the wrong word. It’s a Bobopedic ottoman pull out bed. It’s a twin bed with a very comfortable mattress. Her set up is pretty good.  It is like her own bedroom with all the amenities. If it wasn’t comfortable she would not have lasted this long. Basically we turn my LR into her bedroom three nights a week.

809,Asshole,"My OH and I both make fairly good money in our jobs. We have no debt apart from our mortgage and up until recently we also had significant savings.

Recently, however, we have had some unlucky events happen which have eaten up all our disposable cash and savings. We are talking high 5 figures worth of unforeseen and unavoidable expenses, although none medical thankfully. Due to our savings, we have been able to absorb these costs without resorting to loans, but it has left us with just enough to cover the essential bills for a few months. We will be fine, but will have to tighten our belts, cancel some trips planned etc.

Now, OH has a large extended family who generally just send our kids (2.5 and 1) money for birthdays/Christmas. They are very generous and over Christmas both kids ended up with nearly $1000 which we have put straight in their bank accounts. However, OH has suggested we use the kids' money to help cover some expenses so we don't have to cancel all the plans we have made for January and February (day trips, family visits and a long weekend away with close friends). 

His argument is that the kids are too young to understand we have borrowed their money and they will enjoy the trips as they get to play with their cousins and our friends' kids. He also argues we should be able to pay them back by the summer (barring any more disasters!). I just feel like such an a-hole taking money from our kids' accounts that we don't strictly need; we can still pay essential bills, we just need to do without luxuries like trips for a bit. We have been debating this since Christmas day! 

Would we be the assholes for taking this money?",329,600,0.89
810,Not the A-hole,"I will include a link to texts between us about this below.

Basically, my roommate is a nightmare. She has been letting her dog, who is potty trained, pee in our kitchen and then leaving it. She doesn’t take her out often enough or buy puppy pads. She usually gets to it within 24-36 hours of the mess being made but when it’s longer I have had to ask her to clean it several times. I have communicated to her several times that dog piss being left about is a serious issue for me. She thinks I hate it because I have OCD but honestly I don’t think anyone would just be cool with dog piss.

If she asks me to walk her dog and I have time I’m always glad to. In the past I’ve fed her and trained her a bit as well. She’s a good dog and I love dogs, I just am not ok with being her free dog walker more than 2-3 times a week because I have 2 jobs, I’m a student as well, and I specifically don’t have a dog because I know I don’t have the time to take care of one properly. I also buy all the cleaning supplies in the apartment and recently she asked me to buy her some bleach based cleaners because mine “aren’t good enough”. I did and had them in my room to give to her but hadn’t yet.

We got in an argument where I asked her to take care of the pee that was dried in the pantry and had been there for several days the day I was asking her. She has no job and no school to go to so it’s not unreasonable to ask her to do it within 24 hours. It turned into a huge argument and at the end I said I’d call the landlord and she still refused to clean it that day. 

I immediately called the landlord because she had basically refused to even agree to try and clean it that day, and she had said several things that bothered the hell out of me. I put the cleaning supplies in the living room and left for therapy and then work.

When I called the landlord the landlords office told me that they would give her a stern phone call and it would be taken care of. At no point did it enter my mind they could ban her because in my experience renting even with someone who has a nightmare pet the landlord can’t just ban it in CT.

So I get to work and we have the text conversation below. In summary, I tell her that I did not intend for her dog to be banned, and gave her some avenues to get it back, and she insists it was unreasonable for me to call the landlord in general over this and I’m a “psycho”, and she’s not going to bother trying to get her dog back.

AITA here? I get that it sucks hard her dog is banned, but I feel like she didn’t give me any other choice than to call the landlord.

Edit: she’s home and she brought the dog. I’m avoiding her and I have no idea what’s going on.

Edit 4: more [texts](https://imgur.com/a/JB1E9x9) . She came home from going to church to clean up the pee, and I didn’t get why until I realized I didn’t respond to where she said she’d do it when she got back. I’m the jerk on that bc I didn’t read the whole text. I stayed in my room and then took her dog to the park while she was here to avoid an argument.",159,256,0.91
811,Not the A-hole,"For context, my husband died 16 years ago, so it’s just me, my son Eldor, and my daughter Rebecca. 

4 years ago when Eldor was applying to universities, we had the conversation about costs. We live in Georgia, which is relevant because Georgia has a state scholarship that pays for pretty much the entirety of one’s college bill. I told my children that out-of-state costs are too exorbitant, and I encouraged them to find schools in Georgia that they liked. As a result, my son went to GA Tech.

Two years ago, Rebecca applied to college with the expectation of going to UGA. With her stats, it was pretty much a shoe in. However, her counselors made her apply to 2 other schools on top of that, so she applied (and got accepted into) Dartmouth.

She **begged** me to let her go there. I understood her POV; an ivy league accepted her and it could be really good for her career. However it was expensive (I make a lot, so financial aid only covered half of the $80,000/year cost to go there). After a LOT of pleading and promises that she’ll do well, I relented on the condition that she maintains good grades, showed me her transcripts every semester, and that she transfers in-state if she couldn’t keep up. She accepted. 

So for the last 1.5 years, we’ve been doing that. Every semester she’d show me her transcripts (she’d get anywhere between a 3.0 - 3.7). Everything was fine until this morning, I lost my retainers, and searched the trash to see if I threw them away. 

In there, I saw an unopened letter addressed to me from her school. It was peculiar because I definitely did not see it. I opened it, and it said that Rebecca was on Academic Warning, and she needed to improve her grades by next semester or she’d be on probation. 

To make a long story short, she’s been lying. She’s been giving me screenshots of doctored grades and she currently has a 2.1. To make matters worse, they sent me a letter last semester, but I found out she threw it away. She’s been non-stop crying and apologizing  and promising that she will improve.

I’m hurt Reddit. I’m hurt that my daughter would boldface lie to me. Every conversation about school was her continuing to keep up the lie. She says she’s changing majors, dropping extracurriculars, and is committed to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

But I don’t know Reddit. I feel like the damage is done. I’ve been shelling out 20 grand a semester, and she’s not even passing her classes. I understand ivy leagues are tough, but I feel like that doesn’t excuse lying to me. Also, she’s already enrolled for next semester, so I’m on the hook for the next 20k for her spring semester. 

WIBTA if I just don’t pay it? I know that’s harsh but I don’t know what else to do. I feel like doing nothing would send a message that what she did was okay. What do you guys think?",292,939,0.91

My husbands birthday is today and we planned a cabin trip up north with another one of our couples friends to go snowboarding, play games, relax, etc. I will refer to this couple as Ann & Chris. Ann & Chris confirmed with us weeks ago that they are planning on coming with us, they just had to finish work and would be heading up later than we would so we will be driving separate. Now this other couple who we routinely hangout with, Andy & April, were also invited but Andy couldn’t make it due to working the weekend. We were bummed but still happy to have some of our friends with us for the trip to celebrate my husbands birthday. Fast forward to New Years Eve. We were hanging out with these same two couples. April brought up how bummed she was to not be able to come because her husband has to work. We all sympathized and said it was unfortunate but we would try to do another trip up north soon that we could all make it to. She then joked about just coming up herself and we didn’t really confirm or deny if she could just said something along the lines of “haha yeah maybe.”  Well yesterday Ann & Chris show up late and April is with them. I was asleep at the time, and so only my husband was there to greet them & help them get their stuff inside. He woke me up last night and told me about how she had come after he had come to bed. We had no idea she was coming and don’t have the food prep etc for her. I’m a little upset at Ann & Chris for not mentioning it, but mainly angry at April for just showing up. In the grand scheme of things this is not a huge deal, but feel as though this was something she should have double checked with us before coming up. WIBTA if I called her out on it?

I recently found out that my body can't deal with gluten very well, it's not very serious, but eating it will cause major diarrhoea (sp?) and intense cramps (sorry if it's TMI). 

So I started buying my own gluten free bread and pasta, sometimes even cookies. I'm in HS and only work weekends, so I don't have much money to spend, but I'm okay with doing it this way. Completely changing my diet would be a bigger hassle. 

Problem is that my mom eats it too. If she's too lazy to get bread from the freezer she'll eat mine. I would be okay with that if she replaced it, but it's happened several times that for breakfast she'd take the last few pieces. Leaving me to skip breakfast, or be late for school to go get more.

816,Not the A-hole,"Ok, so before I start here is a bit of background. I got my gaming set up for my birthday mainly because my siblings didnt let me play what once was my Xbox. I got it about 4 months ago. It cost around €700 for the monitor, PC, keyboard and mouse.

At first when I got it I was the only one to use it, with my father also knowing the password incase I searched up anything suspicious. My brother (12) and sister (9) begged me to let them play but I decided to not share the password in hope that my dad wouldn't give into them either.

About a month passes up until I come home after a night out with my mates to see my brother playing a game of mine on my set up, luckily, nothing was ruined, however I was extremely annoyed that my dad allowed him to play the computer.

I had a chat with my dad and he assured me that he'd only let my brother play when I was out with my friends.

I reluctantly agreed to this, however only because he made me feel bad if I didn't, something alot of people do to me as they know I hate disappointing others.

This continues up until about 2 months ago where it seems he is getting addicted to it and begs me to play it even if I am using it. I told him to f*ck of and get his own, which led to me being banned for a week and he got to play it all he wanted.

The week ends and I come back to a very laggy gaming set up. At first I though it was because it was cheap for a gaming set up, then considered it was possibly because my brother downloaded an apk of some game. In the end it was neither.

You see, during this week, my dad told my sister the password and she downloaded the one thing that f*cks up all computers. Roblox.

For anyone who isn't aware, this game causes alot of lagging when downloaded even when it's not running.

I recently seperated from my religious community, because of my sexual orientation. Most people in these situations would be disowned, my family has simply asked I don't bring any partners around because it goes against their beliefs (not that I've ever had a long term partner anyways) and I'm always invited to family functions since I only live a few hours away. Over Thanksgiving I went and all anyone could talk about was the babies. Oh you should do it this way, well you know this is the best way to... Blah blah... It was so boring.

Most people brought pre-made stuff like meat and cheese platters fruit platters, ice cream and the like. One of my coworkers is very well known for baking stuff, let’s call her Susie. 

Susie bakes stuff for the office all the time, and I used to eat her baked goods until I had to drop her off at her house. She was having car troubles and her house was on the way to my house. I asked her if I could come up and use the restroom because I had a drive a head of me. 

When I walked into her house the smell knocked me back. It smelled like rotting food and cats. Susie has like 8 cats and they walk everywhere in her house, including on the kitchen counter. I also saw a litter box that was completely full. I don’t have cats, so I don’t know how often they need to be changed but it *smelled*. Her bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned. Her kitchen was fucking terrible. Dirty shit and old food everywhere. From there on I told myself I would never eat anything that Susie prepared in her house. 

As I was saying her baked goods are an office favorite, so everyone was having a piece of her cake at the potluck but me. A few of my coworkers asked me why I wasn’t eating the cake, and I described to them the state of her home. They didn’t want to eat her cake either, one of them even threw her slice away. 

I guess word got around the office, and today when Susie brought baked goods nobody touched them. Eventually word got back to her that I told everyone that her house was nasty. People are distancing themselves from her. She says she’s filing and HR complaint against me for gossiping. I was just being honest with my coworkers, and I am asshole?

Edit to clarify. 
I did tell the coworkers “privately” as in I didn’t scream across the office “SUSIE IS A SLOB. DO NOT EAT HER FOOD”. I told a couple of people and they told others because most people think that it’s nasty AF to have animals on your counters in your kitchen.

Edit to clarify #2
Several of y’all have told me to add the fact that I have gotten food poisoning TWICE in the last three months to my post. I didn’t add it originally because there is no definitive way to determine whether Susie was the cause. It could have been bad sushi or a bad salad, but I have gotten food poisoning.

Not aggressively, Dog B seems oblivious. There are other dogs running around the other side of the park, including mine, but the three of us our standing in the same area as these two dogs.  I know the guy who has the dog being humped, and he doesn't seem too concerned, but he is elderly and I am thinking maybe he just doesn't have the energy to deal with this crap.  After about 5 minutes of this, I ask him, ""Whose dog is the humper?"" and he points to the other guy.   So I asked this guy to stop letting his dog hump other dogs.  

My understanding is that mounting/humping is a learned behavior.  And my concern is that my dog will see this as acceptable behavior and pick it up with some Monkey See - Monkey Do bullcrap. 

I don't remember my exact words, but I wasn't confrontational, I said something along the lines of ""Come on man you can't let your dog hump other dogs""  

Obviously he had no concern about this, and he says ""Un-huh, you think I should do something about it?""

I responded ""Yeah, push your dog off, It's a learned behavior, I don't want my dog picking it up"" 

He told me ""be my guest""  and turned around and walked a couple of feet away. 

That was the end of the conversation.  Neither of us left the area, and remarkably his dog didn't really hump the other dog anymore, although not for a lack of effort.  Other dogs came and went.  After a bit, I said ""You guys have a good morning"" and went home. 

So AITA Dog Park Nazi? Or is it reasonable to stop your dog from humping other dogs?  I don't wanna be a dog park Nazi. I understand dogs are going to be dogs, it's a dog park and there are too many distractions for dogs to be completely under control.

I’m a college student who is home visiting for the holidays. I fly out today, and this all happened yesterday night. 

Let me start with: I have no issue including my sister in things I do. She’s funny, and while she definitely needs a lot of help with playing games, my friend group and I have always gone out of our way to include her. The previous day I was up with both of my sisters playing D&D with them and my friends until 1am. My disabled sister has a TBI and tired out around 11. We also threw a Christmas party with which we were also including her in all of the games we played. 

As this was my last night home, I wanted to run a more complex campaign with my friends by ourselves. We went to our local hobby shop, and as we were setting up, my father had taken it upon himself to drop my little sister, her boyfriend, and my disabled sister off in the middle of the game. We were all kinda upset but we tried to build her a character anyways. This campaign was just too complex for her, and she got frustrated and stormed off. My younger sister asked my dad to pick them up. 

Later I get a text from my mother, which I will copy and paste: 

“You were a real jerk today! I did not raise you to act like this! You should be ashamed of yourself! I am so disappointed in you! Tonight you were a bully!”

I won’t lie. I did kind of blow up at her when I read that. I was very offended, as I spent my entire break home cleaning their house (they’re hoarders), playing games with my sisters, and spending time with them. This was the one night I had planned out in advance to just see my friends. My mom and I argue back and forth for a while, both being pretty nasty to each other. Then my father texts me this: 

“I think you need to change your legal residence when u get back home to (city I go to school in). We’ll pay the final semester as promised and the rent so we don’t stick it to (boyfriends mom who co-signed our lease). When school ends your on your own.”

I’m a sophomore, so this will mean I will have to drop out of school. (For more context, they agreed to pay rent because it was cheaper than the dorms). Im just really confused and this is just such a bizarre situation. I’m obviously very distraught as I’ve been essentially kicked out and cut off. Over board games and DnD. I don’t think I was TA in wanting to see my friends alone before I left. I’m just really confused

Edit: just because there has been some confusion, my school has an hourly based program. A lot of my school days are from 9am-7pm, so it’s not that I couldn’t take out a loan and work, I just wouldn’t be able to work full time and go to school.

We gave her £900 and paid child support every month, the court ordered amount which I will admit was barely anything (£10 a week)

  I grew up in a wealthy family, I was spoilt- as was my husband and maybe its 21 years late but I think we owe this child *something*

I offered her a monthly allowance to help us look after the children (6,10,11) 

My husband gets home and now we are in a heated argument about how no matter what I should've asked him, this is *his* child and *his* choice.

Normally I'd ignore him but even our eldest child (23) agrees

824,No A-holes here,"Ex wife, bought a house.  When we divorced I sold her my half and left it at that. We are in mostly agreeable terms and she lets me go hang out in her house so I can see my son after my work and his school.  I can see him every weekend too.  I pay for his insurance and child support. For the past five years after divorce I've helped her fix her car, get rides, and fix anything that breaks in the house. When I can't do it myself I'll help her find someone that can and she pays the bill. However, I don't want to do it anymore.  It feels like I'm putting more work into this that I really shouldn't have to be doing. She says she is ok with paying me for it, but I don't want to do it for the money either. I make more if I take extra hours at work than go fix her car.  However, she is very accommodating for me to go play video games with my son and doesn't kick me out, which would be within her rights. 
I need someone's impartial opinion.  I am being an asshole here?


Edit: I'm reading through the responses. Yes, I am worried that if I stop doing the favors, she will also stop letting me be at her house.  Being that a lot of people have pointed this out, it seems like a very likely scenario. So, I think I'll keep helping. Also, if she got into a new relationship, I would stop being at her house so much since it wouldn't be right for her and her partner.",146,579,0.93
825,Asshole,A couple years ago my husband struggled with addiction. My mother in-law comes home from work Monday-Friday and has 3-4 glasses of wine every night and a bottle to a bottle and a  half on Saturday and Sunday. This has been her routine for decades now. My father in-law has a couple glasses of whiskey after work most nights. They both smoke pot and my father in-law has been known to take pain pills that are not prescribed by a doctor. They both think that they aren't addicts because they are in their 60's make good money and can afford it. They consider it something they do for fun. Recently I was speaking with my mother in-law and she was saying how she is so happy my husband has been sober for a few years now and she just doesn't understand where his addiction comes from. I finally had enough of her denial and I said well look at the home he grew up in you both drink and smoke daily its not hard to see where he gets it from he is a product of his environment.

826,Not the A-hole,"I do portraits in oil for commissions. Throwaway because my main account is my art account. 

I have a friend that wants me to paint a picture of his mom and dad when they were young as a gift to her. It’s a really sweet gift. I agreed to do it. I always ask for a deposit so that I don’t have to spend too much out of pocket on supplies. He told me that his mom was sick, so I told him to just buy me the canvas for now. He can pay me later. I gave him an estimated time of six weeks to finish the painting, and he was cool with that. 

About a week later he hit me up and told me that his mom was taking a turn for the worse, and wondered if I could hurry along the painting. I told him that I would try to have it finished as soon as I could, but I have several other commissions lined up. They *actually* paid me, so I need to have it to them in the time frame that I gave them. 

He said that since he’s my friend ,I should do him a favor and let him cut the line. He doesn’t think the others would notice the difference. 
I had to let him know that I couldn’t do that. I assured that the painting would be done in my original timeframe. 

In the mean time he has been telling everyone in ear shot how heartless I am for not finishing this faster for his dying mom.

827,Asshole,"I was hosting a dinner party for a few friends and the morning of, one of the guests writes and asks what we’re having. I told them I was making frittata. 

They asked what was in the frittata and I told them one was goat cheese, tomato, asparagus. One was bacon, cheddar, mushroom. They said since their 4 year old son is coming could I make him a plain one. 

I explained each frittata is pretty big as it’s made in a pan and I’d hate to subject everyone else to eating a boring one instead of a flavorful one (I only had the ingredients and time to make the ones I’d planned to so would have to scrap one in favor of the plain one.)

She asked if I could throw together a cheese sandwich or plain scrambled eggs for her kid and I said I couldn’t. She got offended and basically said why did you invite us over if you weren’t prepared to host people and I said I’m prepared to serve everyone *a* dinner but it’s a hassle to do a whole separate thing. 

She did tell me her kid was coming well in advance, but I didn’t know they were a picky eater until then.

Looking back now I feel badly because I know I could’ve just made the kid something like plain scrambled eggs and I didn’t do it because I didn’t feel like going out of my way. 

They can’t afford childcare and were coming over right from work which I wasn’t thinking about at the time, so might’ve been banking on me to provide dinner since they wouldn’t have had time to stop at home. (They ended up just not coming.)

 I just went to this party because my sister (16F) really wanted to have some fun on the holliday and I promised to take her out to have some fun, and there was no other events I could take her in the little city we live in.  I accepted to go even tho I was still very hurt from the breakup.  
Later in that night, me and a couple other invitees of her found on my ex's daughter (13F) on her bed, about to draw on her own vomit, because she was so bad and drunk she couldn't even turn around in bed to throw up on the ground. Me and a couple other people helped her out and left her by the carings of one of her mom's close friends, while the rest of us went to look for her mother. She wasn't there as she went out to buy more alcohol to the party, and wasn't back for a good half hour. During this time I commented with my sister and some other girl how it was irresponsible of her to let a so young kid to get drunk to that point right under her eyes. Her daughter is very stubborn and don't respect her that much, but in this situation in specific, my ex was there all the time and saw she was visibly drunk, and did nothing about it.
Yesterday she texted me asking if it was true I called her a irresponsible mother and I said that yes, I did it. She got mad at me, saying she was busy administering the party and that her daughter got drunk by her back and she wouldn't allow it. I told her that when I first showed up to the party, her daughter as already visibly altered and that she was close to her all the time, so she could pretty much had noticed it and made her stop before it got so serious.
She keeps telling me I don't understand because I'm not a mother, that her daughter is impossible and that she's tired of everybody judging the way she raises her kid. I still think it's her responsibility to check on her daughter's behavior, specially if it's inside her own house, and that she have blame to take on this situation.

We got there, had some food and rented some surfboards. This is where it sort of began. Sarah didn’t want to surf. We told her we’ll be out fairly deep waiting for some big waves. She said that’s fine. We all jumped in the water and out we paddled. Sarah stayed behind with water only up to her ankles. We’re having a blast, catching a few waves and getting wiped out every now and then. The 2 hours was up on the rental so we went back to drop the boards off. Sarah was pretty upset. She kept asking why we were out for so long and that she was bored by herself. We told her we rented them for 2 hours, we’re going to use them for 2 hours. We dropped off the boards, grab another bite to eat and went back into the water. We start pushing each other into oncoming waves, wrestling and talking crap for another hour or two. Every 15 minutes or so, Sarah would ask to get out for a bit to sit on the sand but we all kept saying no. Later, Sarah says she’s had enough and goes back to the shore by herself.  Luke, John and I said we want to keep swimming. Eventually we get tired, head back to the shore, pack up and jump in the car. About half way home, Sarah, after not saying a single word the whole trip says she’s really angry at us for not including her during the day. We told her we had plans to surf and swim all day, that’s what John wanted for his birthday. Furthermore, we live an hour away from the beach, we wanted to make use of the waves, not sit around on sand. She kept saying we left her out and so on. That’s when I asked her in a genuine way, why she even wanted to come if she knew what we were going to do all day. At least bring a book or watch some YouTube or something to keep occupied while we surf. She didn’t respond and just ignored me for the rest of the drive. The next 30 minutes we’re dead silent.

832,Asshole,"So I’m 17 and my 18th birthday is coming up in a little less than a month. I have dysphagia which is painful/difficulty swallowing. I can’t eat solid foods. At all. 

Anyway, I was planning on having every food at my party be puréed. We’re also having mousse and ice cream instead of a regular cake.

Anyway, I was talking to a couple of my friends about my party. Most of them seemed fine with the food idea, but one of them asked a couple times if there really wasn’t going to be any “normal” food at the party and seemed a bit put off. Another friend also said it was weird.

A few days later another one of my friends also said it was weird. They asked if they could bring food from home and I told them I’d really prefer if they didn’t. They didn’t really protest that.

On my friends’ end, I see how it could definitely be off-putting and weird. Maybe even uncomfortable. But I really don’t want to be excluded from anything at my own birthday. So AITA?

Edit: So idk when an appropriate time to edit with what I plan to do is, but I’ve gotten solid answers, so I’m just going to do it now.

I’m not going to have a party. I was on the fence about it anyway. I didn’t have a date/time/place set and obviously I didn’t officially invite anyone yet. When discussing what I might do for the party I mentioned I just might not have one. 

I’ve decided there just isn’t really a way to make everyone happy in this situation.

Edit 2: So, a second edit. First off, I’d like to thank anyone who threw ideas around. My original plan was definitely pretty silly, I just wanted something that wouldn’t make me uncomfortable/insecure(which is my own problem)

But I’ve also realized that ALL eating around people makes me uncomfortable so the original problems wouldn’t even be solved. Which is really a big reason why the party was unrealistic to start. But ty to everyone who offered ideas and advice!",67,45,0.7

While we were at dinner, we were talking about our relationships. We met our partners around the same time over a year ago. She told me that she and her partner decided to have an open relationship. Although the relationship is “open” he’s sleeping with people and she’s not. 

This guy is living at her house, not paying any bills *and* sleeping with other women? I told her that he was making her look like a plum fool, and that it might be the reason she’s feeling depressed and has low self esteem. 

She went off about how I’m uptight and judge mental about open relationships. She said that I didn’t have the confidence to share my partner. I told her that I surely don’t! And that she’s sharing her partner but he’s not sharing her. And maybe if she didn’t share her partner she wouldn’t call me and tell me how ugly she’s feeling, and how depressed she is.

When I got engaged a few months ago, I asked Julie and Michelle, my sister, and two good friends from college to be bridesmaids. 

I was hanging out with Julie last night, and she said Brian had told her he was really hurt that I hadn't asked him to be part of the wedding. I did ask my fiance early on if he would consider making Brian a groomsman, and he declined because he said he'd prefer to have his own friends on his side, which is fair. 

I guess I could theoretically have made Brian a ""bridesman"" or whatnot, but that's not really traditional and it would look a little weird to have an extra guy on my side. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong by only asking my female friends to stand up with me.

They like to do things for my grandma like buying her nice items (TVs, electronics, furniture, etc) but then call my dad, me, my brother, and ask that we reimburse them because ""we (aunt and uncle) can afford them up-front but in the long-run we'd really like to recuperate the costs). They never let us know they're going to buy her an item until afterward which means we get hit with a surprise request for reimbursement. Nine times out ten we agree to pay up because in the end we love grandma and want her to have a good and happy life with nice things. 

Recently dad took a month off of work to fix grandma's house. It was falling apart. He really couldn't afford to take a month off but he did, and spent $30,000 of his savings on her. My brother and I did what we could but we're young adults just starting out so we couldn't offer much more than labor and encouragement.

Two weeks after he finished the house uncle and aunt showed up. They had bought grandma new, very expensive furniture and electronics. Uncle then took photos of the house and the new stuff, posted it on Facebook and claimed credit for everything. My dad got no mention. Several of our cousins and their childhood friends and family are on their FBs and they all commented on how good a son my uncle is, how grateful grandma must be to have such a loving child, how every child should be more like him.

So growing up my dad was never around (not my moms fault he took off and never came back). And my mom had what seemed to me a never ending stream of relationships. I never had one consistent father figure in my life. 

I was also abused when I was really young. Not going to go into too much detail about it because its something I still really struggle with to this day.

Me and my partner have recently found out we're expecting a baby (I'm super excited as I never thought this would happen due to my issues from my earlier abuse). My mom had just gotten married not that long ago and she has just split from her new husband. After looking back at my childhood I made it clear that if she was going to start seeing loads of different men then I wouldn't be having that around my baby. As I had grown up with this and it really affected me. She agreed with me at the time. Then told me later that she had joined several dating sites. I of course wasnt happy with this as I thought I had made my point clear. Something else I've struggled with over the years is that she still speaks to my abuser and says shes only doing it to get him back someday. So she would regularly tell me whenever she spoke to him not really thinking that it would upset me. I'm not good at speaking up for myself and have alot of social anxiety. 

I then found out she had started speaking to an ex of hers who had repeatedly cheated on her and had also said some disgusting things about my unborn child. I contacted my mom and finally told her everything that upset me. Especially the part where she had been talking to my abuser for years. She apologised and said she never realised that it would upset me so much and has blocked them from being able to contact. She said she had also deleted the dating profiles and would stop talking to the ex. My partner never knew about her still speaking to my abuser and wants her nowhere near our child.

838,Not the A-hole,"Am I the asshole for removing a friend from my wedding party?

During the summer I asked a friend of mine to be in my wedding party. The problem is he’s a pretty heavy drinker, and rarely is up past 7-8 in the evening because he can’t stay awake. I figured it wouldn’t be a problem and he’d take it easy on the day of the wedding and it wouldn’t be a problem. I also lent him $175 earlier in the year, and it took almost 5 months to get it back from him, even though he constantly had money for booze, smokes, etc. It was annoying but he was going through a rough patch with work and I didn’t need it. 

A few months later his wife said she wants a divorce and they are in the process of separating, so he gave me $400 to hold on to for things like renting a suit, shoes, hotel, and whatever else he would need because he said he probably won’t be able to afford it by the time of the wedding with the divorce going on and all the other expenses. Not long after, he started asking if he could borrow a bit of the money for things. He still always had money for smokes and booze, so I said no thats not what the money you asked me to hold onto is for. The second time he asked for it, he said it was really important, he wanted to take a girl out on a date and he needed a couple hundred bucks, and he would pay it back, and it was really important and if it meant he couldn’t be in the wedding party that was fine. 

At first I told him I’d give him some of the money on the condition that by the end of January he had it all paid back or he’d have to take it all back and come as a guest. I didn’t feel very good about it after because I could barely get him to pay back my own money when he wasn’t getting a divorce, and I had a pretty good feeling that there was no way he was gonna pay it back. Plus with his drinking I was starting to have doubts of his reliability to help out during the wedding, and him saying he was willing to not be in the party, and the fact that I have no interest in managing a 52 year olds money for him, I told him that I consider him to still be a really good friend, but I think it’s best for both of us if he just attended as a guest instead and he can have all his money back, and he won’t have any financial obligations, and in a month and I half he’d already asked for it back twice and I wasn’t going to manage his money for him and I wasn’t going to lend him any money if he couldn’t pay it back. 

He didn’t take it very well, and hasn’t responded to me in a month now, so he obviously didn’t mean it when he said he’d understand if he couldn’t be in the wedding party was wasn’t planning on me removing him. At first I felt like I shouldn’t feel bad because I have helped him out lots, and I don’t owe him anything and I have enough to worry about without worrying about him, but on the other hand I feel bad because he’s going through a lot already and I kicked a friend when he was down and may have ruined a friendship.

839,Not the A-hole,"My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.

My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.

Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.

Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).

edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?

There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.

Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.

This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. 

Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart.

This has worked for almost 12 years now and I'm 21 and she's 19, we have moved out but we live together cause we goto colleges near each other and we've always been pretty close.  Recently I put the ""marks"" on a couple pieces of clothing that I was planning on wearing for a date.

I was able to get a back up dress ready and the date went well but I was annoyed that she broke such a long standing tradition.  I told her that I'm kinda mad that she did that and that I don't trust her anymore.  She apologized but she ""needed"" it.  I told her that I needed it too and that it was mine.  I wouldn't say we were fighting just having a discussion.

The next day she did it AGAIN and broke our rule and took a couple shirts I marked.  This time I was pissed and told her our rule of borrowing clothes will be broken if she takes one of my marked clothes again

Yesterday I caught her wearing my tube top that cost me a lot of money that id NEVER let her wear and it was marked, not to dig on her but she's not the most delicate person and breaks shit very often.  I basically forced her to take it off cause I didn't want to risk her ripping it (we are the same size but she would do something stupid and wreck it).  She took it off after some back and forth but she was pissed.

I had enough and said to not touch my shit and how our rule is over.  She isn't allowed to touch any of my clothes period and Ive started to lock my door so she can't and I don't touch any of her stuff either of course.

After three months of waiting, she finally provided one part of the art, saying the other part would be done soon. Over seven months of waiting she let me know that her computer broke and she 100% would not be able to finish her side of the art trade.

Disappointed but understanding, I had to commission another artist for replacement art as I needed it. I offered a copy of the model to the artist as thanks for the small bit she did, and asked permission to sell the model publicly as I needed the money. She said I could sell it. I asked if I needed to alter it to sell, and she said that the model was completely mine and I could do as I wish. 

A week later she gave me a “completed” part of her trade, though the second piece of art was nowhere near the quality of the first part and I told her that I already was in the process of getting another commission, and I do not feel like the art trade was honored. She said that was fine and she was sorry still. 

I held onto the model for a bit, not putting it immediately to sale since I got overloaded with work. Finally I had a break last month so I asked again to double check permission to sell, and she said it was fine. 

I finally put it for sale and someone commissioned me to make a similar model with different features and colors. 

She (the original art trade artist) messaged me out of the blue saying that she is uncomfortable with the changes to the model, and wants me to halt all sales of the original and the alterations. She also added that she would now be fine with sales of the models if she received royalties from them.

I told her that this was not our previous agreement, and I will be honoring what was agreed upon. I include credit to the original concept (her character) with the purchase of the model. I intend to keep selling the model.


TL;dr: I made a 3D model of an artist’s character and she gave me complete permission to sell it. Now that it’s being sold, she is asking for royalties even though it wasn’t agreed upon. Am I the asshole for following previous agreements?",35,60,0.88
845,Not the A-hole,"Now, before you just straight into calling me the A-hole let me explain. 
About a day or so ago I was given a heads up by my cousin (23 F) that she'd be having a small get together in our home town for her birthday. Her and I have always been very close and she practically begged and pleaded that I'd be there, since I haven't visited in a while. (It's about a 2-3 hour drive from where im currently located) so I get all dressed up , nothing too crazy and I head out 8AM. Whilst at the get together there were lots of our family and a few of her college friends. I noticed there was one friend of hers that was CONSTANTLY STARING AT ME. I mean not like glances here and there but staring daggers into my soul. I let my cousin know what was going on and she kindly introduced us... 
C is cousin, CF is Cousins friend, Me is me. 


Cousin: Hey CF! This is my little cousin op. 

Me: hey!  im only younger by 3 years lol. 

CF: oh hey! Very nice to meet you Op. I have to say you look beautiful in that skirt. Really makes your curves stand out. 

Me: uhh.. Thanks? How long have you and my cousin been friends? 

I was just saying anything to avoid that really awkward compliment. 

(Also I had a long sleeved back shirt on and a knee length gold skirt nothing provocative) 

Now at this point I kinda brush it off because I take it as him just being overly nice. I thank him and we continue with basic pleasant chit chat. It wasn't until he started getting a lot friendlier than i enjoyed. Little actions like touching my leg as we spoke (we sat next to each other in her living room with guests standing around) and basically playing footsies with me. Each little antic I continued to curve. He'd bring up wanting to be married and have children and just random things that had nothing to do with our general conversation. It wasn't until he attempted to pull that bs ""yawn and arm around her shoulder"" move that set me off. I kindly but firmly let him know that I was uncomfortable and that I am currently in a relationship (my boyfriend and I celebrate our 1 year anniversary in 2 days! 💚). He proceeded to act hurt and be upset, then stormed out of my cousins place in a huff. It was VERY dramatic and everyone saw him practically RUN out of the door. Cousin asked me what had happened and I explained I was feeling very uncomfortable and let CF know that, resulting in the reaction we all just witnessed. She said she'd never known him to be that way and it almost feels like she didn't even believe me.. When i got home a few hours ago i got a text from her informing me that her friend went home and cried as I hurt his self esteem. I just wanna know AITA for hurting him? I do feel bad but.. I was just so uncomfortable.",25,33,0.8
846,Not the A-hole,"Some background: Me (28/M) and my boyfriend (30/M) have been together for 8 years. We both have very good jobs and make a lot of money between the two of us. We're childfree, not the kind who call kids ""fuck trophies"" but we don't like kids and don't want kids. We also admittedly live kind of a party lifestyle. We go out to clubs a lot, drink, do drugs. We have an open relationship. Not exactly the kinda lifestyle a kid should be around. I have two sisters, Sarah and Rebecca. Sarah has a little boy, he's two, and she's raised him on her own since he was born. The father is completely out of the picture. Besides me, my family isn't exactly well-off. Sarah never finished high school and struggled financially. My parents are both on disability and live in a small apartment. Rebecca is attending university on a full scholarship.

During the holidays, Sarah was killed by a drunk driver. It's been very hard on our family especially with her kid in the mix. If none of us adopt him, he'll be going into foster care. My parents physically and financially can't take care of a young child and my other sister isn't exactly in the position to do so either, being a 20 year old uni student.

However, apparently, my parents and Rebecca all decided on behalf of me and my boyfriend that we'll be adopting him. Our immediate reaction was hell no, are you crazy? We have no desire to turn our lives upside down to take care of a kid, even if he's our nephew.

My parents and sister think we're being completely selfish and irrational and to say they're pissed would be an understatement. They can't believe we're going to let him go into foster care (their words). They know we make enough money to give him a good home and think we should just cut out the partying to become parents.

Rebecca was texting me this morning, essentially saying that lots people aren't ready to become parents when they get pregnant but they do it anyway. She also compared us to ""childfree guys who get their girlfriends pregnant and then leave her with the full responsibility when she doesn't get an abortion.""

I said that's fucking ridiculous because we aren't out here having the kind of sex that's going to result in anyone getting pregnant. We're perfectly content with the life that we live. She says we're terrible people if we don't give that little boy a good home when she ""knows"" that we could.

I think my family has lost their damn minds thinking we'd be good parents.

We've already made our decision regardless, but I do wanna know what Reddit thinks.

**edit**: I've been reading all of your comments and appreciate every one, even the ones calling me an asshole. A few things I do want to address:

\- I've seen a lot of comments saying I come across as an asshole or lacking empathy for the people in my family. That wasn't my intention, I'm not the best at conveying emotion through text (I'm on the spectrum) and I just wanted to lay out all the facts. I don't look ""down"" on anyone in my family for having less money than us, it's just the reason that they turned to me and my bf as the one who should take on the responsibility of our nephew which is why I mentioned it. We often helped Sarah out with things like rent and groceries when she was struggling. We essentially pay for my parents rent. I was very on edge when writing this post, my boyfriend and I had just fought over it too. I'm also very much still grieving my sister. None of this has been easy and I don't process things like this well.

\- I think I understated how busy our life is. I focused on mentioning the partying and drugs because it's a big factor in why I don't think it's appropriate for us to be raising a child. Not to mention the fact that neither of us like kids. But my job requires me to travel a fair amount (approx \~9 times a year, usually gone a week) and I work long shift. My boyfriend works a lot of late hours. We aren't home often. Even when we're not working, we're usually out of the house with friends. Taking a child in would literally mean changing our entire lives.

\- When I said over the holidays, I didn't necessarily mean this happened over New Years. This happened sometime in December which is as specific as I'd like to be.

\- I wasn't looking for ""validation"". I genuinely couldn't tell if my family was being absurd or if we were. The answers here seemed mixed. 

\- I saw one person call me a drug addict but there may have been more comments like that that I didn't notice. I will say that my bf and I aren't addicts, but I guess most addicts aren't going to admit that they are either. We smoke weed daily and occasionally do cocaine and ecstasy. We've dabbled in shrooms and acid. We drink when we go out. We aren't dependent on these things and have our life together otherwise. Bills are paid, we go to work sober, etc. We aren't having drug-fuelled orgies in our house with a bunch of heroin needles laying around. That seems to be the impression some people got.

With all that being said, we all got together earlier today to discuss some potential solutions. I hadn't mentioned extended family originally because we aren't a very close family. I don't really see my cousins or aunts, ever. Neither did Sarah. I know who the father of my nephew is and I've reached out to him. I'm not very hopeful that he'll even respond but it's worth a shot. A cousin of mine has also offered to take him in if need be, though her life is also quite hectic and I'm not sure if this will pan out. She lives on the other side of the country. I've offered to help out financially to whoever takes him in, but my boyfriend and I have still made our decision not to adopt him ourselves. 

Oh and no, my family isn't going to stop talking to me over this.

Lastly, thank you for all your input, especially the people who messaged me privately. I didn't answer everyone but you all gave me a lot of good advice and things to think about.",304,480,0.82
847,Asshole,"I'm 29, she is 28. My wife had been away visiting her parents for the past 5 days. One night, around 7, I decided to invite a few friends over to our basement. The basement is a great place to hang out in general and we often throw parties there. 

&#x200B;

At around 9:30 I just decided, screw it, lets invite a bunch of friends and throw a little party. About 15-20 people came to the basement and we had a party. Me and my wife casually do this a lot, invite a bunch of people over for a party. I didn't assume it was a big deal. Nobody ever goes upstairs, everything is contained to the basement. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, wife came back 2 days after. Everything was fine and dandy, I didn't even think to tell her about the party because again, I didn't think it was a big deal, and she was already stressed about her parents so I didn't care to tell her about anything here. Then she looked in the garbage outside and saw about a hundred beer cans in there and a bunch of bottles of liquor. She asked me what it was, and I mentioned I had thrown a party in the basement two nights before. She right away got insanely mad at me. Like ""YOU THREW A PARTY IN OUR HOUSE AND DIDNT EVEN TELL ME!!?"" kind of mad. I just told her I was sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal. Then she started getting accusational and asked me why I was throwing an entire party and not telling her, as if I was hiding something. We got over the fight quite a while ago, but I still think about it a lot. 

&#x200B;

If this was actually in the house, like on the first and second floor, that is a big deal. But our basement is just sort of empty except for a couch, a TV, a stationary bike, a punching bag, some boxes with useless shit in them, a tiny bathroom, and... that's really it. Its a huge basement, 90% of it is just empty. There is practically nothing to destroy or even make a mess of. Not to mention we've thrown like 15 parties in the basement before in the past 5 years we've been living here.

848,Not the A-hole,"To start off, I am a 15 year old girl and I have a brother that is 17. My brother and I have both been signed up for swimming at a young age, but they took me out because they feared I'd get longer shoulders and be deemed unattractive (if that even happens..?). Now I have been wanting to get into sports for a while because I've been feeling generally unhealthy and I wanted to try something fun and productive. There is also the fact that I have low self-esteem that developed heavily due to my lack of physical strength or stamina, so not only would it help me grow physically, but it would also help boost my confidence. 

Those are my reasons for my interest in getting into a sport, but my parents has always refused to sign up and I would always stay patient. They've always told me that I should focus on my future career the most, that they don't have enough money, and because I'm a girl. Yet my brother gets a free membership to the gym thanks to my parents, goes swimming, while his main focus of his desired career is entirely different from sports. I've also told them before that they could just drive me to the area and I'd pay for the fees (I started working fyi), and my mom agreed about putting me in for free at least once, then to make me pay for the rest of the other fees if I wanted to continue. Then once I asked her again, she magically forgot that I told her that, then began avoiding my question by saying that her head hurts (a cue that I should leave her alone, she also does this FREQUENTLY when I confront her)

So I just blew up because of how I frustrated I was. I yelled at them about it was unfair that my brother got more opportunities simply because he was a boy AND that he gets an extra addition of going to the gym, and that they have no right of saying they have no money if they pay for his fees (mind you his fee for swimming and the gym is around 160 dollars per month). I also started mocking them by acting like my mom and saying that my head hurts after blowing up. They started yelling at me back, telling me that I have no right to yell at them like that and that I genuinely make their heads hurt, and that they'll use their money however they like because they're the ones earning it. My other relatives have been laughing at me for wanting to joining sports due to my lack of physical strength, while others call me spoiled for yelling at my parents about it.

849,Not the A-hole,"I met my best friends MIL recently for the first time during a family dinner. I was warned that she was “really into nutrition” but that she had no formal education and was self taught.  Backstory: I have my Bachelors of Science in Nutrition. MIL was nice enough, about 5 minutes into our meal she starts talking about how she has started selling a supplement (juice based) and proceeds to hand me her freshly printed business card. It says she is a ‘certified nutritionist’ (she doesn’t know my educational background). 

Fact: there is no such thing as a’ certified nutritionist’ in fact the word nutritionist holds no meaning academically, anyone can claim this. (If you want to see a professional, make sure they are a registered dietitian) 

I tried to change the subject several times. But when she said something along the lines of : “I specialize in food intolerances and allergies” I called her out. I told her calmly (in my regular speaking voice.... the table could hear) that how she promoted herself was dangerous, and there was no such thing as a certified nutritionist. I added that she could be found liable if one of her “patients” had adverse effects due to her negligence. 

She is upset now and insists that I embarrassed her in front of her family. Should I have said nothing? Or perhaps spoken to her in private?

850,Asshole,"SIL (25) has always been close to my son (5) and my son used to be quite fond of her. In late 2018, SIL lost her baby at 34 weeks. She was really devastated. After this, she started acting weird.She'd ask to see my son a lot and offer to babysit etc which wasn't weird by itself but then she started treating him like he was much younger. Baby talking to him, trying to swaddle him etc. It made me super uncomfortable (it was like she was close to being delusional) and my husband and I stopped letting her see him. At first I'd just make excuses and say my son had xyz things to do but then eventually just told her husband I didn't feel comfortable with him being around her. At the time everyone in the family  (including her husband) supported me in this. She'd call and say things like she missed her baby (referring to my son) but I'd just say make some excuse.Her behaviour got even weirder for a while, she started treating her cat like a baby (putting the cat in a pram and walking around etc) and I just essentially cut her off. My husband stayed in touch with her and her husband.

Over Christmas she called me asking me to let her please see my son and that she missed her nephew. She apologised if she made me uncomfortable before and claimed that she's better now and that she'd been having therapy all year. I wasn't so convinced (she was in therapy even when she was behaving weird so Idk how effective it was. I saw her over Christmas and she seemed normal but she seemed fine before even). I refused saying that I was still uncomfortable. She started begging and saying she really missed her nephew etc but eventually said she understood. But then she must've also asked my husband cause he was trying to convince me to let her see him and saying that he wants it to be a joint decision but he might just let his sister see him cause ""he's my son too"".

853,Not the A-hole,"I have been dating my SO for just over two years. He has two daughters from a previous marriage who are now 13 and (almost) 15. I do not have kids, nor did I have any interest in dating someone with kids, but life is weird and the unexpected happens and I love their father and want to make this work. Things have been finally going well over the last few weeks and I’m starting to feel like we’re becoming a family. I know with their ages that I only have a few more years until they are off living their own lives. 

One of the things I have used to bond with the kids is that all three of us love Harry Styles. I saw he was coming in concert later this year and had been trying to save up to buy tickets to his concert for the kids for Christmas. 

A few weeks ago the four of us were at dinner with my MIL and the concert got brought up and how the three of us wanted to go. My MIL told my SO that she would buy the tickets for Christmas. My SO told her to buy three tickets and I would take them. 

Christmas comes and my MIL comes over with her gifts. The kids open their gift and there is a ticket in each of their box. I open my gift and there is a blanket and a DNA test. I was confused because I did not ask for either of these things and there was no ticket in my box. I didn’t want to be rude so I thanked her for the gifts. She then proceeded to tell the kids she bought another ticket and she will be taking them to the concert. I was in such shock I excused myself to my bedroom and stayed there until she left. 

I told my SO how upset I was. That this was supposed to be my thing to bond with the kids and his mother basically stole it from me. If I had known she wasn’t going to give me the third ticket I would have never agreed to her buying the tickets and bought them myself. He told me he was shocked and confused too but did not want to cause a potential fight on Christmas. He would talk to her about it later that week and tell her I am suppose to be the one to take the kids. I made a very firm stance that if she isn’t willing to give me her ticket then I do not want to see or speak to her for some time until I forgive her. 

Fast forward to now- my SO still has not spoken to his mother. Everyday that passes I get more angry and upset about it and it’s starting to effect my mood, especially toward my SO. I feel like I’m putting my SO in between me and his mother over something silly but I feel like what she did was so hurtful.

When my sister finally came back, she asked if the kids liked Indian food because she had never given it to them before. I told her I just gave them popcorn. She would need to feed them dinner still. She got all mad and said “you only fed them popcorn?! That’s horrible!” 

She complained about how she is all alone taking care of the kids, and needs some help some times. “The least I could do was give the kids some food.” I told her that the kids were supposed to be gone before dinner so it wasn’t my problem.

856,Not the A-hole,"So I've (20m) been friends with this guy (21m) for about 3-4 years now and he is terrible with money and also general awareness.

There have been multiple occasions when him, our group of about 4 other friends and I have all gone out to dinner and he's ordered and eaten everything then when the checks come he's forgotten his wallet or he didn't have enough money to eat out in the first place and didn't tell us. 

He also doesn't have a driver's license and since we live in the middle of suburban America we, the friend group, need to give him a ride most of the time we want to do anything and this often means going out of the way to pick him up from work. I say most of the time because it's not everytime, he uber's sometimes but he'll never tell us if he needs a ride until it's too late and the person  picking him up will be late as well.

Most recently we all planned to go to dinner and agreed to meet at 7:30, he agreed to go to dinner saying that he would get off work at 7:30 but he would still make it.
At 7:00 he messages the group saying that he's gotten off work early. At 7:20 he asks if anyone can give him a ride. The restaurant we all agreed to go to is right next to our houses and his work is 10 minutes away so whoever picks him up is gonna be 10 minutes late. 
Once we get to the restaurant we're all having a good time and everything and he's talking about how he's just bought The Outer Worlds and he's loving it and how good a game it is. Then the checks come and it's one of the restaurants where you gotta pay at the front, as were all standing up to go pay he says to me ""Hey can you pay for me?"" 
It wasn't much, only $15 after tip, but it's not the money that i care about it's the principle of the thing and this kinda thing happens too often. We've tried talking to him about it but he doesn't listen it just goes in one ear and back out the other. 

Honestly I'm sick of covering for him, I don't want to pay for him anymore or give him anymore rides or anything, I'm his friend not his babysitter.

Being at home for the winter break made me realize that being at home causes me to go back on my bad habits and it leaves me feeling disappointed in myself.

I (M42) recently grounded my daughter and I would like to hear the takes of some of her peers. I do not want to be overly harsh to her and do wish to treat her fairly.

Her friend responds by slapping it and grabbing it (disgusting). I later asked my daughter about this and said that she is just fooling around and having fun the way all young women do.

My friend is really shy, but she wants to meet a man so I decided that I would go out with her and support her as her wingman. I’m engaged, so I don’t want any male attention. 

Yesterday we decided to hit up a popular bar/music venue to meet some people and hang out. I like to dress nicely. I wore a cropped sweater, a pencil skirt, some light makeup, heels, and jewelry. When she got to my house, she seemed annoyed with how I was dressed. She kept making sly comments. I offered to let her have a look in my closet if she wanted to change, and she didn’t. 

While we were at the bar, I thought everything was going great. We talked to a bunch of people. I introduced her to some guys. I thought we had a lot of fun. 

However, when we got back into the car she started crying. She told me that I was trying to steal the limelight from her and being an attention whore. I was supposed to be supporting her.  The guys that I introduced to her wanted to talk to me instead. I was like, “if you’re so desperate and blaming me why don’t you fix yourself up some so you can talk to more guys. It’s not my fault that I’m attractive.” 

She thought that I was saying that she’s unattractive, but that’s not what I meant.

865,Not the A-hole,"My daughter was born when I was very young and my ex-wife ended up running off with someone and left the country as she couldn't deal with raising a child. I was 20 at the time and tried my hardest but in the end I couldn't handle working, going to school and being a single father. My parents tried to help but they were the other side of the country and it wasn't feasible. In the end my daughter was left with them whilst I finished school and tried to earn money. I visited as often as I could and when she was 2 I moved back to my parents to be with her.

My mother died when my daughter was 6 and my father fell apart, suddenly it was about me raising my daughter whilst working and looking after my father. I'll admit I wasn't the most attentive father as I just couldn't deal with it all and as she became a teenager I was rather strict with her. I didn't give her much freedom as I didn't want her to make the same mistakes as I did. I wanted to her to focus on her studies so that she'd  have a brighter future than I could provide for her.

When she was 18 she decided she didn't want to go to university and wanted to explore the world. This was fine with me and I explained she'd always have a home here to come back to no matter what she decided to do.

She travelled a lot with her friends but it seems by discovering the world she meant partying, doing drugs and excessive drinking. After about a year her funds ran out and she came home. She suddenly wanted to go to university and I was ecstatic about it. I offered to pay for her studies and even help her with rent and expenses if she wanted to move out. The only thing I asked in return was that she tone down her partying an no more drugs.

She decided to stay in the house with me and her grandfather in order to save money. At first everything was going great and she was focusing on her studies. Paying her purse wasn't bankrupting me but with medical bills for my father each month was quite tight. 
She passed her first year but that was the end of it. During her second year she stopped going to classes, wasn't coming home often and by the looks of social media was back to partying and drugs. I sat her down and explained she wasn't holding her end of the deal  but this just led to tears and screaming that I was stifling her.

At the end of this semester her attendance was so low that the university wanted to exclude her, however I explained her grandfather was sick and they agreed not to do anything as long as she did well in her Janurary exams.
I haven't seen her since before Christmas, she still texts to let me know she's ok but that's it. She's partying, back tending drugs and seems to not care about her studies. I also found out that despite me financing her she still took a student loan so she could have money to support her lifestyle.

AITA if I tell her that if she doesn't get the necessary grades in her January exams and stop doing drugs that I will cut all funding and allow the university to expel her?",157,1013,0.95
866,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: my friend wanted to use my bike to get to a job interview a mile and a half away. I said no. He couldn’t find another way there. He missed the job interview, am I the asshole?

Here’s some background: 

My friend recently got his car repossessed for being behind on car payments and in between jobs. He has been staying with me and my girlfriend for about two weeks. We told him that we could stay for one month while he’s trying to figure some things out. 

He randomly asked me if I was going to be working yesterday morning, I told him that I wasn’t. A couple of hours later I see him putting on a helmet and preparing to take my bike out.
I stopped him and asked him where he was going. He said he had a job interview. I asked him why he was taking my bike, and he said that it was close, and I didn’t need it for work so he was going to use it. 

I told him no, and he seemed really confused. He said “its just a bike, and I’m just going up the street, what’s the big deal?”
I told him that it was my vehicle. I use this bike to get everywhere, I don’t have a car. My bike costs $1000. He argued with me and said I wasn’t going anywhere and he would be back in an hour or so. 

I asked him why he couldn’t get a Lyft. He said that he couldn’t afford it. So I asked him how he would afford to get my bike replaced if something happened to it. I told him that he is obviously irresponsible and I don’t want him to take my bike. He accused me of throwing his situation in his face, and told me that the job interview was only a mile up the road. I told him to walk. He said that he wouldn’t make it on time because he planned on taking the bike. I told him no and locked my bike up and walked away. 

He ended up missing the interview. He has been bitching so some of our mutual friends about what happened and blaming me for him not getting a job. I have been told “bikes are meant to be shared” and that I should trust my fiends more so I’m an asshole for not letting him take the bike such a short distance. What do you guys think?

So long story short, my first gf died when we were 15 from a super rare case of lung cancer. It's been really hard to get over it because she was one of the nicest people I've met etc. Etc.
Tonight, my current gf jokingly told me she's gonna start smoking. So naturally I said please don't, you might get lung cancer among other things. She then said ""well when I die young that's just tough. Not my problem"". I suddenly got very very upset and stopped talking to her for a bit. She texted me saying I shouldn't be mad and I'm being an ass for no reason. I know this is a bit childish but that really hurt me considering she knows about my first gf and it really wasn't that long ago. Am I an asshole for being mad about it?

869,Not the A-hole,"A have a pretty solid group of girlfriends I've known for almost seven years. There are five of us in total. Two of them are getting married in the next year, and I am truly excited for both of them. One has made all of the other four of us her bridesmaids along with her cousin, her sister, and her college roommate. The other has a smaller party, but made everyone in the friend group except me a bridesmaid so that she could include one of her fiance's friends. Privately, she told me that it was a tough choice, but ultimately choose to not include me because I was ""the most reasonable"" and would understand the most and not stop talking to her over it. Which, in many ways she is right:  I love all of my friends a lot for their charm and bubbliness, but I am the most introverted friend and I am probably the least excitable. 

A few days ago she came to me and asked me to be an honorary bridesmaid instead. I have heard horror stories about these sorts of things and the way they start drama. I do not want that tension... I would like to think me and friends are better than that, but I am quickly learning weddings bring out the worst in people. 

I would rather just be a guest at the wedding. It also just seems more like a consolation prize than anything else, and I have too much pride for that. I told her I would have to check my schedule as I have a very busy job and I might not be able to make it to a bunch of important pre-wedding events (there is a bridal party getaway spa weekend her mother is funding, a bachelorette party in another state, and a bunch of other stuff). They don't really conflict but I was buying time. 

It would also mean buying a $375 dollar dress (it is the same dress as the bridesmaids but in a different color) and spending an extra few hundred dollars to get to the wedding early and stay longer. It wouldn't break the bank, but I don't want to spend it either. 

My sister (who was once an honorary bridesmaid herself) thinks I am selfish for making it about me and that I just sound bitter.  My mother said the same. My BF thinks it was shitty of her to exclude me in the first place and now I can be a bitch back if I want to.  But I don't want to be a bitch, I just don't want to do it. 

Am I an asshole if I say no I don't want to be her honorary bridesmaid?",193,706,0.96
870,Not the A-hole,"Today I had a guy come to my home to sweep my chimney. When I made the appointment I asked him how much the total would be for an inspection and sweep and he said $149.  I asked him if he accepts cash and he said he did.

So I gave my husband $149 cash in an envelope and asked him to handle the chimney sweeper so I could work in another room. I didn’t rush out to the bank to get exact cash or anything, I just happened to have it on hand.

After the guy left my husband was pretty upset with me and said he felt embarrassed by what I did. He said the guy gave him a look that said “seriously?!?” without actually saying those words when he took the money (a $100 bill, two $20 bills, and 9 $1 bills) and “smirked”. I wasn’t there so did not witness this myself. My husband said we looked like “cheapskates” for not just giving $150 or $160.

I’m confused. Am I supposed to tip a chimney sweep? I honestly didn’t know. I thought the price he quoted was the price I was supposed to pay? Also, if the worker wanted $150 or $160 for his work, why not charge that?

I am very shy and have social anxiety and generally don’t do well communicating with people I don’t know very well. I am also an extremely direct person and have trouble understanding when people beat around the bush and play what I call “social games.” Just say what you want. If you want $150 for your work, tell me that.  I find dealing with people, especially in service setting where you have to negotiate, exhausting. I am always unsure of myself.

My husband pointed that out how I don’t understand social cues, how I should have known that $149 was just what they say because it sounds better than $150 for marketing purposes. I should have known that I needed to give $150 and possibly even tip to not look cheap and avoid bad service. He was also pointing out how this translates to my professional life. I’ve had a hard time with job interviews and office politics in the past and don’t have any of my own friends or close family.

This really hurt my self esteem and really had me questioning myself/my judgement. I also feel bad if I am supposed to tip and didn’t.

AITA for giving the chimney sweep exactly the amount he quoted/billed? Should I have rounded up to $150 for etiquette purposes?

Edit: My husband said that the embarrassing/weird behavior was not the lack of tip (husband said he wasn't even sure if he would have tipped or not) it was giving $149 exactly, particularly 9 $1 bills that were a bit creased/crinkled (but still totally acceptable).  He said it just looked super cheap and weird.  I didn't have a $10 to give $150 even if I wanted to, I would have had to give $160 since I only had $20s.  Why pay $11 more than quoted just to avoid looking ""weird?""",84,97,0.91
871,Not the A-hole,"Today was my 19th birthday and we were having some family over to celebrate. Yesterday, I was out shopping with my mom and dad for food and supplies for today when I got a text from my BF, who unfortunately couldn't get out of work for today. He texted that he was sorry again and he dropped my birthday present off at my house (he has a key because he sometimes looks after the place like getting the mail if we're on vacation) and it was in my fridge.

When I got home, I looked in the fridge and saw my favourite champagne! It's a reasonably small bottle and pretty expensive. I left it in the fridge to stay cold and decided to save it for tonight, but probably would split it with my mom after everyone left so I didn't need to share. 

I went to look in the fridge not long after everyone got here today to get some of the appetizers and wine to share out when I noticed the bottle was half empty. I immediately knew it had to be my brother because my parents would never do that to me and my brother is one of those people who will eat or drink anything in sight without any regard as to who it belongs to. 

I confronted him then because I was so pissed and he said ""yeah that was me, I didn't know it was yours."" I got even more pissed and loudly said ""Are you serious? Who the fuck just drinks an unopened bottle of champagne in the fridge they KNOW isn't theirs? Why are you so selfish? Why can't I have food in the cupboard or drinks in the fridge without being constantly worried you're going to eat it before I do?""

He didn't say anything back. He went off to his room for the rest of the night. I apologized to the people there for the outburst and just said I was really, really frustrated then we continued the party.

After everyone left, my mom sat me down and told me she understand why I was so angry and I have every right to be pissed at my brother, but I should've waited until after the guests left to make a scene. I do kind of wish I had been able to hold my anger back for a while, but at the same time, IDGAF if my friends and extended family know what a selfish POS my brother is.

872,Everyone Sucks,"My son is in the 7th grade and has this history teacher named ""Ms. Lipston."" I have both my BA and Master's in US History so I was excited that my son finally got to take the same classes that I loved. I tried to build a relationship with Ms. Lipston, but she was pretty cold. Fine. Not all teachers want to see or deal with any parents. I get it.

Before the break, I got a call from the school nurse that my son was ill. He had a high fever and needed to go home. I picked him up and as a courtesy, I emailed his teachers letting them know he was ill and going home. I was shocked when Ms. Lipston emailed me and said that my son was not sick. She said that his fever was from his drinking hot soup (yes, the have a vending machine that serves hot broth) and then going to the nurse knowing that the thermometer reading would be high, thus he gets to go home for the day, right before the 2 week Xmas break.

Now, my son is no dumbass, but if this were true then I got to give props to my son for thinking of something so genius and give props to Ms. Lipston for knowing what's up. I took my son to urgent care and they examined him. They said he was coming down with the flu. He wasn't faking anything. And then he got really sick with pneumonia and needed to go back to urgent care for medication.

I replied back to Ms. Lipston a week later (a week into the break) that as it turns out, he really was sick. I made a joke that I hope she didn't get it. She wrote back that she never said that he wasn't sick. I reread the email she sent...yes she did. So I wrote back to get more information about this thing with my son drinking hot soup and made it clear that I wasn't upset, but was curious. I would have been fine if she admitted she made a mistake or even a joke about it. I am not some psycho dad. I just wanted to make sure SHE knew my son wasn't faking it. She replied that she never specifically said that my son was being manipulative.

That did piss me off because she is the teacher who lectures students about integrity and owning up to your mistakes and she is doing the opposite. I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy, so I posted her original email and her responses to me on FB. I didn't give her name, but some parents figured it out. I guess it got back to her because the principal asked to schedule a meeting with me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For everyone saying that I should have taken up the issue with the teacher. That is EXACTLY what I was trying to do. I wasn't being a dick, abrasive, defensive, mean or angry. And actually I couldn't have cared less about her making a mistake. My biggest issue is that she often incorporates themes of ethics and integrity into the lessons plans which I appreciate so it bothered me greatly that she thinks my son is a liar or dishonest. I was trying to either correct her that my son wasn't lying and/or get more information as to this whole soup situation.

&#x200B;

As a parent, it concerns me yet not something worth the time (at least in my opinion) to file a complaint. I know the principal is every parent's best friend and the teachers have mixed feelings about him. If I brought this to his attention, I have no doubts it would have caused her some trouble which is what I did NOT want to do. Anyways, this was more of a communication issue between me and the teacher and less of a classroom problem.

&#x200B;

I wanted to know if I was crazy one which is why I posted it on FB without her name. People made their comments. I assumed another parent figured out who the teacher was and tipped her off about the post. She's furious about it. Someone said she's doing ""damage control.""

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Here's my clapback to the Reddit teachers calling me the asshole. I hope you can find the humor in my being told to find something else better to do when you're probably posting in the classroom.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: Saying you're a teacher doesn't make your argument any more valid.

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: People who are saying that she might be a bitch to my son to get back at me are wrong. She's already a bitch to everyone.

&#x200B;

EDIT 5: I got another email for the principal because he wants to meet first thing on Monday, before my son goes to her class. I asked him what was the purpose of the meeting and he said there was no meeting - more like a ""mediation"" - it had to do with something I posted on FB and she is apparently ""distraught."" I asked if she was ""distraught"" over her calling my son a liar or the post and he said we'll discuss Monday. He wants to meet with me first, then all three and then a meeting with her. He asked me to take the post down until we meet. As a courtesy, I will take it down pending the ""mediation.""

&#x200B;

EDIT: So I had this mediation with the principal and explained my intentions. He agreed with me more than what he needed to. Then Ms. Lipston came in and was all over the map. She didn't do herself any favors. She kept on trying to ""one-up"" me over the posting of her emails. For example, she said I ""leaked"" them LOL. I told her that I respected that she had some fire in her belly for someone with such a cold personality, but unless she was going to admit that she was wrong and apologized then I'm reposting those emails. 

Principal intervened and chewed her out. She turned as bright as a tomato. Then he excused her. He asked me NOT to repost because it would be harder to reprimand her ""officially"" later on as he wanted to make it more administrative than personal. 

At the end of the day, she posted a notice on her class website that she was going to be out all week LOL.",1111,2848,0.92

Thanks for weighing in everyone.  After sleeping on it and listening to some of your input I agree the comment should have been left out. 

Thanks! 





I work in a specialized department at my company with a slightly small group of people.  

Usually some of us grab coffee together in the mornings.  Now we are all paid very well to begin with, but under certain circumstances, some of us are given a bonus (20%) for a day or multiple days at a time.  

Generally, the guys getting the bonus will pay for the other guys breakfast (5-7 dollars).  I've paid for breakfast multiple times for one person, we'll call him Phil, wether I'm getting the daily bonus or not as sometimes it's easier.  Say the waitress forgets to split the check, I'll just take it and pay for Phil instead of asking her to redo it. Phil does not do this.  He will make the waitress redo the check. 

Phil, although he regularly gets the bonus, has never offered to pay.  I'm found out from other people in the department, that Phil is known for always accepting the free breakfast, but never reciprocating.  One time I paid on my way out, and he didn't even feel inclined to leave a tip.  Luckily the other person I paid for, took care of it.   

Personally, I don't care.  I buy for someone to be nice, and usually decline if people try to purchase for me, but he's never even thanked me for buying. 

Recently we were out, and all the guys getting the daily bonus asked for combined checks.  Then it got to us, and Phil asked for individual checks.   I interrupted and said ""No, one check is fine, I don't want him to struggle paying the mortgage this month.""

Now, most people in the department loved my response, but I'm hearing a few guys think it was rude.  I think it was perfectly acceptable. So what say you reddit, AITA?



Edited for Info

1. It is absolutely not a money issue.  

2. He's done this his entire career. 

3. You don't understand the context of it, but people who received the bonus, usually pay for the other guy for a reason.  They are not required to, but it's considered polite to do so.

4. My bigger issue is the Never saying thank you, and going out of his way to split the check when it's possible he'll have to pay. 

5. I did stop buying for him, but this particular situation made me want to, just out of spite.",77,191,0.94

When he came back he seemed to be a lot better. He was taking his medicine, hanging out with his friends. He also made a new friend at hospital. 17 y.o boy. That boy lives closer to me, so when my son stayed with me(weekends), they’d hang out at my house. They were really close. 

Then they started fighting about something, I still don’t know what, and my son was incredibly stressed. I could hear him crying in his room, I tried to talk to him but he refused to. Me and his dad talked, we decided it would be best if he spent more time at his home, so he wouldn’t have to see his friend. 

It was fine for first two weeks, then he said he wanted to see his friend. We said it would be better if they didn’t see each other. He got really upset over that, but we told him that our decision was final. He started throwing tantrum and breaking stuff in his room. Next day he snuck out to see him and we caught him. We grounded him and took his electronics. He went mad at that point, he broke literally everything in his room.


I was just so damn tired, I couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even talk to him. I told his dad that if he needed anything he could contact my parents and left.

876,Not the A-hole,"I run an all-inclusive wedding venue with my husband and parents. My older sister has an eleven year old daughter (her only child) whom she is very protective of (only lets certain people watch her, like my parents). 

My niece is at my parent’s house and tells my mom that she has a friend who’s mom owns a bunch of stores around the area and wants a big fancy wedding, but hasn’t been able to find a venue.

My mom starts texting with this person to talk about her wedding. This lady tells her to come down to her store the next day so they can talk in person and she offers my mom a store discount.

So my mom ends up going to meet this lady at her store with my niece, but the lady makes up a bunch of excuses as to why she can’t meet them then. My mom ends up buying a pair of shoes at the store and leaving. The lady texts my mom later apologizing for not meeting her and asks if she got her discount. My mom said she didn’t, but it was ok. The lady ends up setting up a tour of the venue. 

My dad picks up my niece to babysit on the same day as the tour (convenient right?). He stops to open the gate and my niece points to something on the ground. My dad goes and picks it up, it’s an envelope with $20 and a note apologizing for mom not getting her discount.

So the time for the tour rolls around and the lady wastes about an hour of our time making up excuses about running late. The lady finally arrives, but says she is walking from the gate, instead of parking in the lot. My niece then says that she sees people walking this way from the gate (~1/4 mile away). I have been outside the entire time and no one has pulled up to that gate and there is definitely no one walking. We look around for her and my husband does a perimeter drive in the golf cart, but no one sees anyone. The lady texts and says that she is about to pass out from the heat of waiting outside for us, so she leaves. 

The pieces all start to come together that my niece made up a fake person, got a fake number, texted back and forth with my mom and myself for hours talking about a fake wedding, made up that envelope of money and threw it out the car window, pretended that she saw these people arrive for the tour, and lied to our faces. 

My dad takes my niece home and says that he is going to talk to her parents when he gets there. He doesn’t end up talking to them since my sister wasn’t there, but then he also doesn’t call/text her or put any effort into telling her. I tell him that I will call her, because she deserves to know what her kid pulled on the family’s business. My dad blows up at me and my mom, saying that we are blowing it out of proportion, that it wasn’t a big deal. He says that if I butt in and tell her myself that I will be tearing apart the family and ruining my niece’s life. So, AITA from trying to tell my sister what her daughter did?

878,Not the A-hole,"I (18F) adopted a puppy two weeks ago to be trained as a emotional support animal for myself. I am still in high school so I still live at home with my mom.



My sister (16F) has always been a little bit of a brat, she thinks she's better than everyone else, smarter, and always right. My mother has always shown favourtism to her. My parents are divorced and dad isn't in the picture.



My sister is prone to tantrums and always wants everything her way. And cries for the dumbest of reasons.



I take care of the puppy myself, and buy everything she needs. I've taught her basic commands already as she's very smart and a well behaved little girl, this is my first dog ever, she stays in my room and sleeps with me. And she has made me so happy in just a matter of weeks. I don't allow my sister near her.


My mother works for emergency services and on her night shifts I am in charge of looking after my sister, even though she's 16, my mother forces me to babysit her.


Fast forward to last night, my sister comes in my room without permission and my puppy runs up to her and she starts trying to play with my puppy, even though I've told her never to do that. My puppy gently bites her leg because my sister is running around playing with her, and my sister starts crying, literal tears and calls my mom at work, and tells her my dog bit her. 

My puppy is 8 weeks old and she never bites hard, she play bites, it's like a nibble and it doesn't hurt, my sister didn't even have a mark on her at all, my sister is known to be dramatic and this is the last straw for me.


My mom comes home this morning, and tells me that she is going to get rid of my puppy if it keeps hurting my sister. I told my mom that I'm done with my sister, and will be disowning her and moving out at the end of the year.


INFO : My sister has a history of crying about anything and everything she possibly can, and painting me in a bad light to our mom, I was diagnosed with severe depression at 14, mostly due to how different my sister and I get treated, she gets treated like she is made out of gold and I get treated like trash. Which is why I decided to get an emotional support animal. My sister loves attention. She fakes having depression, because she sees that my depression has gotten me some attention from our mom and can't handle not getting 100% of the attention. I say she fakes it because recently she told me she's just doing it as a trend and says that if I can fake it, so can she. I am diagnosed by a psychologist so I find it funny that she says I am the one faking. I am always blamed for upsetting my sister even when it's not my fault, I get the blame for whatever is going on with her, if she throws a tantrum then my mom automatically yells at me, assuming that I did something even when I haven't spoken to my sister in days sometimes.

881,Not the A-hole,"My adult daughter (25) hasn't visited my home in over two years and I feel she only talks to me when she needs something, mainly money. Here's some details. 

During summer I received a jealous fb SS of me meeting my gf's children (12,16,18).  Daughter was upset and wanted to be included in the ""fun stuff"" like mini golf, go karts, batting cages. The stuff you do to help keep kids comfortable while meeting for the first time. So I extended an open invite. Just come by. School was starting soon. There wasn't much left of summer.

September was her birthday. She was busy. I asked for suggestions for a gift but was told I could buy her a gift card so ""I can buy a bunch of sh*t"". 

November, her crew (bf,2 kids) is invited for Thanksgiving. She has other plans and she couldn't fine time during my break.

December, we agree on a plan for Christmas. Everyone is asked to wait until the entire family was there to open presents. Daughter waits until around one pm to claim to be low on gas and then cancels when I don't give her any money. Says shes coming on the 28/29th. I made a 12 year old wait on Christmas for nothing.

December 31, I take the tree down. Unwrapped their gifts and send a text telling her I wasn't going to allow this to happen again. I would no longer would include her in plans nor give any more money. I no longer wanted to participate in the situation and ended it.

She lives about 30 miles away.
She works a couple days a week for a few hours each day. Her bf works full time.
They each have a vehicle.",65,370,0.93

883,Not the A-hole,"I (24f) have a friend (26) who has always been avidly child free. I've known her for 12 years and she's always hated kids and talked shit about babies. I personally don't mind that she's like this, although it is annoying when she goes on rants about how ugly people's babies are, and I've known her to call toddlers assholes. 

I know this sounds unbelievable, trust me, I feel like I'm not in real life. She texted all of our friends last week to say that she's having a very important dinner and she needs everyone to come. This is 15+ people. In a smaller group chat, she told me and three other girls that she is 'expecting a new arrival' and she wants to announce it at the party. We were all super shocked, but very happy for her. She was very evasive with questions, but I honestly just assumed she was feeling weird about being pregnant/admitting she had decided to have a child after all, and I brushed it off. 

So, we all get to this dinner party at a local restaurant. She stands up to make a speech, saying (as well as I can remember), ""I'm really excited to announce that we are expecting not one... But three new arrivals !"" Everyone was shook! Until she handed out the ultrasounds, and they looked nothing like babies. We all looked at her confused, when she said ""Princess (her cat) has been a naughty little girl, and is blessing us with three little ones. I'm sure you're all super excited to meet the babies, and there will be a naming party when they're here!"" I think the last part was a joke, but needless to say, most of us were quite pissed she did this. 

Two of the women there have been very vocal about having fertility issues. I am also pregnant, and so are two other girls there. I feel like this whole thing was set up to belittle the fact that most of the people in the group (ranging from my age to mid thirties) are settling down and having kids. One of the women with fertility issues actually left upset soon after, and the other one just after her. I called a cab after I'd eaten my meal, and left early. I immediately blocked her on everything, because I'm sick of her being so anti-kid, especially when she was addressing multiple people who are pregnant and struggling to conceive. I sent a message in the smaller group chat saying that what she did was insensitive and disgusting, and she responded saying it was a joke and I should lighten up, and I obviously don't know her very well considering she has been vocal about not wanting to meet my baby. 

I heard from a friend who stayed that she ended the party with a toast to 'still hating human spawn'.

884,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend (23M) proposed a few weeks ago, and we're starting to dip into plans for our wedding. Something that's come up pretty quickly is the question of who's going to be in our wedding party. We each have a sibling – my older sister (27 F) and his older brother (27 M) – and we're planning for them to be our Maid of Honor and Best Man. We also have a shared close friend and previous college roommate who's going to be officiating. 

The problem, however, is that my fiancé has always had a wider social circle than me. He has a lot of friends, some of whom he's been close with for a long time (since high school), while I honestly have pretty much zero close girlfriends. I have a number of acquaintances, but no one I'd feel comfortable asking to be a bridesmaid. Personally, I'd be thrilled to have a small wedding party with just our siblings, but he's planning on asking seven friends to be his groomsmen. 

I've always been insecure about my inability to maintain close friendships (I have a fair bit of social anxiety, besides just being rather awkward), and I really don't want to be reminded of it on my wedding day, when I have no bridesmaids standing behind me and he has a whole bunch of guys on his side of the aisle. I also just think it would be obviously uncomfortable, embarrassing, and (this is less of a concern, but still) unbalanced from an aesthetic perspective. 

WIBTA if I asked him not to include his friends? I'd be fine with them being given other roles in the wedding (ushers, etc.), but I really don't want him to have a ton of groomsmen. That said, I know it's his day too, and I don't want him to feel obligated to be unhappy for my sake.",41,29,0.82
885,Not enough info,"We had a child about a year ago and my wife is getting ready to go back to work but she tells me she would much rather be a SAHM as she finds it better than her work. 

I would say I'm more career oriented as opposed to my wife who always puts family first. I've been the sole provider for a few years while she went to school for her masters and even now as her maternity leave is finishing up. We live pretty comfortably with my income. 

I am also in  a very niche field and the money can dry up any day and we've been very fortunate that things have been looking up.  I currently make about 140k a year and my wife would be making 50k a year. If I stopped working, i don't have the skills do do anything else so I would go back to working minimum wage jobs until I figure out what I want to do after. 

We have a mortgage that we're paying down, we eventually want a house, and then also saving for our son's future as well as any other kid's along the way.

Our daycare situation is simple, the grand parents both live in the city so we've been alternating between them. We don't have any day care costs besides activites that the grand parents want to do so her not working to save day care costs isn't an argumenet. 

The way I see it is, if we're both working now we can continue to work hard and make the money we need in order to buy a house, save for retirement and even potentially retire earlier. And if anything does happen my wife still has her job and I can find a minimum wage job so we can get by.

My wife wants to spend time with our son and watch him grow but I tell her eventually he'll be in school and she'll be out of her career for a while which would make it hard for her to get a job. She even did 2 years for her master's which I wouldn't want her to waste. 

Am I the asshole?

TLDR: I make enough that my family lives comfortabely but that can end any day so I'd like my wife to go back to work so if anything does happen we're ok and if nothing does we're able to save more towards our goal quicker.",222,265,0.92
886,Not the A-hole,"My husband has ptsd, and manages it as well as I think a person can. He tries not to let it get in the way of stuff we like to do. But as a result of this we’ve skipped Fourth of July and New Years Fireworks in 2018 and 2019. We used to go with my parents for those because they’re close by and it was a tradition.

He’s not too bad anymore, it used to be really bad. As long as he’s mentally prepared he doesn’t get triggered by loud sounds anymore, I.e watching movies is fine now. Fireworks seem to be the exception to this, at least viewing them.

My mother hasn’t been appreciative of this. Every time we missed an event I got a barrage of texts how he’s probably just faking it to keep me from seeing her. I’ve told her off multiple times but try and keep peace because my dad is great.

But this New Years she crossed a line. Since we weren’t going to the fireworks, she said she wanted to come to our house so we could still celebrate. At around 10 when no fireworks had started yet so my husband wasn’t prepared, we were all sitting in the living room(except my mom), and she comes running out of the kitchen banging a metal spoon on a pot as hard as she could.

This of course triggered my husband. I won’t get into it but he was pretty rattled. I kicked her and my dad out and told her not to call or text.

887,Asshole,"So my SIL (husband's brother's wife) and I found out we were expecting at around the same time. She was due 10 days before me, she was pregnant with twins and I was pregnant with a singleton. We didn't talk about baby names at all, neither of us were telling anyone the names until birth because my FIL has a habit of complaining about them constantly and saying how they will never get anywhere with that name, we are making their life harder, etc. I figured if he didn't know until birth and they were already named that would curb some of it, I'm guessing that was her thought too but I really don't know, and anyways its not important. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately she had complications with her twins (TTTS) and had a still birth at 24 weeks. They had named the babies on certificates and one of the names was the name my husband and I chose for our daughter.  I had a pretty uneventful pregnancy and gave birth last week on the 26th. We decided to use the name for a few reasons: it was out top pick and we couldn't agree on anything else, as well as, its not an uncommon name, plenty of people have the name or use it for their children.

 Neither one of them came to the hospital, visited us since, or reached out other than the ""congrats!"" text my husband got from his brother right after the birth. My MIL says she can't believe we would disrespect them like that and refuses to call our daughter by her name and just says ""the baby"" or ""my granddaughter."" My FIL has been complaining about it too but its hard to tell if thats just his normal complaining about it or if its because of the situation.

889,Asshole,"Okay so this happened 2 years ago but I am asking because I am faced with the same situation again. I was dating a guy who had a son and would constantly tell me how hard it was being a single parent and trying to study to become a firefighter etc. Backstory: I was/am a single parent. My child's father was never in her life or provided any type of support. (Guy I was dating knew this.) I had her before I was 18 and the struggle was real. This guy though co parents with his child's mother. She is remarried to a great guy who treats their son as his own and also supports him. They share custody and overall costs for their son with the mother/stepfather doing 70% of the supporting and the guy I was dating carrying 30%. Where I want to know if I was the asshole is because after him constantly telling me how I can't understand how hard it is for him being a single parent..... how stressed out he is.... and just being overall condescending and whining about his struggle, I told him he was NOT in fact a single parent. A single parent in my opinion is a person raising their child solely on their own without a partner helping financially or with overall childcare needs. He did not take it well and I got tired of the negativity and broke it off with him. Now I am being asked out by another man who is hash tagging #singledad life and when I ask him if he has sole custody etc, the answer is he co parents with the mother and they share custody. So reddit was I the asshole for telling the guy I was dating he wasn't technically a single parent? I'd like to know in case this guy has the same thoughts about single parenting.

Edit: The majority have spoken and IATA. There were other red flags when I was dating him and I let his belittling and whining get the best of me and became a gatekeeper on single parenthood. I am still cordial with him and will be contacting him to apologize for what I said. I don't like bad kharma or hurting others. Thank you Reddit!",59,42,0.75

One of my clients this year has given me a bottle of wine for Christmas. Even tho I don't drink alcohol myself, I was happy with it. It's a nice bottle and something I thought I could open on a birthday or if I have visits over or something. 

My parents haven't stopped badgering me to give them the bottle. 

Their logic is that:
I don't drink alcohol anyway;
The wine is from their country of origin, so it's relevant to them and not to me;
It's my mum's favourite wine.

My logic is that it was a gift to me and I wasn't planning on giving it away!

901,Not the A-hole,"Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

902,No A-holes here,"I recently unfortunately lost my maternal nan, and there has been quite a lot of conversations regarding wills subsequently.

My mum let slip that their will would have to be changed now my sister has 2 children. She said that the inheritance will now be split 4 ways instead of 2.

I like to think I'm not a materialistic person, but the message this sends to me has hurt me.

In my experience inheretences should be equally split amongst children and then they can pass to their children as they see fit.

The way my mum's would work is I would stand to get a quarter of the estate, and my sister would get 3 quarters (with a clause for a half of that to be split amongst her children when they are of age).

The way I see this is that I am worth less to my parents as I dont have any children currently. And if (god forbid) anything did happen to them in the immediate future and I hadn't had children by then, their future grandchildren would be at a loss.

I dont know how to bring this up with them and tell them they've hurt me a bit by potentially giving a larger sum to my sister as she has children, albeit with clauses.

I will not bring this up whilst my mum is grieving, but WIBTA if I did mention it in the future?

EDIT: just to clarify, the issue isnt with the split of money per se, I wanted to raise that it might be sensible for them to split it on a percentage basis for the grandchildren.
For example 50/50 to children with clauses that 25% of that should go to any grandchildren when they come of age. I know my mum wouldn't see any of her grandchildren favoured over one another, but I think she may not have thought through the process of the will.

903,Not the A-hole,"This happened several years ago, but I told the story to someone recently, and they seemed to think I was in the wrong. I would appreciate an objective opinion.

I was looking for a place to live, and a friend of mine owned a house. She needed some help with bills due to some issues at work (I think her hours got cut) and asked if I would like to rent a room. It was a good deal and close to work, so I did.

Everything went great for about ten months. One day, she mentioned that her sister was coming into town, and that she would be staying with us. I didn't have a problem with this. However, it turned out that the sister had four children between the ages of two and eleven. What's more, it became apparent over time that the sister and her children were less staying to visit as much as they were moving in permanently. The sister didn't have a job, and the kids' various fathers were entirely absent.

After several months, I'd had enough and found an apartment. The sister and I never got along, and the kids were constantly looking for attention (of course, they're kids.) When I told my friend/landlord that I would be leaving, she was really upset, and concerned about how she would cover the bills without the few hundred dollars I was paying her a month, and supporting so many additional people. I tried to be nice about the situation, but ultimately told her that it wasn't my problem.

I feel that leaving somewhat abruptly (I only gave her about a week-and-a-half notice) might have been rude, but was greatly eclipsed by the rudeness of moving an entire family into the next bedroom without so much as a heads up.

904,Not the A-hole,"I am 23f, I live pretty far from my hometown and see my family about 3 times a year, so not as often as a lot of them see each other.

I know there's been a lot of drama recently, my aunt had a messy divorce and then she moved onto another guy very quickly.

My sister got married to a guy with 3 kids and it's a little weird because she's not really the parent type so she's their stepmom but not really being an equal co-parent

My other aunt and uncle just seem to be fighting a lot, the gossip is that someone cheatd? 

I mostly stay out of this, but my mom will gossip to me on the phone sometimes. I'm not too interested in gossip but once she gets rambling she's hard to stop lol.

Anyway, I'm pretty insulated from the drama because I live quite far away. And I know I've gotta grin and bear it a little around holidays but that's for a very limited time. 

--+-

Now, onto the problem. 

I always thought it was good ettiquite to never give someone's cell phone number out without their permission. Like, it's not publically listed, it's not something people want anyone to have. It's awkward getting an unexpected text or call from someone you know you would not want to talk to. 

You just don't do that without asking. Like if someone wants my friends number, I'll tell them I'll pass their number on to my friends instead.

But after Christmas this year, it seems like my dad gave my number to a bunch of people. 

My aunt's new husband texted me asking for photos I'd taken on my phone over Christmas.

My sister's husband's son whos 7 and has his first phone has been sending me meme after meme.

My other aunt has called me to say that my mom wasn't picking up the phone, and could I tell her where she was and when she'd be ready to talk? It sounded like there was some drama or conflict going on, and I said I just don't know where my mom is or why she's not answering her phone.

I felt like my dad crossed a big line, so I told him that I was upset he'd given my phone number to a bunch of people without asking me. That was really rude and was putting me in an awkward situation. I didn't want to be pulled into whatever family BS was going on, but I felt like it would come off bad to not pick up our reply.

I said it was just basic ettiquite to ask before giving out a phone number. 

My dad got mad about that, he said I was irritable about every little thing; that ""my generation"" is so sheltered they can't even deal with an unexpected call. That it's family, not some telemarketer. 

I said it was about courtesy and respect, it's basic respect that most people expect of each other.

My dad was like ""I don't know who those people are but you're the one being disrespectful of me""

So I guess I want a 3rd opinion

AITA for expecting my number is kept private?",81,186,0.94
905,Not the A-hole,"Hey y'all! I posted on here a few months back about my mom, and as you can see by the title, this post is also about my mom. So let's get into it.  


About a year or two ago, my mom started frequently complimenting me (F, if that's important) on my weight and my looks. (Constantly calling me skinny, nothing else on my weight, *just* skinny. Just general compliments on other aspects of my appearance.) At first I appreciated the compliments, despite a *slight* uncomfortability. Now, I've realized that her constant complimenting makes me very uncomfortable for 4 reasons.  
1. It's always in front of people that are sensitive about their appearance. In my family of five, there are three people that are sensitive about their appearance. I'm not sensitive about it, it's just that the compliments are always in front of these three. I am the only person in my family that she compliments frequently. I'll get into that later.  
2. I am the favorite child. It's really obvious, and I hate it. I don't want another reason for my siblings to hate me even more than they probably already do.  
3. I feel like my mom isn't complimenting me for the sake of complimenting me, I think it's because she's compensating for herself. You know how I mentioned that over half of our family is sensitive about their appearance? My mom is one of them. She is very insecure about her own weight, and I feel like she is projecting that insecurity by complimenting me.   
4. It's just very uncomfortable in general.  


You may be asking, why can't I just tell her? I'm afraid that she's gonna pull the ""Oh, I guess I just can't compliment my kids anymore"" card. I don't want to hurt her feelings, and if I do, I'll feel terrible forever.

906,Not the A-hole,"I've been going to the gym for a little over two years now and my mom has been wanting to go with me for ages since I can bring a guest. One of her new year's resolutions was to start going with me at least once a month. Yesterday was the very first time she actually asked me to take her instead of her usual comments of wanting to go one day, or when some problems resolve.

I don't blame her for waiting since she has some legitimate health problems but I kindly explained that I don't go to the gym in January. She seemed mildly confused but seemed to accept it until she asked why.

I explained to her during January the gym is usually loaded with people who are trying to get healthy this year and it will be filled to the brim and there would be a crazy long wait to get into the massage beds or showers once we get done so it's better to go to a nearby park that has a track of a nice walking trail.

She wanted to know what would make February any different so, not thinking I gave her the honest reason that 90% of them won be there by that point, they'll either give up completely or move to diets, trails, or some fad thing as they aren't getting results fast enough while the few that remain will find a set schedule for not be there quite as often giving us room to move around and use what we want when we feel like it instead of having to wait for 50 people to use the treadmills for 10 minutes then go home or spend an hour tanning and getting a massage... Unfortunately all things I've personally witnessed twice so it's not like I was shitting on a group of people I never actually dealt with. 

She immediately changed her mind and told me that she would just stick to walking because she didn't want to go with someone that ""antisocial"" and would probably ""just be in my way"" and gave me a lecture on how all of those people just wanted to better themselves and I should try to help and encourage them instead of avoid them and treat them like a problem.

I simply wanted to explain why starting in January is a bad idea and that she'd get the best experience waiting until the phase ended but my dad called later to tell me I should have took her, let her see for herself and come to her own conclusions. He was semi neutral in the matter accusing her of over reacting and me of speaking before before I thought because she's failed in the past, several times and now feels like I called her out and said she has a ""90% chance of falling so there's no point to even try""

Recently, my boyfriend went on a trip with his guy friends. It's a yearly trip and in the past the mother of one of the guys used to make them a specific snack but was too old(? Not entirely sure what the reason was) this year.

So one evening when we have had two or three beers already he told me about the snack and asked if I would do it for them. I have never made this specific food nor do I really like it. Which I told him. I said something along the lines that I am wondering why they couldn't do it himself and that I would prefer making something different to which he didn't really say anything and dropped the topic.

My main reason why I didn't feel like doing it, is that he or one of his friends is perfectly capable to do it himself and I feel like I've only been asked because I am female. I don't even know his friends since they are all from different regions. 
On the other hand it is only a small favor and to be honest cooking isn't one of his biggest strengths.


Edit: all right, I do see it would have made sense to include that beforehand. The reasons I feel I was asked because I am a woman is that he in an unrelated event said that he wants his wife to cook for him.",279,652,0.9
908,Not the A-hole,"I’m a vegetarian and I turn 20 on Monday. Indian is probably my favourite cuisine of food and so much of it’s naturally vegetarian. There’s an Indian restaurant near me which isn’t 100% vegetarian but probably half their menu is. I told my mom I’d like to go ther  for my birthday dinner. 

The problem is no one else in my family likes Indian food except my mom and I. Our solution was that my mom and I would go alone to the restaurant on my actual birthday - Monday - and on Sunday or Saturday, we’d have family and friends over for a small gathering with alcohol, cake etc. 

I thought this was a good plan but my siblings are kind of mad at me for excluding them for part of my birthday because they want to  to eat too but want me to choose a non Indian/different place. They’re not ridiculously mad, more offended I guess? AITA for refusing to change the restaurant and basically telling them not to come?

EDIT Thank-you for everyone who responded and made me feel better about my decision. I've told my siblings the Indian restaurant is where mom, dad and I are going and they may come or not come. My dad also dislikes Indian food but he looked up the menu online and found a cilantro lime chicken dish he think he can handle. 
For those who asked why the Indian restaurant had anything t do with vegetarianism, I live in a small ish city with few restaurants with any vegetarian options or just 1 or 2 tops. To go to a better option restaurant would either mean driving about an hour OR the restaurants in my city that have more than 2 options for me are ALL ethnic restaurants like Indian, Thai and Chinese. It wasn't about going to a vegetarian restaurant but a vegetarian FRIENDLY restaurant with multiple options for me rather than the steakhouse my siblings usually go to or the fish place my mom usually goes to.

UPDATE: I've read a lot of the comments and I think overall i'm the asshole for assuming they didn't have a car and for assuming that because they didn't have a car that they were in a poor financial situation. However, I still don't think I would want to rent a room to someone without a car.

910,Not the A-hole,"   I have a racist sibling and his finance basically WAS a kindhearted person, but she's quickly turned into him. She switched her entire moral compass and political views to have a relationship without drama because she has no self-esteem. I kinda thought my brother was long over his 
racism just until this week apparently. 


   I caught them both at a family gathering ""joking"" (AKA pretending their racism is funny so people can laugh it off). First, they were NEAR my son and my brother was saying some vile garbage about black people that he personally knew. I mean unnecessary rude and racist stuff.  I was in shock just listening with my arms crossed. Then the fiance directly turns to my son seeing as he heard it all. But to my surprise she starts making silly jokes about race and gays with my son. She said the picture he drew looked like it was for the gays. Then she asked the name of his new friends - ""what are they black?!?!"" in a very disgusted voice. Now luckily my son is very bright and is exceptionally smart for his age. He just looked at her like she was a creep. 


    I did not ask kindly for them to stop. Nope. I slammed my hands down on the table and told them off. I know I said a curse word in front of my kid, but I was infuriated at how racist they are. Just how does anyone think trying to get MY KID to repeat their garbage is somehow funny? Why anyone in my family even laughs at them, but never tells them off is beyond me. Why I bit my tongue and didn't snap sooner, also beyond me. Just unbelievable. 


   I contemplated just keeping my son from them because they obviously have some serious issues. The problem is my son loves all his family and I don't want him to be upset. I just really trusted my own family more than to do something as dumb as that. I also thought they were becoming better people. I honeslty think they wanted to piss me off for fun, but there's no doubt they are just disgusting racist garbage. 
   Some people in my family write it off as ""they just have bad humor"" or some BS. Sure, talking about hitting someone for being black is a joke, sure. Talking about leaving your ""friend"" out of plans just for being black is somehow a joke, sure.

But eight years later it's still going strong. I'm a mechanical engineer and I can do a lot of the maintenance and fixes myself now, so it's been really cheap to maintain. It's stick shift which makes it pretty reliable too. 

It's had some accidents, one that dented up the hood before I bought it, one sideswipe from a drunk driver that just caused cosmetic damage, one time it was rear ended on a snowy day and I had to replace the back panel of the bodywork. 

It looks well worn too, someone who owned it in the past must have been a chain smoker because there's plenty of little burn marks and discoloration.

But it's mine, it's special to me, I call it my adventure wagon and have taken it traveling all over the country. I know it well and it taught me a lot about maintenance.

Anyway, I work at a techie company in a city, and it's a place a lot of people don't need to drive since there's great public transportation. 

A few of my coworkers, John and Tim, were going to a conference along with me. Our boss thought none of us had cars and suggested expensing a rental car, but he seemed stressed about the cost and was waffling on whether to even send us. Then I said I have a car, I just don't take it to work very often, but I could drive to save the team some money. He said absolutely, and I'd get reimbursed for gas and tolls plus a little extra for wear and tear.

So we got going to the conference in my car. John, who's a friend of mine, had no problems with my car. But Tim, who I don't know too well, but I know he tends to ramble on about stuff, just started complaining, and complaining, and complaining.

The car was so dented and scratched... It smells funny... The seats aren't comfortable... there's no air vent in the back... Why won't the window open... How old is this thing anyway... It shakes when it goes... Is this as fast as it'll go... It does not shift smoothly... Is this a burn mark here... You're using a casette??? I want to listen to something else...

I was getting annoyed, and I didn't really acknowledge his rambling and turned up the music. He started complaining about how shit the speakers are.

I turned around and was like ""tell me about your car? Oh right, you don't have one. Don't complain if you don't have anything better to offer."" 

He said that he didn't get one because he took the subway, but if I was gonna have a car, why didn't I get a decent one? Mine seemed like a death trap, it was noisy and uncomfortable, 

I said that it was a normal car and he was acting real entitled for someone who didn't even have a car, like he could talk after he got off the subway and started driving.

The rest of the drive was super awkward and quiet.

913,Not the A-hole,"I (21F) bought my little sister (16F) foundation a few days ago. My sister (Alya) has never really had a problem with acne up until recently. She's gotten acne that has left these reddish/brownish marks on her cheeks and chin that won't fade. It has been destroying her confidence recently as she has decided to not meet up with friends or be in any pictures because she hates the way her skin looks with the hyperpigmentation left behind. 

Last week, my relatives came over to celebrate Christmas with us and my mom wouldn't stop pointing out her acne marks and scars to our relatives and constantly would tell everyone to not let Alya eat sugar. At one point, my grandmother made these \*AMAZING\* cookies and Alya was about to eat one and my mom went, ""NO! DON'T EAT THAT! DO YOU WANT YOUR SKIN TO GET WORSE? THIS IS WHY YOUR SKIN IS SO BAD.""

Alya instantly retracted her had and looked completely humiliated. When I was around her age, I also had to deal with acne that left marks on my face and it demolished my confidence. I had always wished I had something to coverup my scars when I was going out. I decided to take it upon myself to buy her a little bit of foundation to help her.

My mom is a firm believer in natural remedies and won't let Alya use anything that isn't [this face mask](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwil7oflgOjmAhVSneAKHUdiAasQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCauvery-Natural-Sandal-Herbal-Grams%2Fdp%2FB01GF89B78&psig=AOvVaw3i0riF1yIOfuF-dr-m0QVB&ust=1578160672626903) on her face and insists that she puts a crushed tomato on her face everyday. I believe that these remedies might eventually work, but they'll take a lot of time and I wanted her to have something that could help her cover it up now. My mom is also very vocal about not wearing makeup if you have acne, but I don't think she understands how much Alya's acne is bothering her. 

I bought Alya some good quality foundation and she was super happy with it. She wore it when we were taking New Years pictures and my mom noticed and flipped out.

915,Not the A-hole,"So first time poster. Absolutely horrific story writer. So give me some slack.

Background: This happened earlier today at the airport. I am by myself with my girls (age 1 and 4) and am having to check my luggage in. One big luggage bag and a storage container (one of those 20 gallon plastic bins at target stuffed with Xmas in it).

If you’ve ever traveled with young kids and a stroller by yourself, you know what a pain it is. But I get my self check tags, move my luggage to the front of the line (there were tons of people standing around but nobody was in line.).  And then I go back to where my mom is waiting (at the front door) to get my kids (in a stroller) and all of the sudden I have this guy blocking my way. This was maybe all of ten or fifteen feet. My mom was making sure I got everything settled before she hopped back in her car.

I finally get around him and he asks me if he can go in front of me since he’s been waiting for 10 minutes. Mind you, I saw him checking in his stuff at the same time as mine at a self service kiosk, but he wasn’t in line yet. He was messing with his luggage and kids because he didn’t know where to go with it. 

I said no. I had two bags, it was going to take me two minutes (which it did) and it wouldn’t make sense. He literally had two carts full of stuff. So he asks me again and then let’s me know he has three kids (they were older - around 8, 10 and probably 12). 

So I told him, that I have two kids and I’m traveling by myself, so the answer is no. He then replies, oh you want an award lady? So I replied, right back at you buddy.

I felt like I was just pointing out the obvious. You have your wife and three kids that are old enough they can help you, but I should wait for your 20 bags to go ahead of me because you got there earlier in the day and was wandering around? 

So give it to me straight - AITA?

Edit - to clarify I did NOT leave my bags for 10 minutes, I turned around to see my mother walking in the door with my kids and got the stroller and pushed them forward - literally 10 seconds later. He saw that she was coming to help me check the bags and that’s obviously why he lined up behind me. Also, He stated he had been in the airport for the past ten minutes, not in line for that time all. There wasn’t even an agent when I put my bags down, and when I turned around she was coming to help me.  It’s not easy to push two kids, plus luggage, plus your carryons. 

Edit 2- next time I’ll just have my mother walk in the airport and then I won’t lose my place in creating a line.

Edit 3 - Everyone was just hanging around there wasn’t a clear line anywhere, because there was no agent.  She showed up only as I was moving my stuff to where I thought I should drop them off since I had self-tagged them.

Edit 4 - just to be clear, if he would have said, hey lady you cut me off, I would have apologized and let him go ahead of me no problem.",517,2901,0.92

Probably not necessary to name everything but it's permanently engraved in my mind so i had to list it all.. ugh anyway. Nothing was prepped besides chopped vegetable so I was left with everything and politely accepted the job because I love my mom and she was having a good time but it was a lot more than I could handle and everuone kept joking and teasing me calling me a nun and a square like oooh stop mommy's going to yell at us!!

918,Not the A-hole,"First ever post, sorry for any errors. I can't quite fit everything in here, so if you have questions please feel free to ask.

Several months ago I (M21), along with my dog, moved in with a friend (F20) of mine to a new house we rented together. We had both been looking separately for our own places, but agreed we'd be a good fit to get our own place together as we had been good friends for awhile and got along great.

About a month after we moved in, she asked if she could get a cat. I was cool with it, but about 2 days after she asked she arrived home with **two** cats. I had asked that she get a pet gate to keep their food and litter boxes separate from my dog, which didn't happen.

Next, her new bf started staying over nearly every night and staying by himself during the day while we were gone. She even got him a key to the house. To me, having him and his (unannounced) buddies over all the time was already enough, but giving him unlimited access to the place was too much. That and the fact that he wasn't paying for anything, either. I ended up spending most of my nights shut in my bedroom with my dog, and when we went out of my room I had to keep him on a leash so he wouldn't get into the garbage and cat stuff that was left out during the day. Eventually, he brought drugs in to the house and started keeping them there. Weed is one thing, acid is another.

This all came to a head when I had a small party. The only issue that ever arose was that many of my friends were also her friends that she also worked with and her relationship with her bf was being kept secret to ""avoid drama"". Everything was cleared beforehand, but just as my friends showed up, I got a text from my her that they no longer wanted me to have anyone over. Shortly after that, she sent back another text stating that she changed her mind again, but that she didn't want anyone from her work being there. As you can guess, one of the two people already here was a coworker, who she had just said earlier was cool to bring by when I first asked. Eventually, she walked out and saw us on the couch. She went back to her room and sent a text: ""Why is X here? I asked you for this one thing and now (BF) is really uncomfortable here."" I texted back telling her that she agreed first that they could be here, and that her flip-flopping on which of my friends could or couldn't be here while she was shut in her room was totally unfair.

The next day she met me in the living room where she said that she didn't think this was working out and very strongly hinted that I should move out. I told her that I couldn't just pick up and move again. I asked why, and she said that she wanted her bf to move in. I put my foot down and refused to move, saying that I wasn't going to move just to make her happy. I offered several times to work things out, but she refused to work with me.

Within two weeks she had moved out and into a new place with her bf.

We had a 2.5 hour long class every Tuesday night which everyone dreaded going to because the professor was extremely scatterbrained and barely taught the class. On the last Tuesday of the program, some other students and I decided to grab happy hour before heading to class. We all were tipsy, but I was the drunkest out of everyone. Throughout the class, I was laughing with my friends and just having a good time (something I did every class since the professor would just ramble about memes and shit). I was probably slightly louder than I had been in the past but I wasn't shouting or anything. At one point, I misunderstood what the professor said and asked a question that didn't pertain to what he was talking about. He could tell that we had gone out before the class, and even admitted that he thought it was funny. After class ended, my boyfriend pulled me aside and told me he was upset with me and I embarrassed him and was not to do something like that. I told him that me going to happy hour before class didn't affect him, and I had that I had every right to do what I wanted. Additionally, I had an A in the class so it wasn't like I was struggling in the class. He maintains that I embarrassed him and that I'm at fault and should have known better. Am I the asshole?

920,No A-holes here,"Two years ago my dad bought me a bottle of Chivas Regal Scotch aged 25 years. It is in a very nice display case and the bottle is very decorative. I have not opened the bottle as I was waiting for the right moment.

I put it back in the display case. I went to work and upon my arrival back home the scotch was completely empty. 

I inquired with my wife why she had drank all the scotch and she told me she hadn't. Her father was here and the culprit.

This became an issue this week when I had a small NYE gathering. One of the people brought their kids with them and asked for the wifi so they could put a game on a tablet for the kids. I told the person no, if the kids are here, they should be interacting with the rest of us (FYI, this wasn't a drinking/drug party), not sitting with their faces in a device, and if the parent didn't want them to be a part of the gathering, they shouldn't have brought the kids. This became a huge issue, and the person ended up leaving with the kids because I was so mean that I insisted her kids be included in the festivities instead of holed up somewhere playing Angry Bird.

Shes a good kid and pretty responsible. So I was going to get her a car now that she can drive. I also thought it would make it easier for her to get to school and back and forth between her moms and mine. I never really liked her having to take the bus all the time. They’re kind of sketchy in our area and it gets dark really early when she’s still out and about.

When I brought it up with her mom she asked me not to because her other daughter who is older would be upset about my her younger sister having a car when she doesn’t and it would create issues. That didn’t seem like a reasonable reason to me.

So I didn’t end up getting her anything super new or expensive, but it’s safe and a good first car. I also made sure she had insurance and AAA. 

As my daughters mother predicted though her older daughter was upset. She said it would be better if they shared the car.

I said no to that because legally the car is mine and I don’t want someone I don’t know or trust driving it. My daughters mom said “really, you can’t just help me make this easier” and hung up on me after that.

Edit. My daughters moms older daughter is not also my daughter. Their mom and I were never married or in a relationship together.

Our daughter has also mostly lived with me for the past 3 years and doesn’t want to share her car either.",584,1453,0.95

924,Asshole,"My friend is, god love her, kind of a hypochondriac and prone to anxiety about health issues. Once again, I love this girl, but sometimes she just goes off the deep end. I'm a physician's assistant, so I have medical training, which is relevant here.


In her 10-11 months of trying to have a baby, she's had two incidents of essentially false positives. In month 5, she had a positive test, followed by a negative test and her period in the evening. She called that a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage. Three months after that, she had the same thing happen, but the negative test and period were the next morning. She has been sad over this and views it as losing two children.

Her doctor has decided to believe her, and has agreed to give her repeat pregnancy loss testing, as the standard is now two losses, and her husband is also being tested. 
**Here's the thing: there is a 95-99% chance this woman has NEVER been pregnant.**

Chemical pregnancies are pregnancies, but the tests are just too close together to have been a correct positive result. She has of course been beside herself about ""being infertile"" and ""never being able to have children"". They've been trying for under a year still. It's entirely possible that her husband is sterile to begin with. 

The medical misinformation is really getting on my nerves and I'm tired of hearing hysterics from everyone in my community about a woman who likely DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I've told her that she's very likely never been pregnant, and apparently that makes me an asshole and insensitive to her ""struggle"". I don't doubt that she's sad, or suffering, but this is a result of poor education and poor medical care.

Edit: 

I've called her and apologized. I still have my doubts about her ever having been pregnant beyond a heavy desire to be, but I am letting it go. I let my anger at the general misinformation about sex and reproduction taint my friendship with her. I'm just going to accept it at face value unless I'm specifically asked for my opinion.",1408,6858,0.87
925,Not the A-hole,"Here's the rundown.

Details relevant to the context at hand: had a falling out with my dad. Not the first, but certainly my last, as far as I'm concerned. I've pretty much cut him out of my life. He's the type of father that believe his kids are his property, and that he holds supreme authority over them for life. He basically demanded that I follow in his footsteps of being a physical worker. I became an IT sysadmin. He doesn't like that, except when he messes his computer up.

My sister has had similar issues with him, but is much more lenient and forgiving towards him. Even forgave him for lashing out at her because she took exception to him minimizing the loss of her unborn. I still can't fathom how she let that one go; she's stronger than I am in that sense, I'd say.

Now, my sister will get married. Of course, I got invited, and so did my dad. I know my dad has this tendancy of being confrontational, and I suspect he may use that opportunity to get back at me. I certainly hope to be wrong on that account. Now I definitely don't want to ruin her day, I'd feel guilty about it until the end of time. BUT, I also told her that if he tries anything that's out of line with me, I won't take it laying down.

While I've made that promise to myself about not being a doormat when it comes to this asshole, I can't help but feel a bit guilty about taking that stance.

So not really a validation post more than it really is a much needed morals check for me. So AITA for standing my ground?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just to clarify, I don't plan on being the person that turns the volume up should a confrontation occur. I do plan on telling my dad not to make it about our conflict as it is HER day, and leave it be. And if refuses to listen AND escalates, then I won't take any abuse on the chin lightly. If it means I have to leave, I will. Better that than messing the event up.",76,86,0.88

Alice then goes off and tells me that working for Amazon is pointless that I should have a greater purpose than shipping people boxes of stuff they don’t need. She then talks about how in her life that serving the country was her best decision and she was happy sacrificing pay to do meaningful work.

Now if it was one on one I wouldn’t care but she said this in front of a lot of my friends. So I told her that her job in the air force was guard duty in Texas and data entry. That she didn’t serve the country anymore than I currently do in my state job.

It seemed like I flipped a switch she started cursing me out, saying she could have been called to Iraq. That I have no idea the training she had to do how tough it’s for women.

928,Not the A-hole,"I was flying home yesterday and bought an economy class seat on the aisle, right in the bulkhead behind first class as I like the extra legroom, being on the aisle, and being able to get off the plane first. After nearly the whole plane has boarded, a man who appeared to be in his late twenties or early to mid thirties comes up to me, and says he has the seat next to me but he has been separated from his wife, who is sitting a few rows back in a middle seat. He asks if I will switch with her so she can sit up in the first row with him. 

I politely tell him no, and he gives me a confused look, like he's insulted. He replies something to the effect of, ""Well, we were hoping to sit together on the flight and it would be really nice if you could just switch."" The other passengers are looking at me at this point -- I say flat out, ""I paid more for this seat because I like being in the first row and on the aisle and I do not want to switch."" He protests again and I make up something about having injured my leg and not wanting to move. 

Realizing he's not going to get my seat, he moves on. Eventually, someone comes and sits next to me (I presume whoever had the seat next to his wife's assigned seat). AITA for not switching so this guy could sit with his wife? 

I was under the impression that when asking to switch seats, it is common courtesy to give the person who moves the better seat (ie the guy next to his wife should be asked if he wants to move up, not asking me to move back). Also wondering if things would have been different is this had been a parent and child as opposed to two twenty or thirty somethings who can spend two hours apart from each other without an issue. I told my mom about this and she said she thought I was rude so now I'm wondering if I made the wrong decision.",149,533,0.87

930,Not the A-hole,"Okay. So I’ve been with R for about 8 months. A few months back, he asked me to move basically across the country with him for work. I said yes, and we have been apartment hunting and been getting excited for it. 
Yesterday, he randomly asked me what I thought about this scenario. His friend (who I’ve never met and never heard him talk about) is getting out of a bad relationship. She travels for work and is only home about 8 days out of the month. She asked him if she could move with us and stay in our spare bedroom. 

I don’t like this idea. I have never met this person, and this was going to be OUR first place together. A big move is already going to be stressful enough, I just don’t think it’s a good idea to throw someone I don’t know and have literally never heard him talk about into the mix. The dynamic of our place will have to change. If she has her room, are we allowed to have guests stay in there if we have family visit? Is the dog allowed in there? We were planning on having a small office space for me in the second bedroom, where will that go if she is occupying that room? 

I might be selfish, but I wanted this to be OUR move. 

Am I the asshole for not really wanting her to come with us?


UPDATE : We talked over dinner and he realized it was unfair of him to ask and he said he would tell her no. She’s not in any danger or abusive situation, she just wanted to change her day to day living situation I guess. He reassured me he loved me and we would have our move together.",97,262,0.95

This is when all of our problems started.  My wife’s mother was so bitter and so jealous that I was able to give her daughter and grand daughter what they deserved.  Instead of being happy for us, my wife’s mother would tell my step daughter that I’ll never be family, her and her mom are the only family she needs.  Even goes as far as telling the child my mother and father would never be grandma or grandpa, don’t even think about calling them grandma or grandpa.  Pure lunacy.

Fast forward to one morning, my wife calls me sobbing.  It’s early, she’s on her way to work, and she’s just so upset.  I ask her why.  She tells me that her mom has decided our daughter belongs in that bum fuck town in the middle of no where, that’s where her family is.  I feel like I’ve been betrayed at that point.  Why wouldn’t you fight to keep our daughter with us?  Well, too late now.  Kid finishes school for the summer and, sure enough, she moves in with her grandma.

This caused so many problems between me and my wife.  It caused my wife to abandon our life where it was and take a transfer to be closer to her daughter.  So what did I do?  I also took a transfer, almost lost my job because of it.  Completely turned my world upside down.  Just seemed like all that time, effort, and money I put forth was all for nothing.

932,Not the A-hole,"I (27M) am a “chill at home” type of person.  I was diagnosed with depression and its largest effect is on my energy levels.  My weight isn’t doing me any favors either.  My wife (27F) isn’t incredibly active, but can’t go an entire day without making plans to do something, which is fine.  I like doing things with my wife and I can deal deal with her plans most of the time, but sometimes I get home from work and just need to sit in my lazyboy and watch a Netflix. 

For example, It’s common to go from having an entire weekend with no plans to her sister and 5 year old to come visit for a whole day. Then the next day we are going to her grandparents. The whole weekend gone in two sentences. I know it might seem normal but it just goes on and on and on. I can’t remember the last time i had a no-obligation, get stuff done (or not) kind of day.  

There are two more layers to this. 

1.  She NEVER asks me about any of the plans. She is happy to commit my time and then tell me the night before.  If I ever want to make my own plans I have to do so around her plans. Plus I always talk to her about it before making them.

2.  I don’t know if she does it on purpose or not, but she makes me feel bad telling her I don’t want to do what she has planned. Sometimes i think it is on purpose because she is always saying “you never want to do anything”. I could do 8 or 9 of 10 things she wants and still be told this.  It just seems manipulative and inconsiderate. 

This has led to me becoming bitter at times.  We have small arguments about it from time-to-time, she keeps making plans, and I keep piling on stress. It’s gotten to the point that I contest her plans every time.

However, today she laid out “our” weekend plans and i said “Nope, I’m staying home. You can do that on your own for once.” She comes back with “We haven’t seen them in forever.” I said “Well I could go a little longer.” She stormed off and I left for work. 

From her perspective I’m sure it’s annoying to have to force me out the door.  I could see her thinking that I’m just being lazy. We get along great but she just doesn’t understand that I need more time to relax than normal. AITA for being complaining often and saying what I did?",414,2425,0.97
933,Not the A-hole,"Two years ago I had breast cancer and had to have a single mastectomy. I was lucky. It was stage 1 and the surgery was easy. It changed so much in my life though. I became reserved and cautious. I was told it would likely come back. To prepare for that and do the follow ups religiously. 

I entered the dating world reluctantly about 3 months ago. Mostly just to meet new people. Friends. I was very clear about just wanting to make friends and keep it casual. I am very reluctant to open up about my medical history. 

I also started a new job around that time. 
I opted not to do reconstruction with a fake single breast because of a lot of reasons. I wear a prosthetic at work. 

A coworker recently fixed me up with a friend of his. We talked for a few weeks before I agreed to a date. We had a lot in common but the conversations never got real deep. I wanted to meet him before I disclosed my medical history. We agreed to a casual friendly coffee. 

We hit it off during that meeting and he asked me to dinner. We went to dinner. A real date. It was fantastic.  At his car he leaned over to kiss me and tried to touch my breast either on purpose or accident.  I pushed his hand away and told him about my surgery and cancer. 

He seemed nice about it but said he had to go. 

Later he ghosted me which is fine but he told his friend, my coworker, who also didn’t know, that it was a lot like surprising someone with the fact you are dying or transgender or married or have 9 kids. He heavily implied I wasted his time and mine and he felt led on in a text he sent me a few days ago to “close it all out” (his words). I never responded. I don’t know how to.

There are 4 apartments upstairs, picture a square divided into quarters. The first two nights I didn't hear any dogs barking at all, but around 6:30pm last night I started hearing a dog barking and whining while I was making dinner. It continued non-stop for a few hours, until finally around 9:30pm I ran out of patience and texted the landlord saying that a dog had been barking for the past few hours, I couldn't sleep, and to please reach out to the other tenants and let them know. She got back to me saying that only one upstairs tenant (directly next to me) has a dog and she said she ""couldn't hear any barking."" I listened closer, it sounded crystal clear behind the head of my bed, but started to sound like it was coming from below me. I let the landlord know that it may be below me, and she said that the apartment below me was vacant. I went outside and peaked in the window of the vacant apartment below me and saw that the bathroom light was on and the door was cracked open. I told the landlord this, in fear that someone broke in and possibly abandoned a puppy, and she told me to call the police and have them check it out. Police show up and I looked like a total asshole because by the time they got there around 10:30pm the barking had stopped. Lo and behold, tenant ""B"" (neighbor) had gotten home and it was their dog all along, they had lied to the landlord and said they didn't hear any dogs even though they weren't home at the time.

I agreed to help out because she needed it (no questions asked, not even how much can you pay for rent), and told me it was only going to be a few months until she got on her feet (credit issues). When we started living together (I had just bought my first solo house!), I was kind of in a ""wild child"" phase. So we made an agreement that we wouldn't have any guys over/stay the night with the child around.

In October I started seeing someone pretty regularly. He lives about an hour away so it is tough to see him as much as I would like for the first few months it was really just he would pick me up and we would be out and about for the night.

Fast forward 3 months to now. They are still currently living at my place. Still is only paying about $200/month and still maintains that she does not want him staying the night if the child is there. I have a hard enough time convincing her that we can just hang out at the house. This guy and I are more serious. He went back 8 hours to my home town for Christmas, met my family, gets glowing reviews from all my friends and is genuinely a good human.

So last night I was flying from LAX to Lima. This was my 2nd flight out of the three I had to take and I had been up since 5am as I had to catch a pretty early bus to get to the airport on time.

On top of getting up early the last couple of days I’ve been working overtime most days into early hours of the morning and not getting a whole lot of sleep due to conflicting work schedules with my room mates so I was running on very little sleep.

After finding my seat on the plane I see a family of 5 get on the plane (Mum, Dad and three boys under the age of 10 ) and pray that they won’t be sitting near me but they were.

I had specifically booked a window seat so I could rest against the window and sleep and for some reason the parents had booked the two aisle seats and the complete middle row so the kids could sit in middle and they would sit either side, but the rows weren’t lined up exactly so the mum and dad were slightly in front of the children and had to look back. 

I could hear the parents arguing and and knew it was coming the Mum turns to me and ask me if I’d mind moving to one of the aisle seats so it would be easier for them to sit together with one parent in the aisle and one kid next to the parents in my seat.

I said I’d rather not because I was really tired and had specifically booked a window seat the mother explained and tried to ask again and I said if there were no other options I’d move they asked some other people to move but nobody else wanted move either.

She didn’t end up asking me again but she seemed pretty stressed out during the flight and    Ended up having to get up a lot

Her soon-to-be husband was on my side and said that he didn't care what I wore.

I should probably add a little more info about me: I'm a lesbian and wear men's clothing in my everyday life. I plan on never wearing a dress the rest of my life. It's not who I am and everyone knows that. However, an important thing to note and I feel like an asshole about this but I wore a dress in our other sister's wedding. It was four years ago and I'm a much different person now.

Anyways, I sent her an email the next day with some pictures of alternatives I could wear to help her see that there are other options out there. She said her answer was still no. A couple days later she emails me again asking about my availability for dress shopping. 

So I responded by saying I was sorry but can't wear a dress even though it seems unfair that I wore a dress in our other sister's wedding but I'm a different person now.

It's absolutely absurd that you can't wear a dress for 4 hours, when just a few years ago, you wore one for \[other sister\] without question. \[other sister\] has beautiful photos to look back on, where she is the center of attention and we are all there in the color she chose, the dress she chose, the shoes she chose, with our hair and makeup done, because that's what you do when your sister gets married. I cannot understand where your coming from because life is full of doing things that you don't necessarily want to do, or doing things that are out of a person's comfort zone, but you just do them.

Her husband has an adopted daughter. 

Now last year for my birthday I purchased and paid for myself and my husband to go on holiday, as the flights were so cheap I said to my mother ‘look there are cheep flights, we will probably get a large villa anyway so you’re more than welcome to join us’ she and her husband then paid for my brothers, my step sister and her 3 kids plane tickets to come with us - we paid for 100% of the accommodation costs.

The holiday was a disaster, her husband was nasty to my husband and my brother who has autism, this has then led to me and my husband not speaking to him since coming home - therefore straining mine and my mothers relationship.

Now here is where the AITA comes in, so my mother and her husband had saved up to do a long weekend in Prague late last year, however my mothers husband decided it wasn’t fair that I got a holiday for my birthday and his daughter didn’t so decided to use this money to take himself and his daughter to Amsterdam for her birthday instead!

I for Christmas decided to book us both a holiday to Prague since she really wanted to do and we need some mother daughter time since this issue us put a big strain on our relationship.

She has got annoyed since she thinks I only did it to be petty, her husband is angry and it’s all blown up in my face a bit.

So AITA for buying my mother a holiday when I kind of deep down knew it would make him annoyed?

Short version - my mothers husband used their joint holiday savings to take his daughter on holiday instead of going on a trip with my mum, aita for booking a holiday for me and my mum to make up for it, knowing it would piss him off?",84,448,0.93
943,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, looking for advice on a sensitive issue.

My best friend (26F) and I are both engaged. It's an exciting time for us both being in the same stage of life. I don't see her in person very much, but we chat on Facebook every day.

She's been engaged for almost 2 years (since March 2018). Unfortunately, both their families are very screwed up and not supportive. Her parents are divorced; her mom is a narcissist, her dad is OK, but he has no money to help with a wedding. Her fiance's parents are just.. odd.

She originally wanted to marry in 2019, but the parents threw such a big fit. Then they tried to plan for 2020 -- same reaction from parents, lots of threats and angry phone calls which made her feel awful. Apparently her mom is afraid of ""losing a daughter."" Now they're talking about waiting until 2022. I know this won't solve the issue with their parents. It may calm things down for a while, but when the date approaches, they will push back again. Despite this, the parents want a big wedding bash so they can invite all their rando friends (even though they don't want to pay for it). The couple refuse to elope.

For the past year-and-a-half, I've been there to offer her advice and support for every bump in the road. My engagement is going smoothly and I've set a date, which I'm sure makes her jealous. People have started to question if she's even engaged, as no firm plans have been made. She now messages me about it daily, usually in the midst of an emotional breakdown.

I've given her all the best advice I can: she's never going to make her parents happy, so she should do what makes her and her fiancé happy. They can't count on their parents' money, so they should host an event they can afford. She likes my suggestions but never commits to any. No matter what I suggest, she seems paralyzed and just says stuff like ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I'll never be happy,"" ""I'm too scared to stand up to them."" She and her fiancé have discussed countless compromises, but they always end up back at square one. Currently, they say they will sign for a venue in a couple months, but I know that before then, one or both sets of parents will intervene, and she will cave.

I've decided I'm sick of having these conversations every day when she clearly refuses to listen. I'm tired of talking in circles. I'm tired of trying to help her stand up for herself when she cannot. I want her to be happy, but I don't want this to go on indefinitely. So WIBTA if, when she next brings up her ""wedding,"" I gently tell her that I don't want to talk about it anymore? And should I also refrain from discussing the details of my own wedding so it doesn't hurt her feelings?

TLDR: Best friend has been trying to plan her wedding for almost 2 years, but parents keep yelling and bullying her into canceling any plans. She ignores all my advice and just keeps feeling sorry for herself. I've done all I can for her, now I want her to stop talking about it until she makes up her mind.

ETA: She's already in therapy, and has been for over 15 years. It's not the magic cure-all that people seem to think it is.",55,150,0.9

&#x200B;

I am a 23M with a long-term GF (23F). We have plans of getting a house in a different part of the country (where are better job offers) and getting married. However, my parents (70 and 71) really want me to stay with them. We have a big house where can two families live without any issues and they are pouring a lot of money and time into renovating it so I can stay living with them. They invested tens of thousands of dollars into renovating it, so they would make it livable for two families even though I have been saying for many years that I want to move out.

Every time I say it, they either ignore it or they say how dumb it would be to buy a house even though I already have one or they say how ungrateful son I am for not wanting to take care of them after everything they did for me (they paid for my university, bought me a car etc..). Sometimes they even say it's my GF's idea and that I would happily live with them if it wasn't for her.

Honestly, I love my parents and they did a lot for me, but I can't imagine living with them. We are just too different and we constantly argue about something. Sometimes it's really bad for my mental health, arguing so much. On the other hand, I know that they are old and they do need help. Even when I move out, I plan to help them and visit them regularly, I just can't do living with them.

947,Not the A-hole,"Hello!

My housemate went home for Christmas on 16th December 2019. I'm the only other person living in the house, along with his cat. Housemate is 12 years older than me and I am a female in her mid 20s. I was going home for Christmas on the 18th. Thus, my housemate got me to feed the cat until I left, and then asked me to set up an automatic feeder for the cat to feed him between 18th-23rd December. Anyway, I fed the cat manually until the 18th, of course, with no problems. I then set up the feeder on the 18th before I left, following the instructions on the box. I had a lot of trouble getting the lid on but had no reason to believe that I had done it incorrectly or anything like that; the clock on it was ticking etc. I left the cat an additional bowl of biscuits for snacks in between meals. The feeder is a second hand one and in my opinion, very hard to use. The cat was only going to get 4 meals in 5 days (not really enough in the first place), because that's all the feeder had slots for.

Not that this really is an excuse at all, but I had a migraine and was suffering from all of the effects of a migraine too (puking etc). Anyway, I went home that evening in spite of the migraine and whatnot - ""home"" is 300 miles away. When I got back on 2nd January after working remotely from my boyfriend's flat between Christmas and New Year, **my housemate informed me that the feeder hadn't worked and the cat hadn't eaten for 5 days.** On the 23rd, a neighbour came round to refill the feeder and discovered this. Another neighbour had also texted my housemate on the 22nd to say the cat had been meowing incessantly for food for several days outside their house (got his number from the cat's collar). My housemate got back on the 28th.

I basically accidentally starved the cat. I know I fucked up, and I feel like a horrible person who belongs in jail. I honestly don't know what I did wrong with the feeder, but I suspect it may have been something to do with the lid. My housemate is really pissed off at me and is being really patronising about it.

But like, in my defence, why the hell would you leave your cat alone for 12 days with just a basic, shitty old feeder to feed them? Put him in a cattery or don't have a cat. I have three cats who live with my mother since my housemate would not allow additional cats, and they're my absolute life. Every time we're away for more than one night (one night we trust my sister), we put them in a luxury cattery because we don't want to rely on other people and risk them being hurt or underfed. For context, I have a good job and can afford to look after three cats properly with vet care and everything, and can afford to put them in good catteries when needed, so I'm not an irresponsible pet owner. I'm moving in with my boyfriend soon and the cats will live with us.

Am I the asshole?

I'm finding it tough financially due to student loans and just entering a career. My BF is quite comfortable financially. I suppose I use my budgeting for a part of my reasoning behind what follows. 

When we have dinner together, I typically cook enough for a 4 person meal.  My partner will have a 2 x 3 times portion of what I have. If I cook more, basically he just eats more - he works quite a labour intensive job. If there are any leftovers, my BF will always grab them for his lunch the next day. He works far earlier than I do, and uses that as his reason to take the left overs rather than buying or making lunch in the morning. 

I started to get slightly frustrated that I always had to purchase more food for myself for lunches. So I have started to put a bit extra on my plate every evening with the intentions of saving a small portion for my lunch the next day - meaning sometimes there was not enough for my BF to have leftovers.

My BF caught on to what I was doing and said that I am being a really crappy person, since it is not his fault his body needs more fuel.

My mother (F, 50), was put up for adopted at birth in a region and time when records were sealed and poorly kept. It was no secret she was adopted for at least the duration of my (M, late 20's) life. To my knowledge, she never sought out her birth mother, and she maintained a close, healthy, relationship with her adoptive parents to this day.

Recently, she was contact by a woman (""X"") claiming to be her birth mother - fast forward a few months, many emotions, fact checking via exchange of letters, etc, they confirm this is in-fact the case. They've now met (despite living in different states) twice, and are semi-actively communicating on social media, etc.

Whilst I am very happy for my mother, this has been largely irrelevant to my day to day life; I moved out many years ago and have my own family, life, etc. Fast forward to Xmas, where ""X"" contacted me with a Xmas card asking to meet me and my family when she travels through the area we live in later in 2020. (Their travel I'm told is for unrelated reasons; but ostensible reason for timing of request).

This forced me to think on the issue more personally than I had previously, and I realized that I actually don't have any desire to associate with ""X"". I'm happy for my mother, and bear no hostility to ""X"" nor anyone else, but a relationship with ""X"" is not something I want for myself or my family.

We got together soon after splitting up with our exes and have been together for over a year. My ex-wife is paranoid (almost clinically) and convinced that I left her for my new partner. I did not.
My mother has been very hostile to my new partner, largely because of the nasty and spiteful things that my ex-wife told her, none of which are true. And despite me trying to explain that it was all lies, my mother wouldn’t listen and thus I didn’t speak to her for almost 9 months. 
Her birthday is December and for the sake of this and Christmas I thought I would visit her, talk to her and try to make a clean slate of it. I didn’t take my partner with me as I knew it was going to be an awkward situation. 
Things seemed to be going ok, there were a couple of snide comments about my choice in women but I let them slide. Later the conversation turned to my partner and my mother told me she had done an internet search and found things out about my partner; for example she had another child but had put it up for adoption (untrue), that her family were gypsies (untrue) and that she continued to believe everything my ex-wife told her. I explained again that this was all total rubbish, but she would rather believe the lies and her google search that was so poor it would make a 5 year old blush!

\- My typical schedule is leave for work at 7am and home by 6pm. 

\- My daughter is in school from 9-1 and is usually napping in the afternoon after having lunch.

My wife will clean our townhouse (3/3 approx 2,100sq ft if it matters) maybe once every three or four months and it's typically when she asks her mom to come over to help.  The mom ends up doing most of the cleaning. Wife might cook a meal for the family maybe twice or three times a month.  House is pretty messy in between.  Wife does dishes most of the time, but regularly lets it pile up until she really has no choice but to clean them.  Wife doesn't typically take my daughter to do extra activities beyond school (i.e. community park, play date, pool, museum, movie, etc.). I do my own laundry and prepare most of my meals. Wife does do daughter's laundry, but she will not do her own laundry for weeks with a perpetual pile of clothes in her closet.  My daughter goes to bed at 10pm (because she naps) which leaves me with little time to myself after I get home.  When I get home I spend most of my time doing something with my daughter or preparing and eating dinner.  We take turns bathing and putting our daughter to bed.  Wife recently started exercising and she regularly waits for me to come home and to do her routine and then bath which has really frustrated me because she has the school time or nap time to do those exercise.

I never expected wife to be a SAHM, but she is the one that has opted not to work. I encourage her to go back to work. I do think staying at home for so long has gotten to her.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I have my baby. She was escorted out of the room when the delivery started and was welcomed back about an hour after I delivered. A few hours later she shows me a picture taken outside of the room and through the little window of the door. It's a picture of me and my fiance looking down at our newborn.

As a present to my grandmother when I got a job after my doctorate program I redid her entire room for her because it was falling part. She’s worked hard her entire life to raise her 4 kids and me. She deserves the world and more and this was the least I could do now that I have a stable income. I did all the work myself and was frugal about it. new wall paint, decent IKEA furniture, and laid down some vinyl tiling, and a new mattress. Maybe $600 total to say thank you to her. 

After this my aunt started getting loony thinking I’d be helping with house repairs. She started asking me to do things and I would decline saying I don’t have money for that. Now on a visit home for New Years she brings me into my grandmothers bathroom and she took it upon HERSELF to sledgehammer the ENTIRE bathtub tiled area down to the cement fucking backers. She said she did it so she could investigate why the water stopped running as hard. And she expected ME to chip in to not only fix the water flow issues but to help pay for putting the tile back up.

I have never been so livid in my life. I told her she had no business laying a hand on a house that she in no way owns and even worse to assume I’d be helping her with unnecessary cosmetic repairs. I even said I have no interest in helping with the plumbing because this is NOT how you treat loved ones. To make it worse this was my second time bringing my boyfriend home to them and they pull this embarrassing shit. I said goodbye to them and dragged him the hell out.

 her cry because I would have laid out some hard fucking truths about her life I won’t

968,Not the A-hole,"Hi sorry mobile etc.

I (27f) have a best friend (27f) who is needy, bipolar and acts out sexually. That's summing up A LOT but thats not the issue at hand. This just past new years eve, she did what I think is a breaking point for me and I need to know if I'm the asshole for cutting her out of my life. 

I have a really sweet work friend (28f) who has been single for a long time and is super picky about who she is into because of her past. She and my friend (Jane) have become friends and we three have hung out together and it's been great. Jane has two kids and my work friend (julie) has taken them out for icecream and has just been an all around very kind person to both of us. Julie expressed interest in my boyfriends best friend and I said I could arrange for us all to hang out casually sometime. This friend (Dylan) has slept with my best friend in the past and they are both crazy and it didn't work out. So I tried to arrange a casual hang out but it didnt work out until new years eve. I asked my friend Jane to be cool, and to be kind and just step out of the way so they could at least meet with no pressure. She said absolutely, she loves Julie and wants her to be happy and she has no feelings for Dylan as he was just a casual fling and agreed to it several times before new years. She promised me she would be selfless and let Julie hang with him no problems. 
We all went out for new years and immediately Jane is all over Dylan. Not like kissing but demanding his attention. She literally cannot not be wanted. She was incredibly fake to Julie and said all of these kind things to her all night but followed dylan around like a puppy. We had an afterparty at my house where jane pulled me into the bathroom and said she was going home with Dylan. I begged her not to because it was cruel to do that to Julie who has been nothing but nice to her but Jane said julie should have been more aggressive and she wants to get laid. She ended up leaving with him and her and I got into a massive fight the next day because I genuinely think what she did was super selfish and self serving to a very kind person. I feel like if she could do that to someone as nice as Julie, she isn't a good person. She accused me of slut shaming and called me a cunt. 
AITA for cutting her out of my life for being what I think is shady and gross?

971,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so tonight my girlfriend and I were having a nice, mature conversation about our values. We've got two fights recently and both of them stem from the issue of us having different values and expectations. In the end, everything was good to begin the New Year. 

That was until tonight, during our conversation of values she brought up smoking cigarettes. She used to smoke when she was in high school (3 years ago) and when I first met her. However she stopped a few months before her and I got together. 

To preface, I am against smoking. I think it's a big turn off for me for numerous reasons that I don't think need to be outlined. She knew this, when we first got together I revealed to her that I was glad that she had stopped smoking and that she's kept it up for so long. She was happy about it too. 

It's been almost a year since she's smoked, and tonight she asked how I'd feel if she were to smoke. The conversation went something like this:

Her: ""What if I smoked?""

Me: ""I don't like smoking.""

Her: ""That doesn't answer the question,""

Me: ""..well I wouldn't be happy with it if..""

Her: ""Why'd you have to think about it?""

Me: ""Because I want to say it properly without upsetting you.""

Her: ""So you wouldn't like it if I smoked?""

Me: ""No, I think it would change the way I feel about you.""

Her: ""That upsets me,""

Me: ""Why?""

She then went on telling me that it was shallow to have feelings change over something like that, and that it upsets her that my love isn't unconditional. I explained that I don't think it's shallow to do such a thing, it's a health risk and a money pit. She turned it and said that if I were to get fat she wouldn't ever leave me. We briefly argued over whether these two are the same thing at all, it ended with her huffing and ignoring me for the rest of the evening.

She went home briefly after. She's sent me a text proclaiming that my view makes me an asshole. I was baffled, I thought this was all hypothetical. I don't understand her behaviour at all. I'm firm on my stance, smoking is disgusting and if she were to take up smoking again it would jeopardize our relationship.

Lots of alcohol was left over and since I'm not a big drinker, I set apart a couple nice liquors that I like and dropped the rest in my trunk (about 15 bottles of booze). 
Then today when I was driving around town a homeless man came to my window to beg for change, I didn't have any so I gave him a bottle of booze. The man was ecstatic, as this is a 20$ bottle of Scotch. We exchanged  new year's wishes and we were both on our way .

Then I thought it would be a nice gesture to give away that alcohol which I wouldn't drink anyway to people who are out in the cold and would cherish having a drink since most cannot afford it. I drove around downtown for an hour seeking out homeless people, giving them bottles of alcohol and wishing them happy new year.

When I shared the story with my friends and SO most of them reprimanded me telling me that many people who have ended up in the streets might be recovering addicts or alcoholics and that by giving them drinks I was actually not helping them.

978,Not the A-hole,"My brother and I have always gotten along, even as kids. We never fought all that much, and even though we are drastically different people with drastically different interests we’ve always respected each others choices.

I’ve been vegetarian for almost 20 years now and while my brother doesn’t agree with it he’s never done more than joke with me a little about it. When I had my sons 12 years ago, everyone was aware they would be raised on a vegetarian diet. While I got the expected lecture from every other family member who thought that, even after I had been perfectly healthy for 8 years, my kids would grow up to be weak and unhealthy and I was basically abusing them, my brother had always had my back.

My nephew (brothers eldest son) is 14, and he’s been hunting with my brother for 2 years. For his 12th birthday my brother bought him his first gun. They enjoy doing it, and while I’ve obviously never been into hunting, I was glad to see they had an activity to do together. This year for Christmas, however, he got both my sons guns. My eldest (they are twins, but one came out first obviously lol) wanted nothing to do with it. He’s always been sensitive and told my brother that he didn’t want to use it. My youngest however was stoked. He was thrilled when he found out “gift of gun=hunting with his uncle”. I didn’t know if he knew what hunting was, so I explained to him very plainly that it meant he would be taking the gun he just got into the woods with his uncle to hunt and kill an animal. He seemed a little off put, but said he’d still like to go.

My brother did not discuss that he would be getting guns for my kids, and I was shocked when they opened them and honestly a little hurt. I don’t think it’s appropriate for a 12 year old, vegetarian or not, to be hunting. It always seemed like an “older kid” activity. I told my son and my brother that I would have to think about it. I ended up telling my brother this morning that I wasn’t comfortable with it. He was pretty upset, and didn’t understand what the big deal was. He even offered to take my son along with him but not let him actually use his gun, just so he could get to see what it really was all about. I haven’t told my son yet and I’m afraid I’ll disappoint him.

AITA for telling my brother I didn’t my want my son hunting, and WIBTA for telling my son I wouldn’t allow him to go with even if he wasn’t going to be shooting his gun?

Edit:spelling

Edit 2: I’ve decided that regardless of the final outcome, they will be participating in a hunter safety class. It will give them a good background if they go hunting. Both my sons will be taking it, even though my eldest doesn’t want anything to do with guns. I feel it’s important that they know how to be safe around guns even if they never end up touching them.

Edit 3: people are concerned with me having the guns in my home, but don’t worry my brother made it clear to everyone that they would be staying at his home in his locked gun cabinet at all times unless the boys are with him and they are shooting.

Edit 4: lol sorry for so many edits. First, I am their mom, not their dad. Second, my dads side of the family is full of hunters, most of the men hunt and a few women, too. So it’s not that they’ve never been around guns or hunting or anything like that, it’s just that they’ve (up until this point) gone with my beliefs.

So we have a few beers, her friend comes by for a pint during which time I may as well have not been there. Sure, she let me know that said friend would be joining us, but I mean I literally said no more than 10 sentences during the hour or so her friend was with us. 

The three of us got into a discussion about umami and what that actually meant. My gf said she thought it was a specific taste and flavor, to which I disagreed with saying that it was more of a  combination of taste, texture, and other things that make up personal preference. 

When she insisted that it was a specific flavor I said that what she was saying was didn’t coincide with what I had learned working under real chefs and called the whole industry, as well as her opinion, pretentious.

In doing so, I hurt her feelings and left her feeling very offended because she interpreted that to mean I was calling her pretentious.

I got a money transfer from my father for Christmas, $800 in cash. Until I go back to my house, there are no nearby ATMs and I have been keeping it in his locked watch case (only for about 3-4 days). He knows I have it and knows exactly where it’s from. On NYE I wasn’t at his place yet and wouldn’t be for a few hours, so he agreed to pick up the alcohol for celebrations. I told him he could take a $20 from my cash to put towards the alcohol. I specifically said only $20 and what it was for.

He picked up liquor then went to get a haircut, I arrived at his house a bit before him. Once he got home, we were hanging out just watching TV for over an hour before he turned to me and told me he took another $20 from the cash to pay for his haircut. For reference, his barber accepts debit/credit cards; my boyfriend chooses to pay cash because he think the card runner they have is sketchy (or that’s what he told me at least.) 

I got upset and told him I was uncomfortable with the fact that he took the money without asking, and waited that long to tell me. I told him I wouldn’t care if he had just asked beforehand, or even just sent me a text as he left the house along the lines of “hey I’m sorry but I borrowed an extra $20 for my haircut, I hope that’s ok. I’ll pay you back.” 
When he told me, he didn’t even say at first that he would pay me back. He just told me flat out “I took an extra $20 to pay for my haircut.” 

When I spoke out about it he got angry and acted like I was being unreasonable. He got mad at me for “starting an argument over nothing.”

Cooper, the golden, was a gift to
my wife in the first year we met. He’s been with us through several moves, additions to family, etc.  He has been the best dog we could ask for,  never had any issues with behavior, destroying our furniture, accidents in the house, nothing... Until recently....

Cooper is well past the life expectancy for his breed, and lately has been having joint pain, moaning and groaning at night, incontinence, sleeps inside until late in the day, and just seeming generally unhappy.  I get it. He’s old. We knew this day was coming.  I hate it for him, for the wife and kids, and for his terrier buddy Charlie.

It may add context that my boyfriend has been with sex workers and hooked up using Craigslist in the past (before we were together). His history doesn’t bother me. I trust him that he has not “crossed the line” and met up with anyone in person since we have been together. 

He feels as though because he doesn’t ever message anyone or fap to Facebook profiles he actually knows in person (just friends of friends or people in the comment sections) that it isn’t an issue, and I am being controlling. 

He says I would have an issue if he told me I couldn’t watch certain genres of porn - which I agree with, but don’t think this is the same thing. He feels like this is essentially the same. 


So reddit, AITA for saying he should stick to places like Pornhub???",36,43,0.87
990,No A-holes here,"Context from 2010: In my (26m at the time) book some things can never be forgiven. It  started with her (23f at the time) stealing my father's pain medication while he was on his literal deathbed in hospice dying of cancer. As in, she tried to pick the lock to get to the morphine pump he was on, while mom and I stepped out for a bite to eat. We were taking shifts, and she had already ate before showing up high. No  charges were pressed, but she wasn't allowed back onto the premises. I  ended up taking care of him and my mother by myself for the two weeks he was there. She knew I was not happy with what she had done, and I didn't really talk to her except as necessary until Thanksgiving 2010.

Thanksgiving 2010 is when it all went down. Dinner was at my mother's place, my sister still lived with her at the time, and it was going to be me, my boyfriend, and most of my mother's family. My sister started talking shit about me to the rest of the  family saying how I never help her, that I won't lift a finger to help mom (not true and mom backed me on that), and the outed me as gay as we sat down to eat dinner to the rest of the family who didn't know. She even tried to drag my boyfriend into it which he wasn't happy about. She continued on, even though everyone was trying to get her to calm down. I got pissed, and that's when it came to a head. I let the family know what she did at the hospice, and how she was banned from there as our father passed away.

She threw a tantrum, seeing as everyone wasn't going against me like she wanted and started saying she just wanted to die and that she needed help and that she would call 911 to go to the  mental hospital. The last thing I said to her was, ""just get out of my life."" I left the dinner and never looked back. (Her running to the mental hospital is something she always did for  attention. Get a 48-hour admit and not have to face her problems she  caused.)

Recently, she's been reaching out to family, trying to get my number.  Wants to make amends and has been ""sober for five years."" I don't want  anything to do with her. My life has been peaceful since I cut her out.  And while some members of my family are giving her another chance for  the 895th time, a lot aren't either. They do think I should at least  talk to her.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting her back in my life in anyway, shape, or form?",79,482,0.95

I go to see this cosmetologist that specializes is coloring hair these very vibrant gradients. It’s really hard to get an appointment with them, but I wanted to make sure I got my hair done before I went on a trip with my friends.

For those of you who don’t know it’s important to not wash your hair for a few days before you get it bleached so you have a lot of natural oils to protect your scalp from the chemicals.

Anyway I was able to get a last minute appointment and it turned out to be the day after my cousins wedding. The wedding where my cousin wanted me and our two other cousins to be her bridesmaids. I didn’t really want to, but felt like I had to since this cousin doesn’t have many friends.

I didn’t think it would be a big deal though because I thought I could just put my greasy hair up into a bun like I always do before I get colored to be more presentable. I don’t like how my hair feels when it’s down and dirty anyway. Even with dry shampoo it makes me feel uncomfortable and cringe.

My cousin told all us in a group text a few days before her wedding that she was going to have a hair stylist do all our hair before the wedding so we would all have some nice matching beach wave look.

I messaged her back privately that I probably wouldn’t be able to do that because my hair is dirty and wouldn’t look good down because it’s so greasy. She said to just wash it. I told her why I couldn’t and she didn’t message me back.

When I got to the venue the next day my aunt told me I would be next to get my hair done. I told her I couldnt because my hair would be greasy and gross and I wouldn’t feel comfortable. 

My aunt tried to give me the keys to her room (wedding was in a hotel) to quickly go wash it. I told her why I couldn’t. She seemed to think that that was ridiculous. Luckily the stylist doing my cousins hair backed me up and explained how it would be painful to get my hair bleach if it was clean. 

While she helped me fix my hair to look a little nicer my aunt left grumbling how I should have rescheduled my hair coloring. My cousin also seemed annoyed with me for the rest of the night and when we were taking pictures.

Edit. Meant after, not before.

993,Not the A-hole,"My cousins husband creates Facebook accounts for their children upon the day of their birth and writes long winded posts for them, basically impersonating them. He sends friend requests to every person he’s ever met and then comments on other people’s posts AS HIS KIDS and FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. He brings it as far as giving himself compliments by writing posts on his kids behalf. Example: “I came home from The hospital today! Gosh mommy and daddy’s house is nice” or “daddy got promoted today, he’s the smartest guy in the world”. If it were just for photo sharing purposes that would be one thing but he tags himself and his wife in all of his “children’s” posts, so everyone on their friends lists would see them regardless. These kids are 2.5 and just newly born.

Anyway, I removed myself as a friend from the oldest child’s “account”, and declined the “request” from the newest child because his posts annoy the hell out of me and, since he tags himself and his wife, I see them multiple times anyway. Well, he noticed that I unfriended his oldest and haven’t accepted the request for the youngest and sent me a private message asking why. I proceeded to explain that I see the posts on his and his wife’s pages and don’t need to see the same post three and four times, planning to leave it at that. He responded how cruel I was to do that to a child.............

Being the reactive person that I am, I told him the reason that I don’t keep his toddler and infant as friends on Facebook is because the whole thing is very strange to me and that he should really spend his time being a father rather than impersonating his kids on social media. He has since blocked me. My cousin is mad at me for it.

997,Asshole,"So my friend Ben decided to stay in town for New Year’s this year and let me borrow his car so I could visit my parents on Tuesday night (my car is currently in the shop for some engine issues). I parked the car on the street in front of my parents’ house around 8 p.m. and went inside. At some point during the night, somebody hit the car and drove away, because when I went outside for a run the next morning, I saw that part of the rear bumper was damaged and there were white scrape marks along the left side. There was no note. My parents and I knocked on a few of the neighbors’ doors to see if anybody had witnessed the hit and run and could give us some more details about the other vehicle, but unfortunately nobody said they had heard or seen anything. 

I contacted Ben right away and let him know what had happened so he could file a claim with his insurance. We took the car in to a body shop this morning, and they gave us a quote of a little over $1,200 to repair everything. Ben’s insurance should cover the majority of it, but there is still a $500 deductible that he has to pay out of pocket.

So here’s the problem: Ben thinks that I should be the one to pay the deductible because I was the last person to drive the car and parked it in the spot where it got hit. I said there’s no way I’m going to pay $500 for damage caused by a hit-and-run. If I had caused an at-fault accident, I would absolutely pay up, no question. But the car was parked. I was not driving it. I understand that having to pay the deductible sucks, but it’s his car, and I think it’s his responsibility to cover the cost.

What makes me want to leave a bad review though was that New Year’s Eve night, my friend and I got back to the Airbnb around 2:30-3ish and we were trying to go to sleep when our host comes back at 4-4:30 with some friends, one of whom his brother and law who’s been here staying with the host the entire time we have been here. When the get here the brother in law opens our door twice to see if we are sleep, but I’m still awake in bed on my phone my friend is asleep and we make eye contact when he opens it so he knows I’m awake and then he closed the door. Like five minutes later they start blaring music and are signing along very loudly with it. This continues until literally 8:45 in the morning. My friend wakes up not long after and we get literally no sleep all night. Now I know it was New Years and I’m trying to be cool but until nearly 9am????? Especially when you are running an Airbnb and KNOW you have guests there???? I just want to know if I’m really justified in leaving a complaint about the loud music and everything even tho it was New Years. Thanks folks.

TLDR: Airbnb host and friends blasting music and loudly signing until nearly 9am. My friend and I get literally no sleep. Should I leave a bad review or would it be lame to complain cause was New Years?

I then said to him ""Well yeah, the killer wasn't captured in real life, did you expect him to be captured in the movie?"" 

I always assumed this was very, VERY common knowledge but a third friend chewed me out for ""spoiling"" it as he's never seen it before.

I liken it to ""spoiling"" a movie about JFK getting assassinated, I just assumed it was common knowledge.

1001,Not the A-hole,"Longtime lurker, first time account/posting - I’ve debated posting this for a while now, but since I’ve been so vocal the last few days on this subreddit I figured it was time to find out if I was TA instead of just commenting on others.

My wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I’ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We’re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. 

The next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an “announcement” to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, “Nope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It’s my day. Thank you for understanding.” and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn’t happen. 

Flash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fiancé announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! 

I’m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It’s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I’m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited. 

So reddit, aita for not allowing them to get engaged during my wedding reception and aita for not attending the wedding on my one year anniversary?

EDIT: You guys have been so sweet! I’m trying my best to reply back to every single comment since you all took the time to comment on my post.  (Y’all will get your reply eventually!) Thank you guys so much! It’s totally making me feel better after this messed up situation! 💕",3243,22656,0.86

1006,Not the A-hole,"Basically as the title says.

Took place on NYE, my store stayed open until regular closing time, 11pm. I have a thirty minute drive home and I wanted to get to the NYE party my roommate was throwing and see the fireworks display.

I got a call at ten-thirty on the store phone from a gentleman asking what time we close. I tell him eleven. We're the only location of our particular store in the area and it's a big area. Guy says he's on his way, be there between half an hour and forty five minutes. I remind him what time we close and if he isnt in the store by 1059pm I'm locking up. 

Anyway, I get ten minutes till close, I've done all my closing tasks just waiting for 1100pm so I can shut everything down. The guy still hasn't shown up. I go around and block and face everything, make sure the place is clean. I turn the lights off and as I'm fixing to lock the door I see this guy running across the lot towards our store waving.

Fortunately for me the windows have incredibly tinted glass on the outside so he may have seen my figure but he couldnt tell if I saw him and the large columns supporting the roof of the covered walkway outside were slightly obstructing me.

It was 1100pm by my watch so I locked the door, grabbed my gear, and left. I could hear him knocking on the front door. Nothing we sell is emergent, we sell vitamins and lotions and stuff like that, nothing we sell is medicine or life saving material so I know he didnt die or anything.

1007,Not the A-hole,"My flatmate (M) is habitually messy and unclean in our shared kitchen (university, 8 people). It's a classic tale.

Last term he threw a christmas party in our shared kitchen on a Friday night: he specifically told the rest of his flatmates (7 of us) that we specifically couldn't attend or be in our own kitchen that evening, as it was for his friends only. Unimpressed, we chose to put up with it, but made it obvious to him that we also planned to have a Christmas Dinner in the same kitchen the next day. He promised it'd be cleaned up in time, no questions asked.

Cut forward to 1pm the day after his party. We'd made it clear to him that we wanted to begin prepping our dinner at 2pm (and we invited him!), but I enter the kitchen to find it in an absolute disgrace. Baking trays (including my own!) full of now-hardened grease, a tray of remaining stuffing and sprouts left out for 18+ hours, drinks open and sat everywhere, you name it.

Me and two others decided enough was enough, and got about to cleaning it up. We weren't going to let him ruin our own Christmas Dinner. We're halfway through washing up and cleaning all his mess (1:30pm), when he comes in claiming to have just woken up, and saying he was just about to clean it all himself. I grew quite agitated, and told him, ""I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough. You either wake up to clean it on time as you promised, or you do it after the party with all your friends."" 

He stormed out, muttering about how unfair we were being, as we washed up his plates and swept up his crumbs. It felt like a major slap in the face. He didn't come back to actually help, as he said he would. I can definitely see why he'd feel cornered, and perhaps I shouldn't have been so short with him when he'd come in to try and clean it (albeit a little late).

My other flatmates told me I'd stayed civil and not to worry about it, but later the next day, I check my phone to see him & his friends had put me on blast in a large group chat for our apartment block. 80+ people, all stating that we were out of order. He claimed in there that we were rude and treated him like a child, and that we were ""bullying him out of the university"". Moreover, he called me out by name to 80+ people for ""throwing away all his leftovers"", when my other flatmates can attest to the fact that what we threw out was probably a single portion of cold, sad stuffing and sprouts. I felt sick to my stomach seeing all these people call me a bitch, etc, etc.

I even extended my apologies for the food in the following few days, but he called it ""petty bullshit"" and stormed out. I can understand why us binning the food may have pissed him off, but this all feels unreasonable.

1009,Not the A-hole,"My partner and I have two Pit Mixes. We have semi-strict rules in place for them to insure that we have happy dogs who aren't perceived as aggressive when we take them in public. (We take them everywhere)

1. Don't allow the dogs to jump up on you. They weight 65+ LBs so they can overwhelm small kids.
2. Don't encourage them to use their mouths on hands, use a toy if you want to play with them.
3. Don't rile them up or do things that would make them nervous. (Our younger one has some weird anxieties about older men that is normally not an issue)

Because we have these rules in place, our dogs have been happy and really good with people.

My dad visits once or twice a year. The last time he came in the summer was the first time he met my younger one, he disregarded all of my rules and constantly riled my dogs up, played with them with his hands, and had my younger one in particular jumping all over him.  After he left it took MONTHS of retraining to get my younger to stop jumping and being mouthy.

He is at my house again for Christmas and gets angry at me when I ask him to stop and makes passive aggressive comments about how he'll never give them any attention again.  Instead, he waits til I am not around and will push them around to get them to play with him, or make angry faces to intimidate them.  Its gotten to the point that my younger dog is sort of afraid of him and will randomly low growl/bark at him. Then my dad has the audacity to say, ""I don't know why he's acting like this!""  I have explained to him my rules and how I want my dogs treated and it feels like he thinks we don't let our dogs be dogs or that we are too strict with them. In a way, I agree. We are very strict because it allows us to do things we want with them. On the other hand, we tell will tell my dad he is more then welcome to play with them if he uses a toy, and to respect our rules.

Its to the point that he gets so offended that I just let him do whatever he wants and will deal with my dogs when he leaves.  Am I too strict with my dogs or too controlling with my father?  AITA?

Thank you all for your responses.  My dad left for the airport so we wont have any more issues for at least a few months.  I appreciate being told that I WBTA if I let him do his thing and will do my best to keep up my rules.

1011,Not the A-hole,"So this boy is my next door neighbour. He only has a slight touch of autism and is really smart. He even got higher points than me in the leaving certificate. But he’s a bit socially awkward and his parents are in denial so he never got any help.

He started to become creepy with girls about 3 years ago when he took a liking towards my friend. She is so nice that she lets people walk all over her but if she rejected his advances he would start lightly banging his head off the wall (nothing aggressive just taps).
After a year and a half he moved onto another friend of mine similar personality, she would try to avoid him but still very friendly and nice. 

The third girl he liked though is when it really started to get concerning. Again super nice personality but she wasn’t afraid to stick up for herself. So he tried to talk to her and started following her around at school but once we finished secondary school and he didn’t see her on a daily basis he started tracking her location on snap maps! (he even showed up at my house unannounced one time she was there) he also walked an hour to where she works and waited outside till it got dark and when she realised he was there she started crying and her boss had to tell him to leave the premises.

But moving onto my experience, on NYE I was on a night out and was talking to a friend. He taps me and says happy new year! I say the same and continue talking to my friend but he keeps trying to get my attention, I tell him I’m talking to someone right now and he’s being rude. So my friend picks up a creepy vibe from him and says let’s just go. So we go to a different part of the club and after a bit I slip on a spilled drink but I don’t fall or anything and he emerges out of the crowd and asks my friend ‘IS SHE OKAY?!’ And my friend is like ‘are you following us?’ And he looks at me and storms off. Later that night I saw him in a corner banging his head like he used to.....

His bedroom window is positioned so if I’m at the kitchen table he can see me and often times when I’m eating alone I’ll look away from the tv out the window and he stares at me until I bring out my phone to record him, then he hides behind his curtains (I record him because it scares me and I want proof if something more serious happens)

So am I the asshole for being creeped out by him following/watching me?

Edit: when I say his parents are in denial I mean teachers have been telling them throughout primary and secondary school that he is autistic and his parents claim he’s not and any reports of his abnormal behaviour fall on deaf ears :(",77,232,0.95

1013,Not the A-hole,"In my family each kid gets $7500 for their wedding. My sister a few summers ago fell in love with this guy, L, and had a kid with him. Turned out he was cheating on her and “only said yes because she wanted him too”. Weddings cancelled only a few months out. We were all sad. 

Now my sister is engaged to a new guy, J. J proposes a few days after they came to visit us.  Sister calls and asks how much we will give her to help with wedding. Parents respond that we gave her $7500 for the last wedding and never got any back. She says it all went towards deposits, her dad says she used it on her house, and mom thinks she used it on a boob job (she did get one we just don’t know how she paid for it). 

Now my sister is ignoring us. My mom didn’t even get to talk to her grandchildren on Christmas. I miss hearing from her. 

With the other daughters, one of which had 2 weddings. Also only received $7500 one time to go towards wedding payments. I will get the same (supposedly). So will my brothers. 

Are we being assholes for not giving her more money? I don’t think my parents are in the wrong here. 

Edit: fixed it to make clear parents are giving money

Edit: fixed spelling

Edit: Lots of ppl are wondering why I’m getting involved. My mom was complaining, I said “let the internet decide” and explained the subreddit, and hence the post. Also my parents are rather old and mom has memory issues and as such they asked me to help them with this one.

So my friend is definitely my best friend. She helped me out so much when I was struggling with addiction and had just always been there for me. I helped her some with her depression, although definitely not to the extent she helped me, but I tried.

We’ve been friends for over 10 years, and I feel no romantic attraction towards her. None. I don’t know for sure but I’m fairly certain she feels no attraction for me either.

Yesterday we (my friend and I) were watching a movie at her house, and then my girlfriend was going to come and we(my girlfriend and I) were going to go out for dinner.

I was sitting on the sofa with my friend, and we were right next to each other. It’s only a two seat sofa so there wasn’t really another option. We weren’t hugging or anything, but were were touching just by happenstance, and neither of us felt the need to move. 

We’re close enough that just sitting and chilling is just, nice. There doesn’t have to be a romantic element to it or anything, just nice. My girlfriend came, and when we left she freaked out saying that it’s basically cheating and that I had to stop being close (physically) with her.

So we waited until around Christmas on a day we had my son to surprise them and pick the dog up.

They both ended up loving her and amazingly they were able to agree on a name. So we thought all was good until my ex called me earlier this week.

She was angry at me because I didn’t discuss with her about getting him a dog. Now her younger son is jealous his older brother has a dog and he doesn’t. Even though he loves dogs they can’t have one because my sons younger brother is allergic. 

Which is what caused this whole other issue because I guess my son didn’t say anything right away about the dog and he had a lot of dog dander on him and on his clothes. Which since they share a room made his brother sick for like a week until he admitted to his stepdad that we got a dog.

His stepdad who doesn’t really like me is now pissed that his son has been sick for a week because of me.

Edit. Because lots of people have asked I didn’t know her son had allergies.

1022,Not the A-hole," My ex-wife and I have joint custody of our daughter Sarah, who is 9 years old. Sarah’s stepfather Steve has been in the picture for about 4 years now. 

So after she came home from spending the holidays at my ex-wife’s house, this is the conversation that Sarah and I had:  
Sarah: ""Steve told me that I can start calling him Dad if I want.""  
Me: ""What do you call him now? Just Steve, right?""  
Sarah: ""Yeah. But I guess I’d call him Dad and you Daddy, so it won’t be confusing.""  
Me: ""At least not until you’re too old to call me Daddy anymore.""  
Sarah: ""Heh, yeah, I guess.""  
She then went on telling me about other stuff that happened during the holidays, and she didn’t mention the Dad/Daddy thing again. I didn’t bring it up either so that was the extent of our conversation about it.

As I heard from my-ex wife, Sarah has since told Steve that she can’t call him Dad because it would be too confusing. My ex-wife thinks that this is my fault because I wasn’t supportive enough of the idea, and now Steve’s feelings are hurt because of my stupid male ego (her words). I told her that I wasn’t really supportive or unsupportive because Sarah and I barely discussed it, but she says that’s the same as being unsupportive and I should’ve gone out of my way to make sure that Sarah knew that I was okay with it. 

Honestly, I’ll admit that I’m not entirely thrilled about it, but I wasn’t trying to deliberately sabotage the idea or anything of the kind. Steve and I don’t know each other all that well but he seems like an okay guy and I don’t have a problem with him.

1023,Everyone Sucks,"Alright, so I was at a club/bar that my friend is hostess/bartender at. That night she was working behind the bar but she had texted me that they had a small booth still not reserved and I could get it for cheap with bottle service. She's hooked me up like that before and I hopped on it. NYE, booth, bottle service. Surely a packed house, and I'll have a reserved seat. I was all over it. Not going to lie and as a single dude it's a nice little setup to talk to women that have mutual interest.

So, I'm mingling by the bar with this group of 3 girls who are all friends. We are having a decent enough conversation and they are talking about how they are all from out of town from California and one girl was from Willow Creek. At this point we literally say, ""the home of Bigfoot.""(I'm a bit of a conspiracy theory nut) After this we all laugh, and such then I jokingly say, ""that's it *ALL* drinks on me for Bigfoot's neighbors."" We all laugh and then I motion for my friend to come over then I buy a round of drinks on my tab.

After the drinks I moved back to my booth and didn't talk to them anymore. I did see they had met a group of three guys and they looked like they had joined up. But, more drinks. More fun. Countdown. All that jazz. Later in the night I'm talking to another woman in the booth. And, I can see the three girls darting straight towards me. 

Apparently, one of the girls had opened a tab and went to close out because they were leaving then got hit with something like a $1,200 bar tab. They were buying drinks all night thinking I was going to pay for it all and my friend was putting on their tab not mine. They wanted me to go up to the bar and explain the situation. I told them I wouldn't because that was obviously a joke that I would pay for all their drinks and I hadn't seen them all night and barely knew them there's no way I'm paying that.

They called me an asshole and all kinds of names I could barely believe. My favorite was the insulting of my wiener size. The woman I was sitting with left to get away from the drama and at this point security steps in telling them to chill out or get kicked out. They leave me alone and I sneak out when I'm ready to leave to avoid anymore drama with them.

But, I'm conflicted I really don't think I owed them anything but I guess in an alternate universe I can understand thinking they had a blank check... maybe? I don't know. Even with a blank check I would have gotten a few drinks. Not the bottles and so on they got.

So, AITA?

*Edit*: adding more detail from suggestions. They had bought a drink before I started talking to them from bartender friend. They must have came back to her for bottles after they left me. Then it got put on their card cause she obviously remembered them. This place gives you a host with the corkage fee. So, once you get a bottle you just alert your host and they keep the party going (mixers/glasses/chilling) along with the tab tallied.

Also, I didn't see their itemized bill but Ace of Spades champagne is carried at the bar and that's about 850 dollars just for a bottle. So, it might not have been 60 Long Island Ice Tea they bought.",881,3058,0.96

1025,Not the A-hole,"The high school I (F23) went to lasted five years, three that we spent in boarding house and two that we lived in flats close to the school building. That made me and my 32 class mates grow really close and we meet up multiple times a year and whenever one of us has a big life event happening, like weddings. And even though I'm not totally close with all of them, I love them all to death, well, with one exception.

I'm getting married next year and right now we're looking at the guest list. I'm the fifth from my class to get married and the four before me all invited everyone from our class. I would love to continue this ""tradition"" but I just... I just can't stand this one girl.

She's a huge narcissist, which is a trait I hate. Maybe I was a bit jealous about all the attention she got, maybe our personalities were just too different, idk, but I spent the majority of our five school years together by ignoring her. It was fine, we still got along okay. But in our fourth year we did a school project and she was the project manager. I don't want to get into too much detail but she loved being the center of attention and was constantly making mountains out of molehills. With one of these mountains she shouted at and embarrassed me in front of the whole class and three teachers. I left school early that day to cry. In the afternoon she sent me a message saying ""everything cleared :)))"". Til this day I have not received an apology. I do not want this girl who has never been kind to me unless it pleased her at my wedding. 

I talked to a friend from class the other day about planning to not invite her and I was told it would be really unfair and asshole-ish, because it would show her and everyone else that I didn't want HER there specifically. I'm not really worried that she would get angry over not being invited. I'm worried that me not inviting her will break this ""tradition"" in which everyone from class gets invited to major life events. WIBTA for not inviting her anyway?

Edit: I'm very thankful for the input so far. What apparently didn't get through though is that I'm not asking if I'm TA for not inviting her. I'm perfectly aware that of course technically it's my right to invite to my wedding whoever I want, that I'm technically not the asshole. But that's not my issue. The issue I'm asking about is whether I'm TA for potentially ruining the tradition my classmates and I have going on.",158,254,0.89

1027,Not the A-hole,"When my (19F) mother and my father got a divorce 4 years ago, I was confused and devastated. When my mom told us that she had gotten a new boyfriend I was of course shocked at first, but he is a nice guy and we have a lot of things in common, but about 2 years after they wanted to move in together. They got together some months after her and my dads divroce. My 2 little sisters and I were not ready for this at the time. Whilst he is kind and cares deeply for our mom, he is also very hard to get to know and he and my sisters are all introverts, including mysel so it was hard getting any of us to take the initiative. One of many issues that I had with the two moving together was the fact that I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around in my nightwear, underwear etc. when her boyfriend was around and therefor I didn't feel ready to move in with him. This didn't seem to be an issue for her and we moved in with him not long after.

Today I was going out to get some water. I was wearing a red bathrobe my boyfriend gave me for christmas without a bra underneath. The robe has a low cut, but does not directly show melons unless you specifically pull it down. I always make sure to pull it up before going out, as to not have it be too revealing. Her boyfriend was upstairs and she was in the kitchen. She then confronts me about my kimono being too revealing and that she thinks it's innapropriate that I wear it in front of her boyfriend and I honestly get quite upset. I tell her that  I was very clear and reminded her about this being an issue for me when they decided they wanted to move in with eachother and she responded saying that it was a bullsh\*t excuse and that I clearly didn't seem to have an issue with it anymore. I tried explaining to her that I did not consider the kimono revealing and she wanted me to pull it up even more as to not have my melons hang out everywhere (they weren't). She asked me if I would be cool with her walking around with her top naked in front of my boyfriend and in my mind that analogy did not make sense whatsoever.

Visibly uncomfortable and irritated I tell her that I'll go change my clothes and then she starts backpeddling saying that I am entitled to wear what I want, but that she doesn't like it. At this point I don't feel comfortable in my clothes anymore and change it to something that completely covers up the breast area. At dinner she starts the conversation again in front of my sisters and her boyfriend, due to my visible irritation and I tell her straight up that part of feeling at home for me is being able to wear what I want. We continue arguing for a while and at last I tell her that I'll just wear it in my room instead.

But AITA for wanting to wear my bathrobe outside of my room? I really can't seem to figure out who's right and who's wrong and whether my judgement is clouded due to our past confrontations.

1028,Not enough info,"So one of my two closest cousins are getting married. Yay! Only I'm really nervous about it because of that particular situation. He's one of my closest cousins.

Also everything I know about my cousin's soon-to-be wife is she is quite nice. Which is why I am making double the effort and have double the anxiety about it. I bought make up and a dress for it, using the color scheme it is alright to wear black and teal said by the bride, to get myself a black dress. 

Problem for my Dad, and my Mom too but she was being nicer, is that this dress is kind of gothic. [The Dress](https://www.dresslily.com/lace-panel-long-sleeve-maxi-product3373641.html) It's a long, ankle length dress with lace sleeves. Conservative neckline which is one of the reasons I really chose it. I love it! Though I didn't work out the zipper. I planned to either wear it with a top or buy another one if I couldn't get the dress zipper working. 

Now my Dad said he would not be seen with me if I went in that dress and he would even buy me another dress for it. No worries then. I don't need to wear the dress. So I am not wearing the dress. But they proceed to call me ridiculous for not only presuming that the wedding colors being black and teal meant the colors could only be black and teal... Alright, very literal person and I have seen worse reaches from the bride then a request for two colors where one is likely to be in a person's closet. 

But they proceed to say that a gothic sort of formal dress is not appropriate for a wedding after talking to me about how silly I am for the color scheme = color preference mistake. AITA for erring on the side of formal for my cousin's wedding with plans to cover up the lace? 

My parents don't think a gothic dress counts as formal. My Mom in particular added later that she also thinks a dress that long would make me seem like I was a part of the wedding party and be mistaken for it. So I describe my parents' position on it fairly.",82,49,0.85

1032,Not the A-hole,"Background: So basically the issue is that my mom and stepdad have been leaving the front door unlocked in the morning when they leave for work while the rest of us are sleeping. They usually leave around 7 am and me (19F) and my siblings (17F, 14M, 11M) are off from school for the holidays so are still asleep at this time. This used to not be a problem because I used to work at the same place before I left for college and was always last out so I'd lock the door.

Mom's argument: We live in a safe neighborhood so there's no reason to lock the door. She says that if there's a problem we can call the police, but that nothing is going to happen because it's such a small town (population ~250) and it's a very rural area (20 mins to the next town, 1hr to nearest city). She thinks that I'm being paranoid because I moved to a bigger city for college and there's more crime there. She just doesn't think it's a big deal

My argument: Even if our area is relatively safe, I don't feel comfortable with the door being left unlocked while everyone in the house is asleep. I've been setting an alarm to get up and lock the door after they leave because they refuse to lock it, and it's disrupting my sleep. I might be paranoid, but there's no police station in our town and if something were to happen we would have no way to defend ourselves.

Unfortunately, not enough planning was involved and while my coworkers were enjoying the pot luck, I verbally volunteered to sit out for a bit and cover the walk-in customer service portion of my workplace. About a hour goes by and when the people who I was covering for got back, I made my way up to the front office.

Along the way, a coworker asked me if I got any of the lunch. I said no because I was just covering the back. He tells me that the food is all gone and he didn't get any either.

I make my way to where the food was and there was a single aluminum tray that was covered. I assumed it was the food all consolidated into one container so I open it. Then a coworker comes over and puts her hand on the lid, closing it and then said ""Don't touch that!"" I asked ""is this not the food from the pot luck?"" She says ""it's the leftovers."" So I said ""Ok, cool. I haven't had any so I'll just grab some of this."" She says ""No. I'm taking this home, it's for my husband. He is working a 16 hour shift today and he's going to come home hungry."" I reply with ""So, your husband, who doesn't work here, is getting food that everyone else brought in for the company pot luck while people WITHIN the company aren't getting any of it?"" She says ""Like I said he is coming home from a 16 hour work shift and you had a hour to grab some.""

This got me a little upset and I retaliated with ""I was covering the back so everyone could enjoy their meal. Both \_\_\_\_ and I never got any food. Is your husband 10 years old and can't feed himself? Or pick something up on his way home? He has to rely on you to provide food, that isn't even yours to take, for him? I'm only half done my coffee, does he want that too? God forbid he has to put water into the coffee maker at home.""

She replied with ""It's not my fault you covered the back and didn't get any. Maybe you should think about taking some back with you next time instead of complaining about it."" That's when another coworker very calmly told us to back off each other and take a breather.

The woman who had the leftovers has been going around to coworkers telling them how much of an asshole I am for confronting her like that and was visibly upset with me.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: okay, I've stepped away from this for a while and thought I would get some reoccurring questions out of the way: 

\-She ended up with the leftovers because she showed no signs of compromise and I didnt want to restart the fire. 

\-I went to the closest fast food restaurant and picked up some food for both my coworker who didnt receive any food either and myself 

\-I brought food as well to the pot luck. It was $40 worth of fresh fruit cut up the morning of because they wanted something light and healthy. That's all I brought so I had nothing to eat for the rest of the day which was a factor of why I got upset.",986,5930,0.96

Anyway, I called out the shift leader who assigned the work and threw in some curse words laying out how in our job description it says   “Must be able to lift 50lbs, endure strenuous labor and hours”. It shouldn’t 
matter if girl or guy. This is a workplace which requires equality and if you can’t handle what the job entails then you shouldn’t work here.

Im a first year in university in the UK and, having come from an overly protective household, wanted to go a little crazy. That was the case anyways until I realised when i get drunk I speak my mind, however messed up it may be.

Thats the problem, one girl in my house came from a posh background where everything was handed to her in a silver platter. Her people were normal, not like me.

I spoke of many things under the influence of alcohol, mental health, Sexuality (im bi), religion. Not really subjects for new people but i like testing waters.

Anyways it was Halloween 2019 i was planning to go out so i had gotten a little tipsy already with other people abd had then gone up to where others including this girl was and intended to keep drinking to a sutible level for going out and having a good night without spending massive amounts at the bar. This girl (we'll call her G) didn't want me to. Despite the fact everyone around me being used to my quirks and being comfortable she took it upon herself toa forceful take my bottle of drink (which i had paid good money for, renember im a uni student) from the table and keep it on her person where i couldnt reach it. She also insulted my ability of self control and level of trust in the friends I did have there all after several weeks of isolating me from discussions. I had enough and came back with fuck you G.

The whole point of this story is that I have two sex toys I keep in this room. Partner and I haven't used them in a while, I was also recently cleaning up and moving some stuff, basically I forgot I left them in a random closet drawer.

Also it's not something extreme... I'm talking a dildo and a buttplug.

Long story short, friend realized her spare pair of socks had a hole in them. I told her to take one of mine, they're in one of the closet drawers. So yeah you guessed it, she opened a couple and saw the sex toys.

Instead of laughing it off, which I think would've been an appropriate reaction, correct me if I'm wrong, or just I don't know, not mentioning it at all; she made a scene of yelling out loud, blaming me for leaving these in my room when I was expecting guests.

She says she is pregnant and asks for my seat. She is wearing a t shirt, and I don't see any baby bump so I don't give up my seat. I say that I am tired and will not give up my seat for her, but she requests again. After telling her to go ask someone else, she calls me an asshole and walks away.

I am dating Mary. Mary and I have been seeing each other since late June, but she is just now starting to hang out with me around friends and family. 

I also have a really good friend Jane I have know for a really long time. She is my younger sister's best friend, but she also is like a sister to me given how much time we've spent together over the years. Jane is really outgoing and friendly/affectionate.

This past weekend I had some people over to my place to hang out. In this group was Jane, Mary, my sister, and some other friends of mine or my sister. We were playing some games, and Jane wanted to partner up. No really a big deal. We partner up for a lot of games because we make a good team (usually we win). 

My living room is not huge by any means, and definitely isn't big enough to fit everyone at my place, so seating was cramped. Jane decided to sit on my lap. She has not done this before, but it's not unusual for her to be affectionate and friendly with her friends so I don't consider it weird (also because as I said she is basically family). 

My girlfriend was very testy all night, and later when I had a chance to talk to her she said it was because I let Jane sit on my lap. She feels like this is inappropriate and also doesn't like how touchy she can be with me, but I don't see the problem. Jane has always been this way. She doesn't mean anything by it. That's just how she is. She also is very sensitive so to say something would hurt her. I think my gf is making this into something it is not.

1049,Not the A-hole,"Hello Reddit,

A little background:
My parents are immigrants and I’m a first generation college student. I have always done well in school and my parents have always had high hopes for me becoming a doctor. They told me that when I become a doctor, they will retire and I’ll support them. 

I obviously had no issues with this for many years, because, like any other immigrant family, they have worked extremely hard to get us where we are. They made sure I had a decent life with everything I could ever want. 

The issue is over the past couple years my mom has become extremely wasteful with their money ever since I was admitted into med school 2 years ago. They bought a brand new Tesla Model 3, a high end refrigerator with a touch screen, several Louis Vuitton purses, a kitchen remodel, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff of very high value. Anytime anything shows a little age, she throws it away. She doesn’t even try to resell it or repurpose it. It just goes straight to the trash. 

The catch is, I know they don’t have the funds. I have access to all of my parents accounts, and they don’t even have 20k saved and are due for retirement within the next 15 years. They finance all of these purchases over credit cards. They don’t have bad credit but currently owe $100,000, that they are just making minimum payments towards. 

When I pictured taking care of them during their retirement, I expected to pay for their groceries and bills, not their debts and wasteful spendings. I told my mom this today and she blew up at me.

Me: You know if you keep wasting money like this, I’m not going to support you when I graduate and find a job. 

Her: Don’t even try threatening me. I gave birth to you and have raised you for years, and now you’re being ungrateful? 

It went on like that for a while, but I stood firm on my decision. It’s like my parents aren’t even saving any of their income because they think I will fully support them and all of their wasteful habits. My mom even thinks I’m buying her a BMW when I graduate medical school. That’s not even something I plan on buying myself. I’m already about $350k in debt and will only earn about $40k a year during residency. 

AITA for telling my mom that I won’t support her  once I graduate medical school? 

I didn’t mention my dad because he has bad spending habits, but it’s not wasteful. He likes to have good food, so he buys rib eye steaks. My mom on the other hand always has to buy the most expensive thing. New TV? Better get the 86” OLED 4K tv so I can cast my 480p YouTube videos onto it. Refrigerator ice machine not working? Better get the $2k model even though she doesn’t even know how to use an IPhone without help. My dad has tried to talk her out of these purchases, but he’s obviously defeated.",408,2619,0.97

1052,Not the A-hole,"I normally wouldn't have too much trouble deciding things like this, but since family is involved my judgement is somewhat clouded.

I have one brother and two sisters, and as it stands and has stood for years the plan for my parents' retirement is purely for us young adult offspring to pay for their old age.  

I'm going into a programmer field, and as such will be paid pretty well, but I'll be making the most out of my siblings.  (Army, vet tech, special Ed (mostly autism) one on one)

My parents' side is that they paid for our childhood, and that while my father now makes six figures he only started making that much about 9 years ago.  We've had to do a lot of work on the house, which has been expensive (biggest by far was redoing the roof, which cost about 40k US dollars).  Because of these things, they believe it should fall on us to pay for their old age in it's entirety.  

My side is that they paid for our childhood, but haven't paid for anything else.  Come college time they decided to pay for exactly $0 of it.  They said 4 kids was too many to pay for college for, but that doesn't mean you should pay for nothing at all.  We missed out on getting financial aid because of how much my father made, but ended up getting zero help from him regardless.  My mother also works as a teacher, which means they are making even more than just what my father makes.  
Also, it's true he's only had the job 9 years, but that's still a long time.  He's in no danger of losing his job and he's been getting consistent raises.  
They chose to have children.  We didn't choose to have parents

I wouldn't be upset about helping out some, but they've been putting zero effort into a retirement plan.  No effort at all.  Our futures are on us to pay for, but apparently so are theirs


EDIT: Several people have been asking about location and cultural effects.  I live in America, specifically Maryland.  I am not aware of any cultural effects that affect their decision making process

Edit 2:  Not as important, but I would like to mention that in every way other than this they've been great parents.  They've done their best to raise us, and ended up doing pretty good.  It doesn't change the decision they made to put this on us, but I wanted things to be considered in the light that they are otherwise good people and we are on good terms

Edit 3:  Thanks everyone for the advice.  With the results I've been getting the plan is to get my siblings on board and sit down with my parents and try to get them to come up with enough of a plan that the four of us would only need to help out a little bit.  They're pretty reasonable with most things, so I suspect it won't be too hard to get this to happen.  They're only 50, and I'm only 19, so there's still time for them to get a solid enough plan in place to take most of the weight of their retirement",339,1426,0.95

She’s very beautiful. I try to hang out with her as much I can, but I also have a twin sister who’s been my best friend forever and she’s super pretty as well.

Sorry for grammar mistakes. On mobile.

When she meets new people and makes friends she always lie about my age. It’s annoying, every single damn time she lies about my age. I love her and all but this just infuriates me and gets under my skin. I confronted her about this multiple times and she laughs it off and says it’s so she looks younger. She always tells my older brother’s age and he is 17.

1056,Not the A-hole,"I was running errands today and got held up trying to go through this one intersection that is notoriously awful. The lights aren’t timed well and people have a bad habit of trying to make it through the light before it changes by pulling forward when there isn’t enough room and they end up blocking intersection and creating a bigger mess. 

People always get angry at this light however today it was particularly awful. Traffic was at a standstill because of the people parking themselves in the middle of the intersection and people were honking, screaming at each other, flipping the bird; it was just one giant cluster of road rage. One guy got out of his car and started waving his arms around like a lunatic and I thought that at this point things were getting unsafe. So I called the non emergency police line to report what was going on in the hopes that maybe they would send an officer to help direct traffic and make sure everyone behaves. 

The dispatcher made me feel like an idiot though. When I briefly told her what was happening, she said “so you’re calling the police to report traffic...?” 

Now I feel like an asshole who may have wasted a cops time. It’s just not unheard of for road rage to get really bad so I thought it was better to be safe than sorry.

My mother in law, who is a sweet heart, wanted to be there for the birth and asked if it was okay if she stayed with us for a while after the baby was born.  My sister in law, who is also a sweet heart, also asked if she could stay with us after the baby was born, but only for one week.  

Although I like them both, I was somewhat hesitant because they don’t exactly make the best house guest, and I expressed this to my wife.  I asked her to have a talk with them and ask them to refrain from doing certain things they do in their homes that we don’t do in ours.

When they both come to visit they leave quite a heavy footprint.  They both set up shop and I have to ask them to put things up, pick up after themselves, and to be conscious of where they leave food because we have three dogs.

My mother in law completely takes over one of our bathrooms and acts like it’s only for her use.  My sister in law has the habit of over shopping and buys so many groceries, snacks, and sodas that there isn’t room for everything in the fridge or cabinets.

Today I was out doing this and was approached by a stranger (young male, not sure about age but taller and heavier than me) who tried to strike up a conversation. It started out fairly normal as it's not uncommon for people to say hello and be a little curious what I'm up to but then it progressed to a point I wasn't comfortable with. I tried to politely but firmly end the conversation.

For some background, it's a fairly good sized city for my region of the country (approx 112k population) and has a crime rate 97% higher than the other towns or cities in the state. The city also has a nationally publicized opioid problem and is in a state where one does not require a license to conceal carry a firearm. My intent in sharing this information is not to be discriminatory but rather to depict why I'm cautious when I interact with people who approach me in this area. 

Anyway, the conversation went as follows: 

Stranger: Hello  
Me: Hi (with a smile, turn back to my work)  
Stranger: What are you doing?  
Me: (turn around to see him stopped behind me, over my right shoulder) I'm just collecting some pole data. (This answer satisfies people 99% of the time so I turn back to my work.)  
Stranger: Like seeing how much power it's putting out?  
Me: No, like what cables are attached to it. (turn back to my work, starting to get a little uncomfortable and hoping he'll move along)  
Stranger: Well how do you know how much power it's putting out?  
Me: I'm really not sure, I don't work for the power company. You would have to ask them.  
Stranger: Oh, okay. So do you drive a personal vehicle? (This question makes me HUGELY uncomfortable and I tense up.)  
Me: Why do you ask?   
Stranger: Oh I'm just trying to learn that's all.  
Me: I'm sorry, I don't have time to chat. I need to do my job. I'm sorry.

1069,Not the A-hole,"So my teenage daughter (call her M) has been best friends with her best friend (call her K) for about a year now. They became friends right after K moved here. 

It’s been a year and I’ve barley ever spoken to her parents. She’s often sleeping at our home to the point were I decided to just buy another bed and put it in my daughters room for when she stays. 

I am a very relaxed parent and so is my husband. As long as our kids are doing their best we don’t really set too many boundaries. And because K is basically my fourth child I do the same for her, at least while she’s at my house.

So a few days ago the girls come home and they asked me if K could dye her hair pink in the bathroom. I asked to see her grades and she showed me. She was doing well and I said sure, I didn’t care.

I honestly just assumed she had already asked her actual parents and just wanted to see if it was ok to use the bathroom since M got green dye every where when she did it. I told them to just clean it up after and they said ok.

So fast forward to today when I get a very angry phone call from Ks mother. She demanded to know why I told K she could dye her hair pink. I told her I said it was alright she used my bathroom to dye her hair pink. She went off on me about my parenting choices. She criticized my decision to let MY daughter get piercings, a tattoo, or dye her hair and told me she wasn’t gonna let my bad parenting influence her child anymore. 

I kinda just laughed and reminded her I was basically the one parenting K for the last year. I reminded her I fed her almost every day, paid for her to go on vacation, gave her a roof to sleep under 25 days out of a 30 day month and so much more. This only got her angrier and she claimed that that was all over as well as K and Ms friendship. 

Before I could say anything else she hung up on me. I’ve tried to call her an explain and apologize for the situation escalating but she has blocked me. 

My daughter and K are both distraught and I feel awful for them both. I’m not really sure what to do or if I’m even really in the wrong here. Am I really the ass here?

Edit: some people are saying I haven’t painted a clear enough picture of K and her mother’s relationship. Her mother is neglectful. She never tries to communicate with me or say thank you for anything I’ve done for K. Last time we spoke was in early August. Ks father ignores my husband and I when we try to reach out to him. The point in where I really realized her parents don’t give a shit is when I was the one who had to take K to the ER over a sprained ankle and when I told her mother she said she was too busy to just deal with a sprain. I thought saying K is at my house 25 out of 30 days of the month and there is no communication would show how little Ks parents care.",530,2853,0.96

I told my boss this and she comes back with the ‘The needs of the center come before the needs of the employee.’  Except her response to the needs of the center has been hiring kids straight out of high school and stretching qualified employees farther and farther to compensate. 

My kids need me, the parents know me, and it’s a big thing for me to miss out on these moments. We have lost 3 employees this month- not including the one returning in December. The center is strapped but since I told my director I wouldn’t work in that classroom a month she sent me home early- I’m pretty sure she is going to fire me. I even offered to train for a week or two and then they could put some one else in till the lead returned. 

AITA for putting my needs first?",18,42,0.96

1074,Not the A-hole,"Ok. Well, It's not as basic as us just avoiding the in-laws for the holidays. MIL has a way of making Hubby and I uncomfortable in a lot of situations. She has started demanding we WILL be at her house for Thankgiving this year because she ""will finally get a picture of all three grand kids in the same room.""

Mind you, we care for Hubby's gma, and this is her first year without gpa here with us for the holidays. I also just went threw loosing my younger brother (He was 22 and literally we jjst went threw with his viewing on Nov. 1st). Gma has treated the loss of my brother as a complete inconvenience to her and MIL acts as though everything is perfect and we should all be super chipper and happy. 

Hubby doesn't want to do much. My parents and I want to do a small dinner together at our house, nothing fancy, and not more then them and us. Gma doesn't want to leave the house this year. But MIL is not having it and wants us at her house, being demanding about it, all because she wants a picture with our daughter that she only sees when it makes HER look like a ""good granny""...

1075,Not enough info,"we're both 24, i'm in school and and she's about to graduate. we usually get along fine and dont argue except for this one occasion.

So today I had class until 11:20a. She had an appointment with her doctor at 12:20p. She happened to be in the area to run some errands so she said she'll go on her own while I had class, and she asked if I can pick her up after she's done. I said that I might as well get some gym time in while she's at her appointment and i'll just pick her up afterwards, cause she said that she thinks she'll be done at around 12:45ish. She said that's fine and that's okay. The clinic is a \~5 minute drive from where we live, for reference. 

So I get into the gym at around 11:45ish (the gym is in our apartment building). Around 12:30 she texts me and says that she's finished early. And I say that I'm nearly done my workout, that i'll cut out some of the other aspects of my routine so i'll be done in around \~10 minutes then i'll come pick her up. And she says that no I should leave my workout and come pick her up and I can go back to the gym and finish afterwards. I was like what??? I said I don't want to do that because by the time I get back my body will have cooled down and it'll be much harder to finish my workout. So then she said that all she'll do is walk home, that it's not that far away. And I was like cmon Tracey it wouldn't kill you to wait for 15ish minutes, I don't want you to walk when I can just come drive you in a bit. And she didn't respond.

When we got back she was really upset with me. She said that I broke my promise to pick her up (she did this while jabbing me in the chest with her finger) and I said that I didn't break my promise at all, I tried to explain that the circumstances changed and I tried to accomodate both of our needs. She really wasn't having it and has been frosty towards me ever since.

AITA?

Edit: if y’all are gonna downvote me for no particular reason then at least tell me why.

Edit 2: I didn’t mention that the reason that I need to be in the gym is because I’m doing physical therapy for my knee as prescribed by my physiotherapist. In April I had surgery for both my knees, I tore my MCL and meniscus in both knees in a freak accident. So I have a strict regimen that I have to stick to otherwise my knees won’t heal properly.

Another thing I didn’t mention is that the reason I didn’t go to the appointment with her is cause she absolutely refuses to let me go to the doctor with her. She actually hates doctors in general, she’s from the UK and she says that they’re only in it for the money and don’t care about the patient. So when we found out she was pregnant, she was really procrastinating going to the doctor and I literally had to beg her to go and she finally relented but she still won’t allow me to go to the clinic with her. She won’t even let me sit outside the room, I usually just drop her off and leave then come back or I wait for her to be done.",795,941,0.79

1078,Asshole,"tl;dr: my male friends stand around for 7 mins in a flat where only girls live, but guys are also allowed there. a girl walks by in a towel and is annoyed. 

I feel like the title is a little misleading simply because I wasn’t sure how to concisely explain the flat situation; I live in uni dorms where my floor (a ‘flat’) has only girls living there. It doesn’t mean guys aren’t allowed there, it’s just that only girls live there.

My male friends called if they could come over to ask a question and so we stood in the hallway talking for roughly seven minutes. During this time, one of the flatmates walked out of the bathroom in a towel.

I didn’t think much of this until she sent a message in the group chat asking that ‘whoever’s male mates were standing around’ could go into their room instead, as ‘people were in towels’. 

Should I have let my friends into my room? I thought it’d be relatively quick so I didn’t bother, but I feel bad for making her uncomfortable. I can see why there’d be an expectation for no guys to be around, but other people’s male friends have been around before.

1079,No A-holes here,"My husband of 11 years, together for 15, forgot my birthday. I didn't make a huge deal about it, I was bummed and kind of sad but there wasn't any crazy drama or anything.  I think I was surprised and confused that he forgot, and I knew he felt terrible about it and wouldn't forget on purpose. Now, I dont want or need extravagant things, Im not like that, honestly I would like flowers or even a decent happy birthday card if he was going to buy any kind of gift. SUPER low key over here. So, two days later, after not receiving even a belated bouquet of flowers I mentioned how perplexed I was that he seemed to have forgotten that he forgot my birthday, so he ran out and bought me beautiful necklace. Its gorgeous...and expensive, were talking several thousand dollars here. Am I the asshole for wanting to return it?

Here are my reasons : he bought it on credit, which means I will also be paying on this for a long time and it is stressing me out to know that there is a sudden and massive debt just accrued on something that I may wear once a year - its so nice that it needs to be a safe.

I know he was sorry and trying his best to think of the best way to make up for forgetting my birthday...but literally flowers would have been fine! I even told him that. He will be mad if I return it, but I will have anxiety and stress about it if I dont. Gifts shouldn't be stressful, right?

The large pack of silverware was kept in the kitchen for weeks following the party, and people kept using them out of convenience when all our other normal silverware was in the dishwasher. I didn't like how wasteful they were (even if they wash the recyclable silverware when they are done with them), so I asked them not to do that. 

The next week, when I saw them do it again, I explained that the silverware was meant for parties and similar events and should not be used for anything else. I then took the silverware box into my room (which is still over a half full). 

My housemates are annoyed with me because they think that once we all contribute to the expenses of a party, the materials belong to everyone, and what I'm doing is selfish. I don't agree. It's mine isn't it, I paid for it. I should be able to determine what it's used for.

I bought a dress off of my friend/roommate my sophomore year of college that she had made for her class. 

I paid 30 dollars for it and it sort of just stayed in my closet for a while until I decided to bring it to my internship out of state 2 years later. I realized that, although the dress was very nice, I was not really going to wear it again, so I donated it to a local Goodwill. Before I did so, however, I did send my roommate a few updated pictures for her senior portfolio, in case she needed them.

Well, yesterday, after the dress had been gone for a few weeks, she messaged me and said that the pictures were blurry and she needed new ones. I decided to break the news to her and tell her that I had given the dress away. 

Needless to say, she was extremely pissed. I was apologetic and offered to take the pics that I had taken and try to fix them with some photoshop skills but now she's demanding I go on a wild goose chase to get the dress back...

We have a new girl staying with us, let’s call her Jane, she has been with us for over a month. Jane is very loud and annoying, she doesn’t follow rules and talks back to my parents. I have been getting annoyed lately because my parents are letting Jane get away with stuff that they never would let me get away with, and to make matters worse I caught her trying to go into my bedroom (we have locks on all of the doors so she couldn’t get in).Jane is also always teasing me, calling me lanky, making fun of my hair, and even making fun of my parents. I really dislike her.

Jane and I have the same lunch at school. As I’m getting my food, I see her point to me and laugh as she is talking to a group of girls. I am a confrontational person, so I went to sit near them to see if she would continue to talk about me to these girls in front of my face. Well she did. She kept talking about my house, my family and me.

Eventually I had enough and said ‘“at least I’m not a fat loser who’s parents didn’t even want them”.

1089,Not the A-hole,"So my mom has had a very crazy love life since I was born. She has been married 5 times (currently married to #5) and each marriage ended with her leaving one man and moving in with another.  This really affected me as a child as I never really had a stable father figures growing up.

Anyways I went through a divorce myself (first one). I moved out of the house I shared and bought a home on my own. Right after I moved into the house my mom called me telling me how excited she is to come visit me and that she can't wait. She then explained to me that one of her high school girlfriends owns a house 5 hours north of me and she just wanted to get away on a girls trip to relax a little on her way to visit me. I was actually pretty excited for this as I hadnt seen my mom in almost a year and with my pending divorce, its nice to have family close by (I'm military and live in another city). So my mom has a bad history of lying to me. When she left her 4th husband she went on a dating spree and slept with a lot of guys and lied to me about a lot of things regarding her divorce and telling me her ex-husband was abusive (in reality I think he was just boring for her and she moved on, not a big deal imo).

So as we get closer to her visit the details she's giving me about her ""girlfriend"" isn't jiving. My mom grew up in a very poor neighborhood and yet her gf lived in a resort like town in a mansion (shes not married or anything). So I got with my sister in law who is a PI on the side and she did a little research and found out one of my mom's ex lovers lived in this resort town in a mansion....

So I let the trip happen without saying a word to my mom. She only stayed with me for one night, then spent the next 5 nights with her ""girlfriend"". All while her husband was at home working away at his job. A couple weeks went by and the situation really didn't sit well with me so I decided to call her up and confront her with my theory. I know my mom well enough that I know when she's lying most of the time. My mom froze for about 20 seconds when I divulged all of the information my sister in law and I found about her ex lover. I then impressed upon her the importance of honesty with me and that it's hard for me to be close to someone, even my mother when she lies to me. So my mom FINALLY admitted to visiting this ex lover of hers but insists that he is married and she was just hanging with him and his wife for a week... I told her that she's a liar and that situations like this are why she's been married 5 times and probably working on 6. My mom broke down crying (she does this a lot when I call her on her bullshit) and eventually hung up the phone. I then had family members and friends calling me up and telling me what an asshole I am for doing that and as her son, I should just support whatever decisions she makes.

1092,Not the A-hole,"To start, I (28M) have worked in the Adult Entertainment Industry (Porn) for about 8 years now. A best friend of mine (28F) has recently found herself in a situation where she needs to make roughly $2,400 or lose her house. On top of that she has also lost her management job as well.I don't extend job offers or open calls to friends out of sheer respect for them and keeping my work life and social life separate, with that being said, everyone knows what I do. All my friends, family, SO, etc. and I am not ashamed of it.

She texts me about 2 weeks ago with this problem and I suggested that she check out Indeed, Monster or one of the many other job sites. Her response was that she looked and either it wasn't something she wanted to do or the pay wasn't good enough. So, going out on a limb I informed her of a open call if she really needed the money fast.She said no, and that was the end of it.

Fast forward about 3 days later she messages me again asking if I knew of any jobs. I told her no, as I really only leave the house to go to work and don't really look around to see if places were hiring or not, but I told her I would keep a look out.But after that she starts getting really passive aggressive about me and my job. Saying stuff like ""If only I could just spread my legs and make money that easy. XD"". ""It must be hard to stare at T&A all day. . ."" and ""You literally don't do anything but get your jolly's and make stupid money."" all and all being very condescending about it.This made me feel a bit insecure about the situation, but it passed. I'm just a camera guy.This all came to a boil about 5 days after that when she sends another message to me saying this time how I'm just flat out not helping her. I have sent her multiple online resumes from a lot of different resources and even offered her a spot at my place of business. I got fed up and told her that she can do adult films or not, I don't care, but it's all I can honestly offer her.She got mad, called me a pervert and hasn't talked to me since.

1096,Not the A-hole,"Ever since I had my baby both mine and my husbands family want pictures of her. This is normal, however where my family is fine with me sending them digital pics or sharing them in a dropbox, my MIL would always say ""Oh, I want this picture and that picture..! Print them for me!"". So I would prints pictures for her as well as for her parents who are in their mid eighties.

&#x200B;

I'm don't have a setup at home for printing so I usually go to the pharmacy or Costco where they have self-serve photo printing machines. Problem is this has gotten to be annoying. As my daughter got older it got harder and harder to multi task plugging my phone up to the self-serve machine and navigating menus, cropping, selecting sizes all while supervising my kid who is now old enough to attempt climbing out of the shopping cart or pulling things off of nearby shelves. Also, now that I've gone back to work, I simply don't have the time. My days are packed. On weekdays I work and take the kid to and from daycare. On weekends we cook, clean and run errands.

I'm also getting annoyed with my MIL's entitled attitude. Once we were having breakfast with my husbands entire family as a final get together before my husbands grandparents (MIL's parents) left to spend the summer in their home country. The grandmother wanted some pictures of my baby to take with herand MIL just happened to have some on her. MIL didn't want to part with her copies and suggested I go and print more right after breakfast and then go drop them off at her parents' house before they leave to catch their flight (like we don't have anything better to do). I said it would be simpler for her to just hand over her pics to her mother now and I'll just print off more whenever. MIL said ok but only if I go make more copies right after breakfast. I said no (I had a good reason and was getting really annoyed at this point). Finally, my husband told her sternly to quit whining and give his grandma the pictures and that it won't kill her to wait a few days for new copies.

&#x200B;

MIL relented and gave the pics to her mother. Then my husband's aunt asked MIL why she won't just have me email her the pics and that's when MIL's response really annoyed me. MIL  ostentatiously wagged a finger back and forth in ""no, that won't do"" gesture (I hope I'm describing this well...) and declared ""No! I am old school. I want my pictures on paper!"".

&#x200B;

This annoyed me for two reasons. One: the snobby, entitled way in which she said this. Two: She is unemployed and thus has more time to go and print all the pictures she wants. But she won't because she either claims that she forgot her email password or her tablet is broken. There's always some excuse why I must make the prints for her and her parents.

He already had a key to my place but when he moved in he said he was going to make a copy to keep in his desk at work in case he ever lost the first one. I said that was smart as we work similar hours so I might not always be able to step out of work to help him get in and I have a spare key in my locker at work.

Since we moved in together I've noticed stuff has been moving. Nothing major, just stuff not being where I thought I left it. It always turns up and it's always in a logical place (eg I thought I left the remote on the arm of the sofa, it turns up on the coffee table) so I chalked it up to my boyfriend moving stuff about and didn't worry about it.

Then yesterday the system crashed at work, and there wasn't much actual work we could do, so I got permission to clock out early, which is a very rare occurrence for me. I got back to the flat, opened the door, and his mother was there. She had the TV on, was doing laundry, and the vacuum was out.

I asked why she was there (dumb question as she was obviously in the middle of cleaning) and she said that she did this for my boyfriend before we moved in together. I asked how she got in. She said she had a key. I asked how she got the key. My boyfriend gave it to her.

Me I can take it from here

Her: It's really no trouble, I'm nearly done

Me: No, really. I'm really particular about how everything is done. I'll take over.

She did leave the key, but she looked somewhere between sad and angry the whole time. I finished the cleaning. He got home and had apparently spoken to his mother. He was upset with me, saying she was his mother and I had no right to be ""mean"" or ""rude"" to her. He said she was doing us a favour since we both hate cleaning, it was his place too, and she'd been doing this for years (from what he said it sounds like the whole time he's been living alone, which I think is around a decade) and said again that I was a bitch to his mother and couldn't speak to her like that.

Her daughter's (5yo) school is closer to me so it works out for her in that she can pick her kid up, go to my place, wait until I get home, have dinner, then either sleep over or go to their own home.

I never actually discussed not having alcohol with him, but we try to never discuss anything alcohol related because he says it's hard to not drink when talking about drinking. Anyways, so I gave our families and friends a heads up that there would be no alcohol at the wedding/reception and that we didn't want anyone to bring any either. 


This didn't go well, and now I have a ton of people coming to me saying it's ridiculous and they've never heard of a wedding and reception with absolutely no drinking, and that having a few drinks is part of the celebration, and at the minimum we should have champagne or something for a toast (dont know if that's normal but every wedding in my family has had a couple drinks as a toast). My family is mad about me going against the ""tradition"" and for banning everyone from being able to drink. His family isn't excited about it either because they were looking forward to having fun and celebrating with drinks. A lot of people seem upset with me now. I just want a nice celebration with no drinking for our big day. AITA for saying absolutely no alcohol is allowed?



Edit: since I've had people say I should include this. It's not a long or extravagant wedding, it's a small casual sunset beach wedding with barely over 20 people invited. It's not going to be a long drawn out event, everybody attending lives in the area and none of them have children. The dress code is casual, swimming is encouraged and we're renting jet skis and a banana boat.",1130,3243,0.95
1105,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I are equal partners in our marriage. We both clean, cook, and care for our kids. I'm not boasting just telling how our marriage is bc I've read this sub enough I know some will try to spin it to make it seem like my wife does everything and I do nothing or I want praised- I don't, I'm just giving info.

We alternate who stays home when the kids are sick. The exception is if one of us has something we need to be at work for. Our son was sick and it was my turn to stay home. About 1:00 I got a call that one of my patients (I'm a cardiologist) was in ER and needed to go to cath lab and I was needed to do the cath. There are only 2 of us in town that can do the procedures it looked like this patient needed- me and a dr who was out of town. If we are both out of town the patient is shipped to a hospital 90 mins away. I called wife and asked if she could come home. She said no she was about to have a brainstorm meeting with her team. I asked if she could do that via videoconferencing at home office as son was sleeping. I explained about the patient and she held firm that no, she wasn't coming home. I called my mom and asked her to come sit with son so I could go in.

It was a bad case. We coded the guy twice, the procedure took longer than normal, we almost had to call in the surgeon to open him but we were able to get him stabilized and up to CICU. I checked my phone after and saw multiple missed calls/texts from wife. She was livid when she came home and my mom was there. My mom was a SAHM and my wife feels like my mom silently judges her for working as much as she does (she doesn't, she is really proud of my wife and is always bragging about her ""amazing DIL"" to friends). When I got home we fought. I was exhausted and told her I was sorry she was upset but I had a responsibility to my patient which she didn't take well and said I have a responsibility to her and our family. I agreed but added that I wasn't shirking that responsibility by going into work. Which only angered her more bc she thought I was saying she shirked her responsibility to family. After about 15 mins of back and forth I finally just said ""Look, you couldn't come home bc of a meeting and I couldn't stay home bc someone was dying. We both made decisions and (son) was taken care of."" She thought I was saying my job was more important than hers and when I didn't reply she took my silence to mean that I agreed. I conceded that yes, that afternoon, me going in was more important than her meeting to plan a marketing campaign for the local dealership. She left and went for a run, I started making dinner and we avoided one another all evening. This morning she texted that I was an asshole for going in and thinking her job wasn't important. I try to be aware that job/family balance is unfair for women bc of society expectation. I tried to put myself in my wife's shoes but I don’t think I’m an asshole. My sister says I am bc of the aforementioned imbalance for women. AITA?

Update/Edit: I was doing a good job of keeping up with the comments for awhile but fell behind. Just wanted to update and clarify some things. 

1. We have backup childcare in place in the event neither of us can stay home with or pick up a sick kid from school. This always starts with my mom and goes through about 7 people, including regular babysitters. We do not have a nanny agency here that we could call on in emergency situations and really, when we had access to one years ago before we moved to where we are now, we didn't feel comfortable using it because it was usually a stranger you are leaving your kid with and neither of us wanted to do that, especially a sick kid. Even though my wife feels that my mom is judging her for working, they actually have a great relationship and hang out doing spa days together, seeing movies, and taking cooking classes. I've asked my wife if my mom has said anything that makes her feel judged so I can talk to my mom but she always says no, she just has a ""feeling"" and then talks about mommy wars. 
2. Through three kids over 12 years, we've only  had a situation twice where we both had to be at work. Our system usually works well. Our kids somehow know not to get sick when I am on call and mom has important things going on at work. 
3. I was not on call. The other guy went out of town unexpectedly in the middle of the night and called in to someone different than I called into when I told the office I wasn't coming in. If I had known he was out of town then I would have asked my wife to trade me. I avoid being the sole caregiver for the kids when I am on call for these reasons. 

Now for the update- my wife had a crappy day yesterday. Her boss got onto her because an employee she supervises dropped the  ball and almost lost a big account for the company. My wife had to take over that account. Her boss's boss was also in the office and told the entire team off for subpar work. She was stressed and under pressure all day. On her way home she picked up soup for our son but when she got home my mom had already made him soup and was baking cookies with our daughters and telling them funny stories and my wife felt guilty and unneeded. My wife was still feeling angry and tense this morning and had lunch with her mentor who helped her talk through things and she also saw her therapist (she sees a therapist for anxiety and we see a marriage counselor about once a month for ""check ins""). She apologized when she came home and explained she was already feeling bad about not being home, was stressed bc of her day at work, wanted to relieve me so I could go attend to my patient, which all led to her guilty feelings of being a working mom. She's soaking in a bath now, our son is feeling better, and my patient is still on a ventilator but holding his own.",944,3513,0.96
1106,Everyone Sucks,"This just happened. I was walking up company stairs and this clique was walking down, obstructing the entirety of the stairway (it’s wide enough for 4 or 5 people). i was walking up the far right side and i didnt feel like i needed to move so i turned my head somewhat to the right and decided if they didnt want to bump into me they would need to move, wasnt gonna just wait.

so i collide shoulders with the lady walking on the side on their left, and she turns around and asks me if i’m blind and demanded am apology.

so i turn around and say that i am actually blind in my left eye (which is true, retinal detachment left my left eye blind, which concidentally is the side she hit me from), and then say something to the effect of how interesting hr would find it to hear that she was belittling me about it. i read out the name on her name tag while i was at it. her clique walked away in the middle of the conversation too, but there were plenty of other witnesses as everyone was heading to and from lunch.

added bonus, i’m also asian (thin eyes thing) so she started apologizing, and i just walked away and she followed me for a bit but i ignored her and put on headphones.

i actually have no intention of going to hr, i just wanted her to eat her words really. so aita? i’m expecting esh.",39,76,0.85

1108,Not the A-hole,"For brief context before I explain what exactly happened here: I'm 27yo gay male and there was a dude in high school, let's call him by his initial B, who loved picking on me for being effeminate.

To be clear, I was never a girly guy on purpose, I just can't exactly change my tone of voice and mannerism that come naturally. B and his friends tormented me verbally so much I developed extreme anxiety whenever I was in their proximity.

They called me every name in the book: fag, sissy, male Ugly Betty (because I was overweight and pimply back in high school). Then, things got 100% worse when we started having PE together. Long story short, B and his friends were one of the main reasons I absolutely, positively detested high school.

Well now, about a decade later, B came out as bisexual on Facebook through a long, public, ""heartbreaking"" essay elaborating his personal struggles. His post popped up on my feed due to a few mutual friends commenting and liking it. Ngl, I was pissed off when I read that. Not saying people can't change, but since B explicitly said in his post that he knew he was into boys since kindergarten, IMO that makes the fact that he tormented me in high school just for appearing gay even worse.

Anyway, all of the comments under B's post were overwhelmingly supportive for him ""living his truth"". That just aggravated me to be honest. I'm not sure whether this line of thought makes me bitter or not, but I felt the need to voice my own opinion. So I wrote something along the lines of, ""That's such a cute and manipulative post B, shame you didn't consider any of this stuff when you bullied me in high school for the exact same things you're now embracing."" I wanted people to see that he's not some sort of a blameless victim of a prejudiced society, as he tried to portray himself in the coming-out post.

Most of our classmates and others attacked me though, saying stuff like ""why rain on a fellow LGBT person's parade?"" and repeating all the generic stuff about people growing up, changing, finding themselves etc. One of my high school classmates even PM'd me to say, you don't even know what B went through since high school, he doesn't need your negativity, you're being petty and holding a grudge.

Am I honestly the asshole here? I sure feel like one now, but I still don't *believe* I am in the wrong for criticizing someone who made my high school experience miserable and caused my anxiety.",1638,10281,0.94

1110,Not the A-hole,"Little backstory, about 15years ago I just finished school and I was overseas working to try and save up money to get a degree in computer science.  My dad had heart problems and asked me one day to come back and take over his small construction business cause he's ""not doing well"".


I did what every good son would and came back and starting working for him.  His health improved a bit and I slowly started taking over his business.  Things went decently, I improved and expanded the business in every way possible.  He's said multiple times that I do a better job than he ever did.


Now 15 years later, he's basically retired and hasn't contributed anything to the business in the last 5 years, The business pretty much pays all hisexpenses.  On top of that every month he has been paying over a massive tithe to a TV evangelical church.


Business has gone downhill the last year and we're slowly losing money.  I don't think we can sustain another year at the current rate.  A couple of months ago I explained to him that business is bad and to please try and cut back on expenses.  


I feel screwed.  i never planned on spending my life working this job.  I'm earning a fraction of what I could have earned.  If we go bankrupt I'm fucked as I've signed surety on everything.  I can't get out as he's too old to take over and he doesn't have anything to fall back on.  I can't hire someone to replace me for my salary.  I'm stuck.


The straw finally broke the camels back when I found out that he had doubling his Tithe since I asked him to cut back.  I lost my shit!  Basically told him that as far as I'm concerned, it's not his money to give away and I ended up threatening him that I would completely shut down the business and I'll look for another job.  I explained to him that I realise we would both be fucked, but I can't carry on like this.


He won't talk to me because he honestly believes he's doing the right thing and that his tithe brings in business (Hey we haven't gone bankrupt yet!)  And my sister called me a asshole for threatening him with a ultimatum.",348,4485,0.97
1111,Not the A-hole,"Sorry I’m on mobile so my b. TL;DR at the bottom

I have been working a lot more than usual as a nanny and today I was able to get off early. I was starving so decided to go to this chain cafe to eat. At this place you seat yourself but there’s about 75 tables. I was the very first customer of the day and I sat basically in a corner in a booth. Well this older couple came in and sat at the very next table. So there’s only us in this restaurant and they chose to sit next to me. 

Well my dad called and my food hadn’t come yet so I’m tired, in pain, and starving. My dad was mad that I chose to go eat alone and not invite him so I slightly raise my voice and I’m like “you eat all the time without me and I’m just starving and upset and my foods coming so I gotta go” 

The older man turned around and said “young lady it’s rude to be on the phone in a nice restaurant. We’re trying to have a conversation but you are interrupting us” and I’m just sitting here shocked like bruh. I say back in a nice tone “I’m sorry but I sat here first and you chose to sit next to me.” The wife replies “it’s still rude to be on the telephone” so I’m just like “I’m sorry” 


My food got here and I ate and I’m a lot less irritated right now. I know being on your phone is rude, but this place is a very casual spot with tons of open seats yet they sat next to me. 


So AITA? 


TL;DR a couple sat next to me at a large cafe with 75 open tables then complained because I answered a phone call bc my voice was slightly raised and I was “interrupting” their conversation.",46,43,0.87
1112,No A-holes here,"Apologies for the format and rambling, this is my first post on reddit and I have a bad habit of unknowingly repeating myself but I tried to get this out in acceptable English... Sorry if this is bothersome, I will be happy to make edits if anything is unclear and would appreciate your opinions, thanks.

My girlfriend has recently gone vegan in the past few months, before this, we both ate meat together and she would often reject meal offers from me and then proceed to eat a decent portion of my meal ^((irrelevant, simply a pet peeve as it often reduced the enjoyment I would get from my meals fighting for my knife and fork.... not sure if im an asshole here, but not the big picture)). Anyway, I have always been a big meat eater, I am however am willing to accept that processed meats such as ham and salami and sausages are unhealthy and am trying to cut them from my diet, and would also agree to a certain degree that red meats are unhealthy, but I've never been big on red meat anyway... I have studied nutrition to a certain level in highschool and watch bodybuilding and related videos and meal guides almost excessively. One of my favourite content creators always references studies in his videos often from both sides of arguments. As such, based on my research and as a guy working in a physical job as well as interested in both building and maintaining muscle, I believe that meat is essential in a balanced diet in order to achieve an optimal level of protein.. I also love the taste of meat. I made it clear when she began to pursue a vegan lifestyle that although I support her doing so I myself have absolutely no interest in doing so in the foreseeable future, and have maintained this view throughout this period. I have however, been to a few vegan restuarants with her and shared vegan meals with her at home, and although I can enjoy the meals it's not a diet that I would want to restrict myself to. **Recently my girlfriend has been actively trying to convince me to go vegan, and when I have adamantly refused she has become openly frustrated with me for a lack of reason and has given me silent treatment when she feels that I have not provided reason enough.**

**Am I The Asshole here?** I feel like I made it clear from the beginning what my intentions were and I feel like she ignores my rebuttal based on my findings of a healthy diet, as information that she is exposed to provides different answers (I recognize that all studies are not equal and that many will provide conflicting answers, and often both these studies will respectively say that a diet consisting of meat or a vegan diet are healthier) She has also discussed the ethical reasons for veganism however I feel that I am not obligated to pursue a vegan diet and the backlash I am receiving in the situation is unfair..

He asked if I was interested in participating, and I declined. This seemed to rub my sister and BIL the wrong way and my sister is pushing me to say that the girls would enjoy hearing from a woman veteran. I still don’t want to.  I know they’re now upset with me because of it.

Maybe if the kids were in high school or seeking out advice, but the project seems disinteresting to me, not worth my time, and 2nd grade is too young for me to be comfortable talking to. Honestly, I very rarely discuss my military experience nor do I want to. AITA?",32,173,0.95
1115,Not the A-hole,"Pretty straight forward but here’s the dirty details: My dad upgraded his phone and gave me his old one, his email is either linked to mine or he left it logged in, something idk. Point being I have access to his emails. I didn’t log out because he has me take care of certain online bills for him, he’s not very computer literate (so he says). 

I’ve been linked for a few months now and I’ve been receiving notifications on my phone showing where my dad has Venmo’d my brother 1000s of dollars every month. Obviously I’m not supposed to be aware that this is happening. 

A little background on the family: My brother lives 2 hours from my dad, he is most definitely a substance abuser in hiding. He has been known to use people for money (whether they were his sugar daddy plain and simple or an older, wealthier man who didn’t know he was being used as a sugar daddy). My father is blindly unaware of these things. I do not really want to be the one to call my brother out, though I have several times in private to his face. 

My brothers roommate (also my ex girlfriend, long story) just passed away from an accidental drug overdose. My dad was sending my brother a couple thousand a month before this, but now my dad is sending almost double as much. I know for a fact that only one of them was on the lease and they lived in income-based housing. I only know this because my ex told me several months before she passed away. There is NO way my brother needs all that money. He owns his own website for selling clothes (paid for by sugar daddy #2), he also judges competitions on the weekends and I know he is paid well for it. 

Would I be the asshole for calling my dad and asking him WTF he is sending my brother all this cash for?? My dad is starting to go a little soft in the head, it’s fucked up for my brother to be digging into his money when my dad will certainly need it for retirement. His retirement is already drained from custody battles, hospital bills, his money-grubbing girlfriend.. 

I just want to help my dad, guys, but I’m scared if I come off as TA he will shut down and refuse to talk to me about it. My family is big on “mind your own business.” Not to mention I’m kind of a disappointment myself. I also had a drug addiction, but I was honest with my dad about it, we got the help I needed, I’m recovered but that doesn’t mean my reputation is.. My dad doesn’t know it, but I live in my car on the west coast. I would never ask him for money regardless because I made the decision to come here and struggle until I could get on my feet. My choices, my problems. I can live in my car at 23 and be fine, if my dad can’t work anymore he will not be able to do the same comfortably. 

WIBTA for calling my brother out?

UPDATE: Calling my dad in about an hour, Ill let y’all know how it goes. Thanks for the advice and support guys, I’m not sure I would’ve had the balls to address it had there not be an overwhelming response that I should. So thanks for the pressure/courage.

UPDATE: I called my father, he was aware of the money being transferred. He  confirmed to me that the death of my ex is the reason my brother is asking for so much money, and that he was helping him out before since my brothers SO stepped out of the picture not too long ago. My father was not aware that my brothers sugar daddy has been paying most of his bills, he was also pretty confused when I brought up the drug use but he seemed to accept it as a fact though he didn’t want to talk about it much. 

I told him I was not trying to cross any lines, but that I had noticed the transfers as they pinged my phone and I was concerned since he has some loans out on getting the house redone and he will probably want to retire someday. I avoided any mention of him being a victim or of him being fooled. He reassured me that he would be okay, he also told me he is not going to send anymore money to my brother as of right now. He will be calling him later not to confront him, but rather set up a repayment plan. I told him he is likely not to get anything back and I’ve asked him to remove his information from Venmo just as a precaution. He was actually very pleased with me, when we got off the phone he was adamant that he was proud of me and “loves me a whole bunch.”

All in all, I’m happy with how the situation turned out. I’m going to keep watch of his email, which he’s fine with, just to make sure nothing weird pops up. Thanks for seeing me through an awkward situation guys, I’m normally not the one to make waves but it feels really great to have done a solid for my dad.",25,30,0.9

He is always alone in school and I’m literally his only friend that he has. I’ve been trying to push him into going out and meeting girls and other people. I have been constantly telling him that he’s going to regret not going to parties, meeting new people, and missing out the college experience when he’s older and that he should come with me. He never listens and I keep telling him to loosen up a bit. I told him that MIT has an acceptance rate of 4% and NASA only hires every 4 years for astronauts and the odds of that are astronomically low (12 in 18500).

She's honestly been perfect, she cleans up after herself, if she eats something she replaces it within the same day, she pays us ""rent"" even though we tell her that's not necessary she still insists.

And plus she's a blast to be around, so I've been loving having her here. Something to know about us is that we are both ""*hardcore feminists*"" lol not really but we share a lot of the same strong views, she looks like your typical ""**SjW LiBtArD FeMiNaZi**"" as *certain* people would put it but she has a good sense of humor about it and steers into it.

Why I'm telling you about this is because well I do consider myself a feminist, I have very different views when it comes to sex. I love to be degraded, I love being called misogynistic names and being used like an object. If that's too tmi then I'm sorry but I needed to tell you for context, thank god reddit's anonymous because that is something I'd rather have no one know about lol.

Well she was supposed to be gone for the day, and me & bf decided to have some fun because we had nothing else to do. I should mention she did have a spare key and I can be quite vocal when horny. So we didn't hear her come home early and we had a pretty long session, I don't know how much she heard but apparently it was a lot.

When we finished I didn't even know she was home because she left for a while but when she came back, she was acting strange. She seemed to be giving my bf some bad looks and she asked to speak with me in private I thought she had something important to tell me. But she started asking me if I was alright or if I'm hurt and all these other questions.

I was confused as to what she meant and she told me she heard my bf saying some horrible things in the bedroom but I quickly explained to her what we were doing and that I liked it, she quickly went from concerned to disgusted. Asking me how I could degraded myself like that, if I had any respect for myself and how I could be with someone like my bf, I felt offended immediately because she was judging me and my bf for our private fantasies, We got into a stupid argument and it led to me kicking her out.

This happened last week and thankfully she hasn't told anyone and she has also apologized saying she was in the wrong and she shouldn't have judged us, I've forgiven her and she's not going to be staying with us anymore because I suspect she's still not entirely comfortable with our sex life.

1122,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:

So my son (14M) is special needs. He has ADHD, was slightly dyslexic (but that has calmed recently), and has high functioning to mild autism. He also started having alopecia (we confirmed this with the doctor, but luckily the bald spot is small). So we went to get a haircut (his hair was starting to get bushy around the bald spot), and we specifically told the barber to make his hair shorter (that’s what he wanted). However, the barber noticed he had a bald spot and I noticed he was shaving my son’s head. The final result ended up being my son being completely bald. The barber purposely did this, because he said you should either have full hair or no hair, none of this “bald spot” shit, as he put it. I lashed out at the barber (I used a lot of swear words) and threatened to sue that barber shop, and I also was planning on writing a bad review on yelp or google. I specifically told the barber what I wanted, and he chose to ignore it. Now I get that it’s just hair, and that hair grows back, but my son was already having alopecia, so I really don’t know if it will grow back or not. So AITA for lashing out and cussing at the barber and threatening to give a bad review and sue him because he made my son bald despite him having specific haircut instructions from me?",311,1479,0.92

There's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. 

Now I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

I'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

When she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her ""Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

She cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. 

AITA?

Edit: When I said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" I wasn't trying to be malicious. 
A) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. 
B) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

I wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.

Edit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.

Edit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

Last edit: For everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

Actually the last edit: My mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean I only watched the kids till 06:30. I usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",2743,21446,0.93
1129,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying I don’t hate dogs, I just don’t want to own one.

So to make a long story short my dad decided that since we had build a house he would get a dog on top of our two cats. 
I told him this was a bad idea because everyone was either working or studying full time. 
He ignored anyone and got one anyway.

Now since I was living out of town because of university I didn’t really care because this wouldn’t be my job and I also made it clear beforehand that I didn’t want a dog because in my opinion they are far more work then cats and I’m not cut out for that. (I’m mostly responsible for the cats because I wanted them.)

To my surprise my mom and my brother managed to constantly watch him by either taking the dog to work or staying at home if his schedule allowed him to.

Well due to some bad circumstances I stopped studying my previous major and moved back home to study something different.
I decided on this study from home model for my new major and got a job to finance everything.

Since I was now staying at home except for Monday and Saturday because those are my work days the dog got dumped on me full time. (My brother can’t watch him because of his internship and my mom only takes him to work on Monday even though she previously was able to take him to work more often.)
I can’t go out or have friends over because he will either misbehave or bark the entire time if some stranger aka my friends are over.
My friends don’t even want to come over because they get scared of him. He is about hip height. I also can’t leave him at home because he will start destroying doors and shoes, been there and boy he’d done it.

I tried to talk with my family to arrange a new schedule for the dog or anything but I was told that this is what family is for and to basically suck it up.

I’m kind of starting to resent the dog for basically holding me hostage at home even though none of this is his fault and my relationship with my parents is also pretty strained right now. 
So AITA for not wanting to put up with the dog anymore or at least only watch after him in a lower capacity?
Edit:
So I feel like I should clarify something. The reason for only working two days in a week is because I literally can’t work more hours. In order for me to not lose my status as a full time student which means that I get to keep most of my pay except for paying my insurance I can only work 20h a week which I currently do. However that is not enough money to move out on my own and pay for everything I need. The cost for my education takes away over half of my paycheck. If I were to take a second job I would no longer classify as a student and would have to pay every single tax that a full time,normal employee pays and my insurance would go up since I no longer qualify as a student. So I wouldn’t get a lot more money if any so that is out of the question. If there was another way I would do it in a heartbeat. My current plan is to finish school and then move out as soon as possible.",67,27,0.82
1130,Asshole,"First off, I'm not some nutty anti-vaxxer. I get all vaccines, boosters and have not had any issues with accepting a vaccine my doctor recommends. I've even considered an experimental vaccine (malaria vaccine when I went to visit tropical countries for a long time) ultimately didnt get it due to its low efficacy. My doctor doesnt push me to get a flu vaccine and tells me its optional.

My sister gave birth the other day and she said while pregnant months ago that anybody who wants to come visit the baby needs to be vaccinated including the flu vaccine. She never asked me directly but its one of those things I heard through the grape vine she said. Like I said I have no problem with normal vaccines but I draw the line at a flu shot. I'm a healthy male in my 30s, my doctor doesnt recommend it and I'm not in a ""priority group"" for the vaccine (those immuno-suppressed, elderly or very young) nor do I work in healthcare. I also think its foolish to think I can vaccinate myself against a virus that constantly reshapes itself rendering the flu vaccine given that year either useless or of diminished utility the next year. Something just seems silly to me to get a vaccine that will be rapidly obsolete and repeating the process yearly. I'd just rather keep myself healthy in the first place and maintain my immune system. Personal anecdote: I did get a flu shot once in my early 20s and damn it, I got the flu a few days later. So my faith in flu shots is pretty low. Maybe when I become elderly I'll change my mind but for now, no thanks.

Anyway, on to my sister. My wife and I have plans to go visit family for thanksgiving soon and we will have a chance to see my sister, family and the new baby. My hope is that she has forgotten what she asked for or maybe she just blurted out the flu vaccine idea due to ""pregnancy brain"". I dont know. She hasnt called me to make sure we get the shot and now with a new baby in her arms, she might never ask me directly since she has 100 other things going on. Does she really want the flu shot for every visitor? I dont know but I'm not asking.

Wife and I discussed this and we decided that if this is a show stopper for my sister, we just wont go see her or the baby. We'll take thanksgiving day to go visit a city nearby or do some site seeing, anything else. Im not going to argue with my sister in her own home nor do we want to create drama; we'll accept whatever is the course of action that results. Of course, I'd feel guilty for just not caving and missing my family and newborn nephew. But something internally rebels at the thought of constantly vaccinating myself against the flu. The best outcome I can hope for is this issue never comes up and she forgot about flu shots for everybody. What do you guys think? TA or not?

Edit:  id like to add that I have seen my sister and her husband since I learned about her desire for a flu shot.  We also were over her house a few weeks ago.  Nobody mentioned it to us ever so Im left to believe it was a rumor or maybe something she said/considered and ended up not wanting.  We all chat and talk regularly and nobody said anything to us about making sure we are flu vaccinated before visiting.  I made this post so I could prepare for the worst case scenario.",224,67,0.63

1132,Asshole,"Disclaimer: this happened during January or February, back when we had record low temperatures from the polar vortex.

So my friend invited me over to his dorm to cook with him, he picked me up because he lives on the opposite side of campus. and even with layers of jackets walking outside was literally a nightmare because it was like -15 out and we had CRAZY high winds. after we parked we had to walk for 4 minutes to get to his dorm and when i got to his dorm i felt like i was freeze dried. 

When he drove me back, I noticed a guy walking from the off-campus apartments to another area on campus which would of been a 12-15 minute walk outside, he didn’t look like he had a lot of money and wasn’t wearing a jacket or any gear to keep warm, he was only wearing jeans and a hoodie and some sneakers. he literally could lose his limbs from the temperature. 

I ask my friend if he could offer him a ride and he goes “no, i’m not letting a stranger in my car” I tell him, “please he could die from the temperature” and my friend goes “i’m not letting a stranger in my car, he’s dumb for going out like that” and he literally drove away.

1133,Not the A-hole," Due to a very long story, I ended up leaving the job of my dreams, where I had reached my long term goal years ahead of schedule. This left me feeling confused about next steps. The job I moved to left me with extra energy at the end of the day allowing me to write both fiction and academic scholarship. The process reminded me how much I love research and writing and made me want to further pursue that passion. 

Fast forward about three months, I’ve learned all I can about pursuing a job in academia, I have a draft paper ready for a symposium and to talk about during interviews. I also found a job posting in town for a tenure track prof job (so I don’t need to leave my SO because he does NOT want to move) and have an interview. I am stoked. 

The way this interview process works is the interview takes place at a conference. There is an online form and fee that you HAVE to fill out if you want to be a candidate considered by schools and interviewed at the conference. You CAN list geographic restrictions, but everything I’ve read says that you should not because it makes schools feel like you “won’t do what’s necessary “ to become a law prof and will then be turned off. 

I submit the form, excited by the interview I already have from the school I directly applied to. I do not expect to get any calls because I submitted the form late and my CV doesn’t scream academia. 

The day of the conference, I have 11 interviews. I’m excited. SO said to take interviews I get calls for since it is good practice and could be used as leverage for job I really want. I take interviews because I am genuinely excited by the options and all of the advice out there says that unless you would 100% reject an offer, go to the interview. 

I end up with 4 call backs for second interviews. I reject 1 because I know I would never go. Local School of my dreams never calls me back. Nearby School to us (about 2-2.5 hour drive) gives me an offer. 

Nearby school I thought would be fine because SO hates change so how about we live 30 miles north of our current location to cut my commute down to a little over an hour? He keeps his job. I have mine. Good compromise? He doesn’t want to do that because his dream for us is to be where we are now. I’m dumbfounded. Taking Nearby School means he would keep his friends, his job, be close to his family. Granted, that 30 miles means it would take an hour to see his friends where it takes 15 minutes now. But he works with 2 of his best friends. Isn’t that better than splitting up or moving 13 hours away? 

If I turn these down, there’s no guarantee it would be like this next year. The academic job market is bonkers.

TL;DR am I the asshole for getting caught up in my new dream, being courted by schools nationally, and wanting to move my SO 30 miles from where we are now (to a school I’m fine with but not the best I’ve interviewed with) so I can pursue this dream without completely uprooting him or breaking up?",26,26,0.87
1134,Not the A-hole,"The short of it: My dad’s eyesight is bad and he refuses to get glasses. Additionally, his reaction times are slower and he’s not as sharp as he used to be. He’s a danger on the road. 

Of course, *he* doesn’t view it that way. In his mind, he’s still 22 (not 74), and has lightning quick reflexes and perfect 20/20 vision. In reality, he has trouble seeing people on his 55” TV. He claims “glasses are for pussies”.

I’ve seen him blow through stop signs, not be able to read those electronic highway signs on overpasses, and nearly shit myself in terror at his night driving - he nearly killed kids in a crosswalk recently. (I ride with him sometimes when he wants me to help him in a store with lifting/carrying stuff)

I’ve tried having many conversations with him about his driving issues, from polite and respectful to bellowing “you nearly ran over kids in a crosswalk!”.  His response is defiant “it’s my god given right to drive!”


So, I took matters into my own hands and prevented access to his keys. I put them in a small lock box, and then put that lock box in a drawer in his garage, which I then secured closed with some brackets and security hex screws. He does not have the combo or the appropriate driver head to remove the screws. The keys are still on his property, he just can’t reach them. 

I’ve been called all kinds of names by him (thief, traitor, communist) and my brother in another state has said “you can’t take a man’s right to drive”. When I told him that dad needs glasses and refuses to get them, he said “that’s for cops to sort out”. 

In the meantime, I’m working on getting his physician or the DMV to indicate he’s no longer fit to drive. The lockbox and drawer are an interim measure.

I work at a popular Canadian coffee chain, in a large Muslim community. So, as you can guess, a lot of Muslim people come into our store. Now, most items on the menu are halal, but little things like certain baked goods and marshmallows are not.
Whenever someone asks, I will tell them exactly what is/isn't halal and they order accordingly. 

However, the issues arises when someone wearing a headscarf/burqa comes in and orders something non-halal. I cannot say for sure they are muslim, and my muslim manager says to not say anything unless they ask, but that feels wrong? But on the few occasions I have said something I think I have offended people who felt like I was judging their order:( I never want to offend anyone.

TL;DR: Muslim people order non-halal food in my cafe and I don't say anything unless asked. AITA?

1139,Not the A-hole,"I have been wanting to join for a while. Even my father was wanting me to join and do military. After a while I guess it manifested into my own dream. 
Anyways, I've been talking to the recruiters and everything looks good besides my weight. (I'm 5Ib off for body fat but easy to fix) I told my father about coming in because I'm turning 18 very soon but nonetheless I'm 17 and they were hoping I can go ahead and get in the system.  
Instead of the reaction was hoping for, he freaked out. He was telling me not to join right away. He told me I should do college and become an officer but that was only half of the reason he's asking me to stay. He then starts ranting on about how the social security benefits he gets from me being a dependent help a lot. Straight after saying this he told me to come home and to ""not fuck everything up"". 
I was absolutely more than surprised so I got home.

 A bit of background, we've had a couple of court cases having to do with my mother and a child support issue. it's still continuous because she didn't pay enough child support and from what I can tell, she has stolen a good amount of money that my dad has made. It also doesn't help the fact that my dad's unemployed and almost 70. Where I live we can get child support until 19.
another issue that's going to need some background is, when I was younger my mother dislocated my jaw and I needed surgery to fix it. Originally I was going to do a case against her for pain and suffering, but you can't join with any pending court cases so I spent a while learning how to let it go.

Anyways I got home and he starts explaining how if I leave he can't get money from child support cases. 
Tells me, I'm going to ruin the court cases that he's trying to press. I start telling him how I've decided to drop the case against my mother because of the pending court case issue. He absolutely goes ballistic on me and tells me that I'm being a flake and I'm selfish. He calls me selfish due to the fact that if press a case, it will help his situation in court. That what I'm doing is going to hurt everything he's been working towards and that I shouldn't be worried about my own selfish wants. 
He starts letting my twin sister yell at me about it. I spend the whole night with them both being hostile and me crying going to bed. I think I was crying more because all I wanted to do was make him proud and now what he wanted, I no longer am allowed to want till I'm 22 (4 year college). I know he only wants this because I'll be a full time college student and yes it might help me but I won't be happy. 

Woke up next morning to my dad screaming about me dropping the case and telling me that he is refusing to tell the lawyer that I dropped it. In fact he was telling me that he was going to force me to press it. My sister tells me I'm selfish because this could be in a way Justice for both our abuse. I keep telling her it could hurt me joining and she also becomes livid. 

Idk guys, I'm pretty upset and emotional about this but AITA???

1140,Not the A-hole,"I do suspect IATA in this situation. What I would like to know is if ESH or it's just me.

Recently it was my (26F) boyfriend's (25M) birthday. I usually budget $300-$400 dollars on presents/activities because bdays are important to me.

I spent $200+ on presents for BF, but I also wanted to do fun things on his bday, and go out to dinner. His sister (23F) recently moved in with him; we’re friendly but not best friends. I do not live with BF. Still, I obviously wanted to include her in our plans.

Originally, the 3 of us planned to hang out during the afternoon, get lunch, and then BF and I would get dinner. He requested wagyu steak, so I made a reservation for 2 at a nice restaurant. I planned to spend at least $250 on dinner, + afternoon activity cost. I also told his sister that she was welcome to dinner if she wanted. She declined.

The day before, his sister told me that she was too tired to do things in the afternoon and just wanted to go to dinner. I changed the reservation, and asked if she would possibly consider covering her meal, as I hadn’t budgeted paying for 3 people last minute. She agreed (""of course I would pay for my own meal"") and we eventually agreed to split dinner. I intended to pay for BF.

At dinner, she insisted on paying the entire bill. I protested, but gave up before it became awkward. I did insist on covering the tip. The next day, she venmo'd me the tip back. I didn't give it another thought, except to think that it was very kind of her.

Yesterday, nearly a month later, she ""mentioned"" this situation to her parents, who have an emotionally abusive and toxic relationship with my BF, and they called him, upset. Obviously he was blindsided, since I didn't think it necessary to inform him how we’d agreed to pay for his birthday dinner. His parents have never met me or spoken to me, but are extremely hostile to me for reasons having to do with my culture and race. This convo has not done great things for our relationship.

Personally, I can see that it may have been boneheaded not to at least offer to pay for everyone's meals. In retrospect, I should have done so, or I should not have invited his sister in the first place--if there are future meals, I will not be inviting her. But I also feel that she could have 1) told me right then, or at the very least, 2) talked to me in private instead of complaining to her parents and having them come down on BF, who shouldn't have had to deal with this. I know actions speak louder than intentions, but I thought I was doing a kind thing by inviting her to what was clearly a “date” and not asking her to split the bill, which would easily have been an additional $100+ for her.

tl;dr: took my boyfriend out to a fancy birthday dinner, with an open invitation to his sister, but asked her to cover her entree. She agreed, then covered the entire bill despite my protests. Now she's mad and complaining to her parents a month later. Who's the asshole here?",145,655,0.95

1143,Everyone Sucks,"Just to note that my husband has a twin brother who is also married. My husbands family is what I would call extremely enmeshed with no boundaries. The parents have narcissistic tendencies, and make it known that they feel their sons are indebted to them for raising them. They appear to feel highly threatened by their sons wives and treat them very poorly. Everybody acknowledges this but nothing is done about it because the sons are scared to rock the boat.

I was being treated poorly by my in-laws in my first year of marriage so I ultimately banned them from coming to our home and my husband continues his relationship with them outside our home.

My husbands birthday was approaching and I asked him to decide his plans as there was drama the year before with his parents wanting two days worth of celebrations at their home (it wasn’t a significant birthday, I think they were just trying to hog the weekend so we couldn’t do anything together). He decided that the day before his birthday he would see his family at his parents house and on his actually day he would go to work and then we would go out for dinner. The day before he was at his parents house, and when his Mother found out he would not be celebrating the actual birthday at her house, she began crying and said that now that he has his wife he no longer needs her etc. This is very typical of her behaviour. My husband then came home and said that he was actually going to spend some of his birthday at his parents house before we went out for dinner and that I was welcome. He had clearly changed his mind after his Mom had cried her crocodile tears to get her way. I did not want to go to his parents house as I feel extremely uncomfortable in their home and in their presence, so my husband proceeded to say he would go without me. I found it very hurtful that he would be celebrating his birthday and cutting his cake at his parents house without me. We had a discussion where I said he needs to follow through with his decisions and not change his mind just because his parents cry or make a scene. He agreed and chose to stick to his original plans. 

When his twin brother came to realise that my husband would not be going to his parents house on their birthday, his brother proposed they cut a cake at his house instead before we went out for dinner. His brother is not my biggest fan either as I don’t obey his parents and he feels that I should. And so this is what we did in the end, spent some time at his brothers house where his parents were present, and then went on to dinner ourselves.

This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

So I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

So she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..

Edit: To clarify: the sports car is the only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

Context update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car which is pissing her off.

Edit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).
2. She only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. We've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. Yes, I did ""warn"" her that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. I do no treat my wife as a child.
6. We have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. We also own things together of course.
7. The reason I sold my ""other"" car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. A lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo
9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". I saved up for many many years for the car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. A lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. Both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

1154,Not the A-hole,"(My aunt is the one who supervises us when our 
parents are not around. She also fetches us from school if my brother can't pick us up.)

I have a cooking task tomorrow for school and I wanted to see if I had all the ingredients at home. My aunt's the one who handles our food so she knew what was available in our kitchen.

I asked her if we had fish sauce at home while we were walking home from school today and she said yes. So I left it at that.

After dinner, I also asked her where the other ingredients were, and she said we'd go buy some of the missing ingredients in the farmer's market first thing in the morning, then I asked where the fish sauce was to see how much of it is left so I can prepare it in advance.

Then she exploded and proceeded to call me annoying for asking that question repeatedly, when I've only asked that question twice, saying how she's so stressed and tired of looking after us.

I was also stressed because of a few problems with my cooking task, since my teacher forgot to make our recipe she assigned us and only gave us the list of ingredients needed, not the procedure, so I ended up talking back, saying how I've only asked twice. I also told her how I asked politely yet she answered back in such rude way.

She proceeded to call me a 'b¡tch' (in our language, it's 'maldita') and how I think I'm all superior and everything, answering back to a grown-up.

I told her that no sane person likes hearing negative things about them, and that I can't handle them telling me all the time what they don't like about me. So, I ended up telling her what I didn't like about her (which was how she was so impatient and irritable towards everything I do) and we left the argument at that.

Was I the asshole?

1159,Not the A-hole,"To make a long story short, my boyfriend of 3+ years (Sam) is going through some kind of manic episode. He's currently not speaking to me. 

Lisa and I have been best friends for almost 15 years. Her daughters are my godkids, I was maid of honour at her wedding, we refer to each other as family constantly. She married Brett, who has become good friends with Sam over the years. 

Sam went to Lisa and Brett almost immediately when his episode began. They fully believed everything he told them and didn't even message me to see if I was ok (even though they knew I was basically homeless as he wasn't letting me come home). After a few weeks of this, Sam asked Lisa to message me because I was refusing to 'talk' to them (he insisted I needed to turn to my friends for support, whereas I wanted to.. you know.. handle my adult relationship in peace rather than like a teenager). She didn't ask how I was, basically just said 'hey Sam wanted me to tell you we're here if you want to talk'. 

Sam has now decided we're broken up. He threw half of my things on my parent's driveway at 9pm in the rain. He let me grab the 'rest' of my things only with police in attendance. The only message I've gotten from Brett was when I was on the way to pick my things up, and all he said was 'we love and support you both'. They both ignored messages from me telling them that Sam had dumped my things on the driveway where I asked if this helped them understand he's clearly not in his right mind.

They invited both of us to an event the following week, so I messaged Lisa and told her I didn't know how to continue our friendship if she was ok continuing a friendship with him when he's treating me like this. I explained I felt she wasn't in my corner and it hurt that she wasn't asking me what was going on or if I was ok, especially when I know Sam had been at their place 5-6 times in the space of the last 6 weeks or so (to be fair, he was helping them move and I'm disabled and can't lift). There was no reply, so I waited another 10 days and messaged again saying clearly they've chosen their side, and as much as it hurts I hope his friendship makes them happier than mine did. 

Lisa said she didn't respond to the previous message because she wanted me to realize how childish my 'ultimatum' was and that Sam didn't deserve to be frozen out just because he doesn't want to be with me. She said she misses me but it's hard to know what to believe when everything I'm saying is the polar opposite to what Sam is saying.

So... am I being the asshole, or is the way Lisa is acting OK?

&#x200B;

before anyone asks: I didn't cheat, didn't lie, didn't steal, didn't do anything to Sam besides love and support him and turn my life upside down trying to make him happy. He genuinely is in the midst of some sort of episode, and has diagnosed bipolar disorder and a history of going on and off meds suddenly.",67,44,0.86
1160,Not the A-hole,"My father passed away unexpectedly from a rare cancer May 2018. We knew he was sick but he and his wife down played the severity until 2 weeks before he passed. Honestly the only reason we found out is because I have just had a traumatic pregnancy and had given birth via c-section at 29 weeks. The next day I was told your dad has days to live do you want to go visit him before he dies. 

So after he passed, my step mom and my sisters had a huge falling out. They already didn’t like each other and my step mom is a huge control freak and didn’t want to let any of us have some of our fathers ashs. Eventually that was resolved by our grandmother. She’s also refused to give us back family belongings like photos. I am currently the only one in contact with her. 

She claimed she still wanted to be a grandmother to my child and I figured that’s what my dad would’ve wanted so I agreed.  She’s barely contacted me since last thanksgiving. If I don’t reach out first we don’t speak. The last time she contacted me  on her own was Mother’s Day. 

In the past few months I’ve learned that’s she’s already started dating. I’m assuming she’s moving on and doesn’t want to deal with her deceased husbands family any longer.

WIBTA if I stopped making the effort or am I being to harsh on her. She’d been through a lot when my dad was sick so maybe she’s still processing/grieving in her own way.",47,289,0.96
1161,Asshole,"My daughter is nineteen and a college student, and lives with us as our house within walking distance from campus. She is dating a boy I've met a few times here and there and apparently he stays in a dorm.

About a week ago I came home early from work because I felt sick, and, to cut it short, heard my daughter having sex in her room upstairs. I knew it wasn't a movie they were watching because I may have had sex once or twice before, so there was no assuming what was happening. I tried to make as much noise as I could by turning on the TV, using the (loud) ice machine, or opening and closing the fridge. Sure enough, I heard silence, and then scrambling and ten minutes later they were coming downstairs. We had awkward small talk before the boyfriend left, and I kind of sat my daughter down and explained that I do not want that happening again and that she can have sex in her own place, but not here.

My wife came home and we talked about it and she disagreed with me. She said that if we're not home or if we can't hear it, it shouldn't matter. I asked her if she was really okay with our daughter having sex in the house and she said that she'd rather it be there than anywhere else.

I do not care that my daughter is active. I know that is normal and she knows that as long as she is safe, me and her mom won't judge her for it. But, I do want to set boundaries in the house. I am willing to change my position I just want some other insight on this.",227,293,0.88

This was a couple of years ago, but sometimes I think about it and I’m still not sure if I overreacted or if I was right to be as angry as teenage me could be. 

Mobile user so please excuse typos.

To start: I have an older sister who studied in Europe (we’re in the US) while I was in high school. We’re really close. She came back during my senior year.

My mom had a car, I learned how to drive in that car. My mom had bought a new truck and had told me for months, if not a year that I would be getting the car when she got a new one. 

The day before the test, my mom tells me that I’ll have to use her old truck, which had several cosmetic and minor internal issues, like no AC. 

Now here’s the huge issue; I did NOT learn how to drive in that. Zero confidence.

Turns out, my sister needed the car from now on, because she decided to stay in town instead of moving somewhere else when she came back. 

No matter what I said, reminded my mom of what she had promised, she basically told me to deal with it and I’ll be fine and “no she doesn’t have favorites”.

I mean somehow I passed my test (I almost threw up while parallel parking), but the whole experience was ruined and I never got an apology for the sudden change.

So, AITA for getting angry as all teen hell when my mom pulled a switcharoo on me with my sister when she had promised to give *me* her car?

Edit: To be clear I’m asking if I was in the wrong for getting upset, at the time my mom got angry at me for not being okay with her sudden change.",29,92,0.9
1164,Everyone Sucks,"I was on my way back home from uni, talking to a friend on the phone when a middle-aged woman came towards me, swinging her arms and yelling ""Hello! Hello!"" At first I didn't think she was talking to me until I looked at her and she pointed at me and said ""Yeah you!"" She started berating me, yelling at me for talking so loudly on my phone and disturbing other people. 

At first I was flabbergasted since I never thought that talking on phone in public would be rude or something and then I got pissed that she talked to me in that matter and said ""Alright, what am I disturbing you in?"". She kept talking over me and I said ""Can you let me speak?"" To which she retorted ""No"".   
Me: ""Alright then we're not having this conversation here."" While she walked away she kept yelling and I basically dismissed her saying ""Yeah thanks. Thanks.""

But now I'm questioning if that's some unspoken public manners rule I just didn't think about before. So, AITA?",34,46,0.9

1166,Not the A-hole,"Long story short, my (future) mother-in-law has no respect for boundaries. It's been a repeated pattern and regardless of how much time we spend voicing issues, enforcing boundaries, practicing mindfulness, explaining problems etc she just gets upset, attempts to manipulate us emotionally and ultimately never learns. She's a really nice person generally , and I do love her... she just has some control issues (to put it nicely!)

Anyway! Wedding date is booked, wedding planning is going well and I'm feeling like an asshole for factoring in MIL fuckery and attempting to curve ball her. She has already meddled more times than I care to list but the most annoying recently was she ruined the surprise of posting save the date announcements because she phoned family and told them all... which I should have seen coming... as well as promising my fiancés little cousin that she could be a bridesmaid without asking me (shes not going to be... I have two adult bridesmaids and that's it. I can't deal with children in the bridal party, just extra stress I won't need! sorry!) She then got shitty with me when I would not accept her paying for the cousins dress as a compromise. Nevermind, move on!

 However, I'm now being more coy with what I tell her. She wants to know wedding colours so she can get an outfit so I just told her what flowers we are having. I feel like a dick but honestly,  I wouldn't put it past her attempting to match the bridal party (or try to and failing) or even buying the same outfit as my mum (mum is mother and father of the bride so is walking me down the aisle and is therefore going to be dressed to go with the bridal party) just so that she can be special. 

AITA? I don't want her to feel excluded, it's her sons wedding too, I know that, but I feel like I need to do damage limitations before hand to stop any ridiculousness later on!",31,168,0.93

I lost my job a month ago. I have just started applying again and I know I’ll get one soon because my field has a decent job market around our area. My wife makes more money than me, she is the bread winner.

Her sister needs some place to stay, and I’m not really about it. She could stay with her mom in their house but she’d rather stay here. My wife took a shot at me for not having a job (she needs to chill on me, this is my first time being fired ever) in a long span of working. 

Also mentioned how she brings in more money than me, and she’s practically supporting both of us right now. Not true, we have money and I’ve been saving up money.

1179,Not the A-hole,"Hey, this is one of my first posts and I'm only posting because this really has gotten out of hand between me(M26) and my girl(M22). It might seem like a simple problem but over time it's causing a lot of anger. Basically, my girlfriend and I have different schedules. We have classes at different times, and her being a girl and me being a guy. I don't spend as much time getting ready in the morning as her. For example, if she has class at 8, she wakes up at 6 and I wake up at 7:30. That's not the problem though, the problem is she sets alarms starting an hour to 90min before she needs to wake up every morning. for example, if she needs to wake up at 6, she sets an alarm at 5:15 every 5-6minutes until like 6:15 which is her goal wake up time. Pretty much, every morning for an hour straight there's constant alarms for an hour until she needs to wake up. I wake up from the first and second one, and can't go back to sleep after. I told her the problem, told her to limit it to 1-2 alarms and she refuses. She says she's always done it this way and she's not gonna change it now for anyone, and that she ""can't"" change it and when I ask why she says because that's how I am.

One of my friends already had a pretty shitty attitude the whole day towards me (She later texted me and apologized for being rude but that she wasn’t mad at me but at another friend) so I’ll set the scene. Me, my girlfriend, my good friend and then his cousin and her boyfriend are sitting around a table and all order food. She orders food but asks for hash browns instead of chopped up potatoes in her skillet.. no big deal easy enough. Food comes out.. she has diced potatoes in her skillet not hash browns. She tells the waiter the waiter apologized up and down took it back and they put hash browns on top and asked her if that would be fine otherwise they could remake it for her.. she takes the food tells the waiter it’s fine and she will eat it. About 20 minutes in after the waiter came by a few times she tells him she no longer wants the food and just to take it off the check. (She didn’t eat any of it) so he takes it back, scratches it off the check and then comes back and apologizes again... at this point the waiter was literally shaking and he even said multiple times “this was my fault my hand writing was sloppy and the cook didn’t get what I wrote” he then shows us his note pad and the order and shows us it was sloppy and that it was again his fault. Well he then asks her if she wants to speak to the manager as he’s shaking. She smiles no no no it’s fine don’t worry and all is good. 

Well a few days ago I went back to the restaurant and was looking at reviews and the first review I found was a 1 star review from her and the whole event was listed incorrectly. She said they told her it was the cooks fault and that if they were to make her a new one she would need to wait for ever for it.. then she also stated that you could tell they didn’t care about her food cause the way they were treating her.. 

I showed some of my friends and they all agree that she complexity falsified the review to look good on her part and basically gave them a 1 star rating for no reason at all.

I’m starting to kinda not like being around her to begin with but this was the final straw me.. I know it seems a bit extreme but WIBTA for no longer talking to her.

Edit: I forgot to add that this review was also really hypocritical of her as a few weeks before we ordered pizzas for delivery and I tipped the guy 8 bucks and she got upset at how low I tipped for a 40 dollar order.

I pay for all fun expenses (activities, groceries, dinners out, etc) but he def paid half the rent this month from savings. 

We love snow sports. Within the last two weeks, hes bought new boots and pants totaling about $600. We needed them to be able to go so I was okay with it. 

Yesterday I lost it. still with no job, with me as the only prospect of supporting us until he has one, he cashed in credit card points and bought a pink snowboarding jacket because it was cooler than the one he currently has. He owns a perfectly functional and kind of cool looking one. 

I get it - it's free rewards earned from his spending. His to do as he pleases right?

My argument- what if his unemployment lasts longer than these two months? His savings is dwindling. I know hes under $4k at this point.

1188,Asshole,"My bf and I have been living together for 4 years, so we’re practically already married but it feels important to him that we make it “official”. I’m not sure that it’s something that’s very important for me but I have nothing against marriage on a whole. I’m the type to always cry at weddings even if they’re just between fictional characters on TV, I find it all very sweet and romantic and I’m totally on board. Btw I say “bf” because he never really proposed, we just sort of started planning our wedding recently.

The thing is, a typical wedding is not really something I want for myself, for various reasons. It all boils down to the fact that I would be highly uncomfortable with a typical wedding. There’s just nothing about it that sounds appealing to me and I want my wedding day to be fun, not feel like a chore. So the only way I can envision us getting married is if we elope and/or it’s just the two of us. Absolutely no one else.

My bf on the other hand thinks that’s the most horrible idea on Earth. He thinks it wouldn’t be a proper or serious wedding if the people he cared about (his parents and siblings) weren’t there. 

We literally just had a conversation about this that ended up with somewhat of a fight and him storming away. He says he just can’t understand the source of my discomfort. Well, I understand and respect the fact that he has a specific vision for his wedding day and I’m fine with us just not getting married if we can’t come to a solution we both like. He seems to be hurt by this and seems to think I have my priorities wrong.

1189,Not enough info,"Right off the bat I sound like the antichrist but hear me out:

My dream for as long as I can remember, and I can thank my tiger parents for this, is to play music professionally. Violin from age 4, nylon guitar from age 6, saxophone from age 10, piano from age 10, and I dabbled in many other instruments too although I took closest to violin and guitar.

Right now my girlfriend and I live in squalor. She doesn't make much, I'm in school for chemistry, I figured that would be my path even though it's not my passion. When I finish, I potentially have years before I land a job and it might not even be my endgame career job. My girlfriend is expecting and due in 6 months. We live in a very bad neighborhood with only one bedroom, and our budget is pretty closed to maxed out.

I took a month to visit family in Hong Kong last year and got to see the HK Philharmonic. I spoke with many people (trying to make connections wherever I can, even if our disciplines or careers don't match) and I might have missed something but I felt like I got a foot in the door for joining their symphony for first violin. Some of these people saw me playing at a bar and I guess they liked my stuff. It's surreal to be sure.

I chalked it up to people talking shop, there's no way I could get in there but lo' and behold, three weeks ago I got an offer of employment which pays very well and includes housing allowance. Problem is I need to leave the country. I spoke to my girlfriend, even proposed we get married and uproot our lives, but she's not on board. Not only with not leaving but also me not leaving.

I still want to do it but our child complicates things. This is more money than I would have imagined and everything's verified with the staff at the HKPS. I would do it even if my salary were halved. I get to live my literal dream.

I would take my signing bonus and buy my girlfriend a house to live in. I would also pay whatever child support was reasonable and I would visit at least a couple times a year. I still feel very slimy but I don't know what is ""enough"" to make this right, if that's even possible.

1193,No A-holes here,"Hi everyone,

I have a group of friends that I play video games with and talk to almost daily. I know 4 of them in real life, while the other is an online buddy. All of us are 18 years old, except for the online friend, who is 16. All male.

We had the idea of renting out a cabin for a few days over Holiday break and staying there. We would travel a state over to pick up our online friend, who I'll call Mike. 

Mike trusts us as online friends and wanted to go, but he initially told us that it probably wouldnt happen because he is essentially asking his parents to go away for a few days and stay in a cabin with 4 guys that he has never met in real life. Much to his surprise, however, his mom will allow it, under the condition that his mom can come and ""chaperone"". 

To be clear, the rest of the group is okay with this. It doesn't ruin any plans if she came. We werent going to drink or do anything stupid. Likely just chill in the cabin, use the various amenities, and play video games all day. However, this poses a question about expenses. With the extra person essentially coming, we need to pick a different cabin. It may or may not be more expensive, just depends on if we get a good deal.

**My question, however, is if I would be the asshole for asking Mike's mom (and expecting her) to pay her portion of the trip. We would split the price evenly among all members, which includes gas, rental cost, food, and other fees. Part of me thinks that it is totally reasonable to ask such a thing but at the same time it feels somewhat rude to do so.**

So, Reddit, WIBTA?

**EDIT:** Thanks for the sound advice, everyone! Hopefully everything goes well and she does not disapprove of paying for herself, as we really want Mike to come along.",23,49,0.94
1194,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I know the title makes it sound like this is a no-brainer, but I want to get all the information out there before anyone makes any judgements. Throwaway and fake names for obvious reasons.

So, at the moment, I (18M, high school senior) live at home with my parents (40sF and 50sM) and my sister (15F). My sister, who we'll call Genie, has a boyfriend (16M), who we'll call Jack. 

Jack has been dealt a shitty hand in life. His dad's in jail, and his mom died a couple of years back, so he's been living with his grandma. Last week, she died after a stroke. Jack has, at least temporarily, moved in with us, sleeping in our downstairs basement. He would most likely be homeless if he weren't with us.

Now that you have some background on Jack, here's some background on me. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (not saying which one) about a year ago. It was pretty serious, and I was hospitalized for a few days. I currently take infusions of immunosuppressant drugs every two months to deal with this, which has led to my immune system being weaker than the average person.

Jack, for his part, refuses to get a flu shot because he's scared of needles. Flu mist is not an option in our area anymore, due to studies suggesting it's less effective than the shot. Would I be the asshole if I put my foot down, and said he has to get a flu shot to stay with us?

UPDATE: He's planning to move in with one of his aunts in a couple of weeks, and we've talked him in to getting a flu shot this weekend. Deleting this account now. Was /u/aitaflushotthrow.",89,194,0.91
1195,Not the A-hole,"I (22f) work in an office. I'm also bisexual and I've been in a relationship with a woman for just over a year.

I have this coworker, ""Jan"". She seemed friendly enough at first, but the second we a conversation that went beyond ""how was your weekend"" I realised that she's very religious (Roman Catholic). I didn't think that automatically made her homophobic (I'm Jewish myself) but it did make me approach the situation with a bit more caution than I would have otherwise.

My girlfriend's name is Christina and if I'm ever unsure about someone being pro or anti gay I just call her Chris and avoid pronouns (she does the same and calls me Lee if in doubt), and I did this for a while with Jan, but I always worried she noticed something was weird, because I'd always be going to great lengths to say Chris instead of using she/her.

Then a little while ago this thing came on the radio about the gay marriage results in Ireland. She asked me what I thought and while I think it's amazing I was careful to keep my response neutral (I think I said it wasn't my business or something like that) Jan, however, was not a fan, and gave the classic spiel about ruining the sanctity of marriage.

The next day she starts up with small talk, asking about Chris. I say ""I think it's best we stick to office talk.""

She doesn't know what she did wrong. I have not told her about my sexuality or my girlfriend. Other coworkers have noticed that we've gone from talking a lot to bare minimum (""doing a coffee run, want anything?"" ""I've sent something to your printer by accident, can you pass it here?"" ""do you have the paper copy of \[client document\]?"") Jan has communicated to another coworker that she doesn't know what she did to upset me.

AITA for saying we should keep it to office talk and not telling her why?

&#x200B;

Edit: I appreciate the comments saying I can be the one to change her mind but that's not necessarily how it works. My parents were very religious and I couldn't get them to accept me, my few months of conversation with a coworker won't be enough to change her mind, either. And I'm not going to HR unless she finds out, but where we live I legally can't be fired for being bi. They could maybe get angry that I'm bi and fire me and say it's for something else, but I am good at what I do so that's unlikely.",710,3635,0.96
1196,Not the A-hole,"This is a long story but I have a space limit so stay with me.

I went to a bachelorette party this past weekend for a buddy of mine. A few of us at the party our part of our friend group but there were also some dudes that we didn’t know as well.
This has been in the works for a few months now and it was suppose to a weekend full of drinking, gambling, and partying. 
When me and another one of our friends get there the bachelor’s brother has us both sign a non disclosure agreement that we can not talk about or mention the party after it’s over or with anyone that wasn’t present at the party.  Ok, weird never had to do that for a bachelor party but we sign and I didn’t even really know if it was a legal document.

Well the weekend is crazy fun. First day we do activities like skydiving, archery, and gold. Second day is the big drinking and gambling day. Everyone is smacked and we’re at a resort and head back to our suite at around 1 am. Some of the guys including bachelor do some coke.  It’s not something we thought bachelor did before our friend group never does it. They hire private strippers so that was going on for about another hour before some of the guys were fucking said strippers.

I am perfectly happy in my relationship so my buddy and and are just trying to find some space to crash and not be apart of what’s really going on so we go back downstairs and play a bit more roulette.
When we go upstairs I wanna go to the bathroom but the main one is being used (people are throwing up at this point) and walk in to the bedroom with bachelors head facing me and a stripper taking him in her ass. Like I full on see him penetrating her. I excuse myself and go back outside.

When I go back home after the weekend I fell my girlfriend because honestly I feel bad for bachelor’s fiancé. She’s a shy sweet girl who loves bachelor a lot. My girl is friends with her so I guess I should of known it would have major consequences because my girlfriend wants to tell bachelor’s fiancé and they are getting married this weekend.  I don’t even know if they can even cancel without crazy fees because it’s an expensive venue. 
I am afraid of the backlash this will cause especially signing that form. I told my girl this and she understands the risk but she said we can’t let the poor girl go through with marrying bachelor and possibly catching an STD.

1197,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend (29F) of 2.5 years and I (27F) are long distance as of about two months ago, but since her job wanted her to relocate so suddenly they agreed to fund her weekend flights back to tie up loose ends and such. This weekend was her last ""free"" visit, and basically, my roommate flew into hysterics after my girlfriend accidentally locked her out. 

For context, I live with one roommate (29F) who is the sister of the person my best friend (33F) is dating. They both dislike my girlfriend. Not because of anything that has happened but just as a person. I have had to expicitly tell them to stop commenting on my relationship because it makes me uncomfortable. To their credit, up until now they've stopped. We had our rough patches, but she and I have been very happy for a long time. 

So my GF has been staying with me for 2-3 nights on the weekends and we make an effort to keep to ourselves and stay primarily in my room when my roommate is here. Two days ago she came with me to my DnD group, but near the end of the night she asked if she could take a rideshare home to sleep since she was tired from flying, so I gave her my key and she left. Soon after I'm driving home when I get a call from my GF worried about loud banging on the front door. I'm on the phone with her as she answers the door and I hear roommate chewing her out at the top of her lungs. Then roommate calls ME, chews me out, and hangs up before I can get a word in. I'm trying to placate roommate over text when I get a call from my best friend, who is in no way involved in this indent, reprimanding me (albeit in a gentler way than roommate) for being disrespectful and armed with a laundry list of issues roommate has apparently had with me over the past year we've lived together. None of which I have ever heard from roommate. Several issues I have with this. 

1. Why an I hearing about these apparently long-term issues for the first time through my best friend and not my roommate? Best friend should have told roommate to take it up with me personally a long time ago. 

2. One issue was that I didn't ""ask permission"" to have GF over. First off, roommate said early on in the lease that GF is welcome whenever so why is she having issues now? Secondly, I don't feel that I should have to ""ask permission"" to have my partner that she has known for two years over in an apartment that I pay for, especially when 95% of the time they don't even encounter each other.  She has never asked permission for any of the handful of random men she has had over, and I really don't care because it's her room, her life. 

3. I'm 99% sure that this wouldn't have blown up like it did if my GF is someone they actually liked, and I feel like this whole thing was blown out of proportion.

1201,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago I was best friends with a girl I’ll call Tiffany. Tiffany had a crush on a friend of a friend of hers, Josh, and they would flirt on and off until he revealed to her that he had a girlfriend, who lived with him and had been together for three years. Despite this, I would still see Tiffany flirting with Josh on Snapchat and whenever we’d go out to bars they’d be close and dance up on each other. When Tiffany revealed her and Josh had been sleeping together, I told her how I felt about cheating, and while I was still her friend I don’t want to hear about them sleeping around and I don’t want to be around them while they’re flirty and eye-fucking each other. On the side, Tiffany was also having sex with another man who revealed he had a girlfriend and remained unbothered. 

Eventually Tiffany and I had a falling out because I was always outspoken against her affair and she wanted ‘less judgmental friends’. Even before this happened I tried to reach out to Josh’s girlfriend anonymously but Josh had his social medias on lock and key (probably for this reason alone) and I have no idea what her name is or anything about her. 

I’m a bartender and last night, guess who comes up to my bar? I know it’s Josh because of the tattoo on his arm. His girlfriend wanted a drink but he seemed hesitant to acknowledge he knew me until I called him out by name. His girlfriend asked how I knew him and explained I was a friend of his friend Tiffany. I then kept asking him things like, “How is Tiffany? I know you two spent so much time together!” I forgot the others, but I made it a point to mention Tiffany’s name pointedly as much as I could while Josh just tried to shrug them off and give pretty noncommittal answers. Also, unsurprisingly, didn’t tip, but whatever. 

That night Tiffany texts me and basically tells me I’m a bitch for trying to embarrass Josh like that, and apparently he’s mad at Tiffany because he hadn’t realized she told anyone about them, and his girlfriend afterwards asked who Tiffany was and why they hadn’t met if they hung out as often as I said they did. I only told Tiffany they’re lucky I didn’t tell the girlfriend right then and there and then blocked the number. I have a couple friends who said they would do the same and another couple of friends say I meddled a little too much.

My wife agreed we would come, but we are both strict vegans. My friend’s wife assured my wife that the restaurant had vegan options so I trusted them and didn’t think much about it as I was busy at work. 

Two hours prior to the dinner I asked my wife which restaurant we were going to so I could plan directions and parking. She didn’t know, so she texted my friend’s wife, and we got the answer, which I became suspicious of because it had the word “Steakhouse” in the name of the restaurant. I looked it up, and I found out it was an all-you-can-eat steakhouse with no vegan options, but with a complimentary salad bar.

I messaged my friend if he knew the price difference between the salad bar and full-menu, and didn’t seem to care as he said, “I don’t think you can just get the appetizer bar.”

I then called the restaurant to inquire, and I was told they have a fixed $60 entry fee + a 20% gratuity. I asked if I could pay less since I would only be using the salad bar, and the hostess rudely told me it’s the same price for everyone regardless what you order. I did the math (inc. tax) and I would be paying close to $200 for two scrap salads for me and wife, and that’s a lot of money for me.

I was kind of mad because my friend didn’t seem to care that I’d have to pay the full price for just the salad, but also didn’t want to offend him because it was his birthday, and I have known him for a long time. So I messaged my friend and told him I would not be coming because I felt uncomfortable paying $200 for two scrap salads, but I would make it to him by taking him and his wife out for dinner the following weekend on my expense, and to the Joker movie afterwards. I know it was irresponsible for me not to check the restaurant beforehand, but his wife assured my wife that there would be vegan options. I was so busy at work I trusted them on their word.

My friend never even responded back to my message, so my wife messaged his wife that we wouldn’t be coming and we were very sorry and would make it up to them the following weekend. She never responded to my wife either. The next day his wife rudely messaged my wife saying how terrible I was for not coming. It’s now been more than a month since then, and I haven’t heard from him. My parents spoke to him, and he’s still extremely mad at me, claiming his 30th birthday was very important and he wanted me there. My parents think I was wrong for cancelling last minute and I should apologize to him. However I feel I didn’t do anything wrong and I feel he’s being very unreasonable.

So the order is shipped and gets sent to me and after a couple weeks i get notified that its been delivered only it hasn't. I was in all day the day of the delivery and there was nothing, there was no card to tell me where it is and it wasn't with any of my neighbours. I contacted amazon to ask them if they can track it further and they tell me to wait a bit longer before they'll do anything so i do; i wait another week and a half with nothing to show and then contact them back expecting them to tell me where it was but instead they just give me a full refund.

a week or so later i get a knock on my door and it's someone from a totally different street, with a slightly similar number to mine, not exactly the same but apparently close enough and they have my parcel. Apparently they assumed I would collect it but of course I didn't know where it was and they eventually got sick of waiting and decided to bring it over.

Because we needed someone quickly, We ended up with a guy who seemed nice enough but wasn't quite a perfect match in age and lifestyle, A 20 year-old student from the local university, James.
When my roommate David interviewed James, He was very eager to move in and offered no objections to the price we'd stated.

Cut to James moving in and the first months rent and bills, James refuses to pay his portion of the council tax since ""he's exempt""
It gets slightly complicated here, Because while full time students technically don't have to pay council tax, It's charged per household, Not per person.
If James had moved in with 3 other students, The house would owe 0 council tax.
If James moved in with someone living alone, they'd get to keep their 25% single person discount because James doesn't technically ""count"" as an extra person.
But because there's 3 of us, we don't get any kind of discount having James as our 4th housemate, 
The price is exactly the same as it was when original 4th housemate lived here.

To keep the peace until we could work something out, David paid James's portion last month, This month David pulled me and my other roommate Sarah aside and said we were all going to have to pay an extra third of the council tax from now on as James is refusing to pay it.

If he won't pay, I want to let James pay the rest of his bills this month and then tell him he's got until the end of the month to move out (The contract we have with him gives either party 4weeks notice period)  If we use his deposit to pay back David, None of us would end up out of pocket this way and we'd have a full month to find a non student to move in.

My parents are running out of space in the rest of the house and they're always trying to sneak stuff into my room. For a while I'd put it back out of my room into the hall or another room because I knew my parents would lose it at me if I throw things out.

His friend has a girlfriend, and a while back they went homeless. (They ended up stopping going to work because they got too caught up doing drugs and went on a bender which they actually told my husband) after losing their jobs, they also lost their apartment. We let them stay with us for a while, and they were terrible to live with.

They would stay up until the early hours of the morning partying and blasting music, and I couldn't even get them to stop because my husband joined in on the drinking (he was sober until then) and got caught up in the partying too, which led to me not only barely sleeping before work, but constantly having to coax two kids back to sleep. Needless to say, I put my foot down and said they had to leave.


My husband then cosigned them an new apartment. He said he trusted them and it would be fine. Well it wasn't, they couldn't keep a job, we ended up buying them groceries and paying their rent several times until we could no longer afford it, and they got evicted. We had to take out multiple loans to pay for everything and now we're barely scrapping by. 


Anyways, now they're coming to my husband asking him to help them pay for a weekly hotel and for groceries. I told him absolutely not, we've already done way too much and we are not spending another penny on them. He said I can't expect him to turn his back on his friends, and I told him if he values our relationship he will because I cannot deal with them anymore and either they get out of our lives or I'm going to be out of his. I'm tired of them draining our money and energy and pushing my husband into drinking again when he hasn't in nearly 2 years. My husband seems torn right now because he said he doesn't want to lose his family but he doesn't want to turn his back on his brother. I was talking to some close friends and family and they think I'm going too far with it. I just want these people out of our lives. AITA?",306,1621,0.96

Backstory: Me and my ex-wife had a child we ended up splitting up a year and a half ago.\[note we had gotten a Prenuptial agreement done\] I make a lot more than my wife, she has enough to live on comfortably while I can make big purchases

.so me and my wife have an agreement where I have him one-week while she has him another. my house has a PlayStation, a gaming computer and an electric guitar that he can use. her house is pretty bland with nothing much to do. recently my ex has called me crying saying ""he doesn't want to spend time with me."" and to ""stop trying to win him over with toys.""

1220,Not the A-hole,"Hello! Long time viewer here! Throwaway for obvious reasons. Posted on mobile, so sorry for any errors.

I (14M) am in 8th grade, and David (13M) is in my grade. We share a lot of classes, but have never gotten to know each other. I have been doing babysitting for quite a while now. I started doing it for extra money, because the only thing I have to do is watch over some child, and I can do my homework while babysitting. One of my clients, on Sunday, asked me if I could babysit their neighbor’s kid from 6 to 10PM. I didn’t know who I was babysitting, but I agreed to do it.

I got to their home, and to my shock, I found out that I was babysitting David. His parents seemed very strange. (Why would someone need to hire a babysitter for a 13 year old??) They gave me a schedule of everything that David was supposed to do, and I was supposed to enforce it. From 6 to 8, he had to do his homework, from 8 to 9, I had to open up a safe with a combination his parents gave me, give David his phone, and watch over him to make sure he doesn’t do anything inappropriate on it. If he decided to go to the bathroom, I had to ask to take his phone. At 9, I had to take his phone, put it back in the safe, and make him read a book. At 10PM, his parents would return. I had to make sure that he didn’t curse at all, and if he did, I should report it to his parents.

I know that his parents seem very controlling, however I am just a babysitter, so I decided to follow the rules. I already did my homework, so I just read Reddit while he did his homework. He asked multiple times, to give him his phone or the passcode for the safe. I refused to do that. He started complaining that I was his classmate, and that I am an asshole for treating him like a kid.  I reminded him that he wasn’t allowed to curse. I also refrained from cursing. At 8, I opened up the safe, and gave him his phone. I followed him, and told him that I had to look at his screen. He said F*** you. At around 8:45 he tried to run to the bathroom, but I told him to give me his phone. He did that, and got pissed as ever. He spent a while in the bathroom, and at 9 I put his phone back in the safe. He came out like 5 minutes later and yelled at me, because I took his phone. I gave him his book, and reminded him that he had to read it. Finally, his parents returned.

They asked me if he did anything bad, and I said that he said F*** you to me, and called me an asshole. They thanked me, gave me the money, and I left. The next day, he looked extremely pissed at school, and his friend called me a dick, among other things.

Not sure if I am the asshole here. From my point of view, I just followed orders. I don’t hate David, I just want my money. Now, it is your time to decide if I am an asshole, or if I am not an asshole.

Edit: thanks a lot for the great feedback! I saw both points of view. Just to clarify a few things: I didn’t know that I was going to babysit him, until I was in his house and talking to his parents. Also, David is only 2 months younger than me. His original babysitter couldn’t come, so his parents asked the neighbor for a babysitter, who asked me. They asked me that around 30 minutes before I was supposed to start. Also, they paid me a lot more than my usual rate, because I am 14 while their original babysitter was an adult, and they gave me the adult’s rate.

Edit 2: Well it seems to be split halfway. A lot of people are calling the parents assholes, some are calling David the asshole, some are calling me the asshole. Someone even called the neighbor the asshole. A lot have told me to refuse babysitting this kid again. I thank all of you for your advice, because it really helped me get a 3rd person POV about this issue. I will probably apologize to David tomorrow at school.",384,901,0.93
1221,Not the A-hole,"Okay, i know this may sound weird but let me explain, first of all i and all my classmates are from Chile, and if you have seen the news you might know that right now people are fighting for ending social inequality among many others things. (#chiledesperto)

So, I'm in a private school and the school have been in a bubble for the last weeks, ignoring the many riots that are happening all over the city. My classmates are no exception, but i really don't care if they're or they're not with the social movements unless they talk shit about it. 

Anyways, today one of my classmates proposed we started planning our costumes for next year, since is our last year in highschool and is a tradition in my school to have a thematic day, like pyjamas or horror, so one classmate decided to suggest we dress up as ""flaites"". If you are not from Chile you might not know this but ""flaites"" usually is used to refer to someone, in a derogatory way, who doesn't have education and therefore poor and uncultured, someone who doesn't speak well and will probably rob you.

I get that they might be living in a bubble but this for me was to much, i told them that in no way we could dress up like this, they told me it was fine and that it was actually really funny, i still told them that they cannot do that, they told me to take a chill pill instead and told me to stfu. For me, even if they vote for this idea i will speak to the director so he can stop it, this can't be done.

I don't like conflict but i really feel like this is unacceptable, however few people have actually supported me and i feel like most of the class thinks i was just making a fuss over nothing.

So, i'm i the AITA for being against my classmates dressing up as ""flaites""?

(Btw English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes, however i will be taking an English exam (cae) next mont so feel free to correct me if anything is wrong so i can learn from it.)

Edit: after all the comments I don't think i will tell the principal, I didn't wanted to be pushed to do that anyways and I didn't know what to do, I didn't tell anyone I thought about doing it anyways,  but I should've think it more calmly, still, I think the school shouldn't allow it. If the idea becomes true I think I will dress as whatever I want, i don't know if my friends will support me in this since for them their reputation is very important. I hope tomorrow my classmates realised that dressing as flaites is a very bad idea, someone in the comments said they could be harassed in social media if other people know they dressed up as flaite.

1225,No A-holes here,"I married ""Tim"" a few years ago. He's divorced and has two daughters, ""Molly"" and ""Rosie"", who were six and nine when we married. We've been married five years now, so the girls are now eleven and fourteen. I have family out of state and every few months Tim and I, along with the Rosie and Molly and our two year son ""Mark"" make the six hour drive to see them. On our most recent visit we had been stuck in traffic for a while, everyone was hungry and tired, we saw a Denny's on the side of the freeway so we stopped in for a midnight snack. Molly, the eleven year old, is crazy about whole milk. It's all she drinks. She can put away a gallon in two days. I think it's great, and I don't mind buying multiple gallons for when she comes to stay.

When we went to this Denny's she drank nine glasses of whole milk with her pancake platter. Nine glasses. She gulps her milk instead of sipping it. W've had her tested for any sort deficiencies or illnesses that might give reason for why she's main-lining milk but she's a healthy, growing girl and the doctors all say to let her have it. Only downside is that she has to pee every hour but it's a small piece to pay. Denny's charged us a $1.50 for every glass of milk she drank. Nearly eleven dollars in milk! No one's breakfast platter cost that much money.

When we were done we got the kids loaded in the car. While my husband and I were still outside with the doors shut I told him they'd charged us for every glass of milk she drank and that that's just insane and way too much money to spend on drinks. We went home and the next day the girls returned to their mother's house. Later on Tim's ex called him and chewed him out for letting me hurt Molly's feelings because of the milk. Apparently it made Molly feel bad that she had caused us to spend that much money and now she feels guilty and embarrassed.

I had no idea she eve heard us, because, as I said, the doors were all shut. Tim asked his ex how did Molly hear us and apparently Molly's window was rolled down a crack at the top. I feel so bad. I never meant for Molly to hear me, I just wanted my husband to know Denny's had charged us for every single glass of milk and maybe we need to have a discussion with Molly about her habits. Now Molly doesn't want to come over anymore because she told her mom that I told her I buy two gallons of milk just for her. I told her that she'd feel special, so she'd know I support her and want to give her things she likes. Apparently Molly's taking it negatively and thinks she's costing us too much money.

1226,Not the A-hole,"Just reading the title makes it seem obvious but I figured I'd run it by you all.

I'm an American living in Canada. Every generation before me fought in pretty much every war after the turn of the 20th century and my family has a proud military history. I donate to both the Canadian Legion up here, and the VFW down in the states. It's something I've always done every year without question.

Up here in Canada, around this time of year, folks buy plastic poppies and pin them to their coats. Remembrance Day is November 11 and that's when people typically remove them, some keep them on all month. It's a big deal and I understand and respect why. Which brings me to the dilemma I'm having.

I bought a very expensive down-filled coat, Canadian fall and winter is unforgiving. It's got a hydrophobic layer and to my knowledge can't be fixed once penetrated. With this in mind, I don't put a poppy on it. If they were adhesive or magnetic or anything other than a pin, you bet I'd wear one. But I can't reconcile with putting holes in it and damaging it (which sounds like a whiny thing to do considering what the soldiers went through). I make OK money, but this coat was an investment I hope to keep for years.

I had an old coat I donated (to the legion) when I bought the new one. The old one, from having poppies stuck into it, would have its synthetic filling poke out of the holes. Not to mention the stitching looks all messed up over the left breast where the poppies went.

I live in a very conservative part of the country and poppies are near-ubiquitous on suits and pea-coats in the corporate community here so I noticeably stand out. My girlfriend thinks I'm being prissy and petty for valuing my coat over showing appreciation for veterans. Since her family fought in many Canadian battles, she thinks I'm being disrespectful to what her family did and choosing to honor only American sacrifice in the war. Some co-workers have alluded to me not caring about Canada's veterans, since my family fought in largely American conflicts like in the Pacific and Vietnam.

I think I'm ok, since I already donate to the cause year-round, but this one period of the year, I can't help but feel like people are judging me.

Both are married with multiple kids each. I’m single and don’t enjoy spending too much time with them because they kind of have their own lives now and it’s very hectic. 

The other problem is that since I am single with no one to look after, I always end up getting treated like hired help. I am the one who has to go to the grocery store 5x because they can’t plan anything or make complete lists of what they need. I also have to do most of the cooking and cleaning up afterwards because “they are busy with their kids or wife/husband”.

My sister got engaged a few weeks ago to a really immature ""frat"" manchild.

Before she made her plans, she texted me asking what I thought of them coming the week I'm due. I told her I thought they should come a week or two after my due date for the following reasons:

1) I am on track to have a natural birth, meaning there's no knowing for sure when the baby will arrive, but women in my family tend to go past our due dates. I think it would be smarter to come later knowing that the baby will be more likely to have been born by then and they will be able to meet the baby before they have to go back home.

2) Knowing people have taken off work and are spending money on a hotel room just waiting for something I can't control makes me uncomfortable.

3) My husband and I will both be working up until I go into labor if possible, so we won't be able to spend much, if any, time with them before the baby is born.

Most of the time, he isn't loud enough to disturb anyone, he just seems like he is talking to himself (he quotes cartoons and movies constantly . . . it's a pretty common behavior for autistic individuals called scripting). However, sometimes he will randomly let out a shout. Both behaviors serve sensory fulfillment purposes. 

I have been working with him on pro-social behavior in public (sitting down for the duration of the meal if we're out to eat, not approaching strangers to touch them, etc). I'm very satisfied with his progress so far, and his birthday is coming up, so I'm considering taking him out to lunch at one of his favorite restaurants to celebrate.

However, I do have some reservations, namely about being considerate of others. He has markedly improved in how he deals with strangers, but we have gotten dirty looks in public before over noises he's made. It's his right to be out in the community, but people at the restaurant would also be entitled to eat in peace. Removing him from the restaurant like you would a noisy toddler would not really work because it would break the trust I've spent a long time building with him; he would see it as me promising a meal at his favorite restaurant, only to renege on my promise. This trust is the key to working with him and making progress. 

I have considered other options like getting him takeout from this place and having him eat at home or at the park or something, but I feel like this defeats the purpose of him learning how to be out and about in society.

I used to be a nurse and I’ve seen much much worse than some blood. But this is what I said:

“I don’t find periods gross and you know that. But I don’t think it’s unreasonable for someone to say that they find periods gross. When I say that, I’m not talking about the actual act of having the period. I think everyone understands that it’s perfectly natural and nobody cares about actually having a period, you know?

I am hosting our family’s Thanksgiving dinner this year. My middle sister and I exchange hosting duties for Christmas and Thanksgiving each year as our places are big enough to hold our large families. We’ve done this for years and it’s usually a great time. Oldest sister has a history of drama, overt and subtle mean comments (free for everyone!), and has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and refuses to entertain the possibility of even being a decent human being for a few hours without having the spotlight on her. I have been extremely very low contact with her. At anyone else’s party, I don’t purposefully interact but am civil. I don’t invite her to my dealings and she doesn’t invite me to hers. We don’t talk on the phone and I have her blocked on social media. 

Last year’s family Christmas party I decided I didn’t want to invite oldest sister. I spoke with her four adult children (only two of which still speak with her) and gently let them know beforehand. I then spoke with our dad to also give him a heads-up and everyone understood. Dad even said it was a shame but oldest sister had brought this on herself by her toxic and ongoing behavior over the years. Middle sister vacillates between agreeing and feeling guilty. Middle sister then goes behind my back, speaks to everyone that was previously in agreement and basically gets people in an uproar about how I’m being too harsh. I find out one week before the party last year and end up letting oldest sister come. I had to handle oldest sister’s outbursts and snarky comments while middle sister kept leaving the room. It was stressful and I truly didn’t want another party where I felt trapped in having people over, not of my choosing.

I’ve been very clear about how unhappy I was with middle sister – how as she was not hosting, she should not be determining the guest list, nor should she instigate behind my back. I’ve been adamant all year about this year’s Thanksgiving party that I am not inviting oldest sister. It’s been very peaceful with oldest sister not being at other family parties and no one ends up crying or leaving early. Middle sister can invite whomever she wants to the Christmas party as she is the host. 

I just received a text this morning from middle sister telling me I’m in the wrong (again) and need to put aside personal feelings for family functions. That I’m forcing oldest sister’s kids to choose between their mom and our family party.

This is a pretty powerful effect but I notice that I have a copy of the same card in my hand which reads 't the start of your turn draw three cards instead of 1.

For the rest of the game almost every card she plays she doesn't read in full, basically reading all the positive effects but not the negatives. I end up having to read every card she plays because I simply didn't trust what she said now and the negative effects have a big impact on the game 

After they left my wife commented how I was bit strict tonight and that I needed to chill when it came to being stirct in the rules. I usually am but I just saw it as blatantly cheating.

1244,Asshole,"
I was kind of awkward back in high school. I was chubby, with long emo style hair, quiet, talked funny and didn’t have too many friends. I was a kind of a target for bullies, both guys and girls. One of the girls, let’s call her J was kind of mean to me in a weird kind of way. She would pick on on me when others were around and when it was just us 2 (which was often because we both got to school early) she would kind of make fun of me in a condescending way while pretending to be nice. I can’t really explain it but I could always tell she was mocking me. The most embarrassing thing she ever did to me was walk up to me and say “if you let me touch your tits I’ll let you touch mine” in front of a bunch of people. Being awkward of course I put my head down and said no. Everyone laughed. I’ve never forgotten that moment.

Anyways that was all over a decade ago. Nowadays I’m more confident and happy, I’ve lost weight, I look good and feel good. I have a good job and hobbies that make me happy and feel fulfilled. I am successful and close to having my dream career. I have gotten on Instagram recently, and been posting about my life. I have been getting a lot of old classmates following me. One of which was J. She’s still good looking, she has a kid and is a single mother. She commented on one of my pictures, we chatted and that eventually led to DMing. I won’t bore you with details but a couple of weeks later we hung out, and I slept with her. The entire time we talked though I couldn’t stop remembering how she teased me in high school and how I went home and cried. 

we went out a few more times and I slept with her a few more times. I don’t know why but I started feeling more and more jaded each time I saw her. One night we were hanging out and I had this rage building in me, even though she had already apologized. That night we were at a bar watching a game and I excused myself to the bathroom but just left. She called me but I ignored her. I was already a bit drunk but I got home and drank a lot of tequila and I felt like I had to get it off my chest, I made a post on Instagram, saying something to the effect of “you laughed at me in high school, who’s laughing now?! Hit it and quit it” then I tagged her. 

She responded with “wtf” then blocked me, a few other people we went to school with also unfollowed me. A bunch of other people all commented asking me what happened and what was wrong with me. Then one comment really hit me, someone commented saying “I don’t know the story, but I don’t know that you’re no where near as happy as your posts suggest, I feel sorry for you”

After that I deleted my entire account and lost all my likes and followers but I felt embarrassed. Was I an asshole here? I felt anger every time we had fun together because all I could think of was teenage me hurting because of her. I don’t know what to do. I’ve thought of calling her and seeing if I could apologize see if I could take her out to make up for it. Idk you guys tell me.",614,1914,0.88
1245,Not the A-hole,"This summer I let two friends who were made homeless by their parents (they are both mid twenties like me) move into the 3 bed house I rented after my last housemate moved. They continued to turn it into a party house, lose their jobs and spend all their money on drugs.

I was sick of paying for them and their dog to live and sick of my home being full of drugged up strangers. I moved into my friends house and let them keep the house in my name with my deposit with the landlords permission so they weren't homeless. 

All I asked was them to pay the money they owed me after I was lending them money constantly. I ended up in a motorbike accident a week after moving and am unable to work. I am also a full time student. My savings were blown moving and looking after them and being unable to work has left me a bit broke.

For the past few months every week they have given me more excuses and not paid me a penny, but have been able to buy drugs and alcohol and don't care a bit that I'm struggling. My parents have been helping me but they don't have a lot of money. 

I want to take the furniture I left them (sofas TV fridge freezer washing machine ect) and tell them I am selling them. I don't think I will sell them but I don't think they deserve my things any more. They will go into storage in my parents garage most likely. They have just started new jobs and said it will be weeks before they give me any money.

It's just before Christmas and I feel bad leaving them with nothing but I feel like I am being taken advantage of here. WIBTA for taking the furniture away from them?

1246,Not the A-hole,"So, here's the story. 

To celebrate our good friend getting married the best man planned out the bachelor party and gave several months notice for everyone with the time/place. I could only make it for one night of the weekend activities. So, I told the group that I'll just grab a room on my own and check out Saturday morning. Everyone was fine with that via the group chat. 

There would be about 10 guys going in total and their plan was to split 2 hotel rooms to accommodate everyone. Even before telling them that I would just get my own room I told them I wasn't down for that. Like I'm not 19 anymore and we all have decent jobs I'm not piling into a room full of dudes when I don't have to. These weren't suites. They were basic double queen rooms.

So, the weekend comes(last weekend). We spend all day Friday doing the bachelor party thing. And, this group of guys *really* knows how to party. Another side note sometimes they can get belligerently drunk but as we've gotten older it's not as bad as it used to be. We start drinking at 10am and do so many events from escape rooms, axe throwing, strip clubs, just a full day of us having a blast.

3am rolls around and we are making our way back to the hotel. And, two of the guys are like stupid drunk and end up throwing up on the walk back. We are basically carrying them to the room at this point. 

We get them back to their two rooms and there's no space at all then a couple of my friends were like, ""let us crash with you.""

And, I'm like, ""no thanks I only have a king and like I booked a room to myself so I could space.""

Then, they started talking about how I could at least let the bachelor bunk with me so he didn't have to deal with the guys vomiting and packed in the room. And, I stand my ground and leave.

Next morning I wake up to texts from 3 of the guys saying I'm selfish and I'm such an asshole for not opening up my room. I've been getting the cold shoulder from everyone since Saturday morning but I told them beforehand that I wanted my own room so I don't think I'm wrong here. According to the text both rooms were complete disasters. Someone clogged the toilet in one room and they had to stop the bachelor from trying to leave to go back out multiple times. The other had two loud snorers and someone didn't make it to the bathroom ended up throwing up on the carpet. So, they all had to deal with just a drunken mess of consequences while I got to relax solo not dealing with it.

1248,Not the A-hole,"So, this sounds kinda confusing. I'm 15, and have only been driving for 4 months. Now to be fair, I'm pretty good, I have 27 hours driving, but nonetheless, it is still a very stressful endeavor, and I only have my permit. 

Anyways, I am currently going to trauma therapy, due to a very hard time in my past that left me with PTSD. Needless to say, it is VERY exhausting, and my parents know this. I go home a lot and my brain and feeling is numb, of course it gets better the next day, but it is just so taxing, the stuff that I'm doing. 

My parents always go to the bar while I'm at my appointment, which I'm fine with, as long as they can drive me home, and we can leave right after my appointment.

This time however, after a particularly difficult session, I went into the bar to tell them I was ready to go. My mom then informed me that they were both too drunk to drive, so I had to drive. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but at that time, I just wanted to cry. I had to drive though, there was nothing I could do. I ignored them on the way back.

Then, when they asked me why I was being so mean, I explained *calmly and politely* that I felt betrayed, as they knew I was going to feel terrible and sick and discusting after my appointment, and yet they still got drunk, and put me in a situation in which I was not comfortable. 

My dad was in the Marine corps and did the therapy I'm doing as well a coue years back because of his PTSD, and he began to guilt trip me by saying things like, ""I got blown up, and you know what I did? I drove home. It was more taxing for me than you, it isn't that hard."" Which hurt me a lot. I ended up going up into my room to try to calm down as best I could, but it was VERY difficult.

So, a huge stroke of bad luck graced upon her. We had another equally qualified candidate that hasn't had a relationship with me, so he did get the upper hand. 
 
We did date for 2 years, and it ended with her breaking up with me. I'm over it, since I am getting married in a couple months.

1250,Not the A-hole,"SAHM = Stay At Home Mum

I work from home and have a 3 y/o son. My schedule has always allowed me to look after our son and take him to local groups for new parents and babies, and through those I wound up with a group of friends, all parents of similar ages to me with kids similar ages to my son.

We're all stay-at-homes (some work, others don't) and our kids get on great. At some point we went from formal groups to just meeting at each other's houses or the playground so the kids can play and we can interact with other adults. Some of the parents are men, and call themselves ""stay at home dads"", but there's about 2 men and 6 women, so even they refer to it as ""SAHMs club"".

My husband has done a 9-5 every day of the week until last month, when he switched to a new job. This new job is at a small company owned by his buddy with a far more flexible schedule, better pay and opportunity to work from home. He did this because he's realised that he missed out on a lot these last few years.

His last job required him to always be in the office, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week (plus commute) which meant that he wound up missing out on a lot of stuff. First words, first steps, ect. I did film them and send it to him, but it's not the same.

With the new job, if he doesn't have anything that requires he go into the office, he asks if he can work from home, which the friend usually agrees to, but there are still days where he has to go in. I am still working from home every day of the week.

It was my turn to host the SAHM club last week and my husband was here. We explained the new schedule and my friends congratulated him on his new job, commended him for wanting to spend more time with our son, and one of the other dads referred to him as a ""fellow stay at home dad"". He got kind of defensive, saying ""no, I actually work"", and the other dad sensed something was up, apologised and changed the subject. They still talked with him after that but it was a little tense.

Later I brought it up and my husband told me he thought of ""stay at home"" as being derogatory, and he's never thought of me as a ""stay at home"" because I work. I explained that about half the club still works, some from home, others part time, and it wasn't a bad thing to be a stay-at-home. He just said he wasn't really into being called that, which I said was fair enough and that was the end of it.

However, after that I was a little cautious about him being around the club, just because he got defensive and in our conversation he indicated that he didn't have a great opinion of the ones who were actually full time stay at home parents.

My husband asked about plans for tomorrow and I said I wasn't sure, which was true, and then I remembered that the SAHM group is going to the local pool. They have a kiddie pool that's about a foot deep with toys/slides/stuff like that. My husband isn't sure if he'll be in the office or not.

1252,Not the A-hole,"Brief backstory: been together for 5 & a half years with my Fiance', Maddie. We're both 25. We've been living together for a full 4 years now. We rarely fight and have a really good system for housework, chores, errands etc that feels fair to both of us. One constant (very small) strain is that Maddie always seems to half-complete something, resulting in me having to finish it for her later. Really minor stuff. Some examples to give context:


* Putting empty bottles back in the medicine cabinet instead of throwing them away
* Leaving wrappers / tissues laying around the house i.e. on her nightstand, dresser instead of throwing them away
* When doing the dishes she'll sometimes leave big items ""to soak"" instead of just cleaning them properly. Last weekend she left a crockpot to soak for 3 days when I was away - I had to clean it when I got back.


Little things like that. She knows it bothers me and she's actively working on improving, which is nice (yay communication). Onto the story itself: Thursday last week I was getting ready to leave for the weekend and wouldn't be home until Saturday. She took the garbage out, however instead of taking it to the back shed she just set it on the back deck, which we both know not to do as raccoons will get into it. I nicely asked her to take it to the shed and she said she would.

I get home mid-afternoon Saturday and there's now two bags of garbage on the back deck. Luckily no animals got into them yet. I kindly asked again that she take them to the back shed and let her know if any animals get into them I am **not** helping to clean it up. She agreed. I then had to leave again until Sunday afternoon when I returned home. The backyard was covered in garbage and I let her know. She asked for help cleaning it up and I refused. It took her at least half an hour of picking up dirty, wet garbage (it had rained). She said she understands why I did it, but she feels that I was being cruel and unnecessarily mean to prove a point.

1257,No A-holes here,"I have two sisters, we are all in our early 20s. 

Years back our parents went through a messy divorce when my mother was pregnant with my youngest sister. The judge gave custody to our mother at first, who in my opinion, is not fit to be a mother. Although she was getting a lot of money from our dad, who saw us on weekends, she was arrested shoplifting and neglected us most in the time that we were with her. When my sister was born she neglected her too until she developed serious health issues. It took years for our dad to get custody of us, and even longer to get custody of my youngest sister who ended up at our doctor's office being malnourished and filthy under our mother's ""care"". She was able to get healthy again, but she has a developmental disorder and schizophrenia that everyone is sure came from the neglect.

Afterwards, we would see our mother every week at a supervised visitation center until  she disappeared one day when I was around 12. Shortly before this my dad confided in me he was still paying her alimony even though he didn't have to anymore since the court order expired, but I told him not to do it anymore – I am pretty sure she stopped showing up because of this. In fact, her landlord called my dad because she left all the photographs she had of us there when she moved out and the landlord couldn't bear to throw them away.

None of us had heard from my mother since then. But after that, my grandmother and relatives started telling us the truth about her and what she did. My dad never spoke a bad word about her, but we slowly learned the full story from them anyway and we began to hate her. My younger sister knows only parts of the story because my dad forbid us from telling her about the neglect.

Which brings me to today. I have found out my mother is trying to get back in contact with us. I also heard she only asked about me and my older sister because we are both in lucrative fields, but not my younger one. Neither of us want to have anything to do with my mother, but my younger sister does - she asked me to help her get in contact with her because she thinks she can change her and finally have a mother-daughter relationship.

My younger sister functions at the level of a preteen when she is already in her 20s, she is trusting, doesn't really understand social cues and she is unable to hold a job so she is pretty isolated. I don't really trust her judgement and I don't want my manipulative mother to use that to worm her way back into our lives. My sister also doesn't know why she is this way although she is aware she isn't normal and is constantly frustrated she can't operate to the level of her peers. Even though she asked me to help.... I just can't. I want to lie to her and tell her our mom doesn't want to talk to us. I don't want to tell her what our mom did because she is sensitive and I know it would hurt her. But on the other hand, I feel like this isn't really a choice I can make for her and she will resent me for it.

I work at a factory and I do one of the hardest jobs there. Dropping. It's when you grab something twist your upper body and put them in a slot. It goes very fast. So imagine standing in one spot on a concrete floor, spending 4 hours or more twisting your spine non stop.

Both of us come from humble families and after some years of struggling, we have finally landed decent jobs. We both help our families with some things like paying health insurance and buying groceries and food. The thing is that since our income grew, he feels like its his responsibility to maintain his family (mom, dad, sister, brother and nephew) I'm ok with helping them since we both work and we can do it, but he has passed from helping with internet, water and electricity bills and buying groceries to constantly 'lend out' money each month. I have been trying to tell him that he should let them know that we are not rich and that we help with some small things but it's not our duty to provide for them, but each time I bring that up he changes his mood. The drop that spilled the glass was last week, when his uncle called him asking for money, I understand he is in a difficult situation but he has a son who spends all day smoking weed and doing nothing and he doesn't demand anything from him, but then when he needs money then he basically calls my boyfriend.

Had a great time going round the course, there was two people behind us that appeared to be on a first date and a small family in front (a mum, dad and a 4 or 5 year old girl) 

So it was slow moving because the little girl took her time, we didn’t mind waiting as we were just having a good time. The girl from the couple behind us kept huffing loudly, under the breath complaints about how slow it was moving etc every time she had to wait. We let her go I front of us, and the family did as well so they didn’t have to wait.

Well as she walked past I let out a silent fart, not realising it would be rank. The girl walked straight through it and spread the smell, everyone could smell it - my brother swears he could taste it. It was toxic. 

Now the part where I may have been a dick, the little girl goes “ewwww ” then points to the woman who just walked past from the couple and goes “mummy I think she filled her nappy” and the guy from the couple stepped back to look down at her arse. 

That was it, we were laughing, the family was laughing, I was crying. The girl was trying defend herself saying it wasn’t her, her boyfriend was saying “everyone does it! You shouldn’t be ashamed” and the girl was denying it before storming out.

1265,Asshole,"Wife and I have always been on the fence regarding children but now that we are both in our mid-30s, with established careers and all, we are slowly swinging towards the ""yes"" camp.

I would very much like biological children. My wife, on the other hand, is strongly against this: she says it's either adoption or no children at all. It's not an ultimatum, she just says she doesn't want to go through pregnancy (I'll elaborate on her reasons below) and if she had, she would rather we not have any kids. For me, it's the same thing: I either want children that are ""our own"" (not that an adopted kid would be anyone else's) and would rather not have kids, if we had to adopt.

My POV: I want them to look like me and my wife, I want them to share our genes and be our ""legacy"" in a sense. We both have some shitty genes, but nothing out of the ordinary (I've got bad teeth and they run in the family and my wife's entire family has some sort of near-sightedness - from 0.5 to around 4.5 diopter). She's 32 so age is not a problem (her mom had her at 36, her grandmother had her mom at 34, they're late bloomers).

Wife's POV: She has tokophobia (doesn't like the thought of pregnancy), is scared pregnancy will ruin her body (her mom had terrible vomitting and was on bed rest since 1st trimester), and has environmental reasons (over-population, taking an abandoned kid in, etc.

I'm aware her reasons sound far more ""morally just"" than mine. But I don't think she's taking into account complications of adoption, e.g. if we go for open adoption, we have to essentially maintain contact with the parent/other family, what about half-siblings, adoption can be expensive and time-consuming, we might have to financially support a lot of new mothers only for them to bond with and decide to keep the baby\*, etc.

\*On this note, my wife actually wants to adopt a toddler/a young child. She is worried a baby would have a devastating effect on our relationship and an older childer may make for an easier transition, given that none of us would be a SAHP (we will do flexible work arrangements with half-days, 1 day from home, babysitting, etc).

She says I'm TA because in the end, it's her body that will need to be sacrificed (pregnancy, breast-feeding, potential complications) and her career that would be on the line (as a baby, especially a biological one, would require much more investment from both of us and naturally, as the mother, she would be expected to do those sacrifices). I think I'm NTA because, for me, biology is the dealbreaker - I want a mini ""us"", and yes, it's selfish, but I think I will connect better with someone who shares my genes and the genes of my best friend (my wife in case there's any doubt).

P.S. I know surrogacy is the logical solution here, but unfortunately, we don't have the funds for a surrogate, but most importantly, where we live this isn't really done (so it will have to be done illegally, which is scary, dangerous and not something we are willing to risk).",212,88,0.73

His best friend, let's call him Tyler works there as well. 

My dad and Tyler have been best friends for 14 years now. 
I got adopted recently. 

Tyler has been rude to me since day 1 of meeting him. 
I'm hard of hearing and he got frustrated that I couldn't hear him on a job site (Due to heavy machinery)  so he yelled at me in front of 30+ people and demanded I sit in the truck since I ""can't bother to listen"". 
I tried explaining to him that I'm hard of hearing and he laughed in my face. 

I felt so emberassed and this incident still gives me nightnares to this day. 

For months now I feel uncomfortable anytime Tyler is around. 

Tyler will insult me and talk poorly in front of my managers about me despite being asked to stop. 
Tyler also told the management my dad is stupid for adopting me. 

My adoptive dad told me that him and Tyler are best friends and that will never change regardless of how he treats me or what he has to say. 

I feel betrayed and frustrated. 

Am I the asshole for telling my dad to stop talking about Tyler to me and  me avoiding Tyler?

1269,Not the A-hole,"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it’s her dream to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we’ve been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I’m an expat and she’s a local), etc etc 

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I’ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we’ve been together, she’s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she’d need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it’s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She’s called me TA, that I’m trying to control her money, I’m trying to humiliate her, make her feel “small” and it’s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

1270,Not the A-hole,"—-full context here—-

My dad called me a few hours ago asking me if I can be a co-borrower for his loan just because he has to pay immediately my aunt for shouldering the contribution for the hospitalisation of my grandpa. 

I don’t have anything wrong against him or grandpa. But the problem is I cannot afford to repay the costs if ever dad fails to repay the loans, especially on time. I do have some financial obligations at the moment and I just moved to a new job after being laid off. I’m not in a financial state to cover for my dad if ever he fails to pay. 

I’m also sceptical of my dad considering he sometimes ends up paying late for my brother’s college tuition. (In our country this is the norm— parents pay tuition of their kids till college) I also doubted the legitimacy of the loaning agent — although upon searching it does seem legitimate. I also don’t trust my dad that much in a financial sense because my brother had to shoulder the cost of my (part of the curriculum) college educational trips. 

He’s adamant he will repay it on time and he thinks I don’t trust him that he’ll repay the loan and I ask too many questions. 

I feel guilty because I know he’s borrowing money just to make sure he can pay aunt for shouldering the hospital costs for grandpa. We do want grandpa to recover and get better. He cannot rely on my brother as he’s a full time student. But I can’t be a co-borrower considering my financial state and my doubts towards him repaying the debt on time. 

Was I right in refusing to be a coborrower for my dad’s loan? Or am I an asshole for being insistent on not being the coborrower even if my dad thinks I’m the only one who can do it for him?",36,79,0.9

About six months ago, she found a new boyfriend. I've only seen her once since. Out of the blue, she was ""too busy"" to hang out. Our weekly chats over coffee stopped. I invited her to hang out with me at an event we both like but she told me that she was too busy that week...before going to the same event that same week with her boyfriend (thanks Instagram). I tried making new plans with her several times (carefully and weeks apart as to not annoy her) but she'd always say she already set plans with her boyfriend. She only WhatsApp me to share vacation and holiday pictures. She rarely replies to my messages.

I was there for her when she broke up with her cheating ex. I'd make her chicken noodle soup when she was sick and she'd bake me cookies in the holidays. We'd talk about our individual dreams and goals and support each other as best friends do.

1278,Asshole,"My MIL has asked, on several occasions, for me to give her some of my daughter’s hair. I keep avoiding answering because she’s never had a haircut and therefore I don’t have any to give. Her asking for my daughter’s hair bothers me for two reasons. 

Firstly I feel like she is wading into a mother’s territory. I know it’s a visceral reaction. Saving your child’s hair is something a mother does (I have saved some of my daughter’s hair for her baby book).  That’s mine. That’s my ritual. Would my MIL having some of my kids’ hair therefore devalue the lock that’s in her baby book? Maybe I feel that way a little, but I am more upset that she is crossing a boundary and inserting herself into something that was supposed to be between me and my child.

Secondly, she has not asked for a lock of my son’s hair. Nor does she have hair from her other two grandchildren. This shows favoritism that I cannot abide. 

AITA? My husband says yes, my mother says no.

EDIT: I want to clarify a few things. I have cut and kept a small amount of hair that she needed trimmed away from her eyes. But she has never had an all-over, formal haircut. In the past when MIL has brought this up I have said that I kept some for her baby and she replied that she just wanted to make sure that somebody kept some of it. This time she said she wanted some to keep in a locket. However, each time she has asked she’s been kind of sheepish about it as if she knew she was asking something that wouldn’t willing be offered up. There have been a few boundary issues before but on the whole I have a great relationship with my MIL. I don’t like to disappoint people but I feel very strongly on this issue.

1279,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my brother (M23) is in a gymnastics club. They do an annual show and my brother is the host/announcer of the whole thing. 

He's basically on-stage between every divisions performance, making jokes and small theatrical numbers while the crew is preparing the stage for the next divisions performance.

Last year my brother couldn't find anyone in the club willing to photograph the show, so he asked me (M 21) if I'd be willing to do it, as I am a hobby photographer with rather professional equipment. I agreed, and photographed the whole thing and delivered a few dozen pics to use for their website and what not. My mother then asked if she could have some of the pics to design a photobook for my brother as a christmas gift. I was happy to help and my brother loved the gift.

Ok so fast forward to this year.

The preparations for the show are almost done as the show is set in two weeks. As my brother hasn't asked me to be the photographer again yet, I assumed he found someone from the club that would do it. But now two weeks before the event he asked me anyway. I was a little taken confused as to why hed ask me just two weeks in advance, which seemed a little on short notice. So I asked him how come they didnt have a photographer lined up yet, and how come he didnt ask me earlier.

He then tells me that they in fact have a photographer but he wants me to take photos too, so he could get a photobook again.

So I told him that:

1. I dont want to photograph alongside another photographer
2. He can get a photobook made from their photos too
3. I felt like he takes me for granted, just because he knows I'm not going-out much and ""I wouldnt have anything better to do anyways""

She's also never really wanted to integrate with our family, I think she's been round for dinner twice in the year and a half since they got married and doesn't come to any family events (not even my uncle funeral because she'd 'only met him a couple of times').

For my birthday we always go to this really nice restaurant and she always makes a fuss over not liking the food (despite ordering the exact meals at other restaurants - I think she just doesn't like it because its my choice). It's normally about £35-40 for a main but there's a deal on in January so it's £30 for 3 courses on the set menu but she always insists on ordering from the full menu (despite liking everything on the set menu and expecting my dad to pay).

Last year she made me change my plans to suit her. My office has a beer fridge on a Friday so I was going to stay for one and meet then at 6, instead she made me ask work to leave early to meet her at half 5 and then didn't turn up till 6. The whole time she acted as usual and made the whole night about her and then didn't sing happy birthday or anything. I'm not that fussed about birthday's but she really is (I got moaned at for not saying happy birthday till 12.30 on hers) so I expected her to want to celebrate.

1282,Not the A-hole,"A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.

My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it’s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

There is no way to prove there wasn’t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn’t put liquor in that shot.

I honestly don’t and didn’t care enough to argue with her about it. I’m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don’t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I’m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

I then let my anger overtake me and I said “if you want to find a job where you don’t have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You’re all capable people that don’t deserve a psycho watching over you when you’ve put good time into a work place.” I basically contradicted myself. 

I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should’ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the “mix things together to look like booze so people don’t feel rejected when they buy you shots trick”. She thinks it’s crazy the new manager won’t trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiancé, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. 

Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don’t want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up...",1337,19563,0.91
1283,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, on mobile, TLDR at bottom. 

I work security at a pretty big retail store. I am in charge of a specific area because it is high shortage and a constant target. Because of this, I get along very well with the retail associates in that area and converse every once in awhile. 

We were all allowed to dress up for Halloween so I asked what everyone else would be dressing as. This one associate joked that I should dress up as an ICE Agent. Sometimes other coworkers get a little too political in the break room when the news is on, so he and I both know this would be extremely controversial. I was not offended by the joke but I shrugged and said I had no intention of dressing up as such. I already had my costume anyways.

A few days after the same associate jokes about possibly spreading a rumor that I am an undercover ICE Agent planning a massive raid as a social experiment. He wanted to see what could possibly happen and who would freak out. This was where it concerned me because security in this store works very well with all associates and we all are supposed to get along and work together. Without their help, we wouldn’t catch half the shoplifters and credit card frauds that we do, so we like being friendly and professional with them. I knew if such a rumor spread out it could completely damage my reputation, my teams reputation, and even the stores reputation. 

On both these jokes I shrugged it off but I really reflected about it over the weekend on how potentially harmful it could be. I also don’t know if this associate is making these kinds of jokes to other coworkers and it makes them feel uncomfortable too. One coworker says his humor is ‘dark’ and that it’s simply just his personality. 

Part of my job is reporting everything I see and hear that goes against company policy so my manager told me to write a statement about this certain associate. There were other issues added (jokes about robbing the store with a fake gun or confusing customers who didn’t speak English by speaking nonsense into their translators) and I sent an email to basically all the other managers and higher ups.

I don’t know if this calls for him to be fired, but I know that he will definitely be counseled for this. 

Does it make me an asshole to report him to my superiors? I feel like I’m making too great a deal about this because I’m not greatly offended and others say it’s just his sense of humor.

TLDR: Associate I work with makes weird jokes that others might see as extremely offensive. Am I being an asshole for ‘snitching’ on his sense of humor? Am I the asshole for not being offended at first and only now speaking about it to his boss?",32,55,0.9

I was waiting for a class with a college friend T. who's gay. He was telling me and another classmate there about some guy he's seeing, an unemployed streamer who lives with his aunt. At 27yo.

So I said, you better not want anything serious from that dude because you're not getting it. T. got mad because apparently he really likes the guy. We all quarreled about something like, at what age is it acceptable to still live with family/relatives, then T. called us ignorant, but that he can't blame us because gay relationships work a different way than straight ones.

To be honest, initially I thought he only said that because me and the other classmate were disagreeing with him on the previous thing, so I laughed and asked, oh really how come? T. basically rolled his eyes and started ranting about how, for example, you grow up later because you spend your teen years in the closet and become a mental case, then also how the dating pool is tiny and you can't pick-and-choose, so he told us how he was desperate and therefore hooked up with 20 and 30-something guys back when he was 16, since no one else was out.

I told T. that's kind of fucked up, gay or straight doesn't matter, even the fact that 16 is the age of consent doesn't when it comes to the creep factor. He was really mad at this point though and said, I shouldn't have even talked to straights about this, of course you won't get it. Then the class started and we didn't talk about this anymore.

Okay but AITA for what I told T., essentially that it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight, same standards apply in dating? Was I acting ignorant? Not that I know anything about gay dating, it's just common instinct, but I might be ignorant or biased or something.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) are both from LA. We met there and have been dating for just over half a year now. I moved to Toronto, across the continent in Canada, for school just a short while ago.

My boyfriend has this idea that him visiting me is almost like a favour to me. He says that we should split the cost of flights 50/50 when we fly across the continent to see each other, but so far the only thing planned is him coming to see me twice this month.

I am a broke graduate student and he is significantly more well-off than I am. I have expressed before that I was feeling lonely, but I never specifically requested that he come to see me.

Today we had an argument because I said that I didn't want to pay for half his flights (800 USD, half = 400). He told me that was not fair because he was spending ""so much time in transit"" flying across the country (5-10 hours one way, depends how you fly) and that ""the person being visited should front the majority of the costs"". He also labelled me greedy. When I told him that if he cared about me, he would just pay for his flights in full, he called me manipulative.

It's a huge amount of money for me and I don't feel comfortable with this arrangement. I asked a friend and my dad today and they both said this was not a good way to deal with expenses. Am I the asshole for refusing to split the cost of flights with my boyfriend coming to visit me?",86,60,0.88
1298,Asshole,"So my cousin recently got an XBOX and started filming his game sessions... with his phone recording the TV screen because he has neither recording stuff nor anything to edit his videos. 

He plays Fortnite and Minecraft mostly and his ""commentary"" consists of him and his family talking over each other and terrible ""jokes"" that only he himself thinks are funny.

He's earnestly trying to become a popular Youtuber like this and thinks if he just uploads hundreds of videos, his subscriber count will grow exponentially as well.

I wanted to spare him the embarrassment of looking back at this years later, along with all the mocking comments he was already getting and told him that maybe he should wait a bit longer before he tries something like this and that he's not going to make it with the stuff he's making right now.

He yelled at me for not supporting his hobby, claimed that I had no idea how Youtube worked, cried and slammed his door in my face. 

I need to know, am I the asshole for trying to talk him out of this?",113,139,0.83
1299,Not the A-hole,"So I (29F) am turning 30 early next year. Growing up I never felt like I had a 'proper' birthday.

I have a cousin who shares my birthday who is a year younger than me who was always a family favourite, and if he had a party or dinner or anything I was expected to go, and no one acknowledged my birthday and even though I asked I wasn't even allowed to take a friend to these events. There would be no cake or song for me. You get the picture. 

The week before I turned 9 my mother unfortunately had a miscarriage of a very much wanted baby. So that birthday sucked, and for a long time every one after did too as the timing meant rehashing that grief. 

I didn't do a 16th, 18th or 21st because to be blunt, I didn't have many friends, and I was worried no one would come. On top of that I was just used to my birthday sucking. 

When I was 27 my grandfather died the day before my birthday, so instead of a birthday we were caught up planning his funeral etc.

But now, I am so happy to say I feel like my life is awesome. I brought my own house, started my own business, widened my social circle and have made really good friends. I felt like my 30th is the perfect time to throw a big party and finally have the birthday experience I never got as a kid. Lots of cake, dancing etc, really go all out. 

Yesterday my family brought up the anniversary of my grandfather's death and how they feel ready to scatter his ashes. It makes sense to do it on the saturday of that week as then no one would have to take time off work. He left specific instructions where he wanted his ashes scattered, about a 3 hour drive from the city all my family lives in. But that saturday is.... you guessed it. My birthday. 

I was furious. I told my family they were being inconsiderate and they should have asked me first. I said he's been dead for nearly 3 years, surely he can wait. Like for a long weekend, or his birthday or something. 

The family mostly backed off, and agreed that it could wait. The very vocal few are calling me selfish and say I am disrespecting of my grandfathers memory. They called me childish for raising my voice, and now wont come to any party I throw out of principal. The family seems torn 60/40 but the 60% is mostly my immediate family who know just how bad my birthdays were growing up. I know I should not have raised my voice but honestly I dont think I'm asking for too much.

1301,Not the A-hole,"So I have music/ theatre lessons in a town 45 minutes away from my hometown. There are five other people from my community who are involved in the theatre group. The workload is very heavy so we end up making the 45 minute drive 2-3 times a week, every week.

We used to carpool in with different parents each week but I’m the oldest by a year and have my licence so now I drive in and out every week instead of our parents.

This means that me or my mom spend 30+ dollars in gas a week to drive in and out. This would be fine but people that are involved in the group get rides in with me even when I have an individual lesson and treat me like a taxi except I never get paid. I feel like I’m being used for my license and not only that it’s very expensive on me. Before nobody paid any gas money because the people driving would alternate but now it’s me every week and the other families don’t pay their share.

I want to ask for some money to help out with the expenses, but I don’t know if that’s greedy because even if they didn’t get a ride in with me, I would still need to drive in. Do you think asking for some financial help would be selfish or justified?",33,59,0.87

1304,Not the A-hole,"To make this quick, basically my family and I were talking about a family friend who is currently suffering from a terminal illness. He was diagnosed less than a year ago but just recently he’s refusing to accept anymore treatments because he doesn’t want to suffer anymore. Anyway, my sister called him selfish for not wanting to live longer for his friends and family (he wasn’t there of course). Almost everyone else was nodding and agreeing with her. For some reason that triggered me because 1) what she said was totally insensitive 
2) it’s selfish to keep someone around for your sake when you know they don’t want to be alive anymore because they’re suffering

I flat out told them if I was in his position I wouldn’t want ANY treatment. Nada. The chances of living a long sufficient life are slim. I don’t want to go through that at all PLUS I would be putting my parents in debt with all of my medical bills. They work too hard to waste money on treatments that will barely keep me alive.

After I went on my rant my family pretty much called me selfish and said that isn’t the right thing to do.  AITA for not wanting to put myself and my parents through that misery?


Edit:

Thank you for all of the responses. I appreciate all of the NTAs, NAHs, and YTAs. At first I thought I was completely right and just wanted confirmation, but I feel like my family does have the right to feel that way if something like that were to happen to me. But they are indeed the assholes for thinking he is selfish for not continuing to fight this debilitating illness. 

To everyone suggesting that I should get an attorney and put that in my will, I’ll keep that noted. As I am only a broke 23 year old college student but still in good health, I will take care of that once I have a steady income. Thank you all.",129,553,0.94

1314,Not the A-hole,"I think this is a cultural thing, I’m an immigrant in the US with a very traditional name from my home country. It’s nothing too extreme, it’s a 2 syllable, 7 letter Scandinavian name. 

I’m totally fine with repeating it, spelling it and I have no problem with people mispronouncing it but I absolutely hate nicknames. My name is my grandmothers name and it’s actually very beautiful in my language. For some reason almost everyone I meet here in the US asks me what I go by for short. I tell them I don’t and that’s my name. After 3-5 times people just get it and it’s a total non issue. 

Some people however just will not even try. I’ve been paged at work by my initials, and ignored it. I’ve corrected a supervisor when he introduced me to new team members by a nickname I had never even heard before, reminded friends and in-laws countless times, sometimes very sternly that I hate nicknames. 

My grandmother in-law was visiting one day and asked if (nickname) minded that she didn’t take off her shoes, I was just around the corner and said “no one by that name lives in this house but you’re certainly free to leave them on.”
I’ve had a coworker tell me she’s uncomfortable with saying my name because it gives her anxiety to not be able to pronounce it correctly, to which I answered that she can address me by mrs. lastname or my first name, but no nicknames and no using my married last name as my name. 
There have been multiple instances like this and it’s caused some real tension.

My thinking is my name is my name, if you can learn to say Zach Galifianakis you can learn my name. My BIL who has a stutter and Down syndrome can say it so I really don’t think there is any excuse not to do it.

1318,Asshole,"I'm hoping to get some perspective here, since I feel a little bit like I'm going crazy.

Here's the story: My son is ten years old and wanted to go trick-or-treating on Friday (my community does weekend trick-or-treating, yeah it's weird) with some of his friends. I offered to let them sleep over at our house afterwards. In total, he had four friends over. One of his friends, Henry, came home with him after school to go trick-or-treating, and the other kids he met up with after and I drove them all home.

I'd spoken to Henry's mom Thursday night and told her what the plans were. I told her that, since we live a ways out of town, that I'd take Henry and my son into town to Trick-or Treat, and then I'd pick up the other kids and take them all home to our house after. She said that was fine and asked what neighborhood they'd be in. I told her, and she was satisfied that it was a safe neighborhood (it really is, too--it's the nice part of town near the good elementary school).

Friday night came, and I took the boys to the neighborhood and dropped them off. When I went to pick them up a couple of hours later, they had already met up with their other friends. All the boys loaded into the car and started trading candies and were just as happy as could be. All in all, a super successful Halloween.

Fast forward to Saturday afternoon. Henry's mom picks him up from our house and calls me as soon as she is home, furious. She starts screaming at me that I lied to her and didn't tell her that the boys would be trick or treating by themselves. She said that her kid could have been killed or hurt and that she would never trust him in my care at all. I got her to calm down and the problem was that she assumed I'd be trick or treating with the boys, and she never would have let Henry come if she'd known otherwise. I told her that was insane and that she was a helicopter mom (not my best moment, admittedly).

Now, to me this whole thing seems crazy. Ten years old is way old enough to trick or treat in a group in a good neighborhood, plus my son has a flip phone for emergencies. But when I went to vent to some other mom friends of mine, they said I overstepped and anyone would have assumed I'd be walking with them all night. I don't know why anyone would assume that, but they sincerely believe that I violated the other mom's trust and that they would have been similarly upset.

So, AITA? I really need some other viewpoints here.",85,92,0.85

1320,Not the A-hole,"So my nephew is in his first year of undergrad at Penn in Wharton’s business school.  He planned on working during the summers + part time during school and taking out some student loans to pay for his tuition.  Well school is taking up a lot more of his time than he anticipated and had to stop working part time so he can focus on studying.  His dad (my brother) is a single dad and can’t afford to help him with tuition.  My wife and I don’t have kids and treat my nephew as if he were our own.  We’ve spoken to my brother about the situation and told him we’d be more than happy to help him out with tuition.  We both have good jobs and can afford to do so. My nephew plans on going to grad school as well so we don’t want him drowning in student debt.  

My brother won’t even entertain the idea of us giving him money and said if he can’t afford it he should transfer to a cheaper school in state.  My nephew was seriously considering transferring at the end of the school year due to his tuition costs.  For my wife and I, transferring is not an option if the only reason is money.  My wife is a Wharton alum and knows what kind of doors open when you graduate from such a good school.

My whole family has tattoos, but they all go to the same guy, who tattoos out of the backroom of his house, only knows how to do one style but doesn't turn down work when it's not his style, and is very cheap. 

One of my biggest pet peeves is people choosing cheap tattoos over saving up and getting better work, but I realise this is a personal choice and don't care too much. My little sister just turned 16 (yes, the dude also tattoos underage) and she immediately went down to the guy and got quite a large piece on her shoulder, and it's dreadful.

Of course, no one wants to say something that's on your body forever is ugly, so I kept my mouth shut, as I have been doing for years about this guy's work.

So, my sister shows me the tattoo and I smile and ask if she's happy with it, she says she is. She asks if I like it, and I say 'it's nice' and try to leave it at that.

1328,Asshole,"I've never been to a bachelorette party before. I know the basic concept: drink a lot with lady friends. But I don't party much, so I have low physical stamina, get sick/tired easily, & am very safety-minded

We all noticed BRIDE was on-and-off sulking during the last night. I don't drink hard with her much, but I've known her most of my life, & know she can sometimes be mercurial so I didn't take it too seriously. Next day, she avoided everyone & spent it at the hotel, alone. I figured she was hungover & didn't read into it. Overall tho, it was truly an awesome time. I thought. Then I got home & got a text from BRIDE

She said that, while I must have meant well, I ruined the weekend with my ""negativity."" I asked for examples, because I literally had no clue what I had done. She gave me a list:

* I stayed at the hotel in the mornings with whoever was hungover. Interpreted as avoidant. I was sore. We all met up later
* At 12am I asked GIRL A, who seemed to be not having fun, as well as GIRLS B + C (B was still hungover), if they were tired & either wanted to bring the party home or split it in half to recover. They were all willing to be troopers though, so whatever. Idea shot down. BRIDE told me that GIRL A gossiped that I seemed really angry about all this & made it sound like I was being conspiratorial when I was just gauging interest
* Soon after, GIRL D bought nonconsensual shots for everyone, including still-hungover/sick GIRL B, which I thought was insensitive to force upon her. I voiced annoyance at this, in that B was still recovering (she seemed not into it but is too polite to take a stand over it) & that type of liquor makes me ill/wish I had input on the type. But I shot it anyway & yep, I got kinda sick, but still stayed out with everyone for the sake of it. GIRL D later told BRIDE that I was very rude about the shots
* BRIDE was getting wasted fast, so I urged water consumption & slowing down a little. This was perceived as ""yelling"" at her (we were in LOUD bars, the only way to communicate is yelling), ""fun-policing,"" & patronizing. I just didn't want her to waste a whole day of her weekend being sick in bed & I'm hurt that expressing concern was interpreted this way. BRIDE spent the last day sulking in bed anyway so I guess I should have let her get fucked up instead, it would have had the same end result
* Like 3 other instances where she interpreted me as being ""really mad"" about something frivolous, but I was actually completely neutral, or confused/asking a clarifying or motive-based question

This isn't even all of it, but I gotta stay under 3000 charas

As someone with social anxiety, who prefers to drink in quiet places, I was really patting myself on the back for socializing so well under these circumstances. Now the whole experience is retroactively ruined by learning that not only did I wreck the BRIDE's fun, but also nearly every girl in the group was gossiping about me during the weekend

Feelin useless & shitty over here

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the comments, it gave me a lot to think about and cry about. Thanks for the more civil ones especially. Didn't think it would get this much engagement, so it's good to see multiple POVs. After some time, it seems like only the other folks with anxiety problems are on my side, lol. But I gotta learn to deal with non-anxious folk to get through life, right?

I think we both made mistakes, but I made more. She shouldn't have even invited me, she shoulda confronted me while things were happening so I could amend my behavior. But I shouldn't have attended in the fist place. FOMO aside, I was also worried that not attending was worse than attending and doing my best to deal, which turned out to be a bad move. I didn't know the social rules, straight-up. I should have been more of a trooper and less of a busybody (both were things I didn't realize I was doing at all.)

In elementary school, I was bullied pretty badly. I was a very sensitive and anxious kid, and I was a year younger than everyone else in my grade, so they called me a baby and made me cry a lot on purpose. I had really nice teachers who would help me through it, all until 4th grade. My teacher (Mr.P, we’ll call him) believed in “tough love” on his students. But, truthfully he was an ASSHOLE. He wanted his students to be in line at all times, never straying from what he thought was the picture perfect classroom. 

I, however, was a problem child for him. 

I finished my work early and read books in class, I asked questions that he didn’t have answers for, I did more homework than he assigned, I finished class readings before everyone else. He hated me specifically, and when I was being bullied or teased he’d either look the other way or watch and not do anything. 

One day, we were finishing up work in class and Mr.P was giving out these special rulers with our school’s name printed on them. I had finished my assigned workbook page and was working on the page behind it, when all of a sudden he slaps my hand with the bunch of rulers. I retracted my hand and started to cry, and he made an example out of me in front of the classroom, saying that this is what happens to children who don’t listen. My skin had broken and I was bleeding and he wouldn’t let me go to the nurse or give me a bandaid. I kept quiet about the incident thinking it was my fault, but eventually told my mother and grandmother. They were angry that I didn’t tell them originally so they could have done something, but it was far too late. 

A few months or so after I told them, I found out that Mr.P was being awarded for being teacher of the year or something like that. I was disgusted because of how he treated me. I found out where the award was coming from and wrote an email to the organization, detailing how he treated me in elementary school and the ruler incident. I sent it off and heard no response, so I ended up forgetting about it.

Apparently, he was taken out of the running for the award and fired from the school. I’m not sure if i was the direct cause, but I figured I had to have *something* to do with it. A few kids that I went to school with that I still talk to were livid and disgusted with me, saying that he was never that bad and I cost an old man his job. My mom and grandmother say I did a good thing, because who knows what else he’s done to other children? 

I’m still in limbo about it, I’m not sure if i did the right thing or what. I thought he was a terrible person and didn’t deserve the award, but maybe I was wrong to make that decision.",41,30,0.95
1332,Not the A-hole,"I'm French, been working in an American company for a few months as part of my post-grad studies. My name's Michel, pronounced the same as the American name Michelle.

When I arrived in the US, I was worried to overstep boundaries, and I wasn't confident in my English skills, so I let people speak over me a lot. A few coworkers tripped over my name at first, but almost all of them learned the proper pronunciation quickly. All except John. John is a senior employee, I guess in his 60s, with a pretty bombastic and loud demeanor, the kind who will slap your back hard and laugh out loud at his own jokes. I'm not a fan of John. Especially since he decided that my name is ""Mitch.""

At first, I let it go because I thought John genuinely struggled to pronounce Michel. But after a couple months, I heard him mention Michelle Obama - I couldn't believe it at first when he just pronounced my name perfectly. I pointed it out excitedly, ""This is my name! See, you can say it right!"" But he countered with ""It's a woman's name!"" I said I don't care, it's my name, in my culture it's not female, please pronounce it right. He essentially waved it off with ""Sure thing, Mitch, hahaha!""

Since then, as I grew bolder and more confident in this new environment, I have asked him a couple more times to call me Michel, not Mitch. Both times, he deflected my request and kept calling me Mitch. I sent him a formal mail asking him to *please call me by my actual name*, but that mail went unanswered.

It's not the end of the world that John calls me Mitch, but it grates on my nerves a bit more every time, especially since he's the only one to refuse to use my actual name - and because he apparently tries to unilaterally ""protect"" me from being called what he deems a female name(?)

My sister is 11 and my brother is in his mid twenties. A few days ago my mom started messaging me for the first time in months trying to ask me if I can find her some weed. I dont gave an issue with weed so I gave her the phone number of the last person I knew back home that might have some. The next night in the middle of the night she started messaging me going off asking me why I told the person not to sell her anything. I did no such thing and told her that I have better things to worry about with my time than whether or not she has weed and that it isnt my problem. Her response to me is a several hundred work written response explaining that she was on fentanyl patches from her doctor who was busted and had his license removed and her new doctor refuses to give her new pain medicine so she is having my brother give her any pills she has in the house to keep herself sedated while she goes through withdrawal.

I reached my end with her and called CPS and reported that she is sedating herself with whatever pills she can get and making herself unable to take care of her daughter? AITA?

1336,Not the A-hole,"Created this account just so I could post, first time poster but my wife is a long time lurker which is how I know this exists 

My wife, Phoebe is 34 years old she has 4 children with her ex husband David ranging from the ages of 3,5,7,11 we have a 1 year old together 

Anyway my wife and I had been planning a family trip, to Disney world and it’ll be the youngest 3s first time there 

She let David know we’d have them for 2 weeks before Christmas but to make up for it he could have them Christmas if he was ok with that, he was.

I don’t know what led up to it but she asked me if she could invite David and Maria (David’s gf) and Maria’s children who are 14 and 16, not a problem while Maria was going.

Maria ducked out today or so David said but Phoebe said she couldn’t tell him not to come with since the children are excited for their dad to come with and Maria’s children still want to go 

Ive told her I’m not comfortable with this and while just David is going I’m not going and she’s not taking my child to go on a holiday with her ex 

She’s calling me TA and is still planning on going and is saying David isn’t a problem since they’re friends

1337,Not the A-hole,"So this has nothing to do with my relationship in general as it is great but about eating habits.

So I am more or less a hobby cook and I am originally from Europe, as a result I cook a lot of food from my home countries(Mom is Greek, Dad is Austrian) and I try new stuff quite often, as an example I worked at a Korean restaurant in the past and the owner taught me recipes and I frequent cooking sites and own a crapton of cookbooks etc. As a result I like to try a lot of different foods and try a lot of different tastes, spicy, sweet, sour etc. My girlfriend on the other hand only really eats local food or fast food which is fine by me, the issue is she wants/likes me to cook her food, which I did for a good while but she basically likes nothing and tries nothing new which results in me having to cook bland stuff and trying nothing new unless I cook myself different food on top of cooking her food which is not an option because I work full time.

Now I also got a bunch of new friends and I have taken up inviting them over to cook for them twice a month or so, so I can try my hand at new stuff and having them enjoy my cooking makes me happy. Well of course my girlfriend is generally there too and where everyone likes it most of the time, she pretty much takes half a bite and orders take out later in the evening.

So I stopped cooking for her and now just make my own food and let her make whatever she wants, which is pissing her off as she cant cook so complains about having to get take out or getting tired of just eating mac&cheese and such where as previously I would cook full meals for the both of us. Now I tried to meet her in the middle and make extra of what I am having but she rarely eats it unless it is something like a Burger, I made a spicy Stir fry yesterday and she would not even try it, leaving me with a heap of leftovers luckily my neighbor likes my cooking!

Thing is I am done meeting in the middle and I dont get why she is mad about it anyways since she wont eat what I cook anyways unless it is tailored to her tastes. But she is adamant about being angry as she says I should make stuff we both enjoy, now I would be fine with that, if it was not for the fact she is the pickiest eater ever.

So am I just being a douche here?",955,6685,0.98
1338,Not the A-hole,"I live with my boyfriend and a roommate. Rent is split 3 ways between us. My boyfriend works out of town but still pays rent despite the fact he is only home 4 days out of the month. My roommate is pregnant and due in January. She’s not a bad roommate. But could improve in some areas (but I think that could apply to everyone). 
I knew she was pregnant when she moved in. When we were originally discussing her living arrangements with us he was not apart of the picture. When the day came she had asked if he was welcome to move in as well. I told her that is welcome to hang out and stay the night here or there but that we didn’t want him living at the house. 
The house comprises of mostly all mine and my boyfriends belongings. My roommate was a friend who was pregnant and in need of a roof over her head. She is financially stable and pays rent on time but she doesn’t have much. All the furniture in the house is mine and the boyfriends. Even her bed is a bed I had given her months before she had moved in with us. All the dishes are mine as well as all towels and I buy all the toilet paper and paper towels. 
She helps where it is needed. She’s not always consistent about helping out but she does help and I can see it. I’m not too hell bent over it for she’s 7 months pregnant. 
Shortly after she had moved in her baby daddy started traveling for work. He usually works for 10 days straight and returns for 3. He has been staying at our house when he is in town. With out physically seeing him I know when he is town for he always leaves the front door unlocked. My roommate gave him the code to the house so he comes and goes as he pleases. He never replaces the toilet paper when he finishes the roll, never does the dishes when he uses plenty in the 3 days he is present, he stays up til 4 AM playing and screaming at his PlayStation.  He has ruined one of my couches. Over all I feel so disrespected everytime I come home to an unlocked house. 95% of the house comprises of mine and my boyfriends belongings and I know if anything were to stolen he wouldn’t take any responsibility or help in replacing anything. 
Their relationship is not my business but I don’t appreciate how he treats her or my house hold and belongings. 
He stays at my house has free WiFi, has free electricity and water, uses our dishes but doesn’t clean up after, uses our furniture, uses our towels, doesn’t clean up after himself what so ever, and is overall incredibly disrespectful. 

His presence in my house is causing conflict between my boyfriend and I. My boyfriend is home 4 days a month yet he still pays rent. Her boyfriend is home slightly more than mine and doesn’t pay a dime. I’m not sure if he will have time off when the baby is born but I don’t want him around. 

Am I the asshole for telling my roommate her baby daddy is unwelcome in our house 2 months before she is due? I am scared to cause any extra stress so close to her due date.",23,101,0.92
1339,Not the A-hole,"So myself and my husband decided to rent out our bottom basement suite, so he cleaned it all out and we found someone to rent well him rather, 

This person has already been awful when I went down to grab my very expensive string lights over 200$ ( they’re not really string lights as thick rope lights they’re beautiful) I saw his suite beer cans everywhere and I think he has someone else living in his suite which is not in the lease and we pay all the heat and gas, hot water internet so having another person is going to rack that up as well.

Anyways back to my main point I had been away while the guy had moved in I expected my husband to get everything that’s ours but he left my lights, now keep in mind this is a brand new renovated suite and it even has dimmer lights and this guy is getting a crazy deal on rent he wouldn’t get it anywhere,

The tenant asked me if i could take the lights later as he had a friend over and I said okay, 
He then went and asked my husband if he could have those lights cause they are easy on his eyes, I said to my husband absolutely not!! I paid allot of money for those lights and by the way he treats his things I do not want them being ruined I also want my lights I spent so much on!

Husband is saying I’m being an asshole and let him have the lights since they are easy on his eyes but he has dimmer lights I don’t understand his argument.

So AITA?

TLDR: bought expensive lights husband left them down there when moved tenant in tenant wants to keep the lights since they are easy on his eyes, he has dimmer lights so don’t understand argument, his suite is already in bad condition after brand new renovation, why would I trust him with my things?",28,74,0.89

He didn't say anything whilst we checked out then when we got outside he screamed, like full on screamed, at me for being an unconsiderate friend and how I am piece of shit and should have thought about him. I told him his previous mental health issues shouldnt dictate what I can and cant eat. He got angry saying I am a stick insect even though I eat tons of junk food and he has always had to diet. I asked him how the fuck that is my fault and if I should feel bad for it. He said I should have been more considerate. I told him I disagree and I can eat what I want and he cant decide it for me, and that him previously not being able to eat properly isnt my problem. He told me he wishes I die of malnoutrition (wat idek). He then threw my doritos in the trash and stormed off. 

That kind of sucked because I am 15 and was relying on his parents for a lift home, because we were planning to go to his house for a few hours after getting snacks. It took 3 hours to get home which was pretty exhausting.

I told him that I will not be attending court because I told him from the start of this current divorce process that I refuse to attend court due to his track record of marriage and divorce. (The accusations are over a restraining order that I do not believe to be true but I was not around them enough to know.) 

So my dad has been divorced 6 times over the last decade. Now that I am a senior in college about to graduate I feel that his failed marriages no longer hold merit in my life however it is my father and yes I do feel obligated to our relationship but I feel that he doesn’t understand how relationship dynamics change and that he is no longer in charge of me. 

Plain and simple, he told my buddy that I was going to court but my father NEVER TOLD ME that court was Friday and just assumed I would attend.

I don’t want my father to face legal penalties (I doubt there will be any because he has other witnesses coming) but I can’t continue to support his behavior and abuse of our relationship.

1342,Asshole,"Hello

My new girlfriend uses a diva cup for when she’s on her period. I’ll admit that I’m totally clueless when it comes to these things and I asked her how she cleans it, like washing machine, hand scrubbing, or whatever else. She said that she wipes it off, scrubs it, and then throws it in a pot and boils it. And I was like, oh so do you use a separate pot for this or does it come with a pot for this use. And she says nah, she just uses one of her cooking pots for this purpose.

Look, I’m not a germaphobe by any means but I just won’t eat off a dish that a cat or dog has licked or touched. I’m just not for it. And to me this isn’t much different and it made me hella queasy. So I told her that I don’t feel good about that and asked if she’d consider using a separate pot. I also made it clear that if it’s not something she can afford then I’d be willing to cover the cost. 

She wasn’t even the least bit receptive to my idea. She actually had the nerve to say that I’m being childish, that it’s “clean” and that I should just get over it

This pissed me off, I told her not to insult me like that and I told her to get out of my apartment. I don’t think I was being unreasonable in any way, shape or form and I feel like it’s an easy compromise. 

AITA?

ETA: Wow this post got a lot more attention than I thought it would. Anyways I thought y’all would like to know that Shelby apologized for calling me childish, I apologized for kicking her out of my place. She said she talked to her friends about it who told her that I’m not at all being unreasonable and that’s it’s not such a huge compromise for her (wow, who would have thought?), so I’ll be heading to SuperStore tomorrow to buy her a new pot for her washing duties. Jokes on you all, you’re all assholes.

1343,Not the A-hole,"My mother liked to collect art during her lifetime. Most of it was not extremely valuable ($5000 or less); however, her prized possession was a pair of man/woman glass statues that ended up bring appraised at $80,000 for the pair. My mother left me the man and my sister the woman statue. My sister wanted to auction the pair and split the amount we make. However, I really loved these statues and didn’t want to sell them. After much arguing, I refused to sell and my sister decided to sell the woman statue. Because the works are meant to be a pair, the sole woman statue was appraised at $9,000. I bought it at auction for $13,000. My sister is extremely angry as I now have both statues worth a total $80,000 and says that I should have had to pay $40,000 for the statue if I wanted both. These statues were the only things that were specifically given to us. The rest of her estate was just to be divided evenly between me and my sister. My sister says that I violated the spirit of my mom’s will by managing to get my hands on the statue set. Although my parents lived well during their lives, expensive end of life care options for my dad and later my mom resulted in the house being mortgaged. After selling the art (except the statues), my sister and I ended up getting about $30,000 each. If you take the statues into account, she ended up getting $43,000 and I ended up getting $27,000 and a set of statues worth $80,000. So, I did end up with the lion’s share of the inheritance. But I say that it was divided evenly and the purchase of the woman statue was done completely apart from our inheritance. AITA?

1345,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend of 6 years Jane is absolutely devastated. She had her own delivery business which she has poured her heart into for the last few years. She worked so hard but unfortunately things went badly and her business went bust. She's heartbroken and all I can do is console her. 

Jane and I went for dinner with her parents, and her mother also invited her sister, sisters husband and their daughter Laura, who is around the same age as us. 

Laura has her own business too, management consultancy, which is is doing really well from what we've been told. Jane and me do our best to avoid any occasion when Laura is present. She was a huge bully to Jane when they were younger and still goes out of her way to torment her now. Nonetheless we decided to go this time because Jane wanted to spend some time with her parents. 

At dinner Laura was being her usual vile self, asking Jane how her business is going, even though she already knows the answer. She was being really nasty and telling her that maybe some people just aren't cut out for business, and saying that now she can concentrate on getting a ''real job''. 

Jane and her parents have told me a fair few things about Laura. I know that her parents paid for the entirety of her university fees, and that they also paid for the premises Laura is using for her company without asking her to pay anything back. Jane, on the contrary, started out literally from scratch with no financial help from anyone. 

I was angry at Laura's comments and said that maybe if Laura's business goes the same way then maybe she can ask daddy to bail her out. I told her it must be nice pretending that she's working hard when her parents made all this possible. Laura swore at me and stormed out and her parents then attacked me for being cruel to her. 

After they had left I got a grilling from Jane and both her parents. While Jane gets that I was standing up for her, she thinks I've gone and made things worse, as now Laura's parents will be on the warpath for letting me offend their daughter.

1349,Not the A-hole," So, this was about a couple years ago, but as of recently, I've been feeling guilty because of it. 

&#x200B;

  I should give some backstory to this first, my mother wasn't the best person, she acted like she loved me sometimes, but a lot of the time she would be quite abusive in the emotional sense. For example, when I was learning how to drive she would constantly make comments about how I was purposely trying to harm and kill both her and my sister by purposely trying to crash the car. Not only that, but she would constantly tell me how terrible of a person I am, how I was compliant with the ""people"" trying to ""get"" her, and she would use that as an excuse to punish me severely for weeks at a time. There's more, but I have trouble addressing this stuff. 

&#x200B;

  Eventually, I broke down and couldn't take it anymore. I wanted away from her as much as possible. I called my dad, told him I wanted to move in with him and then proceeded to tell my mother the same. Instead of becoming angry, she tried everything she could to keep me from leaving (preparing my favorite meals every day, tried to enroll me in a new high school, begged me to not pack my things, etc. Everything but apologize for how she treated me). I ended up agreeing to call every day while I lived with my dad, but this didn't last long. While texting with my sister, I ended up learning that it was my mother pretending to be my sister. After this I was done, I called my mother, told her off and then ended by telling her I wanted nothing to do with her anymore. I blocked her number and I thought that was that. 

&#x200B;

  But as of recently, my mother has been going to therapy and receiving medication for bipolar disorder. I keep being told that she's doing better and that I should reach out and try to reconnect, if not for her sake, for my sister's and my grandfather's sake (I can't see them as much because of my mother and my grandfather is quite old and likely doesn't have many years left.) But I want nothing to do with her anymore, she betrayed my trust on several occasions as well as gave me longstanding problems with depression. But I feel a little conflicted, I feel as if I'm the asshole for not giving her a second chance, or at least not having some relationship with her so I could spend more time with my sister and grandfather, but yet I'm still firm on my decision to not want to have anything to do with her.  

&#x200B;

 So, I guess I should ask you all, am I the asshole for not giving her the second chance or am I justified in not wanting to see her ever again. Most of my family feel as if I should reach out, but I do mostly feel justified, though, no one in my family knows the full extent of the story so I though, so that's why I'm posting this here.

Looking to find out if I was in the wrong here...

I (33/f) got a online wedding invite from one of my closet friends last week announcing that her wedding is a month (we got 30 days notice of it). When speaking directly to her the reason it is happening so quick is because her future MIL is stopping her cancer treatments and so they wanted to get married while she is still here. It is a very bittersweet event.

The problem is - the wedding is happening the same day that I leave for my honeymoon. I spoke with my friend and told her that I could not come because of this and she said she understood.  
Later that night I get a text from one of our other friends asking me if I ""seriously was not going to our friends wedding""  
I replied that I was out of the country and she then said ""and that cant change?""  
I then said that it was an expensive vacation, both my husband and I had to book the time off and it wasn't easily changed so no I didn't think it could.  
Her response was "" I am surprised, I thought one of your best friends weddings would be more of a priority to you""

During our conversation I was very defensive in why I couldn't go and she told me I was missing the point - I should be doing all that I could to try and be there. This was also only about 6 hours after we got the invite and at this point I hadn't even spoken to my husband because he was at work so discussing potentially trying to push our vacation a day wasn't an option. We didn't buy cancellation insurance with the booking site so us changing our dates could mean either cancelling the trip and re-booking or losing money. We are looking into it - but the chances of us doing this are really slim.

She never responded to my last text, hasn't spoken to me in 4 days (one of those days was my birthday and she did not say a thing to me) and she spoke with our friend who is getting married and bitched me out. I know this because I spoke again with my friend to see how she felt about the fact that I couldn't be there and when I mentioned that our other friend was pissed at me she just said ""yeah"" like it was acceptable that she is mad at me.

In my opinion the only person who should be upset with me is my friend who is getting married - and she can be disappointed that I can't be there but mad at me for it I think is unreasonable.

We share the same bedroom and she’ll have guests over on a weeknight until 2-3am. She doesn’t tell me they’re over, however so I’ll come home to people I’m not expecting in our room. 

I feel that it’s not to much to ask to make sure I’m cool with someone being in our shared bedroom before having them over especially since shes had guests over on nights when I have important exams the next day. I’m fine with guests most nights but when I have big exams or assignments due the next day I’d really rather not have people over being loud all hours of the night, especially since our library closes at midnight. 

She gets genuinely mad at me for being upset and claims since she lives there she shouldn’t have to check before having people over and just decided to get mean with me about it. In my eyes, however, it’s just common courtesy and I personally ask every time I want to bring a person over.

1355,Not the A-hole,"My fiance and I have been together since college. He proposed and before we could start planning for our wedding I found out I was pregnant, so we postponed the wedding. 

Life kind of got in the way of the wedding, and 5 kids and 17 years later we are finally in a place where a wedding is possible finacially/time wise for us. I have always just referred to my fiance as my husband, but now we can finally make it official. 

Now to where I may be the asshole. My aunt and her kids have never gotten along with me. My aunt was horrible to me as a child, because my mom was quite poor and she married rich. She used to accuse me of stealing her kids things and would overall treat me like dirt, because her daughters were ""just better"" than me and my sister. 

I would be willing to look past this if it werent for the fact that she is an abusive manipulator as well. My mom took several of her dogs away from her because she was so abusive to them. My mom would rehabilitate and then rehome them where they would finally be loved. It finally came to a point where my mom said she would call the cops if my aunt got anymore dogs. I was only about 10 when that happened, but I still cant get that out of my mind when I think about her. 

Her kids arent any better. My cousins are spoiled to all hell and the few times theyve met my kids theyve been just awful to them. One in particular would pull my daughter's hair if she was too loud or silly (she's only 10 now probably about 6 when this happened) 

I want to exclude them from my wedding. My whole extended family will be there and they told me that I need to get over it. My aunt is a ""changed woman"" and wants to finally see me married. I will concede that my aunt seems like a much nicer person now, and she has never been mean to my kids like her daughters have, but I still dont want to see her there on my big day. 

WIBTA for excluding her and her daughters from my wedding, even though literally my entire family will be there?

Edit: I should mention our wedding, the reception specifically,  is almost doubling as a family reunion (for me and fiances families). Aunt in question lives out of state and Im afraid there will be some tension with family members who want to see her",31,26,0.87

1357,Everyone Sucks,"I'm a girl in high school and obviously living with my parents. They're kind of gross around food; they put open containers in the fridge with no lids, stack stuff all over each other till something at the bottom is crushed or spilled, they've put uncooked meat in Saran wrap in the fridge that drip raw meat juice out.

For a while I'd not eat anything that was not from a closed package because I didn't trust my mom to tell me if stuff was new and clean. She'd always say stuff was OK and she just bought it even if that wasn't true. 

My mom often eats stuff that's molded and just gets rid of the moldy bit. And she and my dad must have an iron stomach But that shit always makes me sick.

I think all this is because my parents grew up really really poor, having trouble affording food, sometimes not having food so they're not ok throwing anything away. But now they're doing good, we're upper middle class I'd say.

Anyway, I'm so sick of it I decided to deal with it myself. I bought a pack of 50 matching tupperwares, all with the same lid size so my parents can't say they can't find a lid. Plus plastic zip bags, date labels, bleach, and sponges.

I took everything out of the fridge, disassembled the shelving, bleached everything inside and out. I went through every container and put the moldy things on one counter, and took the things that looked OK in the tupperwares or bags with date labels estimating when they were bought. I washed the outside of every condiment container with bleach water and then put the clean stuff back in.

Plus I hung a list on the door about food rules:

- All food in an closed container or it'll be taken out of the fridge

- All containers have the date of purchase on it or they'll be taken out of the fridge

- Any milk or juice that I see someone drinking straight out of the bottle will be taken out of the fridge

- Anything moldy will be taken out of the fridge

- Anything spilled in the fridge and I'll bleach clean the fridge and the things in it

- Anything taken out of the fridge will be marked with a red X and cannot go back in. You can eat it if you want but it won't be making the fridge nasty

Anyway I did all this and told my family the new rules and my parents got mad. My mom was mad that I'd decided some of her things were too nasty to go back in the fridge because she wanted to eat them. I told her she could eat them for dinner but they were not going back in. My dad was mad I'd used bleach because it made the kitchen smell like bleach.

And my parents have been mad when I stop them with groceries and say I need to label them with the date. Or when I took the milk my dad was drinking from the bottle and said it was not going back in the fridge because that's nasty and nasty stuff does not go in the fridge anymore.

1361,Not the A-hole,"Hello! Throwaway because duh.

So I'm a trans woman, who has been on medication (HRT) for about a year. I'm at the point where I can no longer hide my breasts, and its time for me to start transitioning in the workplace. Now, when I was just starting my medication, I informed the manager and HR of the branch of the midsize company I work for what was going on, telling them I was going to work with them so we had a smooth transition. I've been very giving, and willing to teach them the basics and be very gentle when they unintentionally say offensive things (I've responded to them with sentences such as ""I'm happy to explain this to you, but just so you know the thing you just said is considered very offensive by trans people because of XYZ""). Basically, I like my job and want to keep it, but I'm also making sure it is a safe and comfortable place for me.

So, with my employers being informed that things are coming to a head soon and that we need to make plans for me to work full time under my new name/as a woman, they're getting difficult. Telling me that thing X we agreed to do is not going to happen, and that I have no say in how this information about myself is disseminated. The final straw came when a member of the management team asked me for very invasive information about my medical treatment as a condition of publicly transitioning, and requiring that I use the two unisex bathrooms on premises instead of using the women's bathrooms.

I live in a very liberal west coast state, and I know that what they are requesting of me is not legal in this state. I tried telling them nicely that I disliked what they were saying. Finally, I went off on them. I told them that what they wanted was not legal, and that I honestly didn't have to include them at all in this process, I was doing so to help them deal with any ripples that could come from it in a controlled environment. I finally threatened them legally, and told them that if things didn't happen the way that **I** wanted them to, then I would circumvent their entire process, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.

People in my personal life are split. Some are glad I stood up for myself when management refused to listen to my polite requests, and some think that I'm making things adversarial (and being an asshole) for no reason, and I should capitulate to their way of doing it.

So which is it? AITA?

Edit: someone asked what they were refusing to do, so i'm copy/pasting my response in here.

"" So the long and short is that when we first discussed it the plan was to  send a building wide email like the day before I ""switched"" visual  appearance for lack of better terms. Informing people that my new name  is X, please use She/Her, that kind of thing. Trans 101 for lack of  better words. Now they're saying that they don't necessarily see a  reason to do that, and people can find out organically. From my POV that  is extremely dangerous and short sighted, and is going to cause a lot  more of a spectacle and gossip than just giving everyone the facts at  once. It is also putting all of the onus on me having to come out to  literally every  individual person who I speak to in person, and who I  work with (Our office houses about 500 people, probably half to two  thirds of who will see me on a day to day basis), not to mention people  starting gossip when I come in in womens clothing, or the outrage it  will cause when I start using the women's restroom.

1363,Asshole,"So my roommate (close friend ever since we were kids) keeps skipping courses because ""he can't sleep at night"". This is absolutely fine by me since i don't really care, i skip class as well sometimes. 

What bothered me last couple days is that he kept saying we'd go together the next morning (we're in the same class) but every time he doesn't want to get up because he ""couldn't sleep last night."" This has caused me to lose the bus a couple times because i kept waiting for him. 

Additionally, he sleeps every day till 6pm to make up for the lost sleep. 

Here's the thing. The very few hours he is in the kitchen, he always eats at least a pack of chocolate alone. 

I told him that maybe his sleep schedule is fucked because of the massive sugar intake he has. (He literally goes to the store every single day to get 3 packets of chocolate that last him maybe 2 days)

His response? ""No it's not.""
I told him that it does happen to people and he should really stop eating so much sugar and maybe he can sleep.
His response? ""I don't care""

So the last straw was this morning when i also had a very shitty night and decided to skip the first course. He comes out and complains (as usual) about how bad he slept and that it's ""becoming an issue"".

I finally snapped and told him ""shut the fuck up if you value your precious sweets more than your sleep""

He just puffed at me, told me i'm an asshole and opened another chocolate just to piss me off.

1364,Not the A-hole,"I bought some land including a house on a corner lot across from a school. There's a ""public"" park on the property which I also inherited. As far as I'm aware, this park has been open to the public for a couple of decades. I'm not super familiar as I'm relatively new to this town. It's one of three parks and obviously it's heavily used due to the closeness of an elementary school.

My lawyer says it's an ""easement"" meaning the public is free to use it out of habit/tradition yet it remains my responsibility. I guess the prior owner maintained it with some help from the town through the mayor's office and volunteers. The prior owner was a developer/philanthropist who did a lot of the small town.

I don't like this because it opens me up to liability. I've asked the mayor's office if they'd like to hire surveyors to redraw property lines and consider it public property rather than my property, for free no less, and they've refused. They don't want the liability or the cost of hiring workers and lawyers to make it happen.

Putting up signage or fences haven't really worked so I want to uproot it all and just make it lawn. Before this, when I had signage up, some of the parents of students at the school started a petition to ""save their park"", not knowing it's privately owned and not part of the town's public spaces. Trying to reason with some of them fell on deaf ears.

Would I be the asshole? Still working it out legally with my lawyer else I'd have posted this on /r/legaladvice. I'm looking for moral/ethical opinions on whether I should or not. I just don't want a kid to get hurt, parents go to the mayor, mayor sends them to me.",1007,9501,0.95

1367,No A-holes here,"On Thursday evening my wife started feeling unwell. I encouraged her to go to bed and told her I could handle the kids evening stuff by myself (3 kids, ages 9, 11, and 13). I checked on her after the kids were in bed at 9 and she was fevered- I asked if she wanted any medicine, made sure she had some water, and rubbed her back for a few minutes. I slept in the spare room but got up twice to check on her. The next morning I got the kids ready and off to school, went to a meeting and came home at 10 to take her to the doctor. I worked from home until our cleaning lady came around 1 and asked her to keep an eye on my wife and went back into the office for a couple meetings, picked up the kids and was home around 4. Her fever broke shortly after I got home at 4 and I helped her shower. Our oldest had a school dance and I got some movies and set the youngest 2 up in the den for the evening with pizza and some games so they'd be quiet. I checked on my wife periodically and after the oldest got home me and the 3 kids camped out in the den. 

On Saturday morning, the kids were restless so I took them out for the day bc I didn't want them to be around the house being loud. I checked on my wife and she was sleeping- I refilled her water and left her a note. Throughout the day I called and sent her messages and my mom took her over some homemade soup and checked on her. We were gone the majority of the day but the kids came home worn out and we crashed in the den again. I checked on my wife as soon as we got home and she was looking better. Sunday morning, the kids and I woke up early, did some yardwork then went to the store to do the weekly grocery shopping. When we got home my wife was up and about and still weak but feeling better. However, she was being really short with me and was in a bad mood. I thought it was just bc she didn't feel well but after a few hours of her making snide comments I asked her if something was wrong and she exploded on me that her family abandoned her while she was sick. She went off about how she always takes care of us when we're sick but we avoided her like the plague and didn't stay home and I made the cleaning lady and my mom take care of her instead of doing it myself. I tried to explain that I didn't want to expose the kids to being sick and I didn't want them around the house being loud while she was trying to rest and I checked on her multiple times.

1369,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I’m 16F, my sister is 7. We live with our mom and grandma. Every time my sister wants something, she would ask my mom for it and my mom would respond “Go ask (my name)”. This didn’t bother me at first. I love my sister and I’d do anything for her, but thanks to my mom she now just asks me for everything. I’m tired of it. She’s asking me for things that I know she can do herself, like make a sandwich, because I’ve seen her do it. Even though our grandma is there, and my mom is never doing anything important that requires her to not be bothered, it’s always go and ask me. Now I know this isn’t my sister’s fault, it’s my mom’s because she made her get used to making me do everything. 

If I don’t do what she asks, or if I tell her to make it herself, my sister will just call/tell my mom that I’m not doing it and then force me to do it. It’s really irritating to be chilling in my room and then my sister comes in constantly asking me to do something. I have a right to be upset but I can’t show that I’m mad or else I’ll get in trouble.

Anyways, this morning my sister asks me if I could make her a sandwich. I’m still in bed so I tell her to make it herself. She goes and calls our mom, and then I immediately go to the kitchen because I know once she calls mom there’s no arguing. She comes into the kitchen and my mom is on FaceTime, and she says “You have to do it, you have to make everything she asks” So I make it, I tell her it’s done and my sister groans because I didn’t toast the bread. At this point I’m fuming, she didn’t even tell me how to make it, but I’m somehow supposed to know?? I put the entire sandwich in our toaster oven and then I go into the bathroom to cool off. After that I went back to bed. My grandma was awake so I don’t know if she redid the sandwich for my sister or if she just took it out of the oven.

Fast forward my sister comes in my room. I’m still angry so I didn’t want to be bothered. She tried to give me paper for our Christmas list but I told her I didn’t want any because I have my own paper. I didn’t yell at her when I said this. My voice was raised, yes, but I didn’t yell.

She leaves and I think that’s the end of it. Until my mom calls me and tells me that my grandma texted her saying that she didn’t like how I was treating my sister. My mom basically went off on me about how I’m lazy and rude and that this is the last time I act this way towards her. She was yelling at me like I beat her up or something. It’s also ironic that she called me lazy because she never does anything for my sister. 

 I’m just sick and tired of doing everything for her when there’s 2 other people in the house. I don’t mind doing things for her, but when it’s ALL THE TIME it starts to get on my nerves.

1371,Asshole,"Ok, I’m in a weird spot and I’m really embarrassed and upset about it. I recognize that I am partly to blame here. I also want to be totally up front and say that if I fail this class, it will put me and my family (mine, not my parents) at a hardship and will delay my entrance into the workforce by a year, which is a huge problem. That’s not the professor’s problem, I just hope it explains some of my upset. 

  
I missed a test for one of my classes and it puts me at a serious risk for failing. The class is online. Here’s where it gets hairy.  
  
Prior to the last test, there were multiple reminders and updates posted. This test had absolutely zero reminders, the test was simply listed in the class schedule, so you would have to manually go to the schedule or have it written in your personal calendar to have known about it.  
  
Now, look, I should have done this. I should have known about it, but I fucked up, ok? I won’t go into my personal life, but I’ve got a lot going on.  
  
The other thing is that I’ve never, ever been to a class where tests or projects didn’t have some sort of reminder. “Just a reminder, test __ is next week”. For assignments, there’s usually an auto-email that goes out saying ____ is due soon. And I can’t count how many times that a professor has reminded the class about something and the students all exclaim because it caught them by surprise, you know what I mean?  
  
  
I have talked to my professor about it and she is 100% unsympathetic and basically wants me to kick rocks. I get it, kind of. But I also feel that they failed to do their part.  
  

So here is the WIBTA part: I want to email the fellow students in my class and see if anyone else made the same mistake. The class is large so it’s very likely. I then want to go to my professor again and say, look, I’m not the only one. If they continue not to budge, I’m considering going to the dean.  
  
WIBTA? I know this mistake is mine, but I also feel that the professor is being unfair about the way she runs the class.  
  
Thanks all, I’m ready to accept my fate.

1373,Not the A-hole,"To start, I think it’s important to state that I have a strained relationship with my mother at best. I grew up in what I will call a difficult household. My dad was an alcoholic and my mother enabled and made excuses for him. She was also emotionally unstable and would take out her frustrations on us – not usually physically, but we were screamed at pretty much constantly. She has also always been terrible with money and we were always on the poverty line due to screwed up life choices my parents would make (like buying a car with a credit card. It took them 10 years to pay off a 3500$ car purchase). 


Anyway, the shit finally hit the fan about 4 years ago and my parents separated. By now I’m an adult with two kids of my own so too little too late for me, but my mother wants to have her grandchildren in her life again (I temporarily cut off contact for their protection when she was still with my dad) and so for the past year or so she’s been looking after my two kids after school while my husband and I are at work. Since she is retired and on a fixed income, we agreed that we would pay her the same that we would to an afterschool program. This ends up being about 700$ a month, which basically covers her rent.


My husband was just offered his dream job halfway across the country. This would mean I would have to give up my job and it is extremely unlikely I would find work where we’re going because I’m in a very niche field. He makes very good money, so it would not be a hardship to go down to one income, but I fear my mother has gotten used to the extra income we give her. (Before we started paying her she was occasionally asking us for a few hundred dollars here and there to cover bills. My frustration with that was what led me to seek out a more formalized alternative to begin with.) Although we could technically still afford it, it would make finances a little too tight for us to enjoy some of the finer things in life, and honestly, I would resent her for that. I feel like her poor life decisions that made my childhood so difficult should not still be impacting me as an adult. Why should I pay for her mistakes just because I have made better choices than her?


I broached the topic with my brother and sister (neither or whom are financially stable) and they say I WBTA because she relies on that money and they can’t afford to help her. My sister also pointed out that if the money wasn't coming from me she would probably do something stupid like get payday loans or get more credit cards or worse, go crawling back to my degenerate father.


So, WIBTA if I stopped giving her money and said “sorry, can’t afford it anymore” even though that’s not technically true?


TL;DR My mother is financially dependent on us to pay her rent due to her poor financial management and now we are going down to one income and moving away. WIBTA if I stopped giving her money?",14,32,0.93
1374,No A-holes here,"I wanted to keep this short but a lot of background is involved.

I have a group of friends, all 25-30, and although I'm one of the newest ones, I've known them for roughly 7-ish years and was added in through my husband. Last year, to offset the cost of Christmas, we decided to do a secret Santa instead. No budget, just one person to focus on, and gift exchange to happen during our annual Christmas party.

Last year, K picked me. She got me one of those draw prompts book, a set of pencils, and a necklace and earring set from Target. I cannot wear the Target set because 1. my ears aren't pierced, and 2. my skin turns green in prolonged contacts with fake metal. Both are not new news, and could easily be verified with my husband and several others in friend group. Didn't bother me though, even if I already had the draw prompts book and the only new thing was the color pencils. I adored the gifts, expressed sincere gratitude, carried on.

This year, I got K, and K gets L who is the newest in the friend group at 3-ish years. 

I want to go all out for K, to match my gift to another friend last year. I just thought it would be the fair thing to do. While taking with K and another friend P, K mentioned what she was getting L: an expensive personlized gift and several hobby-specific gifts.

And honestly, I was a bit disappointed. She was putting so much effort for L, even asking another friend who was closer to L for gift ideas/confirmation.

I didn't bring it up with them but asked my husband, who K is close to, if she had asked him about gifts for me last year. I already knew she didn't, first thing he would mention was my metal allergy, but when he confirmed it, I was a bit shattered.

I've always struggled to connect with people, but I thought I was meshing with this group, it just made it feel like I got thoughtless gifts.  It's never about the price of the gift, it's about the effort put into it.

So, to the actual question, would it be the asshole if I matched K's gift to me last year by not giving her all the gifts I planned on? Among the things I already got her, is an expensive thing that is particular to a hobby we share. No one but my husband knows I got it for her and he encouraged me to just keep it if it's what i want to do.  I just feel petty and shitty all over.",40,70,0.92
1375,Asshole,"So I get that I could be the massive asshole here. My mom and sis certainly think I am. So just curious. 

This happened a few weeks ago but still feels slightly raw. Anyways, roughly a year ago I had an abortion (voluntary) after trying to get pregnant for over a year. My husband and I had always wanted to have kids but we had difficulties so when I first got pregnant it was like the skies opened up. We had a really blissful few weeks doing baby shopping and name brainstorming.

Unfortunately in the few weeks following the good news my mental health began to deteriorate. I had bad panic attacks and constant anxiety and after a long period of thinking I realized I couldn’t stay pregnant and have the baby. I don’t want to go into all of my reasons here but my decision was made and my pregnancy was soon terminated. 

This caused a huge rift between me and my husband. He couldn’t understand why I did what I did because it was impossible for me to verbalize my feelings at the time and in return I resented him for not being there fully for me when I needed him the most in recovery. We made it past  that time and now we’re ok. Until a few weeks ago when his sister called me saying he’s been crying at work (they work together at a family business). 

I go pick him up and he’s just inconsolable. I ask him what’s wrong and he says it’s the anniversary of my abortion and what would have been the baby’s first few months or something. I tell him it’s disturbing to me that he’s kept track and that I don’t want to talk about it because it’s brought up bad memories of our fight at that time. 

We then have an argument where I tell him I feel like he cares more about that nonexistent baby than about my actual physical health (which was iffy after my abortion) and he goes quiet. I tell him I never want to hear about the abortion or the “baby” ever again and he stays quiet. I admit I went on a little rant in the car and raised my voice but I felt like he couldn’t care less about my health, only about this hypothetical child. It made me fearful that he only wants me for the babies I’d give him one day and that fear made me really angry and lash out. 

I told my mom and sis about this incident afterwards and they really ripped me a new one. They think I crossed a line by yelling at him after he had just cried. I’m not going to defend my actions but I do feel like him keeping track of the date was a strange, passive aggressive attack on me almost. AITA?

Edit: the reason I lashed out is because I couldn’t believe he was dragging my abortion out in the open when he knew how upsetting the initial episode was for both of us. It felt like he was trying to make a point by reminding me of that time and trying to make me feel guilty for the abortion a whole year later. I get that he’s mourning but at the end of the day the baby never existed whereas his real, living wife was hurting and still hurts from the memories of that time. It just feels like he’s pedestaling the baby for no reason and it’s an extra kick in the gut because the baby doesn’t even exist and I do. /rant

Edit2: it was an upsetting time because I felt like he left me when I needed him the most. Again, I know that he was mourning but I felt betrayed too. After the abortion I was suffering mentally and physically, and while he was by my side physically he was withdrawn emotionally. I felt like I was drowning and I could see in his eyes that he was just upset he lost the pregnancy. That’s where my resentment comes from but we’ve had therapy since then which is why I felt like we’ve finally forgiven and moved on. But seeing him talk about the baby a year from then just reminded me of how he left me fighting for myself. And how he couldn’t even remember to bring up MY pain during that time, just the baby. I get that he wanted his baby, but I’m not a human incubator to provide him with children. But that’s how I felt in that moment.",216,77,0.7

Or at least, I assumed we were both fine with it.

Now that graduation's coming up, he keeps talking about cancelling my lease on my current apartment and the one on his since the chances of him being stationed anywhere near here is low and he wants to make plans to move to wherever it is right away. I told him, rather bluntly, that I wasn't comfortable moving since I have a full-time job I've been with since I was 22 (I'm 28 now) and three cats, one of which has a lot of mental trauma and doesn't like being in cages or carriers too long.

I've been talking about it with my mother to some small degree but not too heavily in order to not have her influence my decision, but now his family's been hinting at me moving out to wherever in the state with him and how I need to do things like learn how to drive and how I'd have to learn how to cook and clean while he's at work, which is only pushing me further and further away from the idea of moving to another city with him since it sounds like they're expecting me to become the girlfriend equivalent of a housewife. His dad's been the most blunt/forward in telling me that I need to make the move for him and it's getting on my nerves since no one in his family seems to be considering both sides like I've been trying to.

Like on one hand, I completely understand why he'd want to move me with him since we've been together for a few years and this ST thing is going to be his career and it's only 18 months, but on the other hand - I also don't want to just say yes for the sake of saying it for him since I don't have the same job security. We'd both be at a loss family and friend-wise so that's not something I'm weighing in here, but I love my job and I don't want to up and leave it for 18 months just to possibly end up back here in the future so I'm at a standstill.

We're supposed to have another talk about it this weekend coming up so I just want to know if ITA here.

&#x200B;

TL;DR : boyfriend wants me to move to a new city with him for his job but I don't know how to say no so now I'm stuck thinking about it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Edit because I'm an idiot and at work but I promise I'll reply to things during my lunch break or after work later: I know how to drive, cook and clean aka the ""*adult basics.*"" I'm assuming his family's just throwing me a good dose of misogyny by assuming I need to go out there to do those things for him since he'll be the one with a job while I look for one, if I decide to go. Hopefully that clears up any poor reasoning on my end, but if not - I can certainly clarify better later! I just felt like I needed to post this now since I got a text from him last night about it after he spent the weekend with his dad again.


******Edit 2: Thank you all so much for the replies! I’ve read every one of them and I appreciate them all. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a bit but we’ve never discussed marriage or living together at any point before this so hence my apprehension with dropping my entire life to move somewhere new with someone I’ve never lived with personally. We had a few bumps for a few years that kept us off the topic but this recent conversation hasn’t sparked it and, as people keep saying, no ring - no bring! Thanks again and I truly appreciate all the kind and upfront responses. I’d rather not force myself to move cross-state for someone I’ve never even dreamed about marrying. It seems very silly as an adult but when it’s the one, I’m sure I’ll know. Thank you, kind redditors! ❤️",84,193,0.93
1378,Not the A-hole,"I have a 7 year old son who, like most kids, loves the iPad. We do our best to limit screen time—no tv during the week and ipad is for games only, no YouTube or Netflix. 


Originally, we would just give it to him and set a time limit. As long as he had been outside or done some physical activity, he could have 20-30 minutes of iPad time. 


Over time he took advantage of that and would beg for more and more iPad time and then act out when we said no. 


So we said no iPad during the week, weekends only now. We told our nanny about this rule and she said ok, no problem.


Now she’s asking if he can have 10-15 minutes of iPad time in the morning on the condition he gets ready for school on time. She said that they’ve been late to school twice since I took the iPad away and he’s been throwing fits to get it back while she’s there. 



I told her no, I’d really like to stick to the weekend only rule and he shouldn’t be on it in the morning anyway. AITA for this? I feel bad that it makes their morning more difficult but I think it’s better for everyone in the long run if he knows that the weekend only rule is firm. She only works for us 3 days a week so I don’t want him to think he can just get away with breaking the rules because our nanny is here. 



I also don’t want to give him the impression that he can throw fits and act out just to get his iPad back even though we already implemented the rule.",42,33,0.87
1379,Not the A-hole,"Okay, from the title alone it should be obvious, however, the manner of which it happened and what it cost me has bothered me for ten years. So now I want a second opinion. My account is an alt, just for full clarity.

&#x200B;

Alright, so quick backstory - I had a friend that I was very close with. We had lived together, we partied together, we laughed and cried together. You get the idea. Never a best friend, but fairly close to that status. We were both 18 at this point and obviously an unhealthy amount of time was spent boozing and partying.

&#x200B;

We started falling out of touch and to remedy this we agreed to invite each other to our non-mutual friends parties - this is where I met the couple this story is about. They were 17-18 years old, bit white trashy from a rough neighborhood and most importantly had a (I believe) 1 year old child together. 

I most admit I wasn't too keen on them first, but the guy actually turned out to be half decent - the girl however was trouble. The first time me and her were alone in the livingroom she made some comments that I at the time believed was in jest, comments about my appearance and how it must be to have sex with me. 

I was uncomfortable but didn't think much of it since she had been pretty open about sex the entire evening, I thought it was just her personality.

&#x200B;

The second time I met them was at a proper party - loads of people around. Plenty of alcohol was drunk by all, and the night seemed uneventful till she pulled me to the side and said something along the lines of ""you know, I don't work, that means I'm home alone all day - you can come by anytime you want and we can have some fun"". At this point my drunken mind had already accepted the role of a snitch, so I made her clarify that by fun she meant sex and after she confirmed I beelined it straight over to the boyfriend, pulled him to the side and explained the situation.

&#x200B;

This is where things went out of hand - he went mental. Started screaming bloody murder at her, and needless to say the party was over. Me and my friend grabbed our stuff and left, but he was oddly cold towards me and after trying to get him to talk he finally snapped at me and claimed I had made a scene and made him lose some of the only friends he had besides me. 

He said I should have kept it to myself and turned it over with him first before acting. I responded that my intention wasn't to create a scene but to help another guy out and that I'd do the same for him in the situation. He then brought up the kid and how I had ruined its life - at this point I got mad and basically left him there.

Haven't talked to him since. Ten years. I really was only trying to do what I thought was right - so, AITA?",32,38,0.86
1380,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input and suggestions. I really appreciate everyone’s perspective. Many people suggested I use my cousin’s name as a new middle name. I should have mentioned this in the post, but I wasn’t originally planning on changing my middle name because my current middle name was her middle name as well. As in, we have the same first, middle, and last names. Nevertheless, I will suggest this to my family and hopefully we will be able to come to some compromise because I really do understand how devastating losing my cousin was for everyone in my family and I don’t want to cause more pain, but I would also like to be able to have control over my own name. Again, thanks all!
... 

My family is pretty big on passing on names in general, so most people in my family are named after someone else in the family, though usually it’s a great-grandparent or something like that, Anyway, before I was born, my teenage cousin was tragically killed by a drunk driver who struck the car she was riding in with her mother (who survived, thankfully). My family decided that it would be a nice tribute to name me after my cousin so she could “live on” through me. 

It’s not so much the idea I have a problem with, it’s just that I hate the name and I have always hated the name. It’s a very common name and so there’s always like at least three other people with the name in any class, office, or other group setting that I’m in. This bothers me because I hate being compared constantly to other people with my name and I don’t really feel like it fits my personality. It also bothers me since most other people in my family have more unique names and I have always wished I did as well (not anything crazy, I just would prefer something below the top 5 most common). Since I’m about to move to another country, I thought that now would be a good time to change my name and go by something I like better.

Well, my family was not happy to get this news. They were just very upset that I didn’t like my name and said that they would never call me anything but my current name. They also brought up my cousin and said how meaningful my name is and how it would be disrespectful to my cousin and her mother if I were to change the name because it would feel like we were forgetting about her as a family. They said that if I changed my name, her name would “die out” and her legacy would be gone. What surprised me most is that my best friend agreed, and said I should just keep the name because it’s not a bad name. I think my family expects me to feel some great loss or grief for my cousin, but while it’s sad that she died, I didn’t know her, so honestly I don’t feel a huge emotional connection. While I do think I should have the right to change my name and my family ought to respect my decision by calling me my preferred name,  I also do feel genuinely bad sometimes for not wanting to keep my dead cousin’s name and for not feeling the grief that I feel like I should feel. 

TL;DR I was named after my cousin who died tragically, but I hate the name. My family thinks it would be disrespectful to change it, but I want to. AITA?",64,250,0.93

1383,Not the A-hole," Throwaway acc as my boyfriend uses reddit!! I (F23) got a really nice laptop as a grad present from my boyfriend (m25) last year. I'm not big into tech so the most this laptop gets used for is Netflix and reddit. Fast forward to two months ago my boyfriends really high tech laptop died and he wasn't even phased just said its all good I still have yours and without hesitation set up all his work stuff on it and logged me out of everything. I thought this would be temporary until he got a new one as he would get the cost subsidized by work but he has no intentions of doing so. I asked him for it back as i was going on a trip and would like to use it while away. He got really bothered and told me netflix is on my phone and that he needs it for work. So reddit, AITA for wanting to use my own laptop even if i dont fully appreciate the tech? Im just confused as it was a gift and I feel like i cant be annoyed over him claiming it?



EDIT: I spoke to him last night about it and explained how I felt guilty for feeling like I couldnt ask for it back and how it feels now like he bought himself a gift and I got to look after it for a while, he was apologetic and we agreed best thing to do would be to get me a much more basic laptop for what I'll actually use it for and he can use the better one for work - I did feel very guilty for having such a good laptop and it not being used fully! I'm going away friday so we'll go get a new one tomorrow.

1385,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a couple weeks ago, and I'm still bitter about it. Some background, I'm a high school sophomore, and this was in my elective ceramics class. It was also National Unity Day. Due to cause and effect I'm kind of suspended now for it, although the suspension is not entirely related to my not wanting to work with them. 

So in my ceramics class, it's a community studio. Everyone helps out with cleaning up and keeping things maintained. That day it was my turn to reconstitute the old clay (taking the harder clay, ripping it up into small pieces, and filling the bag with water the make the clay softer again) and she wanted me to work with the special ed kids. (I'm not really sure what to call them, because I got yelled at for using the term ""special ed,"" but it's the only one I know, forgive my incompetence.) I don't have anything against them, they're actually pretty nice, but they (edit: the ones in my class) don't know person space. I've caught them touching my stuff without permission, picking them up, they've even touched the things I'm wearing (I painted a duck on my hat, and they were touching it without asking while it was on my head). I also have issues with people getting into my space from childhood trauma and the fact that I was in a homeless shelter until recently and a lot of my stuff was stolen in there. The space my teacher (T) wanted me to work with was also a small, secluded section of the classroom with not much room to walk around in. (Edit: this space is hard for me to walk around in with one other person, let alone four others.) 

So I quietly drew T aside and told her I was too uncomfortable to work with them due to my personal space issues. She took offense. She told me she was disappointed in me, and that if I say anything more I'll be on her ""radar.""

Now I actually liked T, and I didn't want her to think badly of me, so I emailed her later that night trying to explain the situation. But now I regret emailing her, because she read my words wrong and got the principal involved. Another situation caused by this has made me lose my respect for her, as I think this problem made her lose her logical reasoning towards me. 

AITA for refusing to work with them due to my personal space issues?

Edit: my counselor and school-appointed therapist do know. as does my mom. but as far as I can tell, my counselor agrees with my teacher and the others can't do much in this situation. After all, the punishment's already been dished out, it's not like they can turn back time.

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for supporting me! I wasn't sure if I actually was the asshole or not, because so many people at school kept antagonizing me for it and just making the ( ͠° ͟   ͠°) face at me when I tried to explain things.",49,115,0.91
1386,Not the A-hole,"Background: My father is a proud member of a fishing club and has been for several years. Each member is allowed to invite a guest to their meets twice a year and 'should feel honoured'.  I should mention that in the past there has been plenty of concerns and discussion around younger people not joining and the club is worried about new blood thinning out.

This weekend we sit around the table and discuss why I, his daughter, have never been invited. The simple answer was 'no women allowed'. Allright, but why? The response was a quick 'in the past partners joined and it turned out badly'. This, I understand. Couples that are in a situation that one lets go more than the other could end up in a tiff. Still not answering my question as to why I'm not allowed. 

Sure, I'm a girl. The same girl that rides bikes with those same guys. The same girl that goes fishing with them while the other girls (linked to this group) would rather be doing other things that I don't enjoy.  If they enforce the same grading system that they use for other members before they are accepted, surely my gender should not be an issue. If I can keep up and do what is required, should that not be the focus? Also note, several of the new members don't own a fishing rod and have been accepted to fill the numbers. There is an issue during every meet (nullifying the couples, and they actually mean the women, causing issues.)

The discussion gets cut short by my father shouting at me to let it go and that I should accept things for what they are. I'm a girl and I don't belong.

So, WIBTA if I skip Christmas? It would be the same group of people. Here too, I'd be different. They are very religious and I see myself as more spiritual. Why should the rules be different?

EDIT: to clear things up a bit. My father and other male members of my family who are part of the fishing club are the ones that are quoting the 'no females' rule. The idea was blocked by these members before talking to anyone at the club.  It will be the same members at the family Christmas.",124,156,0.88
1387,Not the A-hole,"So, on Reddit I disclose pretty often when it's relevant to a conversation, that I am Chinese & Filipino. In person, I will discuss it with Asians if it comes up, but when (almost always) white people try to figure out what ethnicity I am, I don't answer.

It started because these questions inevitably come in two rude forms: ""Where are you from?"" (I was born and raised in New York! ""But where are you REALLY from?"" Manhattan!) and ""What are you?"" (Human being!). If a friend or coworker gets to know me it obviously eventually comes up naturally, so it's not like I'm keeping my ethnicity a secret, but now I just decline to answer. I've discussed this with other non-white friends and we all basically agree with the Hari Kondabalu bit where he says that this question really means, 'Why aren't you white?'

Recently, I had a really awkward moment with a friend's husband where he asked me where I was from and he became really annoyed and offended that I wouldn't answer or was 'playing games' (because I answered where I was from with the cross streets in Manhattan where I grew up). His wife later told me that I should just answer people.",1205,1753,0.91
1388,Not the A-hole,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway to post this I hope I can get some honest opinions here. I'm a 26 year old female with a 25 year old boyfriend. We've been dating for 4 years and live together. Especially the last few months we talked about if we would want kids, but would want to marry before that, how that 'hypothetically' would look like.

Why that matters? Last Friday night we had a nice meal at the restaurant we went for our first date. Suddenly he started to say he had something important to tell me, he got all stutter-y and I got so confused! That's when a waiter spilled a drink on a woman and she did NOT take it well, she started to make a big scene. This caused him to be even more nervous just for him to say ""I think I left the car unlocked and thought he heard the alarm."" He checked but nothing.

The next day I decided to do some laundry, I was emptying the pockets from clothes he wore last night, just to find a small box, instinctively I opened it just to find this absolutely gorgeous ring in it! That's when everything just hit me, he was meant to propose but he hesitated! I felt so happy! I quickly put everything back where it was and asked if he wanted to do the laundry. 

I quickly gushed to my best friend about this, instead of being happy for me she called me selfish, cold and fake to just pretend like I didn't see what I see to him. I just kept telling her it was thoughtful of me not to ruin the moment like that. I thought he could propose to me nicely, and then afterwards we could have a good laugh about it, but now I'm thinking about this more I'm starting to worry I wasn't open enough. AITA here?",41,91,0.92
1389,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year, although this happened about 6 months into our relationship. I don't have any tattoos but she has 6. I have always considered getting 1 but I want it to mean something, so its taken a while to decide on one. I really like her tattoos, and she knew that I wouldn't want to get matching ones with anyone unless I was married or best friends with them. 

Now for me. I love to hike and I have since I was 13. Due to this, I have traveled to Colorado each year for the past 5 years climb mountains that are over 14,000ft in elevation. Since this is basically my only true hobby, I have always thought that if I got a tattoo it would relate to mountains or hiking.

So, my idea was to get a band on my arm that would be a custom mountain range that I would make by taking the outlines of photos of the peaks I've climbed and combining them into a strip. I really liked this idea and and I told my girlfriend just to get her opinion on it.

About a month later, she tells me that she is getting a new tattoo but won't tell me what it is. She always designs her own and is very good, but she wouldn't let me even see her sketches. She tells me what day she is getting it so I can be there. We are in college together, and it slips my mind until the day arrives. 

When I walk in, she is already sitting in the chair, and her artist is pressing stencil paper into her arm to start. My heart sinks when I notice that it is in an outline of a mountain range in the shape of a band around her arm. 

She asks me if I am surprised and I don't say much. She then asks me if I'm ok and I ask if she copied my idea for my tattoo. She told me that she liked the idea so much that she wanted something similar, but she just freehanded her own range instead of fully copying me. She also got a quote there, so she said that hers would be different compared to mine. I was still upset because I didn't want to end up having a near matching tattoo with my girlfriend of 5 months, and I knew that she hadn't done much hiking at all either. She ended up noticing me and asked if she shouldn't get it. I knew she wanted it, but before I could even answer the artist started on it. He had already been paid a nonrefundable deposit so it makes sense, but I had to fight back tears at this point. 

We had some issues after this for about a week. I didn't even want to talk to her or look at the tattoo. Eventually, I became more ok with it and found it attractive, but I still can't help but feel like I can never get what I wanted. I actually managed to get her to go with me to CO this year for her first peak, which justifies the tattoo a bit more, but it still doesn't feel right.

AITA? Part of me thinks that I have the right to be upset since she took part of my idea, but another part of me thinks that I shouldn't be upset when she thought she was being thoughtful and that I'm holding a grudge for too long. I think about this often and I'm torn inside.

Edit: thanks for all of the comments so far, keep them coming if you like! I'm reading all of them and I'm focusing on replying to the ones that are mostly going against the grain of most of the other comments for now. 

Just a little bit of clarifying information here though. I'm aware that my tattoo idea wasn't original to just me, however my hangup is with the idea of having a matching tattoo with a  SO that I haven't been in a relationship with for a long time. She got her tattoo 5 months into us dating and knowing how I felt about matching tattoos, so that's the crux of why I made the post. 

Also some people are calling me TA because I'm trying to control what she puts on her body. I'm not trying to do this, I never told her she couldn't do what she did, I'm just seeing if it is reasonable for me to be upset about it while also still accepting it. 

Thanks everyone! Keep commenting if you like, I'll be trying to reply to everyone so wish me luck lol.

Edit 2: funnily enough, many people are focusing on the part where I said I was holding back tears. I wasn't crying or anything here, I was just upset, surprised, and confused and I got that feeling of a lump in the back of my throat. So, I'd say that getting choked up would be a better phrase than holding back tears. I wasn't on the verge of bawling my eyes out or anything, I was just taken aback rather suddenly and was trying to suppress some of what I was feeling since we were in a public place with the artist right next to us. 

Also, for the people insulting me for getting even slightly emotional over something I care about, I'm getting a pretty good laugh out of your comments so thanks for changing things up a bit every now and then lol.",487,2652,0.97

1392,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago but it's been on my mind a bit recently.

I usually make a habit of giving at least *something* to homeless people I walk past. If there's a Tesco's nearby I'll go in and get them a sandwich and a drink. If not, I'll just give them £2 or so, as long as I have change in my wallet. 

In this particular encounter I was out late downtown one night when I was approached by a homeless guy asking for change. To be 100% honest I was kind of uncomfortable as there weren't many people around and it was dark, but I figured I shouldn't judge him. I took out my wallet and opened it, taking out a £2 coin. However, it was at this point that the homeless guy saw a £10 note in my wallet, and asked ""Actually, can I have that tenner?""

Something about the situation rubbed me the wrong way. I felt kind of... I dunno. Violated is a strong word. Maybe intruded upon? I decided to put the £2 back in my wallet and keep walking.

""Where are you going?"" He asked.

""Home."" I answered.

""But you were going to give me something!""

""Yeah, I was.""

He proceeded to follow me down the road for about twenty metres, walking backwards in front of me, repeating variations of ""Don't be a cunt"" and ""be cool"". Eventually when he realised I wasn't going to give him anything he stopped and shouted abuse until I was out of sight.

1395,Not the A-hole,"Last year I was still living abroad. I had lived there for a few years, after moving there for a job. I started dating a woman, and after a few months of being together, she informed me she was pregnant.  
  
This was a huge shock, as we had already discussed our future and if having children would be a part of it, and both of us had agreed that we would never have kids. She was on the pill, and after a couple of months, I stopped using condoms as she had no STD's (and neither do I), and I fully trusted that she would use birth control. She even said that IF she got pregnant, she would have an abortion.  
  
So when she announced her pregnancy, I figured that the pill had failed, and she'd have an abortion. Sucks, but I'd support her obviously. HOWEVER, she confessed that she did want a child, and hoped that her being pregnant would also change my mind. She had stopped taking the pill, which I hadn't noticed, and also said she wouldn't get an abortion.  
  
I ended the relationship immediately. A few months later, she had the baby, and I told her she'd have full custody (I did insist on DNA tests, and they unfortunately confirmed that the boy was mine). She kept asking me to meet the boy, but I never did. I was ordered to pay child support, which I did, until I moved back to my home country.  
  
The country she lives, and the country I live in now, don't have an agreement regarding child support payments between individuals living in these separate countries. So, I stopped paying her. I have no plans whatsoever to ever visit that country again.  
  
Now, regarding the child's and his mother's financial position, it's decent enough that she can afford to raise him on her own, in a good apartment/neighborhood and all that.

Well, I have this cousin that I meet once a month at our monthly family gatherings. He have asked me how much I make in front of the entire family about 5 times now on different occasions. He works in the steel business and have problems making ends meet and usually talks about this. I don’t like him and I have never liked him since we were kids. Well, however I work in real estate and I have been fortunate enough to make a fair amount of money. So the last time he asked I cracked and told him flat out how much money I made last year (high 6 figures). I was about to start ranting if he is happy now etc but my wife stopped me.

Well here is the problem, our family is very close and now somehow people seem to think I should pitch in and help him with money so he can keep his apartment. I don’t want to do that, when I refused I got called capitalist swine and all these other things by other family members. 

My wife thinks I should help him keep his apartment to not make family gatherings awkward in the future. 

Should I do this? Am I an asshole if I don’t give him jack shit?

1398,No A-holes here,"My son is in 4th grade and has been invited to a classmate's birthday party for next weekend.  When he brought home the invitation,  he asked me to RSVP ""no"".  I asked him if he was sure/disliked the boy (as I have never heard mention of him). He said that he doesn't really know him, but that the kid is ""very bossy"" in classes. 

Fine by me. I was always taught that not everyone is going to like you, and you aren't going to like everyone. So long as one is polite/civil that is okay. 

I am friends with a mother of a student at my son's school (our kids are 3 yrs apart, and we did not meet through them). She asked me if I was making my son go to the first boy's party,  as she had heard that no one has RSVP'ed ""yes"" yet. Turns out that her older child is friends with the bday boy's older siblings. I told her, no, as my son did not want to. She says, that she knows the boy and he is ""brat"", but he still shouldn't be alone on his birthday.  

I don't now my child's classmate, but as long as there is no bullying (by or towards my son), I think he is old enough to choose his friends. Am I the asshole for not forcing him to go?",262,1506,0.97

1404,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account sorry!

Basically my husband and I have been married about six years, and have a 3 year old daughter, Elle. 

Prior to getting married and having Elle, we were both very independent people. This hasn’t changed - as much as we value our couple/family time, we also both cherish time to ourselves and with our own friends.

We came up with an agreement that we each get ONE weekend a year to do whatever we like - go away, stay in a hotel, go out with friends - while the other stays home looking after Elle. It’s been working really well so far.

Well this past weekend was my husbands time and he chose a fishing trip with his pals, staying in a cabin roughly 30 mins away. No problems.

Saturday morning, the worst happened - my sister was involved in a serious car wreck. She’s on life support, it’s touch and go and I’m devastated. I can’t say much more.

I called my husband to tell him and ask he come home ASAP - and he refused. He said it’s his weekend, and he’ll come by the hospital Monday. He wasn’t totally heartless, he listened to me cry and scream and reassured me she’d be ok (how do we know that?) but he was adamant that he’s enjoying the remainder of his weekend and will join me today. 

My family are obviously noticing his absence and I’m too embarrassed to tell them. I understand this is interfering with his weekend but this is my SISTER and she’s in critical condition. I’m stunned, he’s never been this selfish before. I’m angry, upset, confused and I just don’t know what to do.

I told him if he didn’t come home now, don’t bother coming home at all - now I’m wondering if I was too harsh because I haven’t slept in two days and I’m a wreck.

AITA?

Edit: wow I didn’t think this would attract any attention, especially this early. Thank you all for the healing thoughts and well wishes!

I just want to clarify re: this weekend arrangement - my husband and I regularly have date nights and nights out with friends throughout the year. This “totally alone do what you like YOLO weekend” is the thing that happens once per year. He sees his friends on a weekly basis, as do I.

Update 2: Seriously never expected this many replies, I’m so touched by your kind words. Thank you, so much. It’s horrifying to me that strangers on the internet offered me more support than my husband.

Apologies for not updating sooner, been at the hospital all day and not checking my phone. Mostly because I don’t want to speak to him.

My sisters still in the same condition, not breathing on her own yet. Waiting for some test results.

To answer some questions: thankfully Elle is with my best friend. I didn’t want her exposed to a hospital ICU and around panicked/highly emotional family, so she’s happily having a sleepover with her “other auntie.” 

I realized I made it sound like my husband and I ONLY get one weekend per year which is my fault. This one weekend (we call YOLO weekend) is on top of weekly nights out, time with friends, time alone etc. it’s more of like a chance for us to do things further afield or go nuts without having to worry about waking up early with Elle. Trust me, he sees his friends all the time. That’s what hurts the most.

I’ve read your comments about an affair and I don’t know, it doesn’t seem likely but who the fuck knows at this point. He’s not the person I thought he was.

He did show up this afternoon. I met him in the lobby, told him to go fuck himself, and went back up to the ICU. I don’t want him here. I’m still running on no sleep so I’m probably being an asshole now, but I hate his guts at the moment.

That’s all for now, thank you all so much again <3

1407,Not the A-hole,"Divorced 12 years. My ex-wife passed three years ago and my son was her ""favorite child"". We had two sons and a daughter. It was something like 90% went to my son and 5% to my other children.

I want to set up my will to counteract this: give that son very little and my other children the lion's share. It won't equal out as my ex-wife had a larger estate than I will likely have when I pass. To give maybe an idea: when I pass, son #1 would have received around $400,000, son #2 around $150,000 and daughter around $150,000. That's with me leaving my first son a token amount of little significance.

I'll admit part of it does fall into how our separation happened. Son #1 favored his mother and the other two favored me. It shouldn't have been about ""picking sides"" but that's what happened.

WIBTA for this?

edit: just to clarify:

Ex-wife gave son #1 90% of the will, son #2 5% and daughter 5%

I will give son #1 5%, son #2 47.5% and daughter 47.5%

I'm not favoring any child.

1411,Not the A-hole,"About a week or two ago I was able to trade my android phone in for an iphone. I thought why not, never had one before. I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. 

I got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. 

So a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end.

However, my mom basically forced me to tell the housing office to move my brother and I together or she would stop paying my tuition.

1414,Not the A-hole,"So first some backstory. Me and my girlfriend of a year are both college students. We both have good jobs but I’m already working in my field make about 70k a year while she is making about half that. A few months ago I bought an RV and worked on it to my liking. New furniture, solar panels and a bunch of other stuff. In total I spent 40k, and payed upfront so paying back a loan is not an issue (I have been saving for 2 and a half years) me and my girlfriend moved into it right away, because our at the time separate apartments lease had ended. So this is a nice, and roomy c class, with full everything like stove, shower, WiFi. Pretty much everything but washing machine and dryer. So overall it’s a great deal.

Last month I asked my girlfriend if she could help me by paying me $100 a month as “rent” for bills like insurance, parking, gas, and upkeep. This is definitely less then half of the price it costs me to keep stuff running. (We also share all other bills like food and dog costs BTW) she said she does not believe she should have to pay because it is my RV, and I invited her to stay there. I disagree. But we did agree that we should go to the courts of public opinion to see who is right on a new unused account. (She is looming over my shoulder right now, to make sure everything is right.) so please help us to see who is the asshole in this situation, or if 100 is to little or to much.

I personally just dont like dogs and dont want to be responsible for anything other then myself which no matter what we all know will happen occasionally when there's a pet in the home. I have expressed all of these feelings multiple times to my roommate including saying no when asked to watch said dog when they go out etc etc reminding them hey i didnt want it either put it in the kennel or know that its going to chew stuff. Anyways recently the owner thought that said dog was ready to be left out on their own merely a week after it chewed up our couch and just asked that I let it out on my day off. Obviously small things like opening and closing a door I dont mind, it's playing with the animal or watching it constantly that I will not do. Yeah I know it sounds bad but I'm not and have told them I will not be responsible for the dog in any capacity. 


Anyways the dog ended up getting into the trash while I showered spilling it everywhere and then having a crazy amount of diarrhea all over our carpet. Im talking multiple puddles all of decent size and disgustingness. Now, if I had cleaned up it likely would not have stained. But as previously stated I am not responsible for said animal, so I put the dog outside shut the door and went to my room to watch a movie after texting the roommate the dog had diarrhea. Fast forward an hour roommate gets home and freaks out after seeing it all. I calmly remind them that I promised and clearly stated I will never clean up or take care of the dog in any capacity. Roommate had to rent a carpet cleaner and buy fluid roughly $30 and is now asking that I reimburse them stating since I didnt clean it it stained. I expressely said no and that that was the end of the conversation.

I was curious to know what the actual gift he got me was so I asked for a hint. He said it involved elephants. I asked if it was an elephant ring and he stayed quiet cause I figured it out. He knows their one of my favorite animals and knowing what the gift was doesn't ruin the surprise for me.

He proceeded to talk about the game and showed me some gameplay of it. It looked pretty cool although neither of us have a NES to play it on.

My older brother Adam has always been super close to Olivia and is protective of her. Her and I are also close, as one of Olivia’s older brothers, but I’m less close with Adam. 

I’ve suffered from substance abuse issues for the past few years. As of right now, I’m a month clean. 

Olivia’s 17th birthday was this past weekend. I knew that my family was putting together a small party for her.  I got a call from Adam last Thursday that said I wasn’t “welcome” to Olivia’s party because I’m not trusted enough to not steal her pain killers, or to ruin the party.  He said that I also haven’t been sober long enough to earn that trust. 

I told him that if he doesn’t trust me not to steal my little sister’s pain killers, then he doesn’t need to be around me at all. He said that if I showed up, then there would be problems. 

The thing is, there’s no way I was gonna miss one of Olivia’s birthdays. Every birthday is a gift, and I’m not going to miss it for anything, despite what Adam days.

So yesterday on Saturday, I made my way to my parent’s house for Olivia’s party. I walked in and immediately saw on Adam’s face that he wasn’t happy. I ended up just ignoring him and going to say hi to Olivia. She was excited to see me and gave me a huge hug.

At one point, I went upstairs to pee and on my way back down the stairs, my brother asked me to turn out my pockets. I did, just so he could look like an idiot. He told me that it was “for my own good and because he loved me.”

Olivia got tired not long after this so we all headed out. My parents stopped me as I was leaving and told me that while they are happy that I “seem to be doing well” but that they wished I would have talked to Adam before just showing up as it caused tension over the evening. 

I told them that he had no right to ban me from seeing Olivia and that she was happy to see me. They then said that they understood but to just be more accountable next time. I then just left. 

I really don’t think that I was out of line. Olivia was happy to see me and I suspect that Adam didn’t talk to her about not inviting me. I was never once tempted to steal my sister’s pain killers. But I know the pain I’ve caused my family, so I don’t know.

We kinda grew apart after high school and went to different universities. Though we weren't close anymore, we still call each other occasionally and hanging out over the summer holidays.

Jess started dating Andy during her senior year, and married him a year after she graduated. As for me, I realized I was gay and have only been in romantic relationships with men since.

Years past, and one day, I got a call from Jess. She was crying. She said she just got into a fight with Andy. She asked if she could come over because she didn't feel safe at home.

I freaked out, thinking she was in danger, so I told her to come over to my apartment asap and I'll meet her at the lobby to greet her. I thought that the security at my apartment would keep her safe if her husband was planning to do anything to her.

When she got to my apartment, she was mess. She was crying and everything. I told her she could stay with me while she got things settled down. I had an extra bedroom, that is use as a guest bedroom when my parents are in town.

We ended up hugging on the couch, while she was crying on and off. She suddenly told me how she wished she had reciprocated my feelings before when I confessed my feelings years ago but didn't dare to because she didn't want to ruin our friendship.

I told her honestly that I'll always be her friend. The romantic feelings I had for her had faded a long time ago. I'm now seeing someone, and things between he and I are getting serious. But she is still welcome to stay in the guest bedroom until things settled down.

I was bothered by what had happened that night. I confided in my partner (the same one as above) and he said I was an asshole for letting her stay over. 

He said while he has nothing against it, it's socially inappropriate for a single man to allow married woman to spend the night as his place. What did I expect was going to happen? I could've ruin Jess' marriage with Andy.

1436,Asshole,"Last week, once I'd already had my pajamas on, I got a knock on my dorm room door. It was two RAs there to inform me that they'd gotten a complaint about me, and did I have frogs in my room. I am allergic to lying so I fessed up, had to rehome my precious froggy friends, and got a warning on my record. Based on interactions with the group chat I'm in with other people on my floor, I am 99% sure I know which person snitched on me, and there have been many occasions where their room reeks of weed stink. 

Would I be the asshole if the next time it stunk like pot over in that corner I conveniently let an RA know, or am I just sinking down to their level (or worse, getting them in some serious legal trouble)? It should be noted that I also can't totally confirm that the weed is coming from their room specifically, but the person who I think tattled on me also has been known to act high and smell of jazz cabbage. Also, those frogs really meant a lot to me and having to rehome them was a major kick in the balls. Reddit, do I teach this person that hell hath no fury like a loving-frog-parent scorned?

Edit: this was the text that made me 99% sure.

""I wasn’t here this morning but my roommate woke up to crickets in our room. We literally can’t figure out how they got down here but the only thing that makes sense is they came in through the hall. We clean daily and it would be impossible for us to have bugs any other way. She was going to work and didn’t have time to react and told the RAs. They told her they would “take care of it.” We didn’t mean it as “assuming” anything we just don’t want crickets on our room ya know""

Edit 2: We live in Illinois. Also, I let people near my room know that I had frogs at the beginning of the year, and the RAs directly asked me if I had frogs, so whoever told must have told them that I had frogs specifically.",115,300,0.89

We came up to a house where a kid dressed up as a firefighter is walking down the path toward their parents who were waiting at the sidewalk, and my daughter runs up and says to the kid, ""Trick or treat!!!"" because she thinks anyone taller than her must be giving out candy. I chuckled and said ""Honey no, he's not giving out candy, he's out here trick-or-treating just like you"". As the firefighter walked past me I noticed a ponytail of long blonde hair sticking out the back of their costume and thought maybe I had misgendered them but didn't want to draw more attention to it, so I smiled at the kid and then encouraged my daughter to walk to the door and ask the grown-ups for candy. While I'm watching my daughter approach the house I hear the firefighter's mom yell ""SHE is a GIRL."" as her daughter (firefighter) is trying to lead her down the sidewalk to the next house. I froze, not sure what to do, not wanting to loudly shout an apology back at the mom and her daughter since they were 20 meters away. I momentarily considered approaching them and apologizing up-close, and then the mom yelled again ""You called her a BOY, SHE'S A GIRL!"" while continuing to walk away with her daughter. I felt so awful for that kid, I never meant to cause them any embarrassment, I just made a snap-assumption based off their costume and hair-length. I ended up not approaching them and just continued on down the neighborhood with my daughter in the opposite direction.

I feel like the mom was being a real A-Hole with the way she handled it and that's what kept me from going out of my way to apologize, honestly I was afraid of getting yelled at in front of my kid. But I'm not sure if I did the right thing by ignoring it.",48,56,0.84

I was driving my little brothers girlfriend home around 10pm. We drop her off, start heading home and all is well however we are both quite a bit hungry so I decided to stop at a convenience store on the way home which is where things started to get interesting. We went inside, he picked out what he wanted and went back out to the car while I paid. When I came out there was a woman sitting in the passenger seat of a white sedan talking to him. I approach the car and she goes ""excuse me...do you have a drivers license?""...to which I hesitantly replied ""yeah...why?"". She then proceeds to tell us that her friends and her had gotten into an argument and left her at the gas station, and she didn't have a drivers license so she couldn't take her car home. She then asked me to drive her car home and have my little brother follow. This screamed ""red flag say no"" to me, as I have never met this woman and was not about to get into her car with her, especially alone. I make an excuse, saying ""sorry but we need to get home to let our dog out"" and she goes ""I'm just around the corner it will only take 5 minutes"" to which I firmly said, ""I'm sorry but we cant help"" before getting into the car and driving off, while hearing her shout ""I don't know what else to do!!"". I feel like I did the right thing, for all I know she could have had a gun (very reasonable assumption in this area) and this was her plan to rob people. Also, she looked kind of rough and It didn't seem out of the range of possibility to me that she was using.

Recently, we've discussed trying to make more of an effort to see each other, so we planned a visit around my work schedule, which was posted a week and a half ago. I ran the visit by my manager, telling her what I was going to do on my days off. So, she knows about my plans. I don't get a lot of weeks with 2 days off, especially weeks with 2 consecutive days off in a row. I've also been working a lot of hours recently, and we aren't really properly paid overtime.

So a while ago, I worked as a server for a hibachi restaurant.  We would occasionally get customers that would be rude, but nothing too much.

Anyways, this once day was a Saturday, so it was extremely busy.  We have this one area at the back of the restaurant that we don't use unless it's packed.  It wasn't too packed, as we had a table empty and ready for the next customer. 

Then a group of 5 people come in, they don't even wait, they go to the back room and sit down.  All of the other servers were busy with other tables.  I only knew this because the bartender saw them do so and thought that they had a reservation.

Then the ringleader of this group came out and went to me asking if they could have some menus, rather rudely. I brought them over some menus, thinking that one of the other servers forgot to set up some menus.  

Then about 10 minutes later, the guy came over and angrily told me to take their order(understatement).  I followed him and saw that they were in the back room.

I asked them why they were back there, and they said that they didn't want to sit next to kids or [redacted n-word].

1448,Not the A-hole,"Hello Redditors, 

My grandmother died last Thursday in the hospital after a year-long battle with cancer. The doctors could sense that the was near, so my immediate family all rushed to be by her side during her last moments. 

For a couple of weeks, I had been working on an elaborately decorated Chinese thread book for my grandma that took about 25 hours to complete. I was planning on giving it to my grandmother on Christmas, but tragically, her disease took a turn for the worse very quickly and that was not to be. The cover of the project consisted of an intricate collage with my grandma's name handwritten in calligraphy. The inside of the book contained a number of collapsable boxes with pictures of our family at the bottom of the boxes. My grandma had difficulty speaking due to the progression of her illness, but I could tell that she greatly cherished the present, and she whispered that she wanted to be buried with it.  

The hours after my grandmother passed were an emotional blur, and I don't remember much. But as we were driving home from the hospital, my sister (who I have a strained relationship with) yelled at me that she thought that it was disgusting to show off my artwork when my grandma was dying. She said that as usual, I was trying to push all of the praise and attention on myself instead of focusing on what really matters. My sister is quite a cantankerous individual, and is pretty resentful because my parents prefer my company over hers. I just stayed silent because arguing with my sister is like trying to negotiate with a time bomb.

For context, not sure if relevant in this scenario, I am one race, this person (we'll call them T, for Tinder) is a second race, and the social media comments and posts were made about a third race that neither of us are.

We met online, and after a couple dates we added each other on Facebook. There I saw that T had very strong opinions about a specific race and posted about it pretty often, using words that I consider to be problematic at best, or racial slurs at worst.

I asked T about those points and explained why I didn't think they were appropriate, especially given that T works in mental healthcare and would need to provide equal treatment to all races, especially when they're at their most vulnerable state.

T strongly disagreed, said they meant exactly what they said, and that that race T was targeting is exactly what T said they are, and so we had a falling out. Before I left I told T that given their work position and that the company they work for is clearly listed on their public Facebook page, and given that T insists they aren't ashamed of their position and would stand by it publicly, that I would be forwarding the posts and comments to their company HR if they didn't remove them.

I checked a week later and the posts hadn't been removed, and there were even new ones on the same subject. I took screenshots and forwarded them to T's work. Since then I have learned (from another recent post on T's page) that they were disciplined and then fired because of my email.

1453,Not the A-hole,"Hi folks. Throwaway for reasons. 

TLDR; I got upset with my mil for putting small gold rings on my 3 month old son. My husband said I was a jerk and should apologize. I don’t want to because I feel she disrespected my wishes as a parent and put my son in danger. 

My (25f) husband (27m) and I had our first baby. He’s now 3 months old and my mil has been pestering me to put these little gold bracelets and rings on him. 

They’re Portuguese, and the jewelry has been in their family for a very long time. I guess it’s tradition for each new baby to receive gold. It’s a huge deal to my husband’s mother that my baby wears the jewelry he was gifted (new and the jewelry that had been my husband’s as a child). 

I don’t see any reason for a young baby to be wearing jewelry. 1, because it’s dangerous. 2, it could get lost. 3, he’s 3 months old. 

I told her when she asked why he wasn’t wearing any of it, that I kept it in a box on his dresser because I didn’t want him wearing it yet.  She thinks I’m being disrespectful of their traditions. I’ve been very respectful of their cultures and traditions, my son is named for his paternal grandfather as is customary and he was baptized in the Portuguese church (despite the fact that I am not religious).

Anyway, I had my mil watching him for a few hours while I ran some errands and when I got home, she had put a few rings on his fingers. I lost it. I realized I shouldn’t have, but I told her “how many times have I said he’s not wearing those? It’s dangerous, he sticks his fingers in his mouth and he could choke. You’re not watching him by yourself again.”

She started to cry and left after yelling at me in Portuguese. I have no idea what she said. My husband came home and told me I shouldn’t have been such an ass to her, and that I should apologize. I don’t want to apologize because I feel that my wishes should be respected and she put my child in danger.

He will basically complain until the whole family has to stop and we just go find a McDonald’s or something that has wifi we can use. 

I’ve expressed my opinions to my mom and she feels the same way. However my brother is autistic and he has a lot of social issues. He has trouble expressing his emotions so if something ever goes wrong when we’re out he gets really angry and will cause a scene. He also doesn’t have any friends.

1456,Not the A-hole,"I (24F) work in a cafe, and although we pay for food, employees can have as many free coffees that they want on shift. We open early so this is great in the mornings.

A few months ago, we employed a new worker (17M) who works a few hours over the weekend. He's settled in and can work without help but sometimes needs a little guidance. For example, if the shop is quiet then he'll stand there twiddling his tumbs at the till, while there is stuff that needs cleaning. We'll suggest something for him to do, and he'll do it then go back to standing at the till and waiting. Other times, when we're busy and have a queue, he'll leave to go to the toilet for 5 minutes or to go do something else out back, leaving one of us to handle a queue of 10 customers. He'll come back if we ask, but it happens multiple times a shift. We understand its his first job and might not understand how it works, so we try not to get frustrated.

He takes full advantage of the free coffee and usually has about 5 or 6 per shift. This isn't an issue, and our only rule regarding it is to drink the coffees out back, not in the front of the cafe and never in front of costumers. However, he always keeps his drink next to the tills. Myself or the manager will leave it on the table in the back, but he will go and bring it back to the front after a few minutes. He knows the rules, we often remind him, but he does it regardless.

Today, as we were both serving customers, I kept seeing him take sips of his coffee whilst serving the customers, which is a huge no no. I asked him quietly not to do it, but he continued to. Eventually, I took his coffee and poured it down the sink. I thought it wouldn't matter too much as it was free, he can get another, and he has been warned multiple times by myself and the managers. 

When we quietened down, he went out back, then came back asking where his coffee was. I told him I poured it away as he was continuously drinking it whilst serving and he could make himself another as long as it was kept out back, otherwise I'd throw it away as well. He wasn't happy, calling me an asshole, that it wasn't a big deal. He went to the manager on shift but she said it was something to sort out ourselves, as she thinks throwing away the drink was too harsh but the kid had been warned multiple times.

There was a guy, lets call him Michael, who really hated me since the moment we met. He hated me for being a pussy, a crybaby, being ugly etc and we had numerous fights throughout school days. 

I am gay and came out at 15, but I have the sort of personality that most people had figured it out already. The place I grew up in wasn't exactly gay friendly (deprived working class area in the north of England) so this made everything 100x worse. My parents and the few friends I did have were really supportive though. 

I was thankful to leave school and moved away from there a few years later. Out of the blue yesterday I got a facebook message from Michael asking for my help. I looked at his profile. He's an absolute muscle monster of a man now and according to a quick google search is also a semi-pro boxer. 

Michael told me that he has always struggled with his sexuality, and that he lost his relationship after admitting to himself and his girlfriend that he was gay. He said he doesn't know what to tell his parents or friends, and wants my help because I'm the only gay person he knows. 

I took a long time to think about it. In a way, if he bullied me for being gay because he was gay himself then I would sympathise a tiny bit, but the fact is Michael bullied me years before I came out, simply because I was a ''girly'' boy. Why should I help him out after everything he put me through.

The rest of the guys vary in the listing but are usually in the top 3 with one or two girls sometimes in the mix at the end of each month. Now since I'm the top performer and a large part of our compensation is based on commission I have been making more than all of them every month and most months the guys make more than the girls in commish. We recently had a meeting with our sales manager and the young women chimed in that theres a gender wage gap in our team/office because the men are always making more and sometimes a lot more. He tried to explain that it was because of commission and that we're all on the same base salary, which they know. But they were kinda ranting about how they should be given a larger % of the commissions they make so that when they do make a ""sale"" it would more or equal us and that would be fair as it would lessen the wage gap. Our sales manager let out a huge sigh and excused himself from the room. A few seconds of awkwardness ensued and I faked like I had a call coming through and got the fuck out of there since it was a friday and I just ran out of the building and ran home. 

 I met up with a friend for dinner later on friday and told her about this scenario telling her how it was crazy to me because there is no wage gap, I just make more ""sales"" so I make more money thats how it works. She said that I'm an ass for not listening to their concerns and to her (She has her masters in HR) it does sound like a gender pay gap and the young womens compromise seemed fair.

1461,No A-holes here," I (M20) and my boyfriend (M19) have been together for about a year and four months, we're in a long distance relationship as we're both at different universities. At the beginning, he was completely closeted. About 8 months in he attempted to come out to his mother who is protestant. She quite promptly shut him down and told him to promise her that he'd stop seeing me, that she'd start praying for him and that she'd read about mother's 'correcting' their son's before?... *I know right.* He's from Northern Ireland.

Fast forward to June/July 2019 he's came out to some of his friends, again great, I've now met some of them. This is progress, I'm extremely happy and proud of him. Now to present day he currently has one of his friends over from home - in this time we might as well be single. We can't call each other, merely text and he has to try and avoid me.

I understand that coming out is hard, I've had to do it. But his reasoning is that he'll be broke without their financial support, he's mentioned they give him \~£100p/m for groceries etc - they don't fund his entire life. He says that he has to wait until he's self sufficient before coming out which I understand. He graduates in 2023 and this is when he's going to think about telling his family. By this time we'll have been together for 5 years - he's told me that if it's not taken well, it could be the end for us.

By no means do I want his family to disown him or do I want him to be broke but in the same breath if the end result is going to be the same now as it will be in five years - why beat around the bush?

Right now I can't see us in a relationship that we won't be hiding in and that upsets me. Eventually he will have to choose between me and his family - that's just what it is. The more I think about it the more uncomfortable it makes me - of course I want him to choose me but I also don't want to take him away from his family.

When I proposed to her I brought the question up again, but this time she said that she did want to have kids. So we talked about it and came to the agreement that if she got her career going and we bought a home I would feel comfortable having a child. 

There were some medical issues with getting pregnant so it was not easy and there were a couple miscarriages.

A couple months into the second pregnancy we went for an ultra sound and the doctor told us that the fetus was not viable. My wife was destroyed and became sullen. We walked out to the car and when she was opening her door I hugged her from behind and told her that we will try again and everything will be alright. I was holding her tight when she said, ""this is your fault."" I kept hugging her, but it was quite a shock to hear that. We drove home and I held her hand or her thigh telling her everything will be alright. She continued in her narrative telling me that the reason the pregnancy failed was because I didn't want kids. I chose not to argue with her. We arrived home and she went to bed to rest. I followed her and spooned her saying supportive things. She continued to blame me and hit my chest a few times out of anger. This went on for over two hours. I didn't say anything negative and tried to be supportive and loving the whole time.

I got upset toward the end of the third hour and started defending myself and an argument ensued. She left to go stay at her friends. She told them what happened but left it the part about blaming me for the miscarriage. She had the procedure for the removal of the fetus booked for the next day and told me that her friends would take her to the appointment.

She went for the procedure with them and we made up later, but she still blames me for being a horrible person because I didn't go to the hospital.

Am I the asshole for not going to support my wife during the removal of a miscarriage after she had blamed me for it?

Tldr: wife blamed me for miscarriage because I didn't want children originally. I didn't go to procedure for removal of fetus because she had two close friends with her and I was upset with her.

Edit: This happened several years ago to be honest. It is still an issue of contention between us though. I just thought I would throw it up here for ""AITA"" validation today after an argument yesterday.

I feel real bad though. Reading your comments has made me see more of her perspective. ""DNC"" big thing... I'm not sure I saw it like that before. ITA for sure... I'm going to have to hug it out with her and tell her I'm sorry. 

TIL: Reddit can be a little emotional and make you question your life decisions.

1464,Not the A-hole,"Note. I currently make around 200K and have to give my ex-wife 40k for alimony and 40k for child support. I think 80k is far higher than any living wage, so she’s doing fine. 
 
My ex and I had a horrible relationship. It ended with her having an affair. I tried my best to be civil, but sometimes it didn’t work. So she’s already making more than me. She does have some serious debt that we were working on while we were married. She still has almost 150k in student loans. She has terrible credit, so all of her interest rates are extremely high. So yesterday she asked me for a loan. I simply said fuck off. I realize that’s not healthy or civil, but I’m not an angel. She called me again, “Please, OP. I know you loved me once. I need serious help. I’m not asking for much. I’ll even let you have the kids more often”. We currently have 50/50 custody, and I have been trying to get more. I simply said “Fuck off” again.
 
She once again texted me the same thing. I replied back with “Oh no, guess you fucked up. Please try again at a different time”
 
She was a good mother to our children. She was always there for them, but what she did to me is unforgivable. The worst part about it was that we regularly had sex while we were divorcing. That was a weird time for me.

1465,Not the A-hole,"First time poster so hopefully I do this right!

Backstory: My (27f) cousin (32f) grew up like sisters and were very close. I asked her to be a bridesmaid when I got married in February. I was a very low maintenance bride, as I didn't ask for help or expect it unless they offered. Due to financial reasons, we had our date on a Friday and it had been planned for almost a year. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks before and I message her on FB to see if she would be available for the rehearsal the night before. Her husband responded (they share FB) and asked what about the people who couldn't come due to work. I told him they would have to get off work and I gave more than enough time ahead. He then told me that I was selfish that I didn't plan around the guests schedules, I was destroying my cousin and being a spiteful bitch. I finally had to block him and got a hold of my cousin and tried to find out her side. She sided with him and started to blame me for making her choose between me and her husband? So I had to make the tough decision to take her out of the wedding. 

She blew up and called me derogatory names and said I have ruined the family and that she would whoop my ass cause my dad didn't when I was little. Due to this we are not speaking. I have been told from her dad that she wanted to apologize and talk things over, but everytime she sees me I do not exist. Everyone is telling me to apologize first, but I don't think I was in the wrong. 

AITA for not forgiving her first, when she won't even look at me?

Edit: For more info: I had to coordinate with the pastor and venue to see if a rehearsal would be possible. As soon as I got it approved, I informed everyone involved. So I had no control over the short notice for the rehearsal. The wedding date had been in place for over a year and was sent out months in advance.",28,27,0.89

*** 

At the beginning of October I invited my SIL and her husband, MIL and FIL for a birthday dinner at a local restaurant. I told my SIL if her eldest daughter wanted to join she would be most welcome, I just needed to know in advance for booking. 

A week before the planned dinner SIL asks me to move the restaurant to a different one which we all also like but which is much smaller (it only has 8 tables in total). I agreed and booked that night for 6 people, reminding her to let me know if her eldest was going to come.

The night before the dinner she messages me to say she invited her son and his new girlfriend and that her eldest was coming too. I responded by saying I only booked a table for 6 but I will try and ring the restaurant. After a lot of ringing and booking an extra table online I told her it was not possible to add more people. She responded by saying it was rude to uninvite them at this point so I should move it to the local pub. 

Now, both my husband and I have anxiety and neither of us wanted to go to the pub. She responded by telling me that if I see her family as extras I should just cancel the dinner.

At this point I got upset and told her that I felt she was being rude and disrespectful as it was my birthday dinner, it had been planned for a while, she always does this kind of thing and that I felt sorry for my husband who always get caught up in the middle. She responded by calling me childish (amongst other things) and told me to leave her alone from now on. This is where I responded saying 'gladly, bitch', that I do regret. However I had spent over an hour trying to find a solution and even offered her the table to go with her kids instead and was tired.

Soon after my husband got a call from her husband screaming at him that he will come round and MAKE ME apologise and how dare I upset his wife and be so self centred and nasty. My husband did not get a word in edgewise. 

The next morning his sister messaged him asking him why he hasn't apologised for my apalling behaviour yet and what was he thinking. He spent 2h slowly drafting a response explaining that it was a prebooked dinner in a tiny restaurant and he loves her but he felt she should not have acted this way after we already changed the restaurant and tried to rearrange.

She responded by saying that she never wants to see or speak to us ever again and has told the entire family that I attacked her out of the blue just for wanting to bring her kids.

I haven't apologised because once she had her husband threaten my husband and upset him by telling him to make me apologise and that he was no longer family she had gone too far in my book. I would have apologised for using a swearword, but I bent over backwards for her over and over and I just got exhausted.

So, am I the AH? I do genuinely feel bad for calling her a bitch...but she was being one.",61,302,0.93
1468,Not the A-hole,"So I work as a cashier at a pretty big retailer, chain store. There’s a girl I work with who I’ve been training the last few days and although I’ve been really trying my best to focus on training her the last few days and getting her used to the job, all her attention has been just staring at me and flirting with me on silly conversation. While I will admit I think she’s pretty cute and funny, I’m a full time college student and just got out of a pretty bad breakup and am honestly not that interested in a relationship, with a coworker nonetheless. And her nonstop flirting the last few days has been just plain irritating, as well as the nonstop staring with no seriousness when I am just trying to train her on the job. 

So me and all my coworkers have each other’s phone numbers just to be able to cover each other’s shift if necessary and keep updated on work related stuff. I gave her my phone number after our last training shift, not realizing she would misinterpret this as romantic interest. She’s been texting me nonstop the last few days, and I realized I would have to let her down. Last night, before I even had the opportunity to talk to her about it she went ahead and asked me out. I remained pretty calm and just told her sorry, I have no interest in dating right now. She started to get a little emotional and just says why not, you gave me your number and we love talking and everything. Admittedly I got a little annoyed and felt like I was being guilt tripped into a response that would make her feel better. I told her pretty bluntly that I was never really interested in her, I give my phone number to all my coworkers, and that she should’ve been more focused on learning the job then trying to get me to date her. I didn’t have time for any more conversation so I had to go into the break room to clock in.

Later on in the night I got pulled aside by one of my friends I work with (he’s watching her on one of the registers just to make sure she’s doing everything okay) what exactly I said to her, that she’s been crying a little bit throughout the night. I told him exactly what happened, and he told that I didn’t have to be “such a dick about it”.

Can’t help but think now I should’ve been less mean about it and I didn’t think it would actually make her cry, but to me, working with her was annoying and I can’t tell why she did not take the hint earlier from clear verbal cues I wasn’t interested and was just focused on the job.

1474,Not the A-hole,"My parents are wonderful people, but this situation has been bothering me. Are they being neglectful or am I being a spoiled brat?

**Background:**

I (25f) adopted a cat a few years ago, who my parents claim to love. They pet him, take pictures of him, talk about how cute he is. When I leave their house after staying with them for a few days with the cat, they even say I should leave him behind because they'll miss him too much.

Because I'm young, my living situation often changes, and there have been a few times that I've asked my parents to watch the cat while I move apartments or travel. They always say yes, and I know I’m lucky to have them for free pet-sitting.

I have 2 brothers, and both of them have dogs who are frequently with my parents whenever they travel, sometimes for weeks on end. They treat the dogs with love and affection, and they take them on many walks throughout the day — more than my busy brothers do.

I’m not a perfect cat owner, but I aim to clean his box every day and NEVER let it go more than 3 days because it just reeks and I know cats will go outside the box if it gets too full.

**The problem:**

Last year, I left my cat with them for a few weeks while I moved apartments. When I visited in the midpoint, I noticed that the litter box was filthy. Totally full and smelled horrible. It definitely hadn’t been cleaned in at least week, if not the 1.5 weeks since I left.

I was really surprised, and I mentioned it to my mother. She told me to clean it myself, which I then did. I was a little annoyed though, because they both pick up dog poop multiple times a day for my brothers. It hurt my feelings and it just seemed wrong to the cat. 

I mentioned it to them later, saying it really needed to be done more often. They just seemed kind of pissed, like I shouldn’t have anything to say about the favor they did me by letting him stay.

Recently, my job required me to travel for three weeks. I asked my parents to cat-sit, and they agreed. When I returned to pick up my cat, the smell of the spare room where they keep the litter box was OVERWHELMING. I actually threw out a small pet bed that I had bought because I thought the cat peed on it. Unfortunately, the room still reeked.

I think if you agree to pet-sit for more than a day or two, you’re agreeing to scoop litter. It’s proper pet care. It isn’t right to make my little guy stew in his own filth. Yet I know beggars can’t be choosers, and I asked for their help. Plus there’s an element where I don’t get why they treat my brothers’ dogs so well but not my cat, even though they claim to love the cat.

**WIBTA if I talked to my parents about how they treated my cat?** I would try to do so calmly but I could see it being contentious. I’m also worried I’d be the asshole if I leave my cat there again, but they’d also act like it’s crazy for me not to leave him there again since they get sad whenever I bring him back to my place.",25,32,0.91
1475,Not the A-hole,"My (33M) Fiancée's (27F) cousin (28F) is getting married early next year. For context, her cousin is generally very nice, and we've spent time with her in larger and smaller gatherings. She is also fairly fit, not a health nut by any means but certainly exercises regularly (biking, hiking, climbing, etc). She does also have a body build/type that's just not skinny (not that it really matters, but important for context).

Two weekends ago, my Fiancée and I were over at Fiancée's parents house for dinner, along with her cousin. Fiancée brought up she was looking at dresses, and Cousin told her to avoid one store in particular. Cousin ordered her wedding dress a year ago, and when placing the order had ordered it two sizes smaller than her size at the time because she was going to lose the weight prior to the wedding. As it turns out, when she went back to the store with her mother the week before our dinner, not only had she not lost the weight but had gained some.  When she couldn't fit the dress, she and her mother demanded refunds, which the store refused. As a result, her mother had to pay for $2k in alterations to make the dress wearable, and Cousin and her mother left a couple negative online reviews of the store once they left.

As she's trashing the store and employees, I said it's unfortunate, but I didn't see how it was the stores responsibility to refund a custom-order. She then asked if I was calling her fat, to which I said obviously you're not fat, but I didn't think it was fair to leave negative reviews of the store for something that wasn't their fault. Cousin then left, and my Fiancée is now mad at me because I made it awkward between the her and her cousin.  AITA?

Edit: To answer some of the questions that came up in the comments:

\- In terms of closeness, my Fiancée sees Cousin maybe once every four months, and we've taken turns hosting each other for dinners beyond the holiday get together's.

\- She didn't ask for my opinion, and when I spoke up it was during a 10-minute rant.

\- My exact words were ""Sorry to hear it Cousin that sucks, but it was a custom order right?"". I wasn't intending to reference directly or indirectly her weight, but that's what she heard apparently.

\- My SO didn't get mad because she agrees with Cousin's behavior, it's that I shouldn't have said anything because it wasn't going to be taken well as alot of you pointed out.

I appreciate the feedback. Consensus seems to be that I should've just kept my mouth shut . If she hadn't said she and her mother left negative online reviews of the store, I probably wouldn't have said anything, but lesson learned for next time.",450,6405,0.96
1476,Not the A-hole,"I'm a full-time student and I also work two side jobs, so I don't have a lot of free time. My go-to meal is pasta with marinara sauce, ground beef, and steamed vegetables on the side. It's quick, tasty and cheap and it's easy to prepare in large batches and freeze.

Ever since my boyfriend and I moved in together, he's constantly complaining that he's sick of pasta and doesn't want to eat it every day. I've told him many times he's more than welcome to prepare something for himself if he doesn't like what I make. He cooks something separate on occasion, but usually he just eats the pasta and grumbles to me about it. I was raised to always eat what was on the table or make my own food, so I don't have a lot of patience for this. AITA?

1477,Not the A-hole,"As background, my wife is 6 months pregnant. She decided that it would be best to take the year off from her job (she’s a teacher) because she’s be pregnant or on maternity for the majority of the school year. This didn’t bother me since I make the majority of the money anyways, but it does mean I have to keep my job.

Last night I had a work “party” involving my boss and many potential clients. I personally hate these, but I have to go to them. I *can* skip them occasionally if needed, but it would hurt my promotion chances.

I told my wife about this a week beforehand, said if you need me for anything tell me now, etc, she said it was fine. The day of I reminded her in the morning she’d be on her own for dinner because I had the party, and she said okay.

During the party, which was about two hours from home, I got a text from her saying the toilet is leaking. I responded saying that if it’s a small leak just put a bucket under it, and I’ll fix it when I get back, and if it’s a lot turn off the water to the house, call me if you need anything.

She never responded to that, so I figured it was fixed. Well, how wrong I was. I got home and she immediately started screaming at me. You’re so useless, how could you leave me here, going to be a terrible father, wish we were never married. She’s been mad before obviously, but the last two hurt. This was beyond what she’d ever said.

1480,Not the A-hole,"So the incident happened a few months ago but it's been weighing on me for a while now and I wanted to know if I'm an asshole for how I handled the situation.

Mostly unused alt. Keeping some unnecessary details vague.

One of the performance groups I was a part of in high school has a senior night at the end of the year where all the seniors walk across a stage in front of all our parents and the director announces our names and tells a little story or two about each of us.

The director made the mistake of misgendering my (transgender) friend ""Matt"" as he was walking across the stage in front of the entire audience. Obviously this was incredibly embarrassing for Matt and he was extremely and understandably angry about it.

My graduation party was about a week after this incident and I had invited both Matt and the director. When Matt arrived and saw the director he told me he felt very uncomfortable and that either the director needed to leave or he would leave.

Now here are the parts that I don't know if I handled correctly.

I was reluctant to do this because I really like the director and I've known them for many years so I went over, told them what was going on, asked them to leave, and they did. I feel like an asshole for kicking them out.

As I was chatting with Matt later during the party he told me he was hurt that I'd invited the director in the first place. I told him that because I believed it was a genuine accident, the director immediately corrected themselves onstage, and apologized to Matt and the group backstage immediately afterwards that he would be OK with the director being present. Matt told me that I should have asked him and that I'm an asshole for not doing so.

Although I didn't say it, I'm rather angry with Matt for making me choose between him and the director like he did.

Am I an asshole for kicking the director out?

Am I an asshole for inviting them in the first place?

Am I an asshole for assuming Matt wouldn't be bothered?

Am I an asshole for resenting Matt?

Slight edit because I think I should explain Matt's point of view. Matt believes it was deliberate because he has been presenting as a man and nobody has misgendered him for years. So being misgendered in public like this ""accidentally"" is implausible. I might be wearing some rose-colored glasses.",58,41,0.79

I honestly don't remember what started it but I started collecting McDonald's toys, they're cheap, my kid loves picking one every time I go get some, they're fun, and I don't have to run all around town looking for them lol. 

Anyway, I had a big box of extras that was getting pretty overfilled and didn't really know what to do with the ones neither of us wanted (still in the plastic wrapper never opened or used) so I had the bright idea to leave them instead of a bowl of candy as a fun alternative. I was actually pretty excited about it. So I put it on the porch, wrote on the box, ""Please take one, Happy Halloween!"" And took my little one trick or treating. Came home to a mostly empty box (only six left over) and we all went to bed. 

This morning I delivered the remaining toys to my neighbor and her two children as I still didn't want the extras I already had and they were pretty happy. I sat back on my porch for a cigarette (I live pretty close to the mailboxes) and a couple were walking to the mailbox were talking about how they ""couldn't believe someone would pass out their old free McDonald's toys"" and saying how cheap and rude it was.

One of the interns has often described himself as “devoutly religious” and likes to talk about Jesus and Christianity often. I understand that we all have the right to practice religion as we please, but I have a complicated relationship with Christianity due to some family trauma. My family was very religious when I was growing up, and when I came out as gay in high school, there was a very rocky period of my life where the church and everything that my life was based on as a kid was thrown back in my face. I’m very wary of Christianity and evangelicals in general now, but I haven’t really said anything to him about my relationship with religion beyond stating that I’m not religious. 


This morning, I was sitting in our living room drinking coffee with one of my roommates when the religious roommate got up to take a shower and get ready for church. He closed the door to the bathroom and basically immediately I heard contemporary Christian music blaring from a speaker in the bathroom.

But I thought he was only going to live with us a few month so after a year I asked him to start looking for a new place in like march of this year, and gave him three months to move out. 

In that three month he went behind my back and asked my husband if he could stay longer and my husband said yes and didnt tell me. So 3 months goes by and I'm like WTF?

1487,Not the A-hole,"I (17F) have a step brother (7M). Our parents started dating about two years ago, they've been married and living together for about a year. 

When we all moved in together it was decent, I get along well with my stepdad and brother. But the older he became, the less our parents are home. They used a have a babysitter, but they started hiring her less and asking me more. 

Every day I'm supposed to watch him after school for 2.5/3 hours, and what we can do that time is limited (no tv, I have to read to him or help with his homework, etc). I don't mind much, I'd prefer it if they hired a babysitter but I like hanging out with my brother. 

The problem is it started becoming weekends too, and evenings. I've talked to my mom and stepdad about it, but they think this is the best option, saying things like 'don't you like hanging out with your brother?' Or 'it's good for you two to bond'. 

Every year on Halloween me and my friend group meet and watch old horror movies on a projector and hang out. It's one of my favourite times of year. But this year (on the afternoon of halloween) my mom told me to take my brother trick or treating. I declined, with school/sports/babysitting I don't see my friends often, and this is our tradition. My mom pretty much told me to just deal with it, she and my stepdad left to a party and told me they'd be home around 10pm. 

Well, I called the babysitter (she usually only comes if I can't babysit, or if they're gone 24+ hours) and she happened to be free. I waited for her to come by and left. According to her she and my brother ate candy and watched movies, and both had fun. 

When I came home my mom and stepdad were waiting for me, and they were livid. Because I went behind their back and did something irresponsible. I told them I left my brother with a trusted babysitter they picked, and that I'd have told them I was going to do this if they've asked me to babysit, instead of just leaving. 

So now I'm grounded. I stand behind what I did, but I'm open to hearing other perspectives. 

Sidenote, I'm not in the US and Halloween isn't a huge deal here, if that matters.

1488,Asshole,"My (31M) friend (30M) recently adopted a dog and asked if I wanted to go for a neighborhood walk with them. I brought along my three-year-old son to give my wife a break. During our walk, we came across a dog park and decided to go in.

At first, everything seemed fine and the dogs were playing and getting along. After a couple of minutes, though, I put my son down and noticed the mood in the park immediately changed. Several dog owners called their dogs back and then some left. As one woman was leaving, she mentioned I should read the rules.

I picked up my son right away and went over to the gate. Now, I’ll admit I didn’t check the rules before coming in, but when I read them, I noticed it said that it was not recommended that children under 12 be in the park. Obviously, something not being recommended isn’t the same as it not being allowed.

When I walked back, people started calling their dogs again except this one guy who was talking to my friend. The guy reassured me his dog was good around kids. I wasn’t angry, but I made a comment, somewhat loudly, that I was going to leave because I couldn’t be certain people didn’t bring their aggressive dogs to the park. Nobody said anything, but it was obvious from the dirty looks that we weren’t welcome there.

After my friend and I left, he agreed people were being a tad dramatic, but my wife completely lost it and said its common sense not to bring young kids to a dog park. I never had pets, so it wasn’t obvious to me. AITA?",338,744,0.84

1490,Everyone Sucks,"So I was in a wedding yesterday. Everyone in the wedding party was to bring a plus one, so I chose to being this girl I've been friends with for a while. She also knew the groom, and a couple other groomsmen, but other than that she didn't know anyone at this wedding, as far as I was aware. We kind of went out separate ways while we're were in college, but we just reconnected a few months ago, and since then I've developed feelings for her and I was planning to make a move at this reception. 

However, about half way through, she went to the bar to get a drink and asked me to go with her, so I did. On the way, I got sidetracked by someone I knew that came to the wedding. I spoke with them for what was maybe a minute or two, and when I turned around, my date was chatting with this guy at the bar and the bar tender. No big, I'd just get my drink and wait for her to finish and we'd go back. I waited and waited until it just felt awkward for me to be standing there not doing anything, so I went back to sit at the table and wait for her there. 

She never ended up coming back. I lost track of her from then to the end of the reception (maybe a couple hours) except for one or two instances of seeing her and that guy off in a secluded corner talking. Both times she was wearing his jacket (we were outside) and one of the times he had his hands all over her as they were talking before walking a little further away, so it's not like she was in an uncomfortable situation, evidently.

Anyway, this got me in a terrible mood, and when the end of the night rolled around, they turned up the lights, and were telling everyone it was time to go, and she still hadn't come back. I called her a few times, and texted her that it was time to go and I was getting us a ride. I had noticed she left her phone on the table at her seat, so I knew there wouldn't be a response. I ran one last check around the venue looking for her but couldn't find her, so I got in my ride and went home, assuming she was resourceful enough to take care of herself (which she was; I asked and she later responded that she got home ok).

So am I the asshole for leaving my date who didn't know many people at this wedding because I got jealous that it looked like she was with another guy for most of it? We aren't dating, but I was definitely working up to it and we've been close for a while, so it stung.

Edit: thanks for the feedback guys. I definitely know that there were things I could have done to prevent any issues, so I'd say I can agree with ESH conclusion. I'm meeting up with her tonight to talk it over, so hopefully that goes well.",164,383,0.94

1495,Not the A-hole,"AITA if I prevent my working cousin from using my expensive body care products (I am unemployed)

So I got into an altercation with my cousin that I live with recently.

I am a senior in university and am taking 6 courses this semester (this is considered an overfilled semester at this school), and as such I didn’t bother getting a job this semester because I thought the workload would be too much for me with a job. My parents supported this, as i work a summer job to pay off all of my tuition and they understand if I deem my workload too stressful to take on a job with it, and they don’t push me.
All of the money I have is currently reserves from the summer job and I need to be frugal with it in order to survive until I’m able to get a job again to support my lifestyle.
My cousin works 2 jobs but doesn’t get a lot of hours for each job. My parents have a strict rule that if you are living in this house rent free you should either be working or going to school or else there will be consequences because they don’t want to raise a mooch. Whenever she gets paid she wastes her money on things from amazon she doesn’t really need and orders in food a lot. She once told me she was envious of me for having skincare routines and wanted to know how she could take care of her skin better but she had “no money.” I went through the trouble of drawing her out an affordable skincare routine but she didn’t end up taking it.
When the items are bought by my parents, I share them her. When there are products that I buy for myself, I want them to last. As such, I keep these products in my room and only use them when I am showering and wish to use them. I’ll let her use things sometimes, but other times I’m firm in telling her these are my items I buy for myself, and that she has a job and can afford to buy herself things. If I had a job I would have less of an issue with her using my things but since I am unemployed I can’t let her deplete my resources. If I leave my stuff in the shower for me to use she will help herself to them so I have to keep my stuff in my room. She gets mad at me for not sharing MY items that I buy with my own money, and that she’d have no issues with sharing with me, but that is in part BS because though she shares sometimes, when it came to her expensive items she’d refuse me. My mom agrees with me, she said that my cousin should be affording her own necessities instead of relying on my mom and I to pay for things for her. 
I think I’d even have less of a problem with helping her if I didn’t know for a fact she spends the majority of her money on bullshit she doesn’t need, so she could damn well afford to buy necessities for herself. 
She always uses the excuse “but we’re family and family should share thingssss. Plus I won’t know if I like a product enough for myself if I don’t sample from someone else first.”

1501,Not the A-hole,"So I grew up in a relatively poor area of a big city in the UK. When it came to thinking about doing my A-levels (16-18) it was looking quite likely that I would stay on at my local comprehensive. Most of the schools around me had poor performance at A-Level and were quite rough. However, there was a Catholic school that had a great college attached (one of the best in the country). You needed good grades to get in but also a 'religious reference' from a vicar, imam or whoever. You didn't need to be Catholic, just a member of any religion.

 A year before I would be applying, I started going to a church nearby and in fact went every Sunday for that entire time. I even went to a ten week course that the church encouraged new members to go to (it was called the Alpha course) where they discussed religious themes and what it meant to be a Christian. I was open to the idea of religion to begin with, but very quickly realised it wasn't for me. Truthfully, my only motivation for going was selfish as I knew I needed the vicars signature when college applications would come around. 

Sure enough, when the time came I asked the vicar to sign my reference and off I went to the good school. I stopped going to church pretty soon after that and never really looked back. I did feel bad at the time but it felt like something the local schooling system forced me to do in order to reach my potential. Fast forward 10 years, I went to a good university and now have a successful career as a doctor. I feel like this was a really defining decision in my life and I have no doubt that had I gone to a rubbish school I wouldn't have gotten the grades that I needed to study medicine. 

Regardless, whenever I tell someone about this they take the piss a bit. No one is ever overtly disapproving, but it has been playing on my mind a bit.

1502,Not the A-hole,"I work in a desk clump. (For those who haven’t had a desk job, imagine the Phyllis, Stanley, Andy arrangement. We look exactly like that.) 

My coworker has recently started intermittent fasting. I don’t know the specifics of how long she goes without eating but she comes into work not having eaten and then doesn’t eat at all during the work day. 

When she started intermittent fasting, she asked us not to eat at our desks. I figured she meant like no mindless snacking, no leaving a candy bowl out, etc. that’s not a problem because I only eat lunch at my desk. 

I usually eat lunch at my desk. Always have. So I started to eat my food (not pungent or offensive, just a turkey sandwich) and she said “Hey I kind of thought we’d agreed this would be a food free space.” And I said “well it’s lunchtime, I didn’t realize this extended to that. How many days a week?” “All the days.” 

I said “Well I’ll be fast and discreet. I didn’t understand the earlier terms meant no lunch at my desk every day, sorry.” She asked why I couldn’t eat lunch in the break room and I said “Well I can one or two days a week but I prefer to eat at my desk.”

She continued to bother me about it for a few days and finally got a doctors note saying she needed to intermittent fast and gave it to the company who have now specifically requested I not eat at my desk to protect us from liability. 

The other person in our clump already ate lunch in the break room so this doesn’t really affect them. 

Would I be an asshole if I push back on this? It seems absurd I can’t eat at my own desk at my own job but every time I sit down to draft a letter to that affect I start to worry I’m being an asshole.

1505,No A-holes here,"Post says it all etc.

My wife is three months pregnant and has had some minor complications with the pregnancy which has lead her gyno to advise her not to run at all throughout the pregnancy, or to do any other sports which may result in jolting of her body or similar.

Running is something that we've always done together, and is additionally the main thing I do to keep my mental health in check (I suffer from bouts of anxiety and depression). My wife is really unhappy that she is unable to run for likely the next seven to eight months.

We were recently away for the weekend with her parents, and somehow got on to the topic of exercise. Her mother made the comment of 'if you are going to continue to to exercise, can't you do it while she isn't around?', implying that I should run during my lunch hour at work (I work full time from home), and that by exercising or by talking about exercise I am making my wife 'feel bad'. Her suggestion would mean that I would no longer be able to go for longer runs on weekends, which I really enjoy.

I was quite angered by this and my wife and I later argued because of it. I feel that I shouldn't have to compromise my health (both mental and physical) because my wife is unable to participate in something we used to do together, due to no fault of my own.

So let me have it, Reddit: AITA?

--------------------------------

**Edit:**
When I said 'due to no fault of my own', I was referring to the complications she had early on in her pregnancy which have resulted in the recommendation that she does not run for the remainder of the pregnancy. There is no blame to be had here in regards to her being pregnant - we're both very happy about it :)

Thanks to /u/Lizzurd31 for highlighting the lack of clarity here.

--------------------------------

**Edit 2:**
I want to highlight that things are all good between my wife and I. We're not mad at each other, and we will figure out how we can exercise together. The AITA question stems from her mothers apparent belief that I should change / hide / stop running due to the fact that my wife is unable to for the duration of her pregnancy.

I was a bit pissed off still when I originally wrote this and likely chose a bad title, used some bad wording, and didn't write as clearly as a I could have. Please INFO if you have questions - as much as I am not supposed to defend myself according to the AITA rules, clearly one post cannot share all context of the situation and I would prefer the opportunity to fill in the blanks before judgement.

--------------------------------

**Edit 3:**
Thanks for all the suggestions everybody. My wife and I have further discussed this and have come up with a resolution which works for us both, and will start some exercise activities together later this week which we can do together (Yoga, and swimming). I will find both more challenging than she will probably, as running and cycling are pretty much the only sports I've done for a few years!

1508,Not the A-hole,"So i recently adopted a golden retriever pit mix that I named Arya. She’s wild and excitable and doesn’t listen well, and also has a problem holding her pee and will be in the house. She doesn’t poop in the house or inside, only pee. We’re in training to break the behavior issues and we’re working on peeing outside.

I took her to the vet to get her worm medicine and while we were sitting waiting for the prescription another woman walked in, looked at my dog in disgust and then went to check in with the vet receptionist, I assume to pick up her pet or something.

So this waiting room is not large. I’m probably 5 feet away from her, and it’s really quiet so I hear her say to the receptionist “I can’t believe you allow dogs like that in here. I wish we could ban them already.” And the receptionist doesn’t respond only smiles and nods. I ignore it. 

When another dog comes in, Arya gets excited and starts barking and jumping about, obviously in a happy way not an aggressive way and in her excitement she pees on the floor. I apologize to everyone, make a joke about getting doggy diapers and get paper towels and cleaner to wipe up the pee. The original lady scoffs and goes to the other woman who walked in “No surprise it doesn’t know how to use the bathroom outside. Look how it’s looking at your dog. She can’t control it.” I looked at her and said “Fuck off lady. It’s pee. Dogs pee and they bark. She’s excited.” 

When I get home I recount the story to my husband and he tells me I should have ignored her and I was in the wrong and I need to control Arya better, when Arya did nothing wrong except pee on the floor.

I explained that I had that model boot before and it does indeed leave black marks on floors. (Amazing how many boot marks you can put on a clean floor replacing a garbage disposal!) The white soles leave marks also but almost invisible. Sales lady got a bit nasty and told me I did not know what I was talking about.

1511,No A-holes here,"I (F30) have just been invited to my nephew's thirteen birthday. Its not a big deal, just his dad's side of the family coming over for a bit of cake. Kid only wants cash, has for some years now, so we're used to it, although it's not the most fun thing to give a kid.

But the thing is... He is becoming a bit of a jerk. He's not a BAD kid, just entitled and inconsiderate. Last two birthdays we've come over he just grabs his cash, eats his cake, and then goes to his room to play video games (while everyone else, including his sister, play boardgames together). And I'm like, fine whatever, he's a kid, but I feel like he's getting old enough that he should try to be more aware of other people and how he comes off as a person. His parents let's him do whatever, BUT I know from my brother/his dad that it bothers him too.

ANYWAY: last week I texted the kid about something unrelated, and he never answered me (if you want to know what, I added it in EDIT below). Or the text I sent the next day, or the day after that. Which kind of pisses me off. He's a young man now, can't answer a damn text? And now, we've been invited over by his parents for the birthday thing, told he only wants money on his mobile pay (cash transfer on his cell phone number), and I'm thinking about showing up, and then if anyone ask if I gave him anything, just say something of the sort of ""oh, I don't think I have the right number on you, kiddo.  Wouldn't want to send money to someone else on accident,"" and if he says it IS his number, then have a conversation about, ""well, if it is your number, then why don't you write back?"" (maybe not that last part, but you get my drift). I don't want to do it big or humiliate him, but I kind of think we as grownups and family members need to help kids understand when they act in inconsiderable ways. I almost did something similar last Christmas, because he couldn't even be bothered telling anyone what he wished for, thinking he'd just get money then, so I pretended to have bought a piece of rainforest in his name and told him jokingly that's what happens when you don't make wishes. He was shocked, and I could tell his dad secretly approved, but of course my mom told me that really buying a piece of rainforest as a gift would be rude, so kid got his money anyway. But this year, I'm like, no, if the kid can't even answer a goddamn text, then I can't transfer money to his entitled little self. I don't know, am I just being a grumpy grownup? Again, I don't expect a backlash from his parents, I could always give them some money for the cake I eat, but I feel like we're all just pampering the kid and he could do with a little reality check.

EDIT. I feel like many people think I'll be super mean about it (and I DO see I sound annoyed here) but the plan was to do it jokingly and with a smile. Is that totally impossible?

EDIT. The text. I'm playing pokemon go, he was too at some point so I just texted him and asked if he still played it and had seen  that there were halloween pokemon out. Then, after a few days without answer, I wished him happy birthday and asked if he had any wishes. After that I just texted his name, asking if this was still his number if he could just let me know. I guess I could've called, but I felt like that would be even more confronting.

EDIT. As for how well I know nephew, I live very close and sometimes come over and play games with my brother and 15 year-old niece (mom and nephew not interested). We try to engage nephew, but as soon as he's not winning he gives up (and the last few times have refused to play altogether). Which is another thing I feel like his dad wants to change, but we never pressure the kid, just tells him we miss him and wanna have fun with him, but we leave him to do his own thing always. Other times I take both kids to the movies. He's not an unhappy kid, or partuculatly introvert,   but just cosy and accustomed to getting things his way.",145,455,0.93

My daughter never goes there as it’s not babyproof and it’s a mess. They don’t offer to babysit. They visit sometimes but don’t put much effort in as they are of the old school view - kids should call and visit parents. 
House- I’m taking crumbs on the ground and only “cleaned” if they are expecting company. Even then, just the main floor is tidied. Growing up a couple friends asked why my house was dirty, but before this I didn’t notice this when I was a child. My parents never throw out a piece of furniture as they “have nowhere to throw it”. Even though I give them information on a junk throwing company etc I think it just comes down to not wanting to spend the money or effort. My parents are well off and own 2 properties. Both are run down and full of stuff, however they are still liveable. They have ppl over monthly and my 2 siblings do not mind visiting or sleeping over. So AITA?

 I met a guy in high school and we became close friends. We'd mostly play LoL together and he'd always criticize my gameplay (not in a constructive way). I told him to stop but he'd never listen and thought he was doing me good.  


 Last year of high school, i transferred to another school. After I got a girlfriend, he was pretty jealous of her. He accused me of 'forgetting him once i got myself a girl' It wasn't the case, i just didn't want to hang out with him as much as i used to because of his disrespectful acts towards me.  


 When we broke up at the end of the year, i bought a new computer because my old one had been broken for over a year. I saw him online, we started to chat and kinda got close again. This is when i mentioned i had broken up with my gf and was pretty bummed about it. He lashed out at me, screaming that he doesnt care because i've been ignoring him for a year. I stopped talking to him after that.  


 Then we started to talk due to some coincidence. He was in a band now, and invited me as a guest to their practice. I accepted but the place was in a part of town i've never been in before. He assured me that he knew the place and would help me find a way back.   


 After the practice, we decided to go get some beers but it's illegal to buy alcohol after 10 pm here. I went first and got my drinks, but then the cops arrived. I knew i'd be in trouble if i was caught, so i told them that i'd go to the beach and wait for them there.  


 While i was gone, one of the band members was caught and was taken to the station. Rest of the band went with him. While waiting at the beach, a friend of mine called and we talked for about 50 mins. Then i hung up to check on my friend who was in the station. Apparently, he gave me a call and i was busy, so they took a cab together to go home. He didn't text me or try to contact me in any other way. When i asked him how to get back, he just said i'd find a way and hung up.  


 It was past midnight at this point, so most of the public transport was closed. I had to walk for 45 mins to get to a line that still worked and went home. He texted me multiple times that night, but i didn't reply. The next day, he started texting me again. I just said that i would no longer be talking to him, he was no longer my friend and what he did last night was far worse. We haven't talked to each other in 1.5 years now.  


 So, AITA for cutting ties with this friend? Some of my friends say i'm exaggerating, but the way he acted towards me was so bad i just couldn't take it anymore.",20,29,0.91

I left the door slightly ajar in case my cat decided to come in, but it was still pretty audible. the only thing drowning it out was music coming from the living room played by my grandfather at full volume. I alerted my 10-year-old sister who I'll nickname Charlie of them doing the 'sex' when she came into my room.

the next few days I kept on hearing them. around 5 pm in the evening while me and my sisters we're playing minecraft, they were at it again- I had to make up an excuse so my youngest sister didn't ask what they were doing. Charlie said that she felt somewhat disgusted, and I did too- but I really don't mind what they do with each other. it's just the fact that I've heard it about 3 times this week is starting to get to me. I can now say that I don't like sex. 

so, Reddit, WIBTA if I told my mom that we could hear her and her significant other having sex pretty loudly?",42,87,0.89
1521,Everyone Sucks,"So, my girlfriends sister(18) went home at 10am and realized she forgot her housekeys.
Her parents are at work and so am i and my girlfriend.
After calling her parents and my girlfriend to go open her door, noone could leave their work, so she called me.
I don't have her keys with me, so when i had lunchbreak, i drove home (25min) and then drove to her house (20min).
When i finally got there, she said something like ""omg you took so damm long, couldn't you come earlier?""
I was so mad at her being this ungratefull that i drove back to work and didn't gave her the key.
I was very pissed that i lost like over an hour to bring her a fucking key!
Anyway, when i left work my girlfriend and her parents were very mad at me for not giving her the key.
Aita?

Edit: she lives in an appartement, so she was just outside of the appartement, but inside the building.
And she doesn't go to school or work, so she has nothing important to do.
And i got here at like 1pm and my girlfriend opened her door at 3pm so she waited 2 more hours because of me.

Edit 2:
Wow this thread has a lot more comments then i thought it would have.

After reading all this comments, i feel like it's 50/50, people hating me and people agreeing with me.

Just to be clear, now that i though better about it, i too think i was kind of an asshole to her. I mean she's a ungrateful bitch, but i am not the one who should get in trouble to teach her a lesson, she's got parents to do it and if they won't teach her it's not my bussiness.

I talked to my girlfirend, and she was mad at the beggining, but i explained what happened and appologized to her that she had extra work because of me.

She knows her sister is an ungratefull brat and kind of forgave me already.

Her parents are still mad at me for ""being to hard to her little baby""",123,670,0.92
1522,Not the A-hole,"First time poster, long time lurker. 

This happened yesterday afternoon. My aunt and uncle had just moved back from across the country after being gone for 6 years. This was the first birthday I got to spend with them in a long time. I’m very close with my aunt, my dad’s sister. My uncle is very lovely and funny too, I was excited to see him. They are both elderly and their health is in really bad shape. My parents are in their 70’s and I try to spend time with them as much as I can. Long back story my dad is in poor health and my mom cares for him. I’m so grateful to have all them together for my birthday dinner. Cue my DH. He’s been under the weather for about a week with a cough. He was still not feeling good as we got ready to meet everyone for dinner. I asked if I could get him anything, he said no. He was basically silent all the way to the restaurant, it was an hour drive. I tried the whole time to be friendly and try to engage him. He either gave me one word answers or said nothing. We make it to the restaurant and he is still basically silent. We help my dad with his walker into the restaurant while mom parks. I sit at our table and DH sits a couple seats down from me. I’m confused and a little hurt. He told me I should move so my dad and aunt can easily sit. I move. Aunt is now in a wheelchair so mom and I help her into a chair. The entire dinner he maybe speaks 5 words. My mom is sitting next to him and she keeps trying to engage him and he gives one word answers. My dad tried and he did the same thing with him. My uncle finally says hey DH are you okay? DH grumbled and said he was fine. His attitude was so hostile everyone could feel it. It put a huge damper on the whole dinner. It was so awful. I was so embarrassed. This was the first time we have gotten together in 6 years and DH acts like a sullen brat. I get he didn’t feel good but get it together for an hour. He could have very easily told everyone he was under the weather but happy to be there. Nothing. When we left I snapped. I told him how selfish and childish it was to just blow off my family when he could have very easily said he didn’t feel good but he was happy to be there. He doesn’t think he did anything wrong. I said if he felt that sick he shouldn’t have come. AITA for being upset my DH couldn’t get it together for my birthday dinner with my family?

To everyone who keeps asking, yes I gave him multiple attempts to stay home. I asked him serval times before we left if he wanted to stay home. I asked him if we should stop on the way to get something for him. He declined every time. He had plenty of opportunities to speak up and tell everyone he wasn’t feeling good. It’s not my responsibility to speak for him. He’s a big boy, he can speak for himself.",76,158,0.83

1528,Not the A-hole,"So, I’m a 17 year old Jewish girl. Profoundly Jewish, like I have zero non-Jewish relatives and my surname literally means I’m descended from the first high priest, Aaron. (If he was a real guy, but who knows.). Anyway, I look exactly like a person with this heritage is expected to look: really curly hair and a huge nose. By huge, I mean HUGE. It’s enormous for my face and it has a big bump in the middle. I’ve been made fun of mercilessly for it ever since middle school. No guy has ever wanted to be more than friends with me because of my nose. In 10th grade I heard a guy I had a huge crush on talking to his friends about how big and ugly it is and it honestly scarred me for life.

I’m graduating high school this year and my parents have offered to get me something really special. I think they were expecting for me to ask for a trip. Instead, I asked for a nose job.

They’re both really upset. They’ve been telling me this means I’m rejecting my Jewish heritage and that I shouldn’t want to change because that’s just giving in to the bullies. The Jewish heritage thing is big for them. We live in the South and we’re the only Jews around for miles. They’ve told me off a lot for trying to act like my goy friends to fit in. But honestly my heritage has brought nothing but trouble, I’m tired of people feeling my hair for horns and the anti-Semitic remarks have increased a lot since the 2016 election.

I don’t want to denounce being a Jew and I consider myself a Jew both culturally and religiously. I just want to have a chance in college. I want to be able to go about my business without people making fun of me. I want to be able to date guys like a normal person.

My parents are still really upset. My mom is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like the asshole.

This was two months ago but it still bothers me a little bit. 

So me and my bf went to our local metal shop. At this day there was a pre listening of the SlipKnot album. Additionally there was a lottery, where you could win the new album. So you picked a number and if your number gets picked you got a CD. I thought, why not try it, and got myself a number. Surprisingly I won one (I've never won anything before). But the thing is, I don't really need the CD as I'm subscribed to a music streaming service. So I decided to sell it for about half of the retail price. I posted it on FB Marketplace and immediately got several offensive comments about, how much of an greedy asshole I am and that I should be giving away the CD for free. At first I tried to justify me, because it's my CD and I decide what to do with it. That didn't help and after a little while, I just ignored all these comments. At the end of the day, I still found one guy to buy it from me, without being rude. 
But as I said, it still wonders me, if this really was kind of an asshole move. I mean I would've given it for free to a friend, but I don't know anyone, who likes that kind of music.

1532,Not the A-hole,"So today I was over at my BF’s place for the weekend. We agreed that he would hang out with his friend (who’s a girl, let’s refer to her as N) for N’s birthday (which is tomorrow) while I did other stuff like errands and what not and then we would all meet up to watch a big boxing match.  I went to run my errands while he met up with N. Some background about BF and N, they’ve known each other for a while and have been close friends. In 2015, N told BF she was interested in something more but he turned her down. Recently, N just got out of a long term relationship with her ex, let’s call him Z. BF has tried to support N through the relationship with Z so he knows a lot of the history N and Z have. BF and I have been dating for 8 months and have already done two international vacations together and we call each other “babe.” When I met with BF and N today, N left after a few minutes saying she wanted to go home, leaving me and BF to watch the fight. While she was getting ready to leave, the bar was packed and BF wanted to let her know we were going to look for seats downstairs and that we weren’t just ditching her so he texted her. At that point, when she texted back, I saw that he had texted her and called her “babe” and that she had ended her reply with, “love you.”  I asked him about it and apparently that’s how they’ve talked to each other for a while now (meaning it’s not just N to BF, he also reciprocates and calls her “babe” and tells her he loves her), I just didn’t know about it until today. When I brought up the fact that I thought this was abnormal, BF told me he would have no problem telling N that he can’t say those things anymore but that he would be telling N that the reason is because I’m not comfortable with it. Am I the asshole for saying that he should stop using those terms with her because it’s unreasonable regardless of whether I’m ok with it or not? (AKA not putting the blame on me?)

Notes: BF doesn’t call anyone else babe despite having other really close female friends.  He does tell one other female friend that he loves her and that friend he does have a sexual history with. I also just found out about that. He also admitted that if he found out that I was saying those kinds of things to a male friend, that he would be bothered. We’re also supposed to go hang out with N again tomorrow for her birthday.",32,52,0.91

My nephew is a lazy, entitled jerk and my sister, who is his mom never punishes him for anything he does, being pointlessly mean to people, putting his hands on people, punching  hitting, and breaking things. A few weeks back I was playing barbies with my niece who was over for the weekend. He didn't like that we were playing barbies because he ""could hear us"" from my room right across the hall. He screams at us and I tell my 6 year old niece to ignore it. I had a pizza in the oven, I pull it out, walk away for a moment to do something and he walks past me and spits on it then gets all smug and says ""I spit all over your pizza"" I'm of course angry I have to throw away this pizza I've been craving for days and of course his mom doesn't do much. She yelled at him for it but that's it, they got into a huge fight where he cussed her out. She as usual didn't punish him in anyway, ground him, take his phone away, nothing. So tonight I get home from work and theres a frozen pizza for me and one him and my mom shared. Which he ate all but maybe 2 slices of. He then asks my mom if she can make mine so he can have some. I object to this and say no because he is awful to me and I'm not sharing with him. My mom says it's unfair and argues that I should because he didnt eat much and he's still hungry. Mind you he had just eaten almost an entire pizza to himself 30 minutes till an hour before I get home. He was not hungry just bored, besides theres other things he can eat in the kitchen, such as sandwiche meat to make himself a sandwich if he truly was still hungry. I get tired of arguing and say fine, whatever. I guess he can have all of my pizza too. I text my boyfriend and tell him this whole story, he reminds me about how my nephew spit on my pizza a few weeks back and how I shouldn't do any favors by sharing with him. I agree and I hide the pizza. My mom was going to make it for him I guess. She comes to my room about 10 minutes later asking about it, so I bring her into my room and close the door so that I could just reasonably explain one on one with her about why I really dont want to share with him because of him spitting on my pizza a few weeks ago and how he's constantly mean to me. She interrupts me to go ""really? That's ridiculous. I guess I'll find him something to eat. Wow!"" Completely not acknowledging the fact that he spit on my pizza causing me to have to throw it out a few weeks ago!

1535,Not the A-hole,"I know that weddings are a big deal and lots of planning goes into it. However I am very torn. 

My (22f) little sister (18f) got engaged to her long time bf a few months ago. I live in a different state to her and travel can be expensive. Especially during holiday seasons. 

I’m a full time student studying a very intensive course, midwifery, and next year I have two 6 week placements at the hospitals. My sister had already stated she was going to have an engagement party in April and it became a massive fight when I said that logically I would not be able to go. It is during one of my placements, I am saving to move with my bf and like I said it is expensive during Easter holidays. I felt really guilty, but after lots of back and forth she accepted it and we were able to talk again. 

Now I love my sister I do, and I would want to be there for her, but she told me yesterday that she will be surprising people during the engagement party and turn it into the wedding. When I asked what about people who would t be able to make it for an engagement party but would want to for a wedding she said that anyone who actually cares for her would be at the party no matter what. I kinda felt like it was a stab at me. 

I told her I will 100% try and be there. But I don’t think it would be possible on that date. I just found out our other sister (we don’t speak) is graduating her college course that month as well and may have trouble going. As well as most of the family live out of state and would have trouble going during the busiest season of their business. 

Would I be the ass hole for asking her to change her wedding date. 

Ps. Hope your not on reddit but if you do see this and recognise me sis I love you but just as very torn.

Update:  after lots of chatting between the family she has decided to move the wedding to the end of the year and not to do a surprise one. Whilst I would prefer she not get married so young and maybe travel instead with her partner, she is dead set on marriage. Can only support her and try to be there for her.

I wanted to clean up while she cooks but I refuse to clean her cats litter boxes. It looks like a mountain of shit and piss.

I clean her kitten litter box sometimes because I can’t stand the smell but I don’t touch the adult cats box. I asked her if she could clean the boxes because they stink. She proceeds to clean the rest of the house except for the litter. 

She starts cooking dinner and I tell her “I don’t have an appetite you can put the left overs in the fridge” she thinks I’m being dramatic about the smell and whenever I suggest she cleans the litter she gets all pissy, frustrated and walks off 

I just don’t have an appetite to eat food that’s prepared in a kitchen with mounds of poop and piss sitting in the box smelling up the house.

1538,No A-holes here,"My husband and I have been discussing having kids. 

He says he 100% wants to have children. I like children and love babies, but I've been on the fence about having my own. Children are a huge responsibility, and i'm pretty focused on my career which is finally starting to take off. 

Husband says he's happy to stay home with the children until they're school age, then he'll go back to work. 

However he's not got a lot of experience with children. No siblings, no close cousins, no friends with kids. At first i was worried that he was romanticising the idea of being a stay at home dad, and then when the day to day of nappies and spit up and tantrums kicked in he'd get a rude reality check. 

A few weeks ago we were talking about children again. I told him being a single mother scares me, and asked him what would happen to the kids if we split up? (He's not from the country we live in, I am). He was really understanding of my fears, and said he gets why I'd be worried - he'd move back to his country of origin and he'd probably only be able to afford to visit the children maybe once a year if we weren't together. 

To be honest this made things much clearer for me. The idea of being a single mum to children whose dad sees them once a year at best isn't what I'm going for. I told him that since I'm so against that idea, I'd really rather we didn't have children at all.

No long relationships, but I did have sex. My wife was “saving herself” for me. 
 
I didn’t tell her about the hookups because I thought that wasn’t relevant to our relationship and that it would make unnecessary struggle. But alas, lies don’t last forever. Someone recognized me as their ex, and we began to talk. She introduced herself as my ex, and my wife was pretty mad at me for not telling about what I did.

So now, my sister allowed my niece to post on my sister's FB page -- information on who my niece is, their street address, and a picture of their house. Also that there's a money box outside so customers can help themselves. Then she made a hashtag about it for people to share. 



I'm not really on FB anymore; my wife sent me screenshots. Apparently my sister's profile is fairly public. 



I see this as stupid, and potentially dangerous. Not just because it literally tells you where to drive to rip off a box of money, but also because it's not teaching my niece common sense about privacy and safety in the internet age.

""You're paranoid; you worry too much.""

""You can't just hide from the world and be a hermit.""

""We don't want to discourage a girl who's trying to build her first business. You should want to help girls be successful.""

""We live in a small town, so it's not a big deal.""

Today as we’re talking on the soccer sidelines a woman comes up with her walking but clearly very young son.   My aunt’s daughter was asleep in the stroller with a pacifier in.  The woman’s son starts patting my aunt’s daughter’s stomach and pulling at her pacifier.  

I can see that my aunt is uncomfortable with the situation but is too shy to say anything.  The boy keeps up the behavior and we both expect that the mom will pull her child away.  But she doesn’t.  Eventually the boy succeeds in taking the pacifier out of the sleeping baby’s mouth.  The boy’s mom takes the pacifier and tries to put it back in the sleeping baby’s mouth stating that her son never had a pacifier and is intrigued by them. By this time my aunt and I are making faces at each other and thinking surely this woman will pick up her son and walk away.  Nope.  She just stands there and he keeps up the same behaviors.  

Finally I make a comment about how I bet sleeping beauty would have appreciated it if the prince had just let her sleep.   The woman still doesn’t get the hint and the boy keeps patting the baby and pulling at her pacifier.  She’s trying to run interference but is doing a terrible job at it and finally I say “you could just pick him up and then he wouldn’t be able to reach her and wake her up.”  My mom was nearby and said I was rude.  I think the woman was rude for letting her kid continue to pat and pull at another baby.  So...AITA?

Maybe a bit of important information, i can't handle change. I've never been all that good with big changes and i've seen a therapist for it. While it has gotten better over the past few years, big changes still really freak me out. I understood that this baby would really change our family dynamic around so i've been trying to adjust, it' just taking me a while. 

Now onto the story. My parents are throwing a family dinner party tomorrow where everyone (My brother, his girlfriend, my sister, sister's husband and sister's daughter) are invited. I have not seen my brother in quite a while since he has a very busy live. I was obviously very excited when i heard that they were coming cause i've really missed them and it would give me some time to catch up with them. My parents were talking about seating and i asked where lotte (the baby) was going to sit. She normally sits in the middle of the table on a chair but since the table's gonna be really full now (it can seat 7), i thought there wasn't going to be any space. My parents acted very offended and said 'In the middle of the table obviously' and looked at me like i was wrong in the head for even asking such a thing. I ignored it and asked if i could sit next to my brother since again, i miss him a lot. They said that ofcourse i could, but that i shouldn't expect my brother to talk to me since the baby was gonna be the center of attention. I said 'Oh' in a very sad way and just stood up and went to my room. My mom later came upstairs and asked why i was acting so weird and i just said that i didn't really like baby's and that it kinda hurt that she said that. She went off. How could i be such a brat and 'The baby is a part of the family too' and 'You only think about yourself you selfcentered brat'. She went to bed and ignored me. A few minutes later my dad came upstairs and also screamed at me for being so inconsiderate towards the baby and that 'I've always been stand offish and that im hurting my sister by not liking her baby'. I dont know how he knows this but im guessing my mom texted him. So now im wondering if i went to far and if im TA

1549,Not the A-hole,"I went to one of my cell phone carrier stores to trade in my phone. There was a promotion where I’d receive a new phone as long as I trade in my phone within a month. The two stores closest to me were unable to accept the trade in (wouldn’t process on their computer) and the carrier kept forgetting to mail me the trade in package. So I spent 5+ hours going to 2 more stores by bus and speaking to customer service (by phone) with the sales associates to get this figured out. 

Now the last store I’ve been to, I was pretty worn out. I had a headache and this was my only half day off in two weeks. But I work in retail so I made sure my tone was polite. When I found out this last store couldn’t take in the trade in, I thanked the Employee 1 (E1) for trying. E1 told me to wait while he go checks in the back with the manager, and so I stood there and waited. 

I started tearing up in frustration and Employee 2 (E2) saw me wipe my eyes and asked why I was crying. I replied that I was worn out and have been going to different stores for the last 5 hours. By then, the manager and E1 came out from the back. E2 then yelled at me that I had no right to cry in front of the crowded store because he’s been at this store for the last 8 hours.  This of course made me start to actually cry because suddenly the crowded store was quiet. 

The manager awkwardly stood at the side and watched, letting the E2 get everything off his chest. I was rather upset that the manager didn’t step in to stop the tirade so I reported the incident to corporate. Apparently corporate had security cameras and they watched the incident and informed me that they ended up terminating E2. 

Now I’m feeling guilty because being in retail, I understand that everyone’s overworked and underpaid. And he’s human just like me and I made him lose his job. Plus in his tirade, he mentioned how he’s working so many hours and I understand how that can wear down on your mental health. (I work/volunteer/commute 72 hours for minimum wage) But losing your job seems like such an extreme consequence for having a human moment and getting angry.",23,57,0.89

I needed to use a personal day, and messaged my boss about it. My boss has a tendency to ignore me messages, but I am always reassured that ""he reads everything"". I have gotten in trouble before for calling this out, so I simply left the message on Tuesday. Friday rolls around, still no reply. I send another message just further verifying the situation, and I take off the Saturday (today).

Two hours later, I get a call from my boss. She is demanding to know why I am skipping work. I explained I messaged her about this days ago, but she had ignored my messages. She admits she missed my message, but then explains she is a manager and is allowed to miss messages because she deals with so much. Suddenly, she asks me what I am doing on my day off. I explain that I need to be someplace.

This was not good enough. My boss asked for more information. I explained that I have an appointment.

Not good enough. Again.

She asked ""appointment for what?"" At this point I get extremely uncomfortable and I explain that I need to attend something related to my health.

Again, this was not good enough.

It got to the point where she repeated ""I need to know exactly what you are doing on Saturday"" that I spilled the beans and explained I have an inactive thyroid problem with blood pressure issues and I want to attend a seminar on solutions. This satisfied her, and we both hung up.

The entire time I was on the phone with my principle, I could hear soft chattering and clicking glasses in the background. She was obviously at a bar, and was drinking with her friends showing off her ""authority"".

I am in shock. I know for fact there will be a meeting about this Monday. However, my roommate mentioned how my principle basically violated EOC laws. Basically, her asking such in-depth questions about my personal days is apparently a violation? Especially discussing this in front of other people?

I want to watch myself with the possibility of being fired, and if so, can I use this as a complaint to HR? I do not want to involve a lawyer of unemployment benefits if I am let go, but this seems so shady to me.

1554,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I have two boys (7 and 11) and we have 50-50 custody. Every Thursday she comes to my house to pick them up for her time. I noticed more and more food was gone, but not for sure. I was able to confirm that food was going missing because someone drank my last can of Ginger Ale. I asked my sons' sitter if he knew anything about it and he said my ex drank it. I was confused. Apparently, when my ex comes to pick up them up, she'll start making a snack for herself like she lives there. I thought about it and want it to stop.

The issue is that she is unemployed and has no money. I believe she is hungry. It's not about the money or cleaning up after yourself - it's about boundaries.

EDIT - I do pay her child support, $300 a month. I make 90K a year and she makes 45K a year. However, I pay for the kids' tuition and cover their insurance. I believe that my ex is barely breaking even at the end of each month and lives paycheck-to-paycheck. She lost her job back in August and just found something in October so that fucked her finances up. 

That's not my problem though.  

My problem is that she just welcomes herself to my food. Literally, the stuff she eats is the food that I buy for myself. For example, my diet ginger ale. It pisses me off that I come home and want to have a nice cold ginger ale with my dinner only to find that the last few were drank.

Hi reddit,

So when I was 13 or 14, I started smoking because I believed it was cool (big mistake) and I got hooked on it pretty quickly. Anyways, my mum found out that I was smoking and I was given the hairdryer treatment for what felt like 65 years. 

On discovery of me smoking, my parents made me take a free NHS scheme thing to help people quit smoking. It is successful and has worked for people, just not me. I done the scheme and a few days later I would relapse harder and got hooked worse than I was before. 

I'm 19 now and took on vaping when in January (was 18 when I started). I read the study that it was 95% safer to vape than to smoke. As I write this now, vaping has worked, I've managed to wane myself to nicotine free juices and it's literally only the hand to lip habit I'm trying to shake off

Yesterday, my parents found my vape pen amongst another discovery that I never attended the NHS scheme the umpteenth time they signed me up for it. They went berserk about Donald Trump's vape ban in the States (despite the fact we're fucking British) and the 1000's that have died from vaping. Literally 7 people died from black market illegal THC cartridges, not the legitimate stuff I've been buying from a well known vape retailer as well as showing the the study that vaping is 95% safer and that it's been working for me.

1558,Everyone Sucks,"Me and my fiance host a few parties a year. I dont like parties, I let her throw them because they make her happy. The main problem is that we're busy people, and our house is pretty messy. So the week or so before the party we try to clean up so we dont have to do it all in one day. I'll make sure my things are picked up and in my room. Do some extra dishes so they get finished, clear off the table. 

My fiance does none of this. She keeps making plans for it, keeps saying she's going to do a bunch of cleaning today but it never happens. We always end up doing a ton of cleaning the day of. A majority of witch consists of moving her shit from the downstairs to her room so its out of the way. (So not something I can help with without her, she doesn't like people touching her things.) She had been working lots of overtime this week to help makeup for the fact I cant work any, so I wouldn't of expected everything to get done but she doesn't even START anything. 

I work 3rd shift, and we were texting about budget and things like that. So I know she was up until 430am, I know this because thats when she sent me the last text. I also know that she got off work at 10pm, and had planned on trying to get shopping started at 8am. So I think cool, she probably got some cleaning done. 

I get home at 6am, and nothing has been cleaned. Nothing move. The house is still a huge fucking mess. 

So I go to sleep, wakeup at noon, and start cleaning. She's off shopping until 3pm, and the party is at 8. NONE of her things are done, nothing moved or put away. So she says she needs a nap. I ask her to help me with some of her stuff first, and she just insists she needs a nap and she'll get up in half an hour. 

So I'm angry, I'm pissed that this is ANOTHER party that I'm doing most of the cleaning for. So I stick my headphones in, planning on ignoring her as much as possible until I calm down enough to actually talk, not just fight. 

She confronts me after I wake up, asking why I'm angry. I tell her I dont want to talk to her right then, and I just want to get everything finished. She insists that we have to talk because she doesnt want to end up arguing while drunk. 

We fairly quickly end up shouting at eachother. Her about how its not fair that I'm angry and me about how its not fair that I have to do a majority of the cleaning. I pull some pretty cruel punches, accusing her of purposfully not doing any cleaning, assuming I'd do all of it. I accuse her of purposefully neglecting it even though this happens every time. Finally by the end of it I'm even more pissed off, and she's gone from apologizing, to claiming the situation was out of her control, to setteling on that I should be grateful that she picked up so much overtime that she couldn't clean the house.

It’s a horrible thing, very sad. She had been battling cancer and passed on December 26th. 

Her children aged 42 and 47 were with her as was her 77 year old husband. 

They all lived near each other and usually celebrated Christmas together, and since I knew my aunt had been the lead on cooking and decorating and festivities in their house, wanted to invite them to our celebration in case staying home would be too difficult for them. 

They accepted the invitation. Then they send a long email saying they were not going to be in the mood for “festive celebration” as they felt it would be disrespectful to their mother’s memory and too difficult for them as they approach the one year anniversary, so would prefer we avoid Christmas music, decorating, making a big show of presents, and that we spend a lot of time reflecting on their mother’s life and discussing the loss. 

Here’s the thing, I’ve got three kids (5 year old twins and a 19 year old.) 

My twins live for Christmas and winter break is the only time I’ll see my 19 year old before summer and we had a lot of fun stuff planned, including our own Christmas traditions like making cookies for Santa and decorating the trees in the yard, and watching movies. 

I tried to tactfully explain they were welcome in my home but I couldn’t have my kids holiday overshadowed with the somber activity of mourning. 

They responded to this by basically saying “Why would you invite us knowing our situation if you weren’t prepared to make any accommodations for us?” And are very upset, also taking our carrying on our Christmas traditions to mean we are sweeping their mother’s death under the rug or forgetting her somehow.

Before the move we would split holidays with our son ( He will get him the day before Thanksgiving and on Christmas Eve and I will have him Thanksgiving and Christmas) and have had no problems with that arrangement. 

Fast forward to early October when I got a call from him telling me that he got a new apartment and wanted our son to come on his day and Thanksgiving also cause his family is spending Thanksgiving at his place. I told him I didn't feel comfortable with him staying over night because I haven't seen the apartment to know if it's safe for our son. Plus he's not familiar with his daily routines.

1571,Asshole,"Several weeks ago I matched with a guy on Tinder. He didn't have a photo of his face, but said in his bio that it was because he was a teacher and didn't want to risk matching with his students or their parents. That made total sense - I've seen it happen before. We messaged each other and he sent me his Snapchat username so we could exchange photos on there. We exchanged countless photos and messages over the course of the next week. I was out of town on a business trip, so we made plans to meet up once I returned. We decided to meet at my house, since he claimed to have a roommate and I live alone.

Fast forward to me returning to town. He came over and we had sex. I enjoyed myself and he seemed to as well. We made plans to meet up again. However, the following morning I woke up and he had unmatched with me on Tinder and deleted me on Snapchat. I was surprised and honestly a little offended. Let me start this by saying that usually I'm pretty chill - if he had simply said something like ""I don't think we're compatible and don't want to meet up again"" I would have been fine with it. However, we had made plans to meet again, so I was left wanting an explanation and some closure. I didn't know his last name, but he'd told me just enough about his job that I was able to find him on his school's staff directory. At first I didn't think it was him, because the first names were different. However, I cross-referenced the names on Facebook and found his profile. His profile photo showed him with a woman. I found the woman's profile and discovered that she is actually his wife and is seven months pregnant. I also found their Target baby registry. I was incredibly surprised. In retrospect, his shady behavior - no profile photo on Tinder, only using Snapchat to communicate, immediately deleting all of the evidence after we hooked up - made a lot of sense.

To be honest, I'm not really upset; what we did was purely physical and I'm not emotionally attached to him in any way. I think he's an asshole for stepping out on his wife, but no true harm was done to me, so I don't feel the need to ""get revenge."" However, several of my friends have told me that I have an obligation to inform his wife of her husband's cheating. Based on how well he covered his tracks, I'm sure he has done this before. I do not want the drama; in my experience, people often blame the bearer of bad news, and I did nothing wrong. In addition, because he unmatched me on Tinder and deleted me on Snapchat, I only have a few messages from him as ""proof"" of his infidelity. I'm not even sure if his wife would believe me at this point.

My question to you guys is, would I be the asshole for not reaching out to his wife and telling her of his cheating?

F/u to the other day’s post: 

My relative’s mom called this AM understandably shaken up. Relative is expecting baby # 5 (like barely showing pregnant) and while I’m sure there’s more to the story, her landlord just told her that baby will put her over the legal limit of people allowed in a 2 BR in our state. This is actually true. 

She’d recently asked us for some $$ (now she explains it was to get into a bigger place w more rooms) & we just refused. We’re looking to put our kids in private school not subsidize hers. 

Landlord is threatening to call child protective services and or kick them out.  They almost never give me the full story, so I don’t know what to believe.

ETA: Kids’ dads (2 or 3) aren’t involved & Relative won’t pursue child support. 🙄

So the mom asked if 1 or 2 of the older kids could come live with us for a year to make Relative’s pregnancy/new baby easier. 

My objections include:

- My husband backed out of having a 3rd child due to family pressure; if he wants more kids in our home we need to HAVE OUR OWN before I get too old; 

- I’m not wired at all to be a foster parent. Also relative lived w us for a few months w eldest while on the outs w the dad... it was miserable. I think eldest has something emotionally wrong. I don’t have the patience. 

- not the 2 older kids’ fault but they’re picking up on their mom’s shitty entitled attitude & poor decision making. I want my kids focused on academics and sports right now, and I think the older one especially would be a bad influence.

- I don’t know that I’d be able to get past the resentment I try not to feel toward the kids but do anyway. 

- Extended fam is always pushing boundaries & I feel like having the kids move in w us just invites more of their BS, which includes the attitude that MY kids are somehow “taking” resources from hers. Fuck that. My husband & I bust our ASSES to give our kids the advantages we do. 

- taking the *oldest* 2; I’m concerned would just encourage more babies. It wouldn’t be just a year they’d stay. 

The mom (& you guessed it, whole fam) are furious with me. I’m selfish; in the old country I wouldn’t DARE say no (this is much much more normal in my parents’ birth country than the US. 

We are also the only ones w the space & $$ and I’d hate for the kids to have to go to foster care. Who knows if it’s true that we’re the last ditch here. This also comes right on the heels of they’re mad at us that it’s not FAAAAIR my kids are transferring to a private school. 

I also feel like I’m just enabling relative & dinging my own credibility if I get her a lawyer (which I was also asked to do). We’ve helped her in the past & cant now.

1578,Not the A-hole,"When I was in my second-to-last year of middle school, I begged my parents for a new phone for my birthday. All my friends had iPhones and the like, and I’d been stuck with a Samsung Galaxy Ace which had continual software failures for a few years.

They didn’t want to, as a ‘phone isn’t really something we’d like to get for your birthday’ but eventually conceded. They ended up getting me a $120 Windows Phone, which didn’t run the majority of the ‘cool’ apps, and had even less comparability than the Samsung. But ya know, they’d in essence got me what I’d asked for.

I had savings that they’d been paying into and they said oh, don’t spend that on a phone (I’d suggested going half/half or 80/20 with them on an iPhone) and instead suggested I bought a computer with it because ‘at high school you’ll need a computer’. I spent all my savings on that computer.

I didn’t get a job until first year of high school, and saved for 140 hours of work to buy my first phone of my own - a shiny new iPhone 8 Plus.

Now in second year of college, my phone got dropped, and so I traded it in. I then spent another 50-60 hours in my new higher paying job to afford a new XR, alongside now paying for family food shopping and petrol because times are tough atm.

My brother is in second-to-last year of middle school. He is drinking and going to parties (which I was never allowed to do), and has been told you can swear at home as long as you don’t swear *at* anyone (which I was never allowed to do either)

My parents have funded 8 years of my brothers music lessons, trips abroad, sports events, 5 different instruments and a computer, They’ve been buying him $70 converse to wear to school, I was stuck with $13 Walmart shoes.

Now he’s got the go ahead to buy with them 80/20 a new phone for his birthday, using his savings (which they’d told me to save for a computer)...

He has outright bought an XS, and is flashing it in my face. 

So this evening I brought up the differences in treatment and caused a family fallout. 

They don’t seem to be able to see how long I have spent working my way up to the level of belongings I own now, and that buying him a £700 phone really feels like a slap in the face to me, seeing as I’ve worked for so long to get where I am.

I wasn’t given any help with a purchase of a laptop for high school, and in fact had to sell them my tablet in order to get any funds from them at all.

1580,Not the A-hole,"My father was not a stable force in our lives (me and my two younger brothers). He would visit us maybe once a week until our mother got ill and died. We ended up living with our uncle and my father bounced from the picture so it felt like losing both parents. I'm in my mid-20's and my father came back after a 15 year leave of absence. He said he sincerely wanted to make amends with his kids. As it turns out, he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and doesn't want to die alone. 

My two younger brothers welcomed him back though they are not close with him. My father has been pushing on rebuilding a relationship with me. Right now, I have too many personal things going on and been through Hell over the last few years. I don't need my father reappearing and asking me to provide him with support and companionship. He was pretty unrelenting and I snapped that I didn't want to have a relationship with him. Not now, not ever. I don't care if he's dying or not. I also told him that I would never call him ""dad"" because I don't consider him to be one so he gets to be called by his first name. I see his attempts to reconcile as being totally self-serving to his needs and wants. He feels guilty and is facing mortality. 

Again, my rejecting him has more to do with focusing on my own personal problems than any bad blood. I snapped at him.",32,79,0.9
1581,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve known that my husband has been watching porn since he was a young teenager. I knew fairly early on in our relationship that he watches it occasionally (although I didn’t know how much). I was pretty young and very sexually inexperienced so I didn’t really understand the impact it can have. And because it‘s so normalized, I assumed that it’s okay (or at least, not harmful). As time went on I began doing research and processing what it could mean when he watches it and became increasingly uncomfortable with it. I brought it up a few times in our dating relationship but it always ended horribly. I’m timid with brining serious things up in the first place because he’s a bit older and very intelligent, so he can talk his way out of anything and I’ll feel guilty at the end it. So I kept my mouth shut while we dated and let my thoughts and insecurities run wild.

It should be noted that I’m very confident in myself, I’m not self-deprecating or self-pitying. I worked hard to get to where I am now, so it’s embarrassing for me to admit that this makes me feel inadequate. To be fair, he did explicitly say that I don’t sexually please him and he’s confident I’ll never be able to, so either he’ll be a guy married to someone who will never fulfill him in that way or he’ll be a guy who watches porn on the side. It should also be noted that it’s not a big deal to him, so I’m widely overreacting from his perspective.

I’ve told him that porn is just about equivalent to cheating to me, and that him watching it breaks my heart. He tries to be rational in everything he does, so when we talk about it, he breaks down the logical implications of him doing everything I want for him, which apparently leads to a sexually dissatisfying life. To me, his “logical breakdown” fees like he’s blaming his porn habit on my inability to please him, and when I defend myself and say that it isn’t okay to put this on me he goes to the other extreme. “I will do my best to get my shit together and not bother you in the process” was his response to me when I said that this shouldn’t be put on me.

I should point out that I want to have more of a sex life. Because he’s getting gratification out of porn, he doesn’t need anything from me, so we end up having sex very infrequently and I’m left hung to dry. I’ve brought up wanting to have more frequent sex but he’ll just say that it isn’t fun for him because he has to wear a condom (I can’t take birth control for health reasons) and that he’s afraid I’ll get pregnant. Also, we’re about 5 months into our marriage, so I feel like lack of sex (or interest in sex) shouldn’t be an issue so early on, right?

I love him so much and don’t want him to feel like he’s on blast, but him watching porn is not okay with me. We’re going to counseling to try to work this out, but I want different perspectives before we dive into it. AITA for telling him that he needs to stop watching?

Now, my brothers are both married, and they each have one kid (elementary school age, 5 and 9).  We often travel to the family homestead for holidays, visits, etc. However, in the last year or so my mother has decided that her nieces need their own room, so each brother + wife gets a room, the two kids get a room, and I can either sleep on the couch or in a sleeping bag in the kids' room.

She waits until my sister had already started her hair to tell her that Tyrone (my best friends ex) had paid for the hair and that she doesn't have any money.

""It's hot in here""

""Why are you braiding it like this, braid it another way?""

My friend does this to guys to make them feel bad for her/give her what she wants, and it usually works.

1586,Not the A-hole,"This year was my little sister’s (4) first year trick or treating because we only recently moved to a suburban neighborhood where our parents felt it was safe enough to go out. We put a bowl of candy out with a sign that said Happy Halloween! Please take only two :). We put the bowl out before we left and went to get ready. About five minutes later, we were heading out the door and my little sister noticed that all of the candy in our bowl was missing. She was upset because now she thought we couldn’t give candy to anyone else and that someone would take so many. Maybe it’s a overreaction on my behalf, but I adore my little sister and hate seeing her upset. So I convinced my parents to take her around and once we were back home, I decided to refill our bowl and then hide in the bushes next to our house with a large spray bottle. Any time someone took more than two candies I sprayed them with water (the spray bottle was on mist so they didn’t get drenched). Obviously I got yelled at by some parents because I was ruining their night, but in my opinion, you shouldn’t be teaching your kids to take whatever they want when no one is looking. I don’t think I’m TA because it really was a light mist and no one was soaked, just annoyed, but a friend thinks I’m TA because it should be expected that some kids take more than WHST the sign says. I should also mention I sprayed more adults/teenagers than actual children. The children were good, it was sad to see their parents urging them to take more.

EDIT 1: I wasn’t spraying little kids or kids who took like three or four candies. It was the older kids/teenagers/adults who were taking handful after handful that I would spray.",229,2305,0.95
1587,Not the A-hole,"Ok, let me explain a little better. My sis and bil have been married for 7 years and she just announced she's pregnant with child #5. Usually if she wants him to do something nice for her he'll ask for sex as ""payment"" for doing it.
Every pregnancy announcement includes a story about sis wanting Bil to do something and he'd only do it in exchange for sex. This time she wanted a drink from Sonic and he would only go get it for her if she had sex with him first. I jokingly said maybe she should just give him BJs from now on so she stops getting pregnant all the time and we don't have to keep hearing about their ""payment arrangement"". Apparently this was offensive to say and most of the family is upset at me. My dad thinks what I said is funny af though. He also agreed he doesn't want to know she got knocked up for a milkshake. 

Edited, because I really was joking. I didn't say it in a mean way.
So, AITA?

One more edit even though it's already been ruled upon. 
I've always thought my sis is TA because she's super bitchy toward BIL and treats him really disrespectfully in public. Sometimes he'll try to kiss her and she does the 180 head turn to avoid it and looks totally put out that he would try to show affection towards her. I could totally see her withholding sex from him on a regular basis and he demanding it if she wants him to do something for her..... which now that I've read some of these comments makes me realize maybe he's a mega asshole at home.
She would totally die if she knew people were calling her/us trashy, but I think it's hilarious. BIL is one of the most sought after surgeons in a very upscale city in TX. So I can totally see BIL having that doctor-god complex some doctors have. 
She's also pretty much a textbook narcissist.

1588,Not the A-hole,"I have recently been hired on by the government in their internship program to transition recent graduates into full time positions. My ""class"" has about 20 people. The other day we had a speaker from human resources who comes in and proceeds to look down her nose at everybody (most people in my class only have undergraduate degrees with a couple of masters) and talk only about herself and her degree. Such gems were: ""I'm very modest, I don't go around telling everyone about my PHD."" after introducing herself as ""Dr. Name"" and currently being on a side titled ""Dr. Name's keys for success"", ""This is what you learn when you get your PHD"" after presenting her keys for success (they were literally Determination, Motivation, and Education, nothing else), and ""I manage 16 people, these are some perks of getting a higher degree"". She even specifically asked some of us (myself included) what we were studying and going into, and when I informed her that I had a bachelors in civil engineering and was being transitioned to the department of defense as a military engineer, she smirked and said ""I didn't know they were bring on undergraduates for that position, I highly recommend you purse a higher degree."" My jaw almost dropped. 

Now I hate being talked down to under the best of circumstances, but while she was going on about herself, she informs us that her undergraduate (human resources admin), masters (don't remember), and PHD (mentoring) are all from a specific online, for profit, non accredited university that was recently sued by the federal government for giving out useless degrees. 

So I go home and call to vent to my sister about how dare she talk down to us when she has a sham degree. My sister, however, said I was being uppity and an AH.

1590,Not the A-hole,"I live in uni accommodation with 5 roommates. We each have a bedroom and ensuite and the living room and kitchen are communal. We agreed early on (we all moved in in September) to take turns with cooking dinner. As there are 6 of us, we each buy the ingredients and cook for everyone one night a week, and on Sundays we either cook together or chip in for a takeaway. I cook on Fridays. We discussed dietary restrictions early on and fortunately there were none, in terms of allergies or intolerances. However, this one roommate openly said ""heads up, I'm a very picky eater"".

Over the last 2 months we've realised that he prefers red meat, the only potatoes he'll eat are chips (fries) and he loves black pepper. On his nights he'll usually buy some form of beef, often a pack of sizzling steaks, and a bag of oven chips, all covered in black pepper.

I happen to dislike black pepper. I'll eat it if it's used as a seasoning, but when everything on the plate is crusted in it, which is how he tends to cook it, I have issues getting through it.

We've also found out that the reason he loves black pepper is that it's pretty much the only seasoning he uses. He hates pretty much all herbs and spices, and he'll complain, loudly, if any of us use herbs and spices (asking why the food is a certain colour, asking what ""those little green things"" are).

Last Friday in the roommate group chat I said ""I was thinking I'd do a chicken balti tonight. Any objections?"" The picky eater objected due to the curry, I said I could do him some plain chicken and rice, he said no, I said he might want to sort something else out in that case because the idea of the curry is it takes less than half an hour and I have an assignment to work on. He said he'd make himself steak and chips.

Then last night I made paella and roast potatoes for everyone. I told the group chat and everyone but him was on board. He said he doesn't like turmeric or roast potatoes. No suggestions for what I could do instead for him.

I did 7 portions of ingredients in one large pan, and then got a second, smaller pan. I separated out one portion of paella and seasoned it with black pepper, and then the other 6 portions got turmeric. That was the only difference. Then for the potatoes I made 6 portions of roast potatoes, and put on a single portion of pre made oven chips. He had the oven chips and the turmeric-free rice dish (which honestly was closer to a risotto at that stage as it was creamier and made in a deeper pan).

I dished it up, brought it to the table, called everyone in for dinner, and he asked why his was so different to everyone else's. I explained the modifications I'd made to his portion and he went off on me, telling me that I was treating him like a child with ""special food"" and being bitchy by not including him at all last week.

1592,Not the A-hole,"Hear me out please. I am the father to my 25 year old daughter named Ella. Ella partakes in a lot of attention seeking behaviour and always feels the need to be in the spotlight. She also frequently goes through brief and extreme phases. For example, she came out to us as lesbian a couple of years ago, and we supported her, and a couple of months later she ""had a change of heart"" and got a boyfriend. She told us she was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and it became a central facet of her identity, and then she later admitted that she was never diagnosed but read about it online and thought some of the things applied to her. A final example is that she decided to ""reject the material world and become a buddhist"" which again lasted for maybe a month. It's a very worrying trend that keeps on happening and I decided to no longer enable these behaviours.

I get that maybe she is trying to find herself, but it is to a very extreme degree and it pushes away those who care about her because it is always something new with her. And we ""can't understand"" what she is going through. It seems apparent to me that she needs mental health counselling, but whenever I try to talk to her about this she shuts me down and I am unsure whether she is receiving any treatment or therapy.

A few days ago Ella tells my wife and I that she is transgender and is transitioning to become a man. She has never expressed any desire to do this before, and I am concerned it is another phase. However, it is a phase that will be harder to reverse. She is just now starting testosterone, and is planning to have a breast removal (not sure what it's called?) and a full sex change. She told us we should come to her ""transitioning party"". I told her absolutely not because I cannot support such a rash decision, and that she had to think long and hard about if this is actually what she wants to do. She claims she's been planning this for months and is just telling us now, but she has thought long and hard about it. I still am refusing to enable this behaviour in light of her past, and will not attend this party. To note, if I truly believed she was transgender I would support her.

1596,Not the A-hole,"Hi- first time posting. My boyfriends sister had a baby in August. I was there for his birth, saw his sister/nephew consistently since his arrival, now there’s a running joke because the baby pooped on me the one time I held him to help his sister out. Point is: I’ve met and been around this baby.

Boyfriend has a commitment he can’t get out of for Sunday that conflicts with this “meeting the baby” event. It was previously rescheduled from the week before and he accepted the reschedule forgetting about the party. He felt bad about it, but shit happens. 

His mother insists that I go on Sunday despite the fact that my boyfriend can’t. He even forgot to even tell me so she cornered me about it when I went over earlier last week. I mentioned I may have to deal with MY family being close to one of the major fires going on right now. She said okay and let it go. My family hasnt had power for a week and were gonna come stay with me over the weekend. I guess she heard that the area they live in got their power back because she called me last night asking if I could make it to the baby event now that their power was back on (which I didn’t even know about yet- they live in an extremely rural area and when they don’t have power they don’t have a way to communicate because they don’t get cell service- hasn’t spoken to them in 24 hours)...

Here’s the thing. I love his family. I really do. But I legitimately despise children and don’t ever want them. I’ve made it a point to have them know that. I have been sweet to the baby. Gone out of my way to show the family kindness. But... We’re not married. His sister has never been outwardly kind back to me.  I get the whole being supportive thing, but I was there at 5 am when the baby was born. Hung out with the family a bunch.....

I told their mom that even though the power was back on I still lent my car to my roommate who has a guest staying at my house for two weeks so I probably can’t make it.

She has a job that requires her to work a lot of hours, while my job is more flexible and lets me telecommute most days, so we have an arrangement where I do the cooking, dishes and some of the cleaning, and she handles the other chores on the weekends. I enjoy cooking and I like to think I'm decent at it, so I'm fine with this.

Anyway, on to the issue: two months ago, after a lot of reflection, I became an ethical vegetarian and have since cut meat completely out of my diet. My wife was initially very hesitant about this change, but we eventually agreed that I would cook us vegetarian base dishes and she could heat up some frozen meat products from our freezer in the microwave if she wanted more protein to go with her meal.

For some background, when we first started dating, I really wanted to impress her and cooked her a really fancy meal for our third date, including a steak dish that she really liked and decided was her new favorite food. She requested the steak for her birthday and other special occasions, and up until I became vegetarian I was happy to make it for her.

Fast forward to today, when we were discussing plans for her birthday next Thursday. She said she wanted me to make her a steak again, as usual. I explained that I'm no longer comfortable with that because I don't cook meat anymore, but I'd make her any vegetarian dish she wanted. She didn't like that, so I suggested I take her out to a restaurant where she could order steak off the menu. She got extremely upset and said that wasn't the same at all because it wouldn't be me cooking it for her and that was what made it special. She said I should be willing to make an exception for her birthday and it was something she looked forward to every year.

I understand where she's coming from but I also think she should respect my beliefs. I'm open to judgment either way.",201,66,0.81

1604,Not the A-hole,"Have a very unusual situation here.

I'm in my late thirties and a working professional. I have a coworker, a very nice man in his early 50s, we'll call him Bruce. We've worked together for about seven years now and we've grown rather close. It's never been romantic however we're each others best friend. We're both busy professionals so there's little time for much of a personal life. Bruce has been vocal about wanting a child for about three or four years now but he doesn't think he'll be approved for adoption because he's a single guy with a busy job and we live in a very, very family oriented state where it's very hard for single people/LGBT people to get approved. 

I've been secretly wanting a baby myself lately and would be fully willing to reduce my career to be a mom. I mentioned this to Bruce one evening and he asked me if I would ever consider having a kid with him. We'd have IVF done, co-parent. I have to admit it's really enticing. He's a great guy and I have no doubt he'd make a great father, and that we'd co-parent well together. He asked me to take a few weeks and think about it, weigh the pros and cons, which he is doing as well.

I'm close to my parents and I happened to mention to my mother that I was seriously considering doing this. She blew up on me. She said it's a stupid move to have a baby with someone you're not in a relationship with, and what if I meet someone or Bruce meets someone, what if he and I end up disliking each other. The way I see it, Bruce and I have discussed romance between the two of us and we both fully understand that while we platonically love each other we'll never be romantically or sexually attracted to each other. We're fine with that. There's literally no friction.

And if I have a baby, how is it really any different from a divorced parent, or a single parent, meeting someone and dating them? Step-children are a thing. Same goes for Bruce. I've mentioned the plan to a few friends and everyone is acting like this is the worst thing anyone has ever suggested. I've gone from wanting to say yes to feeling like some kind of creep. And my friends are making all sorts of assumptions about Bruce that are really unfair. Accusing him of being a cradle-robber even though there's only about sixteen years age difference and I'm a consenting adult.

1605,Not the A-hole,"Marijuana is legal where I live. It was Saturday morning and my friend and I wanted to smoke some weed. We don’t want my house to smell so I went outside my window to go out on the 2nd story roof. 

My neighbors across the street and I don’t ever usually converse. In fact, I don’t even know their first names. They were setting up tables in their driveway for some sort of Halloween party and all of a sudden I hear the couple saying
 “come on guys, give us a rest. I thought there was a skunk! You gotta respect the neighborhood”. 

My friend and I say sorry and we both are pretty upset that they would tell us what to do on my property.

I guess, I do not think that they have a right to tell us anything. Just like I don’t have a right to tell them not to set up a Halloween party in front of their house. 

AITA for smoking in front of my house on my roof?

1607,Not the A-hole,"I'm on a creative writing course, we had to write short stories. We're meant to write comments on each other's stories and feed back in class on Monday so we can improve based on the comments. There is this one person in class, ""Guy"", who asked me out a while back, and I said no because I'm a lesbian, but we've since struck up a friendship.

Two separate classmates messaged me saying ""have you read Guy's story yet?"" I say no. They say ""you should.""

I read it. The first thing that struck me was that the main character ""Dude"", was pretty much just a cooler version of ""Guy"". Dude is a real James Bond-esque character described as having similar physical traits to Guy and reads pretty much like a self insert. The writing isn't especially bad, but it's just kind of obvious that Dude is meant to be a sort of evolution of Guy.

I figured that was what they wanted me to see, but then another character was introduced... she is described as having very similar features to me, and her name is similar to mine. Not exactly the same but it's pretty much the difference between Kathy and Katie. Her dialogue and personality are also not entirely dissimilar to things I would say and do, and at one point she's described as wearing a dress identical to the one I wore to a social one time.

Here's the kicker: she's the love interest of Dude.

I talked to the people who said I should read Guy's story and they said, before I even said anything, that they also made the connection.

We're meant to go over the stories in class on Monday. I wouldn't directly ask (just in case I'm wrong but I'm pretty certain) but I might make him sweat a bit, just asking where he got his inspiration from and if the characters were based off anyone in particular.

However, in order to do this I'd have to ask him in front of the whole class, so unless I'm wrong and he has something prepared, I would basically be interrogating him in front of the entire class as to whether his main character and love interest are based on us.

WIBTA?

&#x200B;

More info on the story: the character who may or may not be based on me starts in a lesbian relationship, goes for drinks with Dude, and says ""everyone is a little bi"" before hooking up with Dude. There is a sex scene. Everyone in the class (35 people) have read this, and it can't be just the two people who made the link.

Also we are meant to ask questions about the story, and it's not unusual for people to ask about the inspiration behind a piece, but he's probably not expecting me to ask about it.

I could bring this up with the lecturer directly but there's some issues: she's the instructor, she can't make him change it, the most she can do is make suggestions. I asked my friend who works in the student union and she said this story *could* come under sexual harassment because of the sex scene, but as it's not explicitly stated that I'm the love interest in the story she's not convinced anything would come of it. I could bring *that* up to my lecturer but again best case scenario is that maybe she could outright tell him to get rid of it, but I'd have to prove it's me first. In any case, this has been sent to everyone in class, and 2 more people have asked me about it since I first posted this, so at least 4 people other than me have made the link.",283,1126,0.96

I found out that he has a tendency to find something that is interesting and likes to talk about or talk about something that is related to the movie during it. 

Now, I'm about with something like ""whoa, that was cool"" or ""awe. That's sad"" after a scene is over. However, my boyfriend does it while some important dialogue is being said. I've told him ""hold on, hun"", ""wait until this scene is over"", ""hold that thought"" in the nicest way possible. Then I just said ""when you want to talk, can you pause the movie? I want to hear what they say and not have to rewind"". He kept doing it so I just endured it. 

The night he left, I finished the remainder of the movies we had left to see because i didnt want to watch them if he was going to talk. 

This weekend, he came over again and ask me ""do you want to watch HP?"" And I said ""I finished them"". He got really upset and said ""why would you do that? I wanted to watch those with you."" And I said ""I want to know what's going on in the movie without any talking going on."". He just walked into the house all mopey and upset. When we got to my room, I just repeated what I said outside and he said ""you should be able to multitask"". That just grew into a whole fight.

1610,Not the A-hole,"So in my senior year of high school, we had a semester-long project that was basically our entire grade. It was a project to create a product and market it, with the STEM, Biomedical, and Business pathway programs teaming up in groups for it. I was one of the engineering students in my group, and this is about the business representative (I'll call her M) in our group. During all four months we had to work on this project, M rarely showed up, never did any work on the slides, and would avoid showing any actual work outside of the slides. Nearing the final presentation day, I emailed the teachers and her about how she didn't do any work, and that all the work on the project was our own. I respectfully asked that she be removed from our group, or at least given an F for the project. She replied and said that she had done work all year, and to look at the slides for her work. I exposed her again by showing the timestamp on her work, and pointing out all the mistakes and errors in what she threw together. I scrambled to fix her ""work"" before the final presentation. She was given an F for the project, and a very low grade overall for her pathway.

I singlehandedly made her fail the project. AITA?",69,328,0.96

I told him many times before hand that he couldn't have a party at our house, because 1. He didn't have permission. 2. I dislike his friends. 3. He doesn't have my permission either. 
Currently it's only me and my brother at home, my little sister who's one year younger is abroad at the moment, and my two other older siblings. Both over 20, live in other countries.

He told me a few weeks before hand that he would invite 5 people, on a certain day. Which I was okay with, as long as they kept to the top floor. We live in a large house, the upper floor is his main ground where there's 3 guestrooms, his room, and a spacious living room. My room is on the middle floor, close to the master bedroom where my parents sleep. My little sister has her room in the basement, and my little brother too. The day arrives, I was with friends for the better part of the that day, I got home at around 9 pm, and I hear his friends upstairs, I think nothing of it and won't bother them. I decide to go and sleep, and use my parents bed as it's much larger than my own, and more comfortable. I sleep until 11 pm when I wake up because they started playing loud music, people screaming. I step out of the bedroom and there's a lot more than 5 people, around 40 to say the least. We have a lot of expensive things around the house, which we're really careful off. I spoke to my brother in private, and told him he must make them all leave now. He refused and said that I should just keep to myself, and fuck off. He was quite drunk, I lost it.

I said I kick all of these people out myself, I started screaming at the people in the kitchen that they must ""get the fuck out of my house"", then I went to the backyard and there were three people chilling by the pool having a drink, I told them to leave right now, and went around the house for 3 minutes telling people in an aggressive Tone to get out. My brother tried to intervene, but he didn't really succeed, after a couple of minutes everyone except the 2 people were gone. Who were both close family friends.

1620,Asshole,"My family had planned to travel for a cousin’s destination wedding. The wedding was cancelled, so we transferred the flights to a different holiday. 

Between the wedding being arranged and cancelled, my wife became pregnant (planned), so we chose a destination which was a relatively short flight and more of a chill city break than a grand tour. 

All has fine with the pregnancy, relatively speaking. Except with a recent scan we found that the placenta has embedded low. The doctors said it isn’t necessarily a risk on its own, and travelling wouldn’t increase any risk - but if anything was to go wrong, it could be fairly catastrophic (lots of bleeding etc) so they banned her from flying. 

As the holiday was booked with the rest of the family I had to decide whether I would go with them and leave my wife behind (with her family for company, who it has to be said would definitely spoil her - though they live an hour and a half’s drive away). 

My wife and I discussed it and decided that since there was no real risk to her or the baby’s health, and since she had a strong support network at home (and it was only a short flight back if anything did go wrong) then I could go, but it would be nice if I stayed. 

The holiday has come and gone without any issue, but I still can’t square in my mind whether I was an asshole to go. 

For context:

- We could have got a full refund on both of our flights and my family would have covered the cost of our accommodation (wife got a refund, we all covered her accommodation). 

- My wife is currently suffering from pelvic girdle pain which means she’s quite limited in terms of what she can do at home and out and about (though she did spend 5 hours shopping for baby gear with her mum, and I think had a nice time doing it). 

- We discussed doing nice things around our home city instead of the trip, but I pointed out this is a false dichotomy and we can still have a nice weekend in the city as well as the holiday.

Last time I got a booking from this family for 3 nights. I don’t really like to host families since they are always the ones that complain the most and that caused the most problems, but money is money.

After a few hours they came I got a call from the wife saying that the house is too dirty and that they are leaving, to which i answered “I am sorry to hear that, you are free to do whatever you want”. I clean the house myself and it was not dirty at all, but of course for someone that lives in the city seeing a small spider in a corner can be a huge deal, still it seemed to me an exaggerate reaction from them to leave from just that and it is the first time it happened to me, but I have no intentions of giving their money back since it was their decision to leave, but I might get a bad review out of it on Booking, the first one for this apartment.

So, AITA?

Normally I'd just leave it at that, but here's the thing: they're filmed through a window. Like 2 buildings next to each other, and the bed is right next to a large, curtainless window in one building, and the camera is in the next building over pointed at the bedroom in the first building.

I assumed it was meant to be like that and everyone was aware/involved but after meeting her she really doesn't strike me as the type of person to do porn. Not saying there is a ""type"" but from having met her she's very religious, wears clothing that's baggy or full coverage, seems a bit shy in general, and she's an accountant. For all I know that's a concious choice she's made, like a persona she's created, so people don't link her to the videos, or it could be her actual personality, and she has no clue the videos exist.

1627,Not the A-hole," So this was probably 2 years ago but I'm curious to see what people think.

So I'm(24NB) an atheist, and my family hasn't always been supportive of that. Which is weird cause we never really went to church or anything growing up, but as soon as my family found out my mother and sister started putting religious pressure on me. And they are genuinely nice people but there were a few points where they got super mad at me, yelled at me, tried to guilt trip me. Whatever I'm chill and face them down calmly while they yell or fume or whatever and now they don't push the issue anymore. One incident does stick out in my mind though.

So my nephew(Probably about 4 at the time) was going to get some kind of blessing thing from the church. It's worth noting my sister converted to her husbands brand of christianity and so I had no clue what this would be. Of course my whole family is invited because we love the little booger and wanna support him so the fact that . So we go to this church we've never been to. I sit through a half hour of this church service. They got a guitar and sing about Jesus. Ok fine. They talk about having used the power of faith to heal people from stuff including HIV. Ok not so fine.

Finally my nephew comes out of wherever they keep the little kids during church service, he went on stage and got a piece of paper from the priest and people clapped. Priest says some nice words and congratulates him and then my nephew walks off back into wherever the kids are. People start singing and playing guitar again. I realize, oh fuck this wasn't a special service to just do the blessing thing for people, that was like 2 minutes tops, this is gonna be another hour and a half of them singing about Jesus.

So I excuse myself from where we were sat in the 2nd row of a large and full church and calmly walk out. Because hey I was there for my nephew, and he's not even in the main room anymore so I've fulfilled my family support. I leave. Told my dad I was leaving and left and wander around the neighborhood looking for something to do til they finish up. Eventually my sister starts texting me extremely angry and insulted that I walked out of church. I told her I was there for my nephew and don't believe in god so I didn't want to be there any more. And that began an argument where she felt I should have stayed and listened and sat through the whole service, and I felt I didn't need to because I didn't see a reason to want to stay. This isn't like a parent leaving the talent show after their kid goes. This is a 2 hour church service which was briefly paused by my nephews short ceremony.

So Am I the Asshole for not sitting through the whole service? I realize I probably broke a social norm to walk out of a church service, but I'm pretty sure that the rest of my family and the 400 strangers didn't care.",347,566,0.89

1630,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. My girlfriend (22f) and I (23m) had been together since 2nd semester of our freshman year in college (now seniors). Everything had been amazing for us and I planned on proposing this semester. I had an internship out-of-state this past summer but flew back every other weekend to see her.  


Earlier this semester, I had already bought a ring and was ready to propose. Several of my fraternity brothers knew about it and some even helped me plan it out. We ended up going to dinner on a Friday at a very nice restaurant and I began telling her about how much she meant to me, how much I loved her, and all that jazz. She broke down sobbing, huge ugly tears and everything. It was here that she confessed to having cheated on me while I was gone and it was tearing her up inside. Stunned, I broke up with her on the spot, paid for the dinner, and walked out on her.  


Over the next day, over a dozen of my fraternity brothers and other friends asked me how the proposal went. Then, word got out about what happened. Twenty more people were asking about what happened before Sunday ended. I have chapter on Mondays and didn't want to have go explain what happened any more; I just couldn't handle that emotional strain. So I wrote up an email explaining why I broke things up. I sent this to all 90 of my fraternity brothers.  


I received major flak from some of my ex's friends about ""airing out our dirty laundry for the world."" She has been ostracized by my brothers and, apparently, has been on the receiving end of ""hateful"" words (people are muttering ""whore"" and ""cheater"" as they walk by her). Among my close friends, there was a clear gender divide: the guys said I was justified but the girls were sympathetic, saying this was a private matter that I invited the rest of campus to weigh in on.

After I expressed this to my SO, some family drama went down. One of my parents pulled out of the wedding entirely and said they weren't coming. This broke my heart. Then my MIL asked if my SO's aunts (MIL's sisters) could attend the ceremony, when we said no she tried to guilt trip and manipulate us. We were at dinner and she refused to talk to us further.

After all this, my SO and I have agreed we no longer want the wedding because it's causing to much stress. We are unsure what we are going to do but are looking towards eloping. When we mentioned cancelling the wedding to my family, they all shrugged and basically said they didn't care. MIL and FIL got very upset, said that's not how their family works, they want to see us exchange vows and kiss and blah blah blah. MIL then said ""if you don't have a ceremony we are invited to, we would be so heartbroken we couldn't look or talk to you for a long time."" At this point I was over all the bullshit and responded ""don't threaten me with a good time."" Obviously they weren't happy with this and called me horrible, my SO isn't too impressed with me because he has to deal with this and pacify them and I kind of feel like after how my MIL acted, it was a little justified but I do feel really awful about what I said.

1632,Not the A-hole,"I'm using the app, so please forgive any errors. 

So, 4 of my friends are looking to rent out a workshop/garage as a hangout/place to fix shit. They have been looking for a few weeks now and the best they could find is one that will cost them £1500 a month, which they were about to settle on until they caught wind of something I set up with my brother. 

My brother also has a workshop that he rents out, but for £250 a month. He has such a cracking deal because I know the guy who owns it, technically I rent the workshop and my brother pays me as soon as it leaves my account. This is something I've had going with him for almost a year. 

My friends heard that if I was the one renting it, it would reduce the cost to £750 a month. They approached me and asked if I could do it to which I declined. I've had issues with 2 of the 4 friends when it comes to money. It nearly caused a massive rift but was soon rectified, however, I don't ever want to be put in this position again. When I said this to them they assured me it wouldn't happen again and think about all the times they have helped me out in the past blah blah. I told them once again no, I'm not going to use the workshop and all the liability falls on me. 

They called me a dickhead for not helping them out when they helped me in the past ( bad breakup, moral support, never financial)

1633,Not the A-hole,"I'm pretty confident that I'm NTA here but would like some input from my fellow redditors! So my mom and I have always had a pretty rocky relationship. Feel free to ask for details below. 
   
I found out I was pregnant in January and it was a surprise to say the least but she was supportive of me and super excited, bought me a pregnancy book and all of that. Well we were fighting over money and one of the times she made a remark saying she didn't know how I was gonna take care of my child if I couldnt pay her on time (I had money stolen from me and as a result was THREE days late on my car payment to her). Obviously this comment hurt me pretty fucking bad and I was pissed about it. 
   
Fast forward about a month later we got in another fight and that night I had a nightmare that we physically fought and she pushed me over hurting the baby in the process. I woke up super distraught and texted her telling her about the nightmare and saying that we couldn't keep fighting the way we were. She texted me back about the money but ignored my text about the dream until I brought it up again and her only response was ""Maybe if you did the things you said you would we wouldn't have an issue.""
   
 This was my final straw. I was so hurt and sad that she seemed to care more about the money than our relationship and I stopped talking to her completely. She tried to reach out to me a few times and I would talk to her on the phone but made it clear that I wasn't ready to talk to her on a regular basis again. 

   Once it got closer to my due date she was calling and texting me a lot and I finally sent her a text explaining that I understood she was excited about my son coming and that I would keep her updated but that I needed to be the one to reach out to her and not vice versa. She kept saying she wanted to meet him once I was ready and to let her know if she could help me with laundry or anything like that.

 So once he came I was sending her pictures and updates but after about 2 weeks she popped off with some shit about how she had already missed the crucial bonding process of the first few days and how I was being unfair to her and my son for not letting them meet and saying I needed to put my differences aside for them.
    
Then she started guilt tripping me saying I was going to realize one day what a mistake I was making and that hopefully it wasnt after she was dead. I havent talked to her at all or sent her any updates since then and it's been about a month. 
   
The more I've thought about it the more upset I get and I honestly just dont feel comfortable having her in my or my son's life with the things she's done to me. I've been a thousand times less stressed since not having her in my life and I only want my son to know positive relationships and not deal with the pain of having her in and out of our lives.

In the AM, I went to work. When I got back at 6pm, there was only one slice left- no longer enough for dinner. Nobody else was there, so one of the roommates must have eaten them. I asked them each individually... Not mad, just curious: "" hey did you eat my pizza ?"" Never did I imagine they'd both say no. So I was like wtf, one of you is lying to my face? 

Thing is, one roommate is always tracking macros and doesn't usually eat pizza. He easily convinced me it wasn't him, so that leaves my friend of 5 years lying to my face about something so assinine as pizza... Which makes me both disappointed and pissed, especially since my only reply to ""yes, I ate the pizza"" would have been ""oh ok cool"". 

Girlfriend and her friend are making fun of me for questioning my friend ("" dude you don't have to lie to me...I would not care"") while they're cracking jokes about a pizza bandit. Meanwhile I find this insulting enough to damage the friendship. Like I'd never lie to this friend about anything, much less a slice of pizza.

The event i'm wearing the shirt to is in 3 days. I brought it to her 5 weeks ago. When I came to pick it up a week after dropping it off, it didn't even button up. Okay. She pinned me again, told me to come back in a week. Same story the following week. And the following. And the following.

Last week, we got to the point where the shirt was so botched, she said she can only try one more thing and then she can't do anything anymore, there's no more fabric to work with. But she still insists I pay for the botched shirt. I know it won't fit, and it was so poorly stitched, it looks terrible.

I already bought TWO of that shirt, $35 each, and now i'm suppose to pay $40 for a shirt that I can't wear because it doesn't fit, and I have to go buy a shirt that does fit for the event? So that's $110 for a shirt i'm throwing in the garbage, and however much for a shirt that fits.

1638,Asshole,"For context, my husband and I have a strained relationship (we’re seeing a marriage counsellor). It is one built on codependence, where I have often been made to feel responsible for his loneliness. It led to some drastic decisions on my part, like giving up my business that I really enjoyed and felt fulfilled by. (He didn’t ask me to do so, but I felt it was the right choice at the time because I felt so stressed out trying to manage his expectations). We’re both trying to work on our marriage in the aftermath: bitterness and resentment from me, and his feeling that I’m holding grudges against him. 

On this occasion, I told him about the dinner that will be happening towards the latter half of Dec, and said I’d be cooking for them. He asked if I wanted him to be out of the house. Now thinking back, the phrasing of the question sounded strange, but I don’t have very good communication skills (I often sound harsher than I intend), so it didn’t pique much interest. I said there wasn’t a problem, he could be around. But seconds later, another thought struck me, and I said, hang on, probably a better idea of you’re not there - this isn’t a hangout where there will be partners in attendance. (Which is true). 

I immediately felt his emotions go down - the rhythm and mood of his interactions changed and I started feeling like I could have said things better, or not flip-flopped. 

The truth is, I didn’t really want him around, because even though he knows this group of friends, he often brings down the mood of any group I hang out with. People ask me whether he’s upset etc, and these friends once told me in confidence that I act very different around him. These are people I really care for, because we spent months in a  leader development program, and even though he knows them too, the relationship he has with them is definitely on the same level. 

I do feel like I’ve made the right choice, but I feel like an asshole, and in the interest of moving forward, I need to integrate some perspectives on how I was or wasn’t an asshole.

1639,Not the A-hole," Sorry this is kind of a long rant. I am a leasing agent at an apartment complex that my mom is a resident at. I work nights so I am alone in the office but it’s connected to the resident lounge and movie theater. A lot of residents spend time in the room right next to my office and sounds really carries so I know they can hear me if I’m having a conversation at a normal volume. My mom likes to come visit me while I’m working and occasionally bring me dinner which I don’t mind at all. However, she has a tendency to talk extremely loud and almost yell during conversations. I have asked her multiple times to be aware of her volume in my office especially because she swears a lot and we have some older and more conservative residents that I don’t want to offend. Tonight she very loudly told me that there was a “big black man who glared at her” sitting near the back exit so she needed to leave out the front door because she was uncomfortable.  I was absolutely mortified that she said this at a volume I know he could hear. I told her that that was really inappropriate to say and asked her to please just leave because I don’t want to have a conversation explaining why that’s not ok to say while at work. I told her I would continue this conversation after work but asked her to please just leave. Well, she started asking me how it was inappropriate and defending herself saying that she’s aloud to feel uncomfortable around strange men. I told her that she is but she doesn’t need to comment on his race and that it is extremely ignorant to be automatically afraid of a black man. She refused to leave and yelled  that because she is a resident I’m not allowed to kick her out of the office. She made a huge scene and eventually stormed out of the office. I am so embarrassed to have been yelled at by my mom in front of the residents and also for how blatantly ignorant she was being.  After she left, I texted her and basically said she is banned from the office because she obviously doesn’t know how to behave appropriately and she doesn’t seem to care about risking my job. Did I go to far by banning her from the office despite the fact that she is a resident? Im not sure what to do because technically she is entitled to use the lounge because she lives here but I really don’t want to get in trouble at work because of her actions. Also I’m not even sure I could I even get in trouble for something she says because it’s not like I have any control over her but my boss does know that she’s my mom so idk.

1640,Asshole,"In brackets/italics at the end of each paragraph is what my girlfriend thinks I should add. The asshole will be paying the vet bill/replacing her stuff.

My girlfriend (19) and I (23) have been dating for 4 months. She often stays at my place since we live 45 minutes away and she doesn't drive, so when I pick her up for dates it often gets late so we just crash at my place. Sometimes this results in her staying for a few days since I work. [*She says she would rather go on dates in her town and go home at the end of the night, but that I always make reservations at places close to me and then am too tired to drive her home and won't get up early enough before work to take her home, sometimes meaning she's at my place for days in a row unintentionally and gets stuck in my room the whole time since my roommate doesn't like visitors.*]

Today she called my place of work asking to speak to me saying my dog had just eaten a couple of her prescription medications and she had already called the vet and they said it was a lethal amount and the dog had to be brought in. She told me her mom was there and they'd drive her to the vet, but to meet them there. 

The vet ended up giving my dog medicine to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home) to unload everywhere. She is okay now. I asked my girlfriend what happened and she said that when her mom arrived (which I had no knowledge of and totally wouldn't have been okay with her having people over without me there) the dog would not stop barking and lunging for the door. My girlfriend has repeatedly said the dog isn't safe which just isn't true, so she locked the dog in our bedroom. Apparently while her mom was visiting, the dog chewed and destroyed all her things-- purse, clothing, bag of toiletries, etc.. [*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened, she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a room was the safest way to handle things. Her mom was there to bring her medicine and food, since I don't keep food at my place and don't want her eating my roommates things. She also says I'm only mad about her mom visiting because I don't like her.*]

Not only did my girlfriend refuse to clean up the vomit, but she won't pay me back for the vet bill and is asking me to pay half toward replacing her items. I think it's just crazy because if she didn't have her mom over without my permission, none of this would have happened. I ended up cleaning up the vomit, but the vet bill and cost of replacing her stuff (estimated to be $650 total) is up in the air.",1740,4606,0.9

1644,No A-holes here,"My (20F) best friend (20F) has recently announced she's engaged to her boyfriend of four months (22M), they're getting married in September 2021 and they're planning on moving in together next fall.

Even tho I think they make a great couple and she seems happy, I'm afraid they might be moving way too fast.

First of all they've only been dating for four months and known each other for five. This obviously doesn't mean they will most definitely break off the engagement or divorce right after the wedding, but they don't know each other that well and starting to plan and pay for the wedding after a few months together is like rolling the dice.

My friend doesn't even have a job at the moment, and has decided not to have one until after graduation (she will graduate in May 2021 or October of the same year), so she will have to depend economically entirely on her boyfriend, who has a good earning job as a receptionist for a 5-star hotel, when it comes to paying rent, maintaining the house and paying for the wedding.

I also think she might still be into her ex (20F), they broke up about two weeks before she and her boyfriend got together.

She talks about her all the time and she even said she wanted to invite her to the wedding to see her reaction, this and many other things make me think she might be moving this fast with her new partner because she wants (unconsciously) to show her ex-girlfriend that she can be with someone else and that she was wrong for breaking up with her.

What also worries me is the fact that she's always been a dreamer and has the tendency of making rushed and impulsive decisions because of a mere idea.

Last summer she dated a guy for a few months, he lived in a different continent and was only here for a few weeks for work.

She spent over a thousand euros to pay for the plane ticket to visit him but then, about a month before leaving, she got bored and broke up with him, wasting a lot of money.

I'm not saying this is what's going to happen this time, it's not my relationship so I don't know everything and I think it's great that she's talking about the future with her boyfriend, however I have reason to believe she might be doing this for the wrong reasons and I want to make sure she has analyzed the situation and knows exactly what she's doing and what her decisions are going to lead to.

A friend told me to let it go and keep my mouth shut since my friend is an adult and it's none of my business.

I disagree because even tho people are obviously free to make decisions for their lives, I am her best friend and I've known her for over 15 years. I don't think I know better, but I definitely do know her and I think that the opinion of someone who cares really much about you, knows you very well and sees things from an external point of view is extremely important. Other friends agree with me.

This means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it might help with context I’m 6’, 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

While in between sets, I’m standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

Like 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn’t exist.  So I move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don’t mean if I squint and stare, I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

No idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

“Hey this is super creepy, but I’d feel creepier if I didn’t say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.”

Again I thought I was being helpful and that she’d want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. This girl practically screams “You fucking pervert! Stop staring at my ass!” 

Not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.

You can ask 'Why don't the teachers do anything?"" and I'll answer it, I act like it doesn't matter, so the teachers don't take it too seriously, and have gotten used to ignoring it.

I was walking to class, and I wasn't really in it, I had been yelled at and my grades are beginning to slip due to me just slowly losing faith in myself, and this guy just yells at me 'Shut the fuck up, you disabled bitch' at me, and I didn't even speak.

I don't know what came over me, but I quickly yelled back at him 'Go join your parents!' and I instantly regretted it. I feel so awful, but  I was so sick of being treated like that.

They told me they were missionaries who just graduated HS, and gave me a copy of the Mormon bible.

I'm not religious at all, but I'm terrible at confronting people. I accepted the book, and told them I would consider reading it. 

They asked if they could come to my house again on Friday (today) at 7 PM, and I agreed (again, because I have a hard time saying no).

After they left, I closed the door, but i could still hear them outside. They were right in front of mine and my neighbors doors, and they were making laughing at the questions I asked them (i asked how old a person usually is when they're baptized). 

I can see why they laughed at my dumb questions, but I genuinely do not know much about christianity since I'm an atheist, and was born to a non christian family. 

I was a little butthurt I guess lmao, because I wasnt rude to them in any way, unlike my neighbors, and I was respectful of their faith. 

I let it go anyway, and my mom came home from work after a while. When she was back, I told her about how lame they were and I was making fun of them. I thought she would laugh too, but she just got really angry at me for opening the door to a stranger without her permission.

I apologized, and I told her I wouldn't open the door to them when they came back on Friday (today). I didnt plan on opening the door anyway, since they made fun of me literally right outside my house.

I was also dancing around a bit while I waited. This is a dive bar, so I'm not doing much, just grooving a little. I'm not a great dancer, I would say actually say I'm pretty bad, but it's fun, ya know?

He comes back and laughs at me a little and says ""man, you dance like such a white guy."" I laugh and say ""yeah, that's kind of funny you say that, my sister is adopted..."" at that point he kind of cuts me off. He says that's not ok to just randomly say, that it shouldn't matter.

Eventually I was able to explain that I was going to tell him that my sister tells me that I ""dance like a white guy"" all the time as well. I thought it was a funny thing, but he was pretty cold the rest of the night.

1655,Not the A-hole,"

Ok here it is.

Today is the day of a tournament I had to play in my game that I play. over $10,000 was on the line. I play in all the tournaments, I’m a semi professional at this game and I’m very experienced and typically my parents are..semi-supportive to say the least. 

Anyways I told my mom, and my dad who was coming to drop off my sister that I had to play in this tournament today and I couldn’t really talk all day. At first they were fine with this idea, “sure ok we won’t bother you, good luck have fun”. Ya know very understanding and very supportive. Now here’s where the AITA part comes in. 

Queue me playing the tournament,  I’m in the middle of a fight with a enemy player, all the sudden my dad and my ex-stepdad walk right into my room and they were expecting my full attention towards them, my mom walks in after them and nicely ask if I can pause the game real quick, and I told her “no I can’t I’m sorry I’m in the middle of this tournament I told you all about”. She goes “not even for a minute to talk to your dad?” “No I told you I can’t I’m sorry it’s just possible, if I was inbetween games it would be different but I’m in the middle of a fight as you can see.”

now I completely understand the frustration of everyone in the room right now, they wanted to talk to me.. but look, it’s not like I didn’t tell them or they weren’t completely aware if they walked into my room This exact situation wasnt going to happen.  My mom exits the room and I have a lack-luster conversation with my dad since I haven’t seen him since I got out the hospital about a month ago, he ask if I want to go out to eat and I tell him “I’m sorry I’m busy tonight, I have to do this” which he seems confused and mad at.

he gets frustrated and we start arguing..soon at the sounds of my dads raised voice my ex-stepdad and mom walk into the room and my mom tells me to turn off my computer.. and I tell her I can’t I’m playing the game. And she turns off my pc

after she unplugged it I asked her why and she started yelling at me saying “YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE NORMAL HUMAN INTERACTIONS AND BE ABLE TO HAVE DECENT MANNERS TO YOUR OWN FATHER AND *ex-stepdads name*!” 

At this point I’m dumbfounded. I gave her the comparison “mom, if my dad, your EX-HUSBAND walked into your office when you told him an hour before you have a work call to take and he still walked in and expected you to give him your 100% undivided attention would you give him that attention and hang the phone up right then and there” to which she was extremely offended that I compared video games to work. She said I’m done playing the tournament and we’re gonna have a long talk in the morning about this.

I’m honestly very confused and just feel very betrayed by my family. I feel like I did nothing wrong and I just lost a shit load of money for no reason other then my parents being egotistical.

Well on April fools day this year, I was at home and my wife was out with her sister for the day. No big deal. 

She had been out for about an hour when I got a message from her saying her water had broken. 

That’s funny, I thought, shes not due for another 5 weeks but oh well. She’s just joking. I put my phone down and continued to do my work. I saw one other message from her but thought she was joking still. I mean, it’s April fools!
 
Two hours passed and it wasn’t until I saw my sister in law calling and decided to answer. She then proceeded to scream at me, as my wife was now in the hospital and about to have our first child. Well, regardless of if she was joking or not, I jumped in my car and drove down 

Well, she wasn’t joking. After a few long hours, and a billion apologies to my wife, she said it was fine. She actually seemed to find it quite funny and said I inspired her for the next baby, but I should’ve known she wouldn’t pick a day as obvious as April fools. 

My wife seemed fine with it, but my SIL was livid at me. 

I’m pretty sure I know the answer here, but Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I saw a few comments mentioning this, and we were already planning to end the pranks once the kiddo was here!

EDIT2: Yes, me and the Mrs are now discussing code words for when/if we decide to carry on the pranks. Thank you for your suggestions!",398,3331,0.95

1658,Everyone Sucks,"Literally a shit post I suppose but here we go.

I’m a first year in college and I’m living on residence. On my floor we gotta bathroom that we all have to share. It’s gender neutral for some weird reason so both guys and girls use it, they’ve got no urinals only 3 stalls. Anyway so someone on our floor seems adamant not to flush the toilet after they’ve taken a dump, and it stinks up for the whole bathroom that we all gotta use. This has happened numerous times since the semester started and it’s disgusting as fuck. 

Anyway, so the other night I happen to notice a guy on my floor leave a stall without flushing and sure enough his dinner is in the toilet. I get super awkward using the bathroom with other people around so I tend to just wait until other people leave outside, so he didn’t notice me. I’ve never spoken a word to this kid and I’ve only ever heard him speaking Chinese.

Anyway so I flush the toilet and decide to write a sticky note on his door saying “this dude is the guy who keeps leaving his shit in the toilet, please learn to fucking flush.” Anyway long story short the uh Floor Leader (and older student whose supposed to like make sure we behave I think?) calls a floor meeting and says that leaving rude notes on people’s doors is not allowed and that whoever did it should step forward and apologize. I didn’t. Everyone on the floor knows who the culprit is now. Should I feel like shit or did I do the right thing embarrassing him?",89,435,0.94

1661,Not the A-hole,"I'm 34, my Dad and Stepmom live several states away from us and I don't see them very often. They have a fairly toxic relationship with each other and my sister but for the most part they treat me decent and we're able to get along.

My wife was changing jobs and was going to be without insurance for 2 months unless we paid for cobra; we talked it over with some close friends and decided we'd just get married because one of our friends was ordained.  Afterwards we were excited and my wife went and got her name changed to have my last name (clearly a bad idea in retrospect).

My Stepmom was searching her name (she now has the same last name as my wife) for some reason or another and found a new Mrs. *Insert last name here*, she was shocked and told my Dad and then she sent me a text message asking me what was up and was generally being fairly cool about it.  I responded to her and then her response was roughly...

You're being dishonest to everyone coming to your wedding by not telling them you're already married,. You're just trying to get gifts and make out with money on this.  You should be embarrassed deceiving everyone about this.  You're damaging the institution of marriage by calling this sham marriage a real one.  No one would be willing to give you presents had they known you already were married. I have serious concerns about who you're turning into.

There's more but Its just kinda making me sick to look at....

My Dad echoed the same thoughts as my stepmom in a subsequent phone conversation and didn't sound happy for me at all. I of course apologized to him for making him feel out of the loop.  His wife sent text message after text message to me shaming me over and over and over. I ignored them as best I could until I just had to call him up again and bitch him out.  It'd be one thing if he just yielded his opinion and went on his way, but he is relentlessly telling me, or at the very least telling and agreeing with his wife, that I'm wrong, a shitty person and need to fix it as much as I can by changing our wedding invitations to read ""vow renewal"" and not wedding.

""About what???""

""I still don't think you're gay""

He knows me and this girl are dating, and that we are in fact, a gay couple. He goes on and on about how shes not actually gay, and how its because she was actually just hurt too much. He goes on to say how its weird and wrong and sending her to hell.

Again, he knows we are dating, and she is head over heels into me. Every day he texts, saying that being gay is wrong. And that he is crushing on her.

So today, I got on the bus, and he was there too, minding his own business. I asked him if he was down for an act of aggression. He shrugs and said yes. So I lean over, look him in the eyes and smile, just a bit. ""Gf's lips taste so good""

He looked at me, destroyed, ""What do you want?""

1665,Not the A-hole," 

So to begin, I have lived by myself for around 2 years. I've grown accustomed to my free time, having my girlfriend over, the little things. Well, about 3 months ago an old friend asked if he could move into my spare room until the house he planned to move into opened up. I agreed, and he lived here for the time. Aside from the cramped style, there were some general issues that I did not appreciate (dirty dishes, using my shampoo, never cleaned) he was fine. On his way out, he asked if he could keep the keys, since he's moving about an hour out of town, he was worried about being tired after work, or in our area, a snow impeding his path. I offered to work out an AirBnB type situation, where he might give me $10 a night for the inconvenience. He didn't appreciate it. After walking him to his vehicle, he asked if he could hang out in my place during his off time (he has a 2 hr window between portions of his job) a few times a week. This time period ranges between 3-6pm, and this being the time in my day when I am getting off of work, I said maybe he could pay me a small portion of rent for the inconvenience, again he was offended.

In my head, it makes sense, but I can see why asking for compensation would be rude. I don't really want a person being in my space when I intend to wind down, but I think he sees it more as friends hanging out.

TLDR: Old friend wants to use my apartment as a space that he can hang out in and sleep when he wants. I asked for compensation and offended him.",20,61,0.91

1667,Not the A-hole,"So a little backstory, my parents separated when I was around 11. My father kept the house, while my siblings and I moved out with my mom. (Siblings have a different father than me). Since then, the major holidays(xmas, thanksgiving), she has made sure that we gather to her house for them. In result, that means I have never spent a holiday with my father. 

Now every year that we all get together, our significant others go to their own parents house and us siblings to my mothers. It has never truly felt like a real holiday because every year it feels like we're forced to be there. 

This year, my brother has decided that he's going to his fiance's parents house for Thanksgiving. In a group chat, my mom announces a few days ago that we need to RSVP for Thanksgiving at her house and to bring our SOs. My brother informs her of their reservations with his fiance. My mother responds with a petty response of ""Oh do I need to book you now to make sure you to come next year"". 

My father and I have discussed how he'd like for me to spend Thanksgiving with him this year. I agreed that it'd be nice since I would like to spend this holiday stress free and stuffed fat with food without any drama. 

My siblings and I are kinda on the same page about not being to fond of our mother. She's a textbook narcissist with a lot of problems so I know that atleast I couldn't care less about not spending holiday up there. 

When she asked me if I was going to RSVP, I told her, no and explained why. She guilt tripped me the entire conversation about how shes sick(cancer stuff) and it's the only time us kids get together or that it's the only time I see her and how since I live with my father, I'm obligated to spend another holiday with her.

Basically I feel like a jackass for bailing on Thanksgiving with her. She planned for her husband's family to all come and have a big get together expecting all of us to come and now she's let down that her own children won't be there. All I can think about is how she's gonna be all sad and mopey on Thanksgiving wishing her kids were with her. I'm not really sure if I'm in the wrong for deciding to not go when its important to her.

1668,Asshole,"When my parents passed away they left their estate to me to later divide the funds up between our three children.
We did sell the property, and kept the money in a safe account that can be used for the kids when they needed it, or until they could legally handle it on their own.

My eldest daughter (28) wanted her full share for a house, my son (19) wanted his for his schooling, and my younger daughter (23) used about 80% of hers for her wedding. 
My wife and I didn’t think she should use so much of on a one day event, especially because she also has mentioned that she does want to own property as well so it would of been better off going towards a down payment. But She insisted, so that’s what she did. 

My youngest recently came to us and told us that she wants the remaining money and that she is planning on getting a breast augmentation with it. 

My wife and I think this a ridiculous idea and a complete waste of money. She has this crazy notion when she was a teenager as well, but we figured she would have grown out of it.
We have always taught her to be confident and to love her body. We have praised her and told her she’s beautiful. Why would she go and potentially hurt her body and lose respect for herself. She can be left with a million complications.

My eldest daughter has been having fertility issues and has been going through IVF for the last two years, and need money for more treatment. She has acquired a lot of financial debt and her and her SO have been having serious money issues. My wife and I both have agreed that the money would be better suited going towards them to finally be able to have a family. I am positive this is what my parents would have wanted as well.

My youngest is throwing a fit and accused us of stealing from her. We told her that if she’s adult enough to get a boob job, she’s adult enough to pay for it with her own money. I really thought she would have more compassion towards her sister.",355,204,0.77

It's been two weeks and I'm freaking exhausted and in serious need of more sleep but my husband refuses to wake up during the night to take care of the baby. He just says just call MIL or tell him to let her help and that she would be happy to. He just says why am I trying to punish all three of us when we could all get what we want. He can get his sleep, I can get my sleep and MIL will feel happy that she gets to help out and it hurt her feelings when she thought I didn't want her around.

So as everyone knows yesterday was Halloween. Being that I was off I decided to run so errands, but have a little fun while doing them. In the spirit of the day, I dress up as Slenderman and just went arrived town in costume. I pretty much just went in to work chatted with coworkers, grocery shopped, ran to the post office, and stop in a restaurant to eat. Fun day with a few people liking my costume and a few wanting to take pictures with me. So, after all, that was said and done I decided since I was near my favorite cupcake shop to stop in. They have the best cupcakes in the city, but I only go every few months because they're $3 each.

Anyway fast forward a bit. I get 6 of them and head back to my apartment. When I get home my Roommate, his GF, and her kid are there. I say hey to them all and start to head for my room. This is when the daughter stops me and asks what's in the box. I tell her in cupcakes and she proceeds to ask if she can have one. I politely say no and go to leave the living room again, but before I could the GF chimes in saying ""Would it really kill you to give her one?"" She said this in a tone I feel someone would say if they feel superior to you but are trying to fake being nice. It could be a bit of bias there. I just look at her and calmly say ""No it won't kill me, but this is something I bought for myself to enjoy on my day off and don't have to share with anyone."" I can tell she wants to say something else, but I'm not in the mood for it. They left sometime after that I think.

I never raise my voice to either of them, my response to his GF may have been a snarky depending on how you took it, but that's only because she chose to be nasty towards me.

1688,Not the A-hole,"My husband ""Jack"" and I are currently separated. We're both in our mid-thirties. Married for 3 years, together for 7. We drunkenly hooked up a few months ago and that led to me unexpectedly becoming pregnant. No other children. Despite this pregnancy, neither of us are interested in trying to work things out as a couple and have agreed a divorce would be best. Unfortunately, our state prevents us from seeking a divorce until after the baby is born. I'm only in the second trimester right now. Jack and I are living apart.

I don't want to go into too much detail about why my marriage broke down, but I will say it wasn't due to infidelity or abuse (although things did get pretty toxic toward the end, on both of our parts). I don't think either of us are bad people. We are just really bad as a couple, and it took us way too long to accept that. We plan to seek joint (50/50) custody of our child and I hope we're able to coparent in a healthy way. I don't intend to do anything to keep Jack from seeing the baby once he or she is born.

However, I want Jack involved with this pregnancy as little as possible. For a multitude of reasons, being around him is stressful and painful for me. My pregnancy is not considered ""high risk"" but there have been a few complications so far. Nothing too serious yet, thankfully, but still. I don't want to risk anything happening to the baby so I'm doing everything I can to reduce stressors and dangers (for instance, I've started working at home so I can rest as much as possible).

That being said, I have told him he's not welcome at future appointments. I will send him all the pictures and videos the doctor gives me, and keep him updated on how the baby is doing at all times, but I don't want him physically there during ultrasounds. If we do have to see each other, like for another legal proceeding, I don't want him touching my belly. I don't want him in the room when I give birth. He's welcome to wait right outside to see the baby as soon as he or she is born - but when I'm pushing in active labor, I don't want to see him.

This has (understandably) hurt him greatly and he's accused me of trying to keep him away from the baby. Like I mentioned above, that is not my intention here. I want him to play an active role in our son or daughter's life. I respect his rights as a father. However, from my point of view, since the baby is obviously still inside of me, and will be for some time, I still have the right to my own body, and that includes telling him he can't touch me or be present for medical procedures. Is this a reasonable perspective, or AITA here?v

Edit - I originally posted this as a reply to another user but I'm going to copy it here too for additional context:

We've tried therapy, both before and after we separated earlier this year. Unfortunately, it wasn't successful. We both have just grown apart and become fundamentally different people. He's a different person now than he was when we first got married, and he has different needs from a partner that I can't meet. Same goes for me. There isn't a 'bad guy' in this situation, in my view. Just two messy, flawed people who were once compatible but no longer are.

I love my husband. I don't know that I'm in still love with him, but I definitely have love for him. There is an idealistic part of me that would love for us to work things out and be a happy family again - but that isn't possible. It's no one's fault. It just is what it is.

1690,Not the A-hole," My fiance was laid off in March. I myself took a promotion in April, and he found a job in May. His new job is a five hour drive away, so we agreed the easiest thing would be to split weekends, with each of us driving two weekends a month. I have three kids, two 3 year olds and a 5 year old. He's gone from 7-5 for work during the week, Saturday is the only full day we have together.

The first weekend at the apartment, he got up and left for work at 7. I could hear the kids talking in their bedroom while in bed. I got up and dressed, bringing them into the dining room to wait for breakfast. At this point it was approximately 7:10, and there was knocking on the door. It was the downstairs neighbor, explaining he worked nights and was trying to sleep, so could we keep it down? I didn't think we were being loud at all but I agreed. When the kids get up in the morning they walk to the table for breakfast, then walk over to the couch where we watch a movie. They go down for a nap between 11 and noon and are down until approximately 1. The kids area never allowed to run, jump, or scream indoors, and I've taught them to walk on their tiptoes but they forget. They're in bed by 8 at the latest.

In August, the same neighbor came to the door again, this time around 1 in the afternoon. The kids had been sitting around playing with their Lego blocks, not being loud at all. This time he brought his dog, and he wasn't really trying to hold it and it was trying to jump on me. He started saying how he knew my fiance wasn't home, we were obviously jumping around because the pictures were falling off their walls, and I needed to take my kids outside to play (in 95 degree weather). I basically told him that I took my kids to the playground in the cool of the morning and evening, and I didn't know what to tell him but the kids had been coloring and playing Legos all morning. I later told my fiance about this and he got pissed, because dude targeted me knowing he wasn't home and it seemed like he brought the dog for intimidation, as it is a big dog.

After that, it's been hell. At least once a visit, he'll start pounding, almost always in middle of the day. During our last visit, around 11:30 in the day, my son fell down walking to the bedroom for a nap. He called the apartment complex to file a noise complaint and told the complex there were five people living in our apartment, which is a lie. We know this because the woman working the office called and told us this, and that the guy complaining about us isn't even on the lease. We've overlooked some of the sounds from them, like arguing with doors slamming, loud music, and their dog constantly barking, because we know that's part of apartment living. I'm not saying my kids are quiet all the time, but the pounding is never when the kids are actually being rowdy. AITA for not doing more to keep the kids quiet during the day?",48,109,0.86
1691,Not the A-hole,"I own a liquor store in the suburbs. Overall the area is decently safe, especially compared to the city.

Two weeks ago, a young man and one of his friends came into the store and ran off with bottles of liquor. We reported them to law enforcement with the license plates. Officers tracked them and asked if we want to pursue charges. 

Two days later one of the kids mothers comes by and begs me to drop the charges. She says her son is the first one in the family to go to college and that he has a scholarship and that if the university finds out they will rescind their offer, and the scholarship.

I told her I am sorry but I already have made up my mind. Since then people in the community have treated me much worse I believe she probably told a lot of people I don’t know her version of events. 

But now I am a being seen as a horrible person. And that I am directly responsible for what the university chooses to do. And people are saying that if a white kid robbed me that I wouldn’t have went to the police. And this is not true, I am an equal opportunity reporter

I don’t know what’s going on to be honest, it also appears that he had a previous criminal record as well.

1692,Not the A-hole,"Last night on Halloween I came home from trick or treating with friends( we went as a joke between all of us) and my grandma was around. She lives in another state so she’s not around too often. My mom asked me to spend time with everyone and I happily obliged because I love my grandma. While I was sitting with them somehow we got onto the topic of evolution. My grandmother and my mom both being very Christian straight up told me my beliefs in evolution were wrong and that there is no scientific evidence to back it up. I whipped back with facts and they still denied me. This got me pretty upset. I can handle being wrong but I can’t stand it when someone tells me I’m wrong for thinking a certain way. I pushed down those feelings of anger to have a good time but then almost immediately my mom makes a joke about how they’re only teaching me how to be a Democrat in school and I only believe in what my friends believe in. This absolutely set me off. I didn’t want to be rude or get angry at my mom so I got up to go back to my room and she kept telling me to come back and I lost it and yelled “No! Leave me alone!” And stormed off to my room. She chased me down and grounded me and had me pick up my room. She kept picking and picking and it sent me into a panic attack so I went to bed. This morning she came to talk to me but I refused to say a word to her. I decided that if she doesn’t apologize for what she said and how she made me feel then I’m not going to feel sorry for sticking up for myself and she can deal with the silent treatment. AITA here?

1694,Asshole,"My son is 7. A few weeks ago I asked him what he wanted to be for Halloween. He said Spider-man. My brother has a son that was spider-man 2 years ago so I figured we could just use his costume instead of buying another one. When I showed it to my son last week my son was like ""No I want to be the Miles Spider-man from the movie. The black costume!"" 

The costume that my brother gave me was a very high quality costume that cost like $100. I thought he was being unnecessarily picky. I said it was the same thing and that they were both Spider-man. but my son was very adamant that he wanted to specifically be the Spider-man from the  movie ""into the spider-verse"" that came out recently. My wife said I was being dumb and should just  quickly order one from amazon prime since we still had a week. But I thought this was really ridiculous and he was being fussy. I even said he could wear a jean jacket and cargo shorts over the costume so he could like the character did in the movie. 

He eventually said that if he couldn't be in the black costume he didn't want to be spider-man and just went as Darth Vader like he did last year., When he came back he said he saw someone in the costume he wanted to wear and he again was angry.

1696,Not the A-hole,"Ok so this happened yesterday and I am still in shock.

Our relationship had been going badly 4/6 months we were in it. He lacked overall care and concern for me, we argued constantly about expectations and boundaries. It was overall a nightmare.

Just last week I had called for a break. His derogatory behaviour towards me had wore me down so I asked for time alone for a week. After that was done he wrote me a letter apologizing for everything he’s done and promising to change. I accepted the apology and moved on.

On Monday, he called for another break. 3 days after ours had ended. He gave reasons for why he wanted it but it seemed suspicious. These issues he brought up should’ve been dealt with a long time ago. 

So I decided to text his ex. She has messaged me in the beginning of the relationship warning me about him. That he’s a liar and is just using me like he did to her. Of course I just brushed that off but it turned out to be the full truth.

She told me all the stuff he did to her, and like clockwork, everything was happening the same to me. She told me he was constantly calling and texting her while me and him were together. Talking shit about me and asking her if she would give him another chance. I know this isn’t a ploy for her to start anything because she recited details that he talking about that only he would know.

At this point I was livid, and even though he called for a break, I decided to confront him about it. I told him everything she told me and he never batted an eye. No emotions. I told him I was done, we’ve over, still nothing. I talked to him about all the lies his told me and he admitted that he was a compulsive liar and there isn’t much truth he has said in our relationship. He also told me that from the beginning I was just something to “fill his void” and he used me for sex to satisfy himself. All the while making me think he cared about me. He told me he just has no care for he people in his relationships, and he has no desire to make them happy, they are only for his use. I begged him not to do this to another poor girl but he just told me he can’t be alone, this will happen again. This is what he does, he needs it.

He has so much disregard for other humans. He gets in relationships for the sole purpose of using the other person until they can’t take it anymore. That’s his fun, he manipulates people.

This is where my dilemma comes in. He is still living at his moms house and going to school. I don’t know if I should warn her about this behaviour because he needs serious help and he needs it now. Nobody deserves what he does to his partners, and he has no remorse so he will keep doing it as long as he’s able. That’s no way to live life.

1699,Not the A-hole,"Hi

So me and my gf are both university students. Obviously this comes with tests and assignments and all that good stuff. The problem is that she never EVER studies for them. Never. It’s kind of astonishing how she made it here In the first place without studying. Like she’ll have a test and be really freaked out about it and just. Won’t. Study. She has ADHD and takes Medication (vyvanse) for it, if that matters. She’s also convinced that she has a learning disability like dyslexia or something else. I advised her to go to therapy and/or a psychiatrist if that’s what she really thinks but no matter how much I push her, which I only do because she keeps bringing it up, she doesn’t go and so her situation doesn’t get better. She always asks me for advice with studying, because I have ADHD too, and I give her study tips and ways to make studying effective but she honestly never listens to me.

So yesterday, I was at work for a lot of the day and when I got back to her place she was freaking out, and I asked her what’s wrong. And she said she has a test tomorrow and she’s not at all prepared for it. I was flabbergasted, she’s been at home all day (she doesn’t have class Tuesday’s and Thursday’s). I asked her what she did all day and she says she spent it watching Netflix. She called herself a “big retard” and “fucking stupid” , not in a self-deprecating way, and asked me for advice again and I just kind of gave a sigh And she got defensive and asked what she did wrong. And I said to her, “look, If I’m being honest I don’t really want to give you any advice because it’ll be the same as what I always say, and it’ll be the same advice that you always choose to ignore. At a certain point, all it boils down to is that you have to Actually want to succeed, and put yourself in a position to succeed. You should also stop calling yourself stupid and a retard because it’s a self-perpetuating cycle and eventually if you say it to yourself enough times then you’ll actually believe it.” 

She started crying and had a full blown breakdown, and she says she feels I insinuated that she’s being lazy. But that’s not the case, I’m just fatigued because it’s like having to deal with someone who doesn’t want to succeed and then acts shocked when they fail.

1702,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys,  


I'm a busdriver in the Netherlands, and I had a bit of an argument with one of my passengers yesterday. This was the situation.  


I was driving my bus during rush-hour, and my take off point is at one of the busiest bus/train stations in the country. During this time the bus is always crowded, and I try to take as many people as I safely can. We have rules in place for how many people can be seated in the bus and how many can stand during the drives.  
When I arrived at the first stop, there were a lot of people waiting to get on so I knew I wouldn't be able to take everyone. At that point, it's first come first serve. People started crowding in and soon all the seats were taken, and there was very little room left to stand as well.  


In comes a lady with two kids and immediately starts scanning their tickets to pay the fare. When she scanned the first one I started telling her that the bus was nearly full, and I couldn't let her kids stand in the path due to safety rules. Her kids were around 8 years old I think. She asked me if I could please use my intercom to ask if people were willing to give up their seats for her kids so they could go home. I told her something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, but I can't ask people to do that. It's busy and these people have a right to a seat as well. Please take the next bus, it'll be here in ten minutes and make sure you stand at the right place to get in first."" She asked me the same thing a few times more, but my answer remained the same and I asked her again to please exit the bus so I could go.

She then proceeded to scan the kids' tickets and moved into the bus while telling me I was being unreasonable and rude by not asking people to move and asking her to get out. I asked her again to leave, but she refused time and time again, stating that the kids would hold on and would be safe and that I was basically being a dick. This went on for about 5 minutes, and I had to call my supervisor who said that I was right, but should go anyway to not delay further. They would make note of it that if she would put in a complaint that they have my back.  


So I started my route, and during the ride the woman started apologizing to other passengers for the delay and that it was all my fault and she did nothing wrong and would put in a complaint with the bus company. Eventually a few people got up and let them sit, so safety wasn't my concern anymore at least.  


So Reddit, AITA for not asking other people to leave their seats, while she could've waited 10 minutes for the next bus? I got the feeling she was starting to get some people on her side as well, but I was just following the safety regulations so I don't think I did anything wrong.",158,680,0.95

1705,Not the A-hole,"So here’s the set up:


My street is VERY tiny but also has street parking. Due to the street parking, only one car can go at a time. Turning around is a BITCH. 


A few of the neighbors have a driveway, including the neighbor directly across from me. I do not have a driveway. It’s just a dirt path that has to stay clear because it leads to a back side street. Sorry if this is confusing but we live in a historic district with very awkward layouts. 


Anyway, every day when I have to leave for work, I pull in to my dirt path and back out. When I back out, the tail end of my car goes in to my neighbors driveway


NOTE: I have never driven on their grass or yard—strictly the edge of their driveway. I don’t even go in, just enough to back my car up a bit to turn around.



Recently, my neighbor put up cones in her driveway every morning. They are gone by the time I get home from work. To me, this was incredibly petty. Like, i can’t use the EDGE of your driveway to back up? I’m not parking there, going in your yard, or blocking anyone in. I’m just turning around to go to work. 



So I started hitting the cones. Just a little bump because I barely need that much space to turn around but if they are in my way and get a little bump, oh well. Doesn’t hurt my car.



Now my neighbor has told on me to my landlord. My landlord thinks she’s a crazy bitch but gave me a heads up just in case I want to keep the peace with her. He doesn’t care what I do.

Unfortunately, I have not.

I haven't been able to make much of any progress because I would have to do it daily and I've already spent almost $300 on this.

1708,Not the A-hole,"I live in the Bible belt and work in a retail store in a customer-facing position. My GM likes to make holidays fun and encourages us to wear small accessories each holiday, like leprechaun hats on St. Patrick's Day or bunny ears on Easter, Santa hats on Christmas, etc.


I have somehow managed to not be scheduled for Halloween the past two years so Halloween accessories never came up. I sent an email at the beginning of the month asking if Halloween accessories were allowed to be worn to all 6 of the managers in my store, including the GM. Every one of them responded with some version of ""I don't see why not"" except the GM, who was on vacation. I did email him solely to ask when he came back, but he didn't answer it and then left again for a business trip.


Well I was scheduled yesterday so I wore a witch hat and wore my pentacle necklace I usually wear inside my shirt outside of it, and I had a pen shaped like a witch's broom with pentacles carved into the ""handle"" of the broom. Within a few moments of me getting there I was asked by the GM to remove my hat and put the pen away and tuck my necklace back inside my shirt because ""it had offended customers"" and it ""wasnt allowed"". I asked why not because not a lot of people in my store dressed up, but another employee was wearing a unicorn horn, one had cat ears and another was wearing a Bob Ross wig and had a fake paint palette, and one had fake vampire teeth and contacts. The GM just said he didn't approve of ""certain aspects"" of my costume and to take everything off because customers complained. 


I am Wiccan (no I don't actually think I can do magic, before anyone asks) and I love Halloween because it's a religious holiday for me, and the pentacle is a religious symbol. My GM knows that, I'm not obnoxious about it but when asked about religion I didn't lie. At Christmas I wear a crown of berries and holly instead of a Santa hat, on Easter I wear a flower circlet instead of bunny ears, etc., so he's never cared before until I outwardly showed a symbol of my religion. I asked other managers if customers complained and they said no, they hadn't heard anything. 


 I want to report my GM to corporate HR for discrimination, because I was the only employee targeted for ""an inappropriate costume"" and I feel like I was targeted for displaying religious symbols.

I'm going to give a bit of a backstory only because I think it's relevant. I've been married 14 years to an incredible guy and we ended up with 3 kids. 8 years old, 5 years old, and 3 years old. We both used to be pretty athletic pre-kids and both picked up I hate to say it quite a bit of weight. I had a bit of a health scare after our 3rd kid was born. And, I took my health more seriously and dropped a good bit of weight along with feel absolutely incredible in comparison to where I was before. I tried to take my husband on this journey with me... but he wasn't ready. He was half-committed to the effort. 

So, boom. It's Halloween. All the kids are dressed up. Which was an exhausting effort in and of itself. And, we are heading out where I see my husband sitting in the van waiting for us to pile in. I stood there surprised. We live in one of those cookie cutter suburbia neighborhoods where we can walk door to door to all our neighbors without being on a highway or something. I told him we could just walk instead of having to pile everyone in and out of the car(strapping in car seats between each house too). He was totally against it said it would be safer this way and that it would be too much work to do all that walking complaining about being tired from work. Meanwhile, beside him there's a pile of candy wrappers from him snacking on our Halloween candy we were leaving in a bowl.

At this point I tell him if he's driving he can follow behind us in the car. And, he throws yet another mini-chocolate in his mouth and says fine. So, I walked the entire night in my Wonder Woman costume with my Captain Marvel, Spider-man, and Batman kids while he just watched us from the street. We got so many compliments and he wasn't apart of the experience. One neighbor told me I was the real treat of the night because of my costume and it helped cheer me up a little. He even put a little airplane bottle of liquor in my candy bucket. Ha.

We finish up and get home. Kids are in bed and we are sorting through the candy checking to make sure it's unopened. He sees the airplane bottle of liquor and kinda freaks out. I tell him that some guy gave it to me what I didn't notice is that had slipped his phone number in the bucket too. Basically all hell broke loose. I'm telling him it's not my fault he flirted with me but if he was there with me maybe it wouldn't have happened. And, my husband is all upset we didn't just ride with him and I'm just so over it.

Its something I have been putting up with for the last 8 years, he gets the most awful gifts, and even though the thought is there, he never seems to get the hang of it.

For example last year for my birthday he asked me what I wanted, I replied with a picture of a pink ipad case with white spots on...what do I get? A plush hippo ipad case... he tends to see the item itself, not the specifics (so I ask for a pink lipstick and he gets me a blue one for example) even when I specify I like this one because it's pink etc.

I have tried to politely raise this with him over the years, as it was getting to the point where I would dread opening my gifts because I was worried about what would be inside, I haven't had one gift from him I have ever kept, they have always had to be exchanged or taken back.

He obviously gets a bit upset about this.

My issue is, today is my birthday, and he has gone out and gotten me a coat... It's a good quality coat, it's an expensive coat, but its god damn awful (think leather leopard print biker jacket - I have never worn leopard print in my life and hope to keep this going)

I will never wear it, and since it's expensive I want to ask him to return it, or exchange for one I will wear (otherwise it will be a waste) however I am wondering if I would be the asshole to ask him to do this yet again and make him feel bad :( if the coat was in some way redeemable, then I would wear it a couple of times then banish it to the back of the wardrobe, but its so, so, so bad.",387,1153,0.96

I went back, finished my degree, and did it with no support from my family.

They have also made fun of me for taking a year off of my degree to look after my daughter, joking that I had a kid because I needed a ""break before studying got too hard"". They've also been ""backseat parenting"", telling me how I should raise my kid, which I didn't appreciate. Everything they said came from a place of love or concern but it irritated me and I talked to them about it multiple times but they never eased up.

When moving day came, I contacted my family (parents and brothers) and talked with them. They were short calls where I said I was moving for this new job, and when I told them what it was I got yelled at by my parents and hung up on them. I refused to give an address.

After the move I got a new phone with a new number, and sent an email to the father with my new contact information and address, as while he isn't involved, we agreed to keep the lines of communication open. He thanked me and wished us best of luck.

I've also posted twice on social media since the move, one picture of me and my daughter in our new home, and another is a video of my daughter on the swing set in the back garden. I replied to some comments and direct messages, but avoided the ones asking where we were or what our new address was.

Then I get a call on my new number. It's from my mother. She is *screaming* down the line, asking how I could just up and move to Ireland without telling anyone. I asked how she found out and she said that she ran into the father and he gave her my new contact info. She's really upset that I moved without telling her, and I said that I shouldn't have to tell her everything.

My father then yells at me, saying they were worried sick and couldn't believe I'd move without telling them. I think this is ridiculous as it's not like I just disappeared, I told them I was moving, and I'm 27 years old, not a child.

1719,Not the A-hole,"I work as a consultant and meet many people in my travels. I usually stick to myself, but this time is different. 

So far, I was only hanging out with other females, and then worked up to hanging out with females with some males around. 

A guy that works with me has been a work acquaintance for the last couple days. He was kinda funny and helped the long shifts go by. Last Friday was my birthday, and he wanted to take me out, but I wasn’t comfortable and declined. Since then, we talk a lot at work, but I’m not interested in anything outside of work with him alone. A couple days ago, another coworker invited a lot of us out for drinks after work. The same guy sat next to me. He didn’t order anything, but paid for my 2 drinks. He said it was a late birthday gift. I told him thank you and that he shouldn’t expect anything from me, and he said “ I know it’ll take more than $20 to get in your pants.” Because I don’t know him well, I didn’t know how to feel about that comment that was intended as a joke, so I just stored it in the back of my mind. I decided to continue to be friendly with him. 

Yesterday, he invited me out to Lunch, and I only went because an older man was joining us. when I went to pay my bill, the older guy paid. I explained to both of them my discomfort with this because I don’t want anyone to expect anything from me in return. They both said I need to let people do things for me. 

Later on that night after work, a group of us went to an escape room and the two guys that I went out to lunch with were there. 3 other females joined us. When it was time to pay for the room, rather than everyone paying for themselves, the two guys paid for everyone, which was expensive and I found it strange. 

Afterwards, the guy texted me [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/zPdD16O) (my texts are blue btw) and I was offended and felt disrespected. I felt like he had an ulterior motive this whole time to pay for my stuff in hopes to get me in bed. I blocked him and went to bed. 

Today, he came over to my unit as usual, and I told him that he crossed a line and I felt disrespected. He told me it was a joke and reached for my shoulder. He was laughing the whole time, so I told him I’m serious and that I was no longer dealing with him on a friendly level. He said that was just his type of humor and that we’re both grown and I need to loosen up. I asked him that in the time he has gotten to know me, have I ever come off as someone that would find that “joke” funny. He just laughed me off. He continued to try to talk to me and I just ignored him. AITA here? Someone told me that since I haven’t explicitly stated my disinterest to him, then how would he know. I’m wondering if I’m blowing this out of proportion, however I don’t feel like he was joking.",102,330,0.96

I was in the bathroom getting ready to take our little one to daycare, which we were already running late for. My boyfriend walked in behind me and held a ring up in his hand and just said ‘Will you marry me?’ I honestly thought it was a joke and the ring was simply a gift. I laughed, said yes, put the ring on and left.

When I got home and spoke to my boyfriend, I realized he actually *did* ask me to marry him. I would’ve said yes either way (if it was a joke or not) but I was just left feeling a bit.. disappointed and empty, I guess. I’m not the biggest fan of the ring either. It’s big and chunky and uncomfortable to wear. It was meant to be sapphire to match my birthstone he said, but he ‘accidentally’ got the wrong colour. It’s not my style and it doesn’t suit me whatsoever. We’ve never looked at engagement rings together so he wouldn’t know what I like. I mentioned this to him and asked if he would mind if I bought a smaller ring (with my own money) to wear instead but he got quite offended by that and called me ungrateful. He’s been moody ever since. May I add that the ring he bought wasn’t expensive, so it’s not like he’d be wasting lots of money if I didn’t wear it. (Price doesn’t matter to me.)

I wasn’t expecting a grand gesture or huge proposal.. but a little effort would’ve been nice, not just asking me in the damn bathroom. It’s meant to be a special moment and memory and it’s just.. not. AITA for being upset over this?",2123,10137,0.91
1723,Asshole,"Throwaway warning.

One of my neighbors who lives on my street is a literal nightmare. She is with our homeowners association and seems to have a personal grudge against me and a few other neighbors. Once my aunt came to visit, and she parked right in front of my house. We live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, so her car wasn't blocking the road at all and it is never busy, but my neighbor took it upon herself to report it and I got faced with a hefty fine.

She will always do other petty things, like if my wife and my kids walk our dog, sometimes our neighbor will follow them behind to make sure they clean up after it, don't walk on anyone's grass, it's ridiculous.

Those are just a couple of examples, on to the story. Now no one really respects my neighbor and I vowed if she comes to the door I will straight up refuse to answer. Sure enough, she and her kids come up to my door. I am looking from the window and the kids knock a few times and look like they are going to give up, the mother comes up and knocks on my door (She sees our cars in the drive way so she knows we're home). I relent and answer and she badgers me ""how come you didn't answer, we've been here for 5 minutes""

Her kids interrupt her and cheerily say ""trick or treat,"" I wanted to give them candy because they are fairly well behaved, but because their mother is a nightmare, I say ""sorry, not giving you guys anything.""

The mother flips her shit and yells at me for not being in the spirit of Halloween and mentions how she will embarrass me by telling everyone about how much of a ""scrooge"" I am. They leave and I sit there FUMING. 

After a couple minutes I grab a few candy bars, walk outside and find them a few houses down. I storm up to them, throw the candy at their feet and yell at the mother ""here's the candy for your fucking kids, enjoy it you old hag."" She looked terrified because I did approach them suddenly.

I am not sure if I was the asshole here or not, my neighbor has been nothing but rude to me for years and because I initially refused to give her kids candy, I was somehow the bad guy?",718,2003,0.89
1724,Asshole,"My son started a new small school last year, mid year. When my son started school mid-year, it was brutal literally being the new kid on the block. It was hard to fit in when kids already have established relationships in place. The kids weren't mean, but they weren't nice either.

One thing that stung was that he made a ""school"" friend named Matt. I had thought that this kid really didn't socialize with kids at school because he lived far away. A month or two after starting school, we found out Matt was hanging out with kids from school and wondered why he never invited my kid to hangout. Then we found out that he had a birthday party and invited kids that he DID NOT even hangout with at school. My son was not invited.

I tried to get my son to understand it wasn't personal. He was too new at school. I do believe that by not being invited by his only ""friend"" cemented and/or delayed my son from fitting in because it looked like that my son was the one who didn't want to go when he wasn't even asked.  And my son was very hurt. He didn't want to say anything because he didn't want to feel anymore excluded.

My son is now in the 4th grade and doing better. There are like 20 kids in his 4th grade class. His birthday passed and and he invited a few friends to go go-kart racing. No one invites all 20 kids and not all 20 kids are going to show up even if they were all invited. The invites are send outside of school.

I excluded this Matt kid the same way he excluded my son.  My son and Matt are in the same class. I know it really hurt and baffled Matt and his family and they wanted to know why and they asked the teacher if something had happened between the two. I told the teacher that obviously they aren't friends, just acquaintances and the party was for just for friends the same way Matt's party was for friends and not his acquaintances.

I saw it as a teachable moment for everyone. Treat people like second-class citizens and they will do the same to you. Forgive doesn't equal forgetting. I hope Matt and his family will be more aware about this. And TBH if I were Matt's dad, I would totally understand.

&#x200B;

EDIT: My son and Matt are neither friends or enemies. They are frenemies. They hangout with the same kids at school. The relationship between the two got frosty after my son was not invited to Matt's party and now even more frosty after being snubbed at my son's party.",115,130,0.75

1728,Not the A-hole,"My parents both have incredibly busy, high-power jobs that take a lot of their time. I was a surprise baby, born when they were entering their fifties, my older siblings are significantly older than me. I spent a lot of time with a nanny as a kid and as such have a distant but affectionate relationship with my parents. When I was 13 I asked to go to boarding school. They said yes and I started my freshman year of HS as a boarding student at a Connecticut boarding school. I'm in my Sophomore year now and I love it. When I first started my parents promised to call at least three times a week and visit twice a month but after a while I started having maybe three or four phone calls a month, and maybe two or three visits a year. I honestly don't mind, since we're not super close.

The problem is, when they do visit, they just show up. I get maybe a couple hours warning, ""hey, we're driving up from the city, see you soon."" I'm not excited when they visit, and rather, it's an inconvenience. I thought I was doing a decent job of hiding how I really felt about the visiting but a recent visit brought things to the surface. My parents visited last weekend and didn't give me any warning. It was my birthday so maybe they thought I'd be excited. Apparently when they called my name and I turned to see who it was my face fell. I didn't realize I had done it.

My parents said they wanted to take me to lunch and in the car my mom asked me why I was never happy to see them, why I always acted like we were strangers. I tried to explain that it wasn't that I wasn't happy, it's just, I'm happy at school and when they visit it sort of throws off my routine. It's kind of awkward, to be honest, but I can't explain why I feel weird when they visit. Mom asked me if I even miss them when they're not there. I asked her if she wanted the truth, she said yes, so I told her, ""no, because I'm happy here.""

We had lunch, it was quiet and awkward. They dropped me off and my mom intimated that they just won't visit me for a while if it makes me happy. They left and I haven't seen or heard from them since. Given the tone of their visit and how we all left things it'll probably be Thanksgiving/Christmas vacation before I see them again.

1730,Not the A-hole,"Andrew (20M) and I (20F) are both college juniors in the same major. We have 4 classes together  and met at the beginning of the semester.  We became kinda friends because of this (strictly platonic) 

Our classes are very rigorous and can be be very demanding . I’ve been doing very well in all of my classes, while Andrew has been struggling a lot. 

This semester I’ve been helping him study a lot, sending him the study guides I made for myself, etc. - he would ask me help him study for every single exam and I gladly did it. 

Last Friday, we were doing work together during the day and he mentioned a Halloween party.  I asked him if I could come with and he said sure.  He sends me the address and what not. 

I took an Uber to the address (it’s impossible to get there without a car since I live on campus and it was 4 miles off campus, on a major road- wound up costing me $25). 

The Uber only took me to the complex the party was supposed to be at. 

I was kind of drunk, cold, and had no idea where I was. I texted Andrew asking what the house looked like and he left me on read. 

I wound up having to call my (sober) friend 20 minutes after to pick me up and I hadn’t heard from him since then. 

I was/ am fucking pissed. 

This morning, he texted me asking if I made a study guide for an upcoming exam we have.

Okay so bit of an explanation. I'm on the train from London to Brussels, it's about 4 hours long and I bought a seat in standard premier. Which is triple the amount of money for regular second class. 

The family next to me has been unusual the whole route. 
The child is watching videos on an iPhone 11 pro without headset. 
The dad is asleep and the mom has been on her phone none stop with airpods in. 
The kid is very loud and not being corrected so when she loudly squealed I made a sound because it hurt my ears. 
The dad suddenly got mad at me and told me she was just a child. 
I told them if she can't keep it down they should have booked seats in second class because we all paid a lot of money for the extra comfort. 

He started calling me names in French and now I'm doubting myself. 
Am I the asshole? I have absolutely no idea how I should feel about this and I'm stuck for another 2 hours.

1747,Not the A-hole,"Okay, long story, but ~~I'll try to summarize~~ here goes. 

I went out with my sister, her husband, and her friends. 

Her friend S, kinda put the thing together. S is a really attractive and incredibly nice girl, who is dating J. J is kinda a passive dude, but definitely a good guy. A few more women and men also come out, including a guy L. 

My sister warned me that L is kinda touchy-feely. Her husband told me that he did not like L because he had been far too touchy-feely with one of this HS gfs. 

Well, we all get together and L was all over S. He gabbed her hand and told her how pretty her ring was. He had his hands on her every chance that he got. He was kinda touchy-feely with everyone, but especially S. He put on some kaleidoscope glasses, looked at her, and said ""my dream has come true, I'm seeing a bunch of S's."" He did not really get touchy-freely or flirty with any of the other girls. J watched the whole thing, but was too passive to object. 

Later in the night, I'm quite inebriated. My sister had walked home with her husband and gotten sick. I was standing outside the bar with her friend S and a couple other girls, J was not there. Then L comes out of the bar and approaches us. L asks me if S is my sister. I said no because I would have been weirded out by all of the touchy-freely shit he was trying, had S been my sister. 

Everyone looked at me weird. I have three girls, including S plus L looking at me like I'm some asshole. I said something to the effect of ""I've hung out with dudes like you, I know what you're trying to do."" 

I feel like L was waaay to obviously flirty with S. I also think,retrospectively that S put J in a weird position. L was a fuckin creep and S is waaaaay too nice so she didn't shut him down. J was too passive to say anything. 

Later in the night L gave S a really tight hug goodbye and I saw J rolling his eyes behind her. J was clearly not cool with the extend of L's physical interaction. 

Ultimately, had I been more sober, I would have kept my mouth shut. I shouldn't have put S in that position. At the same time, I fucking hate dudes who are creepy and touchy-feely because they aren't being genuine. My sister pulled me aside early in the night and said her creep radar was through the roof with his behavior. My sister's husband was on guard around him. This guy was being a creepy fuck, but apparently that was only obvious to the three of us (and maybe J). 

AITA or am I just a guy who got drunk and spoke up against a creep? I feel like this one is a gray area, so I'm really interested to see what reddit thinks.

I feel like I overstepped; but at the same time, had she actually  been my sister, I would have said something. 

I also called him out on saying ""nigga [this]"" and ""nigga [that]"" to which he (the white looking guy with the Italian nickname) responded, ""it's okay, I'm Mexican.""

We didn’t give her any because they make her paranoid. 2 hours later, we’re all hanging out, and the edibles start kicking in. The friend that we picked up notices. We tell her we ate edibles and she asked when, since she never saw us eat any. We said before we drove to pick her up.

She freaked out and immediately called me and my friend an asshole for risking her life by driving to pick her up. I was confused and tried explaining that I had literally taken then minutes before driving, they’re not instant... edibles have always taken at least an hour and a half or more to kick in for me. There was no way I could have  become impaired on the drive to pick her up and drive back, which is 15 minutes in total.

She wasn’t haven’t it, called us assholes again and left. I honestly feel like she’s being pretty ridiculous, but also wondering if I did something wrong? I’ve eaten edibles many times.

Somewhere in the middle of the group there was a couple in mascot Mickey and Minnie costumes so I gave them each a full sized bar since I don't see a lot of that in my neighborhood. One of the mothers noticed so she sent her kids back to get some of the full sized chocolates. I turned them away nicely letting them know I had already given them each several pieces of candy and the lady yelled at me in Spanish that I had not given them any of the big ones. I told her the reason I had those and she told me I was treating her children unfairly. I told her its not like i had not given them any candy at all and she went on to curse at me and insulted me as she called her children back. Its been almost two hours now but I feel awful and decided not to even bring out the last of the big bars. Am I the asshole here? Should I be giving everyone the same type of candy?,378,776,0.93
1753,Asshole,"For Halloween today, we didn’t have any plans, and his family was having a Halloween party, so we decided to go. His family is very conservative, which has been a problem in the past. When we were getting ready to go,  I put on my costume, a cute nurse outfit and he flipped out.

He said that I couldn’t wear that to a family party and that there would be little kids there(his nephew is 5), and that his parents would freak out. He said that I had to change into last years costume (a spider). 

This pissed me off, because my last boyfriend always tried to control what I wore and I’ve been trying to break that internalized mantra of thinking about what to wear so he wouldn’t get mad. 

I told him that I had told him what the costume was a week ago, and that if his parents had a problem it is their problem not mine, and that he shouldn’t control what I wear.

We ended up no showing the party, and his brother got pissed at him.

My daughter is going through a tough time right now. She is an alcoholic and is currently in rehab. After rehab, she’ll be living in a sober living facility for 12 weeks. Only a week after she leaves the sober living facility (assuming everything goes according to plan) is my sons wedding. Though she hypothetically will be able to resist temptation at that point, I don’t think throwing her into a wedding with an open bar is a good idea, especially considering that their fathers side of the family are rowdy and heavy drinkers.

My daughter asked my son if he would be upset if she stayed home and they celebrated elsewhere. He told her that she would be dead to him if she didn’t come. My daughter was distraught and very emotional. We talked it out with her counselor, and during the conversation, I told her that I thought she should stay home and that her sobriety was more important than the wedding.

She reached out to her brother and basically told him exactly that and told him that I said she could stay home.

1758,Asshole,"So theres this girl (lets call her Alex) I'm really interested in and we've been slowly getting close. She's a very quiet, timid girl who's not really massive on socialising, which comes imporant. 

Tonight for halloween I invited her over to my place to watch some horror films and do some drinking games w some close friends.

At least that was the plan.

We agreed on 9.30, but due to reasons she had to come late at around 10.30, which was totally fine to me. So before she came, some other friends (who she did not know) came over and we smoked some js together.

Being all high together, I couldnt make them leave and decided to just invite them over to join the film viewing. They all agreed. When Alex came by at 10.30, she was all smiling and really happy. I told her some people came over and she said yeah cool that'll be fun.

When she came in my apartment and saw like 10-12 other strangers, her face immediately turned sour. She just stayed silent the whole night and was very clearly annoyed/upset. The movie everyone picked also turned out to be one that she's watched before too, and she was just on her phone like the whole time.

After the film ended and people were leaving, I tried walking her home and she just curtly replied that its fine, she can go alone. So I walked her to the door of my building and tried to go in for a goodbye hug, but she didnt even look back once and just left with her back towards me.

Am I the asshole here? I feel like apologising but it was also somewhat out of my control. What do you guys think?


UPDATE: I apologised to her, without trying to come up with any excuses like I did on this post which you guys pointed out, thank you for that. Straight up said it was on me and I was totally responsible.

She said thank you for apologising and she appreciated it. She also said that the people didn't bother her, but more that our plan of horror movie marathon and drinking games were all just discarded out the window due to the people.

1759,Asshole,"I'm the owner of a sporting/hunting goods store and for the autumn season we had a giveaway of a 5 minute shopping spree. It may not sound like much but it's a small store and you could easily rack up $5,000-10,000 in goods in that time. The winner was chosen by purchasers of the month of October: you got a number on your receipt and we drew the winning number two nights ago with the spree happening today.

The winner was announced on our Facebook page and a woman was the winner. Maybe mid-30s, I don't know if that's important. She doesn't seem like the kind of person to go hunting or whatever but looks can be deceiving, we don't judge. She posted on Facebook and it started a long comment chain between her and others, in public view of everyone else including myself and my employees, and the gist of the conversation was asking people what she should pick out to *maximize her profit selling the items on the secondary market*.

Our rules are pretty lax, so much so we didn't consider someone just picking up the most expensive things just to resell. I figured it'd give one lucky person a new kayak and some hunting gear, not someone picking up 50+ Yeti mugs. The resale market for most hunting stuff is pretty low but there's some treasures in here that could easily be flipped for easy cash. One of our rules did apply: we reserved the right to rescind the giveaway offer at any time for any reason and without compensation.

But that's all beside the point (so far), just idle conversation doesn't imply intent, but when she came in today to redeem her win, that's exactly what she did. Straight to the Yeti cups. She even asked one of my employees ""what do you think in here I could sell for the most money"".

When she got to the register, I was the one who handled her cart. And I decided to take away her win and instead hold a redraw next week for a new winner. She didn't break any rules, but I was exercising my one rule to preserve the spirit of the competition. This woman doesn't need this stuff, she wants cold hard cash. Why give her this reward when someone more deserving could get it? Someone who actually uses this stuff?

It started an uproar on Facebook but I'm pleased to say most agree with how we handled it. There's a vocal minority, however, and we've already been review bombed. Was I the asshole, though?",600,2060,0.93
1760,Not the A-hole,"On mobile, sorry for bad formatting.

So I carry around mascara, an eyelash curler, powder, lip gloss, and an eyebrow pencil. Only really for touch ups. I’m in the bathroom just touching up everything and this group of girls walk in. I didn’t pay any mind to them as I had my earbuds in. One of the girls tapped on me on the shoulder so I turned around and took out my earbud.

Me: “Yes?”

Girl: “Could I borrow some of your makeup?”

Me: “Sorry, no”

Girl: “But why?”

Me: “I’ve have a bad history with sharing my makeup. Again, sorry.”

The girl scoffed and walked back to her group. I ignored her after this and the group of girls were just talking their shit. I was really tired and didn’t feel like arguing.

Some of you may be asking, why didn’t I share?
1. I have gotten pink eye from sharing mascara and curlers.
2. Sharing face powder will mess with my acne.
3. Sharing lip gloss is like sharing a toothbrush, I’ll pass.

I’ve gotten mixed answers if I asked people if I was the asshole. Some think I’m the asshole because it’s just makeup and that I was being selfish.

1762,Asshole,"Context: was in an LDR for 2.5 yrs. Very long term. Talked about marriage and kids, I was going to move out of state to be with him. 

We had our own problems. My mental health was declining (I returned to therapy shortly after, 6 mo in I am coping with being bipolar + having PTSD. Was nice to put a name to the crazy.) He was very selfish. Rarely made me finish in bed. I understood he wasn't romantic, but he didn't even make an effort. It was like we were best friends with benefits. I loved him a lot...sometimes it felt like a struggle to get him to show that he loved me. He was very girlish, wishy-washy and prissy. I was ok with that. I could work with it. But he had some serious problems that he refused to fix. He always said ""well that's just how I am, sorry."" 

So we inevitably break up. I had been gearing up towards it but it was out of no where for him. We talked on an off and admittedly I had been becoming close with another person. I wasn't cheating, I have a lot of guy friends and we clicked. Of course now we are dating, but I didn't do anything or flirt with him until I was single.

Fast forward a few months after the break up. Me and my now bf are living together, happily. My ex does not know because I'm not in contact with him frequently. One of the females in his friend group - let's call her Sam - is my best friend. She is dating the best friend of my ex's roommate, so she can keep up with my ex in passing and by association since the friend group goes out frequently.

So, dear reader. My ex was into big girls. I'm a little fluffy myself. But he had a pretty major crush on a woman within the friend group - let's call her Hannah - since middle school. He would try to hang out with her because they were close. He tried to voice call and play games with her. They were just friends, he said. Maybe I was being paranoid, but paranoia for me isn't usually common unless I find something suspicious. He was flirty with everyone, so naturally he was with her too. It made me mad. I knew he liked her. He would always buckle when I called him out on it, say that wasn't the case, I'm dating you, etc.

So Sam tells me that my ex slept with her within these past few weeks. I am angry and hurt - but I have no right to be, right? 

So I unload. I tell her how shitty of a partner he was. I tell her everything because the only other people I told were my mom and therapist. She is taken aback. What, my ex? He is a shitty partner? He made himself out to be a great one. That my mental health caused the break up. I am FUMING.

So she tells her bf. Her bf tells his best friend...so...his roommates don't talk to him. The friend group has shunned him for talking bad about me, whom they really liked and enjoyed. They were all under the impression I was going to move in and we would eventually get married.

So..I kind of unintentionally ruined my ex's relationship with most of/all his close friends. AITA?",145,176,0.78

1765,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 13 years old. She's had type 1 diabetes since she was 7. She's at a stage right now where she likes to pretend she does not have the disease, which is scary as her blood sugar can rise very high and she can get very sick. She's been out with her friends on the weekends a couple of times these past few weeks, and every time she's gone, she had consistently been in the high 200's and 300's (normal is between 80 and 180). She has a continuous glucose monitor, so we can see her blood sugars, and she just ignores it when she goes high instead of correcting (she has a pump, which makes it easy to correct since she doesn't have to give a shot). She will ignore any texts or phone calls about it, too if we try to call her. She wants to go to the movies with her friends this weekend, and I said, only if I go with her to ensure she's checking her blood sugar and correcting when she needs to, which she was very unhappy about. I know that as a teenager, it's difficult for her to manage her blood sugar, and sometimes she can go high without explanation, but I also want her to pay some attention to it, and if she won't do it, I feel like I need to for her.

1770,Not the A-hole," For those of you that live in the city, you can probably understand how infuriating it is to drive at times. People who swerve suck, people that ""slow-start"" and prevent you from making the green-light suck, etc etc.  

But NOTHING infuriates me more on the road than people not using their turn signals. Not only does it show their incompetence and laziness as a driver, but it shows how absolutely scummy they are for not taking the extra half-second and finger stroke in order to signal those they're sharing the road with. Even if your signals are broken (which is rare), you're still obligated to use hand signals. Or at least in the city I live.  

Fast forward to last night where I got out of a bar with a friend, and his friend offered to drive us home. Initially I said ""thanks but I'm good"" since I was planning on getting an uber, but my friend insisted she take us since we live nearby so I agreed.  So as she's driving she's already doing some pretty gnarly moves like leaving the parking lot at 40mph and flooring it before the redlights hit. Lo and behold, she's also not using her turn signal.  

I tell her that she should probably use them but she states that she's never had an issue before, which makes no sense whatsoever (turn signals are NOT for you, but for people around you). I explain this but she gets annoyed and brushes it off.  Well we hit an intersection and she TURNS WHILE PASSING IT. This in itself is illegal but since she refused to use a signal, the driver behind her intended lane didn't stop and we almost got in an accident since she panicked, swerved back to the right and skidded along the sidewalk. 

I was in full adrenaline mode and as soon as the car stopped, I snapped and yelled out ""USE YOUR GODDAMN SIGNAL"", then left the vehicle and stormed off. I took an Uber the rest of the way home because I sure as hell wasn't going to apologize for my outburst.  

Well this morning my friend texts me saying that I was a dick last night for yelling at his friend like that even after she offered to take us home. I do feel bad but her refusal to signal, even taking into account the rest of her bad driving, almost got us hurt and I'm not ""grateful"" for that in the slightest.

A bit of context for this:
1) My family has never bought candy for Halloween as my parents think it is an A) Waste of money and B) every Halloween the streets get littered with wrappers, it’s like every little kid here eats all their candy in between houses. 

2) This is pretty important: My family and I are Hindus, we have a flower painted on the frontstep (that was for Diwali which was about a week ago), and recently we had a religious event (not going to go into too much detail, the important thing is my sister gave me a bag of kit kats and i was eating one at the time. My grandfather puts out food in front of the pictures and statuettes we have to bless the food before we eat it (he only does this for special days). This was the case with the kit kats.


The doorbell rings; I get up (with the wrapper in hand) and open the door. There are three little kids in costume stomping away the paint on the step while their mother watches. I go “Hey, stop that.” They say “trick or treat” and I tell them we have no candy. They turn away disappointedly, but their mother sees the red wrapper in my hand and goes, “Hey! You have candy, there’s a wrapper in your hand.”


The kids turn around and start accusing me of keeping their candy for myself. I told them that I couldn’t give them candy because they were kicking up the flower we painted and they were trying to grab into my pockets to see if I had any candy. Their mother told me that if we decorated the house that meant we would have had candy. I told her what the flower meant. She then rolled her eyes and muttered something I could only presume was racist.


I quickly left to go back inside. My grandfather thinks that I was too harsh and should’ve given them my candy. I know I might come off as selfish here, but the kit kats were a special gift and my grandfather telling me to give away the sweets even though he is the most religious person in the family just got on my nerve as him being a hypocrite.

I am a product of my mother’s first marriage. When I was a toddler, they split and she got pregnant pretty fast with a new guy. They married, had a few more. My bio Dad was out of picture. Stepdad never interfered with my upbringing. My teen years were filled with lots of abuse by my mom. I left as soon as I was legal. 

Fast forward 15 years. I’m married with a family of my own. I worked really hard to repair the relationships with everyone, because I felt family was important. My mother started showing signs of verbal abuse towards my kids, I removed us completely from her.

I recently had a talk with my stepdad about everything a couple months ago, we seemed to be on same page. He wants to be in my families life. He let me know he was told time and time again by my mother to not interfere in my upbringing because she said- ‘that’s my kid’. Part of me is still pretty angry that he did absolutely nothing about the abuse. 

So that brings me to current day. A family member that I was very close to is sick in the hospital. My mom called to let me know. In the same breath, she quickly said how she didn’t appreciate me contacting ‘her husband’ and it was the equivalent of her contacting mine to complain about me. I saw red, told her I can talk to anyone about anything I please and hung up. 

I have gotten a slew of messages from my younger siblings how I am an asshole and in the wrong. ‘Family above all’ and how I am ‘using my kids as a weapon’ because I do not let them see them anymore. I told them all they can’t have it both ways. Either I am a sibling and that’s my dad, and I get treated just like everyone else. Or I need to respect marital boundaries. I am also pretty upset at how a call about a sick family member was used for an ulterior motive.

If he wanted it other-than medium, sure. No problem. But he wanted me to season his specifically 30 minutes ahead of time with salt only and then add seasoning right before. I know this isn't a big deal but you're getting free ribeye steaks and I'm proud of how I cook them and you're already trying to tell me how to cook them. That's rude to me. I tell him I found really good cuts at Costco and he says, ""Sams are better, you should get them from there"". Ok. I say we're watching the fight downstairs in the basement and he goes, ""we're not watching it on the big screen""?

That's why I have the downstairs set up for. The he was like,""Well I'm bringing a $100 (was $60 when he said he found it online. Not sure how it jumped $40) bottle over so..."" and he let it hang. I was like, ""Hey man, I was happy about things going up to this but you're not making me feel so happy because you complain so much"". I want to just un-invite him and call it a day because if someone offered me free steak and salad, a UFC fight at their home and free alcohol, I would just be happy.

1784,Not the A-hole,"Since it's the day of, I want to get your guys' take on this, experience from last year.

Few details - I live in a large suburban neighborhood, and probably get 300+ kids coming to my door on Halloween. I have a habit of going all out on Halloween, and it's not subtle. Spiderwebs, giant spiders, loads of lights, speakers, bones, generic stuff and expensive pneumatic and static props. It is incredibly obvious that our house is a ""scary house"".

I myself want to get in on the action, so I have a hidey hole I jump out of and scare people who are coming to the door. Keep note that the door is a good 30 feet away from the beginning of the yard, and everyone has every chance they want to turn around and not go to the door.

I wear a pretty elaborate costume, so I can't hear or see very well at all, and I end up jumping at everything that moves in front of the door. The issue arises when it's little ones, or parents. Parents get PISSED at me for scaring their kids, or them when they're walking up with their kids. They'll get in my face and call me out for being an ass for scaring their kids.

In my point of view, they knew it was a scary house, they knew there would be things that could jump out, and they spent 30 seconds walking through the elaborate decorations before getting to the door, so why couldn't they have turned around if they didn't like it?

1786,Asshole,"I am not from the US — would love some insight from people originally from here. 

We just moved to the US this year and it is my son’s first year in school here, all of our first Halloween celebrations. 

My son is in third grade and has been excited to celebrate Halloween. I bought him a costume and we decorated the house and drew on pumpkins, I thought that was enough for him to feel he’d participated. 

I didn’t realize trick or treating was so widespread and thought he’d realize it was a tradition for some families but not ours since we don’t eat much candy, it is raining here, it is a school night, etc. 

Plus I am not very keen on his approaching the neighbors we haven’t met and running around the neighborhood after dark, even if I am with him. 

I told him tonight was not a good night but I’d go to the store and he could pick any candy he wanted. He is *hysterical*. I have not seen him this upset in a long time. 

He went to school and discussed this with his friends and five different moms called and offered to take him out. 

I didn’t want him eating a lot of candy and being exhausted tomorrow so just said “thanks but no thanks” and they were all very surprised and several asked “oh no is he sick” or “did he get into trouble” as though it was unthinkable he wouldn’t go out for this tradition. 

He says all his friends are going out but I cannot tell if it’s the same as “all my friends have the new Nintendo” or “all my friends stay awake until midnight” etc. 

So American parents AITA? I’ve got to make a decision in the next couple hours.",228,344,0.9

1788,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I decided to have a little vacation to World of Harry Potter in Florida (You all should go if you're Potter fans, the atmosphere is amazing). Between the two Potter themed parks you can take platform 9 and 3/4 and ride the train to the other park. While in line to get on the train the woman ahead of us has 2 little boys with her that are bouncing a basketball around. Off the wall, off the floor, passing it to each other, etc. This is happening all within a crowded line for a ride where clearly you shouldn't be bouncing a ball around. The mother is paying no attention to her kids while this is happening and is either staring off into space with her arms crossed or is zoned into her phone.

I literally just start thinking somebody is going to get hit with the ball and then my husband says something to me. I turn away for a couple seconds and WHAM! I get pelted right in the side of the face with the basketball. Out of shock I scream at the kid ""YOU JUST HIT ME IN THE FACE, STOP FUCKING AROUND!"" It actually came out way louder than I meant it, but I just reacted because it scared me more than anything. Then the mother immediately steps in and shouts at me how that is no way to speak to a child. Everybody is staring at us at this point. The mother then started cursing at me, telling me how I should have told her to discipline her kids and not yell at the kids myself. We kinda were bickering back and forth and the woman starts to get in my face a bit and waving her arms around, clapping her hands, being really loud and obnoxious.

At this point my husband steps in and tells us to break it up, telling us both to settle down. The woman then started yelling at him saying ""I'm not talking to you. Mind your business."" My husband then screams back at her VERY loudly at this point clearly very angry at the scene. ""WELL I'M TALKING TO YOU. YOU NEED TO SETTLE DOWN AND SHUT UP. IF YOU DONT WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO DISCIPLINE YOUR KIDS THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THEM."" This sort of snapped her back and she quieted down after that. We moved some spaces back in line to get away from her and exchanged a flew glares but that's it after that.

1789,Not the A-hole,"My mom was taken the the ER in early August and was admitted to the hospital. She gave me her wedding ring to hold and keep safe while she was hospitalized. I placed the ring in a jewelry box in my closet that I do not use. Several weeks later after placing the ring in the box, I found another ring that I do not wear and that was in the jewelry box laying on the floor of my closet. I picked it up and opened the jewelry box to put it away, and I saw that my mom’s ring was missing. Neither I nor my husband had opened the box, and I had not worn the ring found on the floor. 

I called or texted everyone who had been in the house telling them about the missing ring and asking if they had seen the ring or moved the ring. I also let everyone know we would be filing a police report and an insurance claim so there would be no surprises if someone got a call. Of course nobody admitted to having seen the ring. 

I reported the ring as stolen, and as requested by the police department, I listed all of the people who were in our house unattended during the time period in question. This list included my mother-in-law, our nanny, and our housekeeper, along with two women the housekeeper has brought with her to help. My father also filed an insurance claim. 

My friend who referred the housekeeper to us and who has been friends with the housekeeper for some time first requested that I file no police report and that my dad not file an insurance claim. I asked how long she was asking us to wait, and she responded, until you find the ring because I am sure it is going to turn up. I told her a delay was not possible. 

She then asked that I not list the housekeeper as someone who was in the home. Her reasoning was that she believed the housekeeper did not do it, and the housekeeper is not in the US legally, so it would put her at risk. 

I told her that was also not possible. The ring was missing, and my parents were entitled to compensation. I also was not going to lie in any police report or in any statement to the insurance company. 

My friend then accused me of being unkind and left, and she stopped calling/texting/communicating. I ultimately was the one who reached out to say that I felt her requests were unfair, especially given the timing of the discussion (she came to my home to discuss this when my mom was in hospice care less than a week before my mom’s death), and I felt she owed me an apology for asking that we either do nothing or lie to the police and the insurance company.  She emailed back with an apology but then went on to say that she understood that in my “vulnerable state”, I had “attacked a vulnerable individual.” To me, that undermines the apology, and as I see it, the only one who has done any attacking is my friend who has attacked me over an issue that was not her concern to begin with. 

Am I the asshole here? And what is the appropriate response to my friend?",55,209,0.94

One of my duties is to wake up at 6am and feed our beasts (a kitty and pup) then take the pup for his morning walk/poop. I am very much a morning person while she is not so me having morning duties makes sense.  Today was the first morning  that was truly frigidly cold. When I got back inside after the morning walk I immediately hopped back in bed and placed my cold hands and feet on my girlfriend’s warm spots (armpits, knee pits, elbow pits, etc). She immediately turned into a vicious monster and practically took my head off. After she was done breathing fire upon me, we had a talk about what had just happened and I politely asked for permission to use her body heat on cold mornings after I walk and poop the pup. She steadfastly refused and this led to a big argument that has evolved into arguments over other duties/chores. I seriously don’t think it is too much to ask for her to share her warmth with me since I am the one braving the arctic weather conditions every morning. AITA?

1793,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory, ""Title sounds awful, but hear me out""

This happened a few months ago and I'm still on the fence about if we did the right thing. My wife and I got married back in May and we, of course, were very excited. I was deployed for the 6 months leading up to the wedding and my wife is a teacher so our time to spend planning was extremely limited. We were face timing/calling as much as we could, but due to the time difference and our schedules, my wife did the VAST majority of planning. She was amazing, balancing teaching, her master’s program, and planning this wedding while I was overseas and I still don’t know how she did it all. She was able to find a friend of a friend who baked cakes and was enthusiastic to find someone local that could provide us with an incredible cake. She set up a meeting for a tasting, which I “attended” over face time and we all chose the different flavors for the cake tiers and icing and discussed our <$400 budget. At the tasting, the baker stated that they would get the pricing figured out and would be happy to help us out as my wife was a teacher and I was military, so she knew we didn’t make a great deal of money. We told her that we could pick the cake up so we could bring it to the venue (1.5 hours away) and she insisted that she wanted to help and that her and her husband were planning a trip in the same area and would be happy to deliver it. Thrilled that we (thought) we got a good deal, we checked that off our to-do list and continued with everything else we had to plan. Multiple times between the tasting and the wedding (approx. 2 months) my wife asked about the final cost and the baker responded that she was still reviewing/getting quote ready. This did cause concern for us, but with my return from deployment, upcoming wedding, and all the other planning we needed to do, it was only a blip on our radar. 

The day of our wedding was incredible, everything we could have ever wanted. We never saw the baker deliver the cake but it was nice (never got to try it due to everything going on) and fit both of our “no frills” personalities. A few weeks after the wedding, my wife received a text from the baker informing us that the final cost of the cake was $1,400. Now I’ve never bought a wedding cake before but this seemed outrageous. It was more than 2x more expensive than my wife’s dress! When we expressed our concerns with the baker, she gave us a “breakdown” of the costs, which included a delivery fee, mileage, and a “premium icing” fee (which were all things we thought she was doing as a favor). We restated our budget and reminded that none of the additional fees had been discussed prior. She began to get nasty and I didn’t take kindly to it. I informed her that we had a budget of $400 and we don’t have a written contract. We would pay the $400 but no more. She never replied. As she never gave us any information on how to pay her, we never did. So are we TA in this situation?

1794,Not the A-hole,"So, I'm in University and a classmate of mine is constantly showing us random people's work and telling us she made it herself, I've never disproved her even though I knew she didn't make it because she wasn't really using it for her own good or anything, but last week she submitted some other artist's work as her own for an actual fully graded assignment. My teacher somehow didn't find the original but I remember seeing it when looking for concepts for my own work and went on the library computer to look for it... after about 10 minutes I found it.

I went to get my teacher and told him she was plagiarizing and had proof, I showed him what I had found and he told me he would talk to her. Her grade was revoked but my teacher also told her I was the one who told him she was plagiarizing work.

1795,Not the A-hole,"Obvious throwaway. But anyway!

So I've really enjoyed the works of a certain artist and have a lot of his prints. I nearly screamed one day when I saw on eBay someone selling two of his originals in gorgeous frames that happened to be some of my favorites. Now, his originals typically sell for around $2,000 a piece. I couldn't pull the trigger on what the seller originally wanted so I watched the auctions, hoping no one would buy them.

As time passed the amounts went lower and lower until the cost for both would be less than $2,000 combined. The seller seemed to be getting fed up having no luck and decided this last time to say if they didn't sell they were going into storage. I HAD to get them so I messaged the seller and we worked out a payment plan/deal.

I'm justifying buying them/paying for these by working a ton of OT. My workplace is shorthanded, and kind of a hellhole, so there's an abundance of opportunities and I've been working some double shifts. Obviously this had made me pretty tired. I've wanted to sleep every chance I can and I'll admit I haven't seen/talked with my boyfriend too much. I told him what was going on, that this could be a once in a lifetime chance to own these originals, and he seemed OK with it at first.

He gradually got angrier and angrier about how long it took me to respond to messages and I'll admit I've been having trouble following conversations because I'm so tired. The OT was going to be the majority of this month and ended yesterday so we could have Halloween together.

Now he doesn't want to hang out. He's saying things like ""Won't you be too tired?"" and ""Don't want you falling asleep on me again!"" in really mean/sarcastic tones. He also seems to think I valued those paintings over him when this is the one time I've ever made something like this my priority (we've know each other for 5 years and dated for a bit over two of those).

1796,Not the A-hole,"I am the manager of a store in the mall that during the Halloween season sells a small selection of costumes, although it's usually lingerie or something sexified. We have a policy that we won't do any returns on Halloween items brought back after October 30th, especially because some of the costumes we were selling were on clearance which is final sale. 

Anyway, I was ringing people up right after opening the store and noticed a bigger woman bringing up a costume to the register that I know for a fact I've tried on only a couple days before (I know it was that one because we only had two of it left, in different sizes). I am on the chubbier side, definitely overweight, but under clothes I look a little smaller. The costume barely went past my thighs, and this woman was a lot bigger than me. I'm not trying to be mean, it was just a fact.

Before ringing her up I politely told her that I've tried on that same costume and it did not fit me at all, and then explained the return policy. The woman was actually thankful and I directed her to a store with a better selection.

After the morning rush left my manager pulled me aside and told me I shouldn't have done that. Even though I never explicitly said to the woman that she was bigger than me, my manager said I implied it, and I should have just explained the return policy and let her figure out the sizing for herself. I didn't want to do that for several reasons 1. She wouldn't be able to return it afterwards, and I'd be pissed if I was out of $50 I couldn't get back 2. I know how much it sucks to try on something and it doesn't fit. It can be depressing and sometimes it ruins your day and I just didn't want that for her.

I also think there are a lot of unethical business practices in fast fashion and I'd like to reduce my consumption because of that. I'd rather thrift for clothes and occasionally buy new from sustainable, ethical, clothes companies.

It's not something I think of as gross or cheap or embarrassing, it feels normal to me, and it's the cool thing to do in my social circle too. A lot of my friends love thrifting too, and are into the whole sustainable lifestyle thing. 

My boyfriend has to shop for most of his good work clothes new, because his career is more image based and a lot of men's suits at thrift stores are older styles or not well enough fitting. But he likes thrifting with me for other stuff, like outdoor wear for hiking and camping, or casual clothes.

Recently my boyfriend had a big company dinner with his law firm, all the lawyers and their spouses would be there. I said I'd go, and I had a nice formal dress to wear. 

I'd gotten it at a Goodwill in the wealthy part of town and it was from a really upscale brand (I checked later, it's called Black Halo and their dresses are literally hundreds of dollars new)

So at the party, a couple of the lawyer's girlfriends and wives complimented my dress and one woman asked where it was from. I was like ""Goodwill in (wealthy neighborhood)! I've found the most amazing things there!"" 

My boyfriend changed the topic right away to something else but at the time I didn't notice it was a deliberate distraction.

Later, my boyfriend took me aside and asked what I was thinking, saying I got my dress at Goodwill? I said ""what, she asked and that's where I got it."" He said it was embarrassing; like it or not law was very image focused and I was hurting his image in front of all his co-workers and boss. 

He asked me to look around; his co-workers wives and girlfriends are wearing luxury brands and none of them were thrifting, or if they were they'd never admit to it. He was right, that is kind of the culture in that group.

Every Christmas, my MIL insists on spending a ridiculous amount of money on our family and my partners siblings families on what can only be described as random junk. Wooden signs with clever sayings, candles and soaps (soooo many candles), novelty plates, cartoon pajamas, weird colored bedsheets, small kitchen gadgets……each couple in the family gets exactly the same thing, in maybe a different color or pattern. The kids of the families get equally similar and bizarre gifts. She spends weeks shopping for this stuff, and hours upon hours wrapping gifts. All of the gifts are mid-range in cost, but with the quantity (4 families and 7 kids), it adds up. And I do mean quantity. Last year, it took two vehicles to bring home all the stuff she got us and our single child.

Last year, after returning about ¾’s of the stuff she gave us, and dealing with random store credits at places I never shop, I tried to gently suggest that maybe, instead of spending a ton of money on random things that the families usually end up returning, she could just pick one nice thing for each person, and maybe 2-3 for each of the kids. I even suggested the adults do a Secret Santa/White Elephant style exchange, rather than her buying mass amounts of presents for everyone. The woman had an instantaneous melt down, screaming about how ungrateful I was, that I didn’t understand how much trouble she went through to buy all this stuff, how expensive it was, etc. Honestly, I was so shocked at the response, I just let it go.

A few days ago, my FIL pulled me aside while we were discussing whose house Christmas would be at to ask if I would be able to “behave myself and be grateful” this year, and if I couldn’t, maybe it would be better for me, and only me, to spend Christmas with my side of the family instead of my partners.

I was trying to get 40 that were assigned to me done during an afternoon shift, but our system we use for activations went down for nearly 5 hours and wasn't able to get them done that day. So the next morning I had to come in at 7 AM (I normally come in at 9 AM when I open) to get them done. I spent almost 1 hour on the phone with our IT because I kept having errors pop up in our activations system. Here's the deal, I was told to get them done by 8:30 AM so we could deliver them all to the customer. By 8, I hadn't been able to do a single one due to the errors. We open at 10 and I knew that I had to get done as quickly as possible. So I busted my ass and by 9:45, was still only had about 10 done. Knowing I had to rush, I tried to get ahold of one of my higher ups (above my manager since she was gone out of state) to get permission to open late to finish the tablets. Of course, our entire cell network went down around that time and was unable to make any calls. So I decided to put up a sign in the door stating we would be opening late. Around 11:30, I finally finished the tablets and opened the store. When my coworker came in at 11:45, I went to deliver the tablets and ran into my DM (my manager's boss) and he thanked me for working on them and said that I could go ahead and just head out for the day since I came in so early. About 4 days later, my manager came back and immediately wrote me up for A. Opening late, and B. Leaving early. I explained to her what had happened and she basically said that it was unacceptable to open late for any reason and I should've gotten permission to do so if need be. I explained that I literally couldn't get ahold of anyone at all and therefore just put up a sign. I then told her that our DM said I could leave early and she responded by saying that I should've asked her instead.

1806,Not the A-hole,"I work at a graphic design firm. Been here for four months, but I hate it. Mostly cause my boss is a dick. He’s fired seven people since I started, leaving me and the new girl. Our manager is currently on vacation and won’t be back til January. 

Because I’m his best worker, he schedules me night & all day shifts with 50+ hours each week. I have no social life to network and don’t even have time to interview for a new job. My day off changes constantly so I can’t even make plans. While the new girl gets less shifts and more days off. 

Whenever he makes a mistake, I have to be there to fix it. My ex-coworker came in 15 mins late for a 8 a.m. shift. My boss sent him home and called me to fill in when I’m scheduled for 5 p.m. My title is Entry Lvl designer, yet I’m now doing manager duties, getting $15/hr. 

Last weekend my coworker quit before his shift, leaving me to come in on my day off and finish all of his projects. My boss now wants me to do interviews and train the future new employee. I don’t care about him at all. My concern is for the new girl. She started less than two weeks ago. She’s an amateur at Photoshop and I haven’t trained her fully in Illustrator or InDesign yet. 

If I leave, she’s gonna have to take over my shifts and future work. With the holidays coming up, that means more pressure on her since she’ll be alone. She can’t train the new employee but I know my boss will force her since he’s a lazy dick. 

I’d feel glee if he had to travel to & from Connecticut to cover my shifts but he won’t. He dislikes the new girl since, I’ll admit, she’s not a doormat like I am and was thinking of firing her. He’s the kind of person who’d schedule me 6 a.m-12:30 a.m (office holiday schedule) and still have me open the next day. 

I’ll finish all my projects and quit after my shift, but I can’t stay at this job. It’s not a career job and is preventing me from moving on with my future.

1807,No A-holes here,"I have a friend, A.

A has anxiety. That's fine with me, I understand that its something that she can't help and that it impacts her daily life. However, A has done seemingly nothing to manage her anxiety on her own. Granted I don't know what she does in her personal time but if she is working on it, its not showing up in her interactions with me.

It wasn't that bad at first. I didn't mind it and I was okay with altering some of our interactions or going out of my way to make sure that she feels comfortable and everything, but its just gotten worse.

We are in a class together and A sends me pictures of EVERY single assignment to make sure it ""looks okay,"" because she has anxiety over sending it in.

She won't order her own food at a restraunt because she has anxiety over talking to the cashier. She won't ask for help in a store or for extra ketchup or whatever, every anxiety meme applies to her.

She dips last minute for plans EVERY time unless its something she has done at least 3 times before-- she dipped last minute from something I needed her to go to and she said she would three times, because it ""just gave her too much anxiety."" I have no problem with having to pass on something bc of that but tell me before 5 mins before the event!! This was after she spent 45 minutes grilling me on every single detail of where to go, what to wear, what to bring, what time to get there, what she needed to know, etc etc. When it was just a simple thing.

A makes me meet her outside of our club building every meeting because she is too anxious to walk in herself, even if I am in the middle of helping with something. She refuses to come in herself.

She won't do anything herself, she needs help/approval for everything or else she will either not do it at all or cry and blame it on her anxiety.

I know that I am being harsh. But I just didn't sign up to be her mom when I became her friend and it is frustrating me very much. I know that she can't help it, but maybe she should try getting some professional help? I am not trained to manage another person's anxiety!

I talked to my brother about it and he agrees with me, but a mutual friend says I am being too harsh on A as she can't help it.

1808,Asshole,"I married my husband from another country, happens to be a 3rd world country where his family is very poor. We live in the US and have good jobs and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with our two young daughters (ages 5, 7). I work hard so that I can save and travel, it's what we do as a family and what we really enjoy. Important Note: We are not rich, not by any standards. We just prioritize travel and creating experiences over buying things. We've visited several continents with our kids and have plans to travel to Mexico this upcoming Spring Break.

My husband has a kid sister whom we became guardians over 2 years ago--she is now a senior in high school. I initiated this and brought her from her country to live with us so that she could have a better future. This decision obviously created lots of change for our family--our two daughters now share a room instead of having their own, we have family dinner together every night as a family of five, I am her advocate getting her into a great high school, finding her counseling for trauma she has experienced, creating structure for things like homework, a chore chart around the house with allowance, drivers ed, doctor appointments, planning for university, etc etc. Last year I paid for her to do a 6 week trip back to her country to visit her friends/family and over XMas this year I am bringing her with us (obviously--it's the holidays) as we visit my parents in Arizona--she'll get a 3 week fun trip at a resort-like location with the rest of us. I've encouraged her several times to consider getting a part time job so she can pay for gas when she starts driving (we are providing her a vehicle at no cost) and other things she might want to buy (makeup, post-high school travel or other plans, etc). She has yet to do this even though she says she wants one.

&#x200B;

So the question--AITA? We are planning a Spring Break trip to Mexico and I'll be honest, it's a bit expensive. I told my husband that I feel comfortable having his sister stay home for the week (she'll be an 18 year old sr in HS) and has stayed home previously for shorter things, and she is very trustworthy. Husband blew up at my and told me it was unreasonable to leave her at home and that if we go we need to pay for her ticket too. I said that if she wanted to go she could have gotten a part time job and shown initiative in saving money for things that are important to her. Our relationship with this young woman is very good, but it is not one of parent/child--we are like her aunt/uncle helping her the most we can. I do not feel obligated to support her in every single way. I feel that we've been more than generous throughout the past few years, and will continue to do so.

I'm not sure how to describe the feeling, but simply put, it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm currently being tested for Autism as I've been bothered by lights and sounds a lot, though my therapist says it could also just be my PTSD. The people usually singing around me are my Partner and my little sister. Sometimes it's along to the radio, sometimes it's spontaneous. Whenever this happens, I ask them to stop, letting them know it's bothering me. This happens very often and makes me feel extremely guilty.  But the thing is that whenever something makes me feel uncomfortable, a touch, a sound, I can't help but speak out.

1813,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

But then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”

I’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”

She wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.

1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).

2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? 

5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. 

After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. 

I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.

So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?

EDIT: some info:

I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.

I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.

I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.

Edit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. 

Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless.

Anyway I'm 31m she's 34f to give you an idea of the age/stage of life we're both in. But I'm getting married in a few months, most of our other mutual friends are ether married, engaged, or about to be. She's one of 3 from our friend group who is single. Anyway some of us were hanging out last night. We got to talking about life and shit once most people had left, she was last single person who hadn't gone home yet (but everyone elses so was off doing other stuff, mine at her sisters house watching her niece). 

She got quiet and said she had a question /needed advice. She wanted to know if we thought there was a reason she was single, since she was sick of it. One of the other girls said her 'standards' were kinds high, to which she took offense. I said her attitude was a bit uppity and entitled, she again got upset and wanted clarification. We said that her refusal to date men below the upper middle class, and how she looks down on men below it (which yeah she does shit talk them a lot saying they aren't worthy of her or real men need to keep up and such) and that will scare even upper class men away unless they just want a one nighter.

She was visibly upset and said she shouldn't have to settle for anything less than she deserves. Which yeah she is the 2nd highest income earner in our group, bringing home a tad over 100k a year. The third friend with us chimed in and said that shes doing herself a disservice by keeping her dating pool so small. That the wealthier guys go after less wealthy women all the time so she ls got a ton more competition than guys in her income bracket do. She said she shouldn't have to settle for a loser she has to take care of jusr because of all the trophy and house wife wanna be wh*res out there taking all the good men. This admittedly made me mad, my finace plans to stay at home once we get married, and I make similar income to her high income.  I said if you didn't want to her our opinion she shouldn't have asked. I left then apparently after that she started crying about being alone and how we were mean to some of the others.

1816,Asshole,"
I got engaged in August to my long time boyfriend and I immediately asked my older sister to be my maid/matron honour. When she got married 3 years ago I was her maid of honour and my sister is my best friend and I love her with all my heart. I asked 5 of my close friends to be bridesmaids. Just one month ago my Fiancé and  booked my dream venue and finalized the date for the last week of May and sent out our save the dates. Before finalizing the date we tried to make sure it was a good date for all our family and close friends. 

One week ago my sister and her husband announced she was pregnant. Obviously we were super happy for her. They had been trying for a while and this will be my first niece and nephew. I then found out she was due  the second week of June, meaning she would be 38 months pregnant at my wedding. 

When I was maid of honour for my sister I planned the bridal shower( including keeping track of all the gifts for thank you notes) planned the bachelorette party, went to almost all the shopping appointments with my sister, and was one of the main go to people at the wedding to make sure everything was going smoothly and made a speech at the wedding. I thought about it and believed this was to omuch stress to put my sister through and there was even a chance she might have to miss the wedding due to giving birth. Im a very meticulous planner and thought it would be a good idea to promote my BFF to my maid of honour and just make my sister an “honorary maid of honour” but put no expectations on her and if she is able to be at the wedding both my BFF and my sister could give speeches.

So I asked my BFF if she was interested in being maid of honor too and she was super excited. I then talked to my sister about this and she unexpectedly got very mad at me and said I was making decisions for her and punishing her for getting pregnant and it was her dream to be my maid of honour and I was being unfair and selfish. She said I was acting stuck up and like a control freak for not wanting a pregnant maid of honor.

1818,Not the A-hole,"I (52M) currently live with my wife and with my daughter (24F), since she moved back home a couple years ago after finishing college. My daughter is very overweight (5'3 and about 200 lbs). She always talks about how she wants a boyfriend, and she has never had one.

The other day she was going on a long rant about this at the dinner table. She was saying that it's unfair that all her friends have boyfriends and get attention from guys, and how guys are ""dicks"" who never give her the time of day. She's gone on similar rants before, where she acts like it is inexplicable why she is not getting the same attention. I told her delicately that it could be helpful to try losing some weight, and that unfortunately people are often shallow and that could be something that would help her get male attention, feel more confident, and also generally be healthier.

She yelled at me about how ""all guys are the same, even my fucking dad"" and stormed off. I was genuinely trying to be helpful, and I knew it would be a sore spot but in my mind my intentions were good. Now I am wondering whether I crossed a line.

Some info: she has no genetic predisposition to being overweight (nobody else in the family is), she has no condition that I am aware of, but rather she eats quite a bit and does not get much exercise.

The 7 and 6 year old girls are best friends (we met through them) and have been calling themselves sisters since before we even got together. It's all harmonious. Good bio parents on both sides. We feel like a family already. We are not moved together and the kids are not aware we're together past they have many playdates.

My mom passed away 12 years ago, but my dad is very active in my children's lives. He has a tradition that he takes them anywhere to the two's choosing for Christmas. Last year, they went to Disneyland and said they wanted to go to Disney for Christmas again this year. My dad is all for it.

He called me yesterday to let me know that he still planned on taking the two to Disney and was thrilled to see them soon. 

My partner thinks we should ask him to take all the kids to make things fair. We are a family and grandparents can't just choose who their favourite grandkids are. The others will get jealous since his parents don't do anything but send gifts. 

I'm hesitant to ask. I agree that we should make all the kids feel included and on the same level as one another, but... I feel guilty asking because I truly think that it would mean the end of the trips. My dad isn't a rich man- he makes 45k a year, he saves up all year to do these special trips. And since we live in the Midwest (he lives 15 minutes away), it's very costly to fly so many kids out, much less just taking care of them.

1821,Not the A-hole,"So context. On mobile, sorry in advance. 

I am an executive assistant for a start up company that has a very specialized service with little to no competition, so business is good. My boss, who I will call Miranda, has many, many requests for me that are very out of the box, because it is a small business there are lots of tasks to be done. Running errands, inventory, paying business and home expenses for her, drop offs and pick ups for very heavy equipment or furniture, you get the idea. Just 2 days ago I moved an 8 foot couch, by myself, with a Toyota corolla, so you could say I manage to get things done with determination and critical thinking skills. Everything Miranda has asked of me, I'll do. 

Except. Putting her under 2 year olds car seat in her vehicle. Miranda is a very private and protective person, especially with her kids (4 total). I have barely met them because I only work on the business end of things, which is fine, work/life balance is a fine line. I have two kids of my own she has not met, nor do I see any reason for her to. 

That being said, I feel incredibly uncomfortable putting together her under 2 year olds car seat because I feel this crosses that work/life balance line. Another thing that makes me really uncomfortable about it is the fact I cannot physically carry a child to term due to a myriad of health issues (my two kids are older adopted kids, didn't get them as babies) and dealing with the car seat feels very personal and intimate because of the glaring reminder I won't be putting MY biological child into one. 

I told Miranda I did not want to assemble or transfer a car seat for her and she got very mad at me, told me it was not personal, just logistical and I need to get over it. I responded with all the reasons above why I did not want to do it, she said again to get over it and that I had to do what was assigned to me.

1822,Asshole,"A friend of mine came into town and has been staying at my place for a few days before heading to his next location.

I am in the process of buying a washer and dryer so when he got here in last night, he asked for a towel to shower with and I let him know I had to go to the laundromat in the am and would he be alright to use the towel he had used last night.

He said okay.

Fast forward to him getting out of the shower and he comes out telling me that he made an executive decision to not use his towel and instead use the towels in the bathroom and how they felt much nicer than the other towel anyway.

I was legit confused because there were no other towels in the bathroom.

It took a few seconds for me to realize that he must have meant the decorative towels.

I have a really pretty expensive grey towel, folded neatly with a smaller white towel that has elaborate designs to match the bathroom hanging underneath a picture.

I have had these decorative towels for about a year now, undisturbed. Guests come and go, never had an issue messing with these towels, but anyway.

I was a bit annoyed so I let him know that those towels were decorative towels and they weren't meant to be used, that's why they had stayed so nice.

He proceeds to tell me that towels are towels where he's from and where he's from people use the towels in the house because that's what towels are for.

I told him that I get that, but when he asked me for a towel, if I wanted him to use that towel I would have gave it to him.

He then says 'Well that's the point of an executive decision.""

He then starts talking to my cat about how much better the towel felt and how decorative towels are an oxymoron.

I tell him that's not really the point but I can feel my irritation rising as I see the towels crumpled on the floor so I tell him that I am just going to stop and finish journaling. ( I am working on being more present and less reactive and journaling helps.)

As a result, he immediately gets angry and tells me that he will just leave then.

I say okay and that makes him angrier, he says, ""I can't believe you are just going to let me leave over towels, I said I was sorry.""

Except he didn’t say he was sorry and honestly, I wouldn't have even wanted an apology.

I was annoyed at his dismissive and incredulous tone about me having decorative towels and choosing not to use them.

By this time, I am honestly just shocked that HE is mad.

It wasn't a big deal until I said, ""Okay, you know what, I am telling you that I am just going to finish journaling instead of getting into a shouting match over towels.""

He screams out, ""Well, I am not as good a communicator as you.""

I don't know what to say so I say okay,

I told him that I wasn't going to beg him to stay, if he wanted to leave then, by all means, have at it and I go back to journaling.

1824,Asshole,"My girlfriend (22f) and I (23m) have been dating for 8 months. Around 4 months before I met her, my sister announced she is having a destination wedding. Being that I was single, I asked my friend (22f) if she wanted to go with me. There has never been anything romantic between us and that is one of the things we value about our friendship. I promised her that even if I got into a relationship, we would still go because I think it would be shitty of me to take that away from a long standing friend and give it to a relatively newer girlfriend. After a few months, we both ended up in happy and supportive relationships. As it turns out, my friend and gf went to the same high school together, but did not interact much as they were very different people back then. To give some perspective on the gf, she is someone who goes far out of her way to accommodate others and make people feel comfortable, putting her own happiness second to those around her. We are both great communicators and are always able to talk through our problems. I brought up the destination wedding trip and details early on in the relationship so it wouldn't be a surprise, and it didn't seem to be an issue initially. Over time, her friends (who I believe were only looking out for her) expressed concern that I was going to a romantic destination wedding with someone that is not her, and that they think it is inappropriate. When she met my family, they brought up the wedding on multiple separate occasions forgetting that she was not going, and when we reminded them of this, she was met with ""oh we wish you were going."" Reasonably, these things got to her and built up to her being adamantly against the concept of the trip. By this I mean that she never asked me not to go, and she never asked me to let her go instead of my friend, but she said that she does not want contact with me while I am gone, and does not want to hear about the trip. She has stated that when I return, if she can forget it ever happened and move on, then we will be fine, but if she can't get past it, then our relationship is likely over. I feel like I am doing the right thing by keeping my promise, but she feels like the right thing would have been for me to realize months ago that this is inappropriate and to take her instead (even though she did not ask me to do that).

EDIT: There is no time to change plans. The flight is tomorrow morning and there are no more rooms in the resort. GF has no passport, so this is impossible at this point.

The wedding was a lot of fun, and we talked every day. She had a good weekend visiting a sibling and we hung out when I got back. She made me brownies and I gave her some rum cakes from the trip and we caught up and joked around.

I asked if she could hang out but she tells me that she will be busy for the day. We both get off work, I go home and start scrolling through snaps and facebook. I see on her story that she went out without me. I told her that she made me feel like shit for not inviting me or even asking after knowing I've been wanting to go. She says maybe next time and I tell her she said that the previous time too.

Roll around to Tuesday, she asks me if I want to tag along at a bar with her. I say yes and we focus on work for the next two days. Now comes Halloween night to me asking her what time and where we are gonna meet up. She had completely forgotten that we were supposed to hang out today apparently.

Edit 3. I need to know before so incase smth happens on the way I would know where to get her and make sure she's okay.. idk if it's too much..


Edit 4 and last : Guys I get it.. I am THE ASSHOLE here. I get all points and i take them happily. Yes this is what i needed to know. Yes this is what i needed to hear people telling me what I'm feeling is wrong. I shouldn't be all that fucking overboard with my worries and shit to a point where I become a control freak. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR VALIDATION. I love the girl and i wanna keep her and I NEEDED TO KNOW THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

1827,Not the A-hole,"Here is some context.  My husband and I still maintain separate bank accounts, while having 1 joint account for bills that we both put money into every pay, and 1 joint savings account.  We both put money into RRSP's, however his employer matches his RRSP contributions up to a certain amount every pay and his RRSP contributions are automatically taken out by his employer.  This also means that his employer does not tax him on his pay for the amount equal to his RRSP contributions.  Come tax time, he is usually more or less squared up even for taxes.  Myself, on the other hand, have to pay into my own RRSP account that my employer does not match.  This also means that I am taxed on my RRSP contributions and I get this tax money back as a tax return every year.

We submit our taxes together, however this year, he owed the government something like $150, while the government owed me over $2,000, so our combined tax return was like $1,850.  He thinks we should be splitting this return.  I do not think that would be fair.

I told him that since he already gets to see the fruits of his 'tax return' every paycheck by not paying taxes on his RRSPs, that the entire tax return should be mine to spend on whatever I want.  Why should I have have to pay taxes on something my husband doesn't, and then share that return?  The way I see it, he is benefiting off his company's policies on RRSP contributions.

TLDR; My husband essentially thinks it would be fair to keep his 'tax return' all to himself, and still get half of mine.  AITA for thinking this is unfair?",82,153,0.91

1829,Asshole,"My relationship with my parents was strained. Out of high school I was threatened that if I didn't attend uni immediately (no year off to work) and I didn't pick an approved study (STEM, law, business) they'd give my education savings to my sibling. I begrudgingly chose a major that they approved. There was a lot of other big issues, such as only being allowed one phone call a week, my door removed off the hinges, and my parents moving their bed so they can watch me while I'm doing homework and sleeping. There's a ton to unpack there but basically I wasn't treated like an adult.  


Later I met someone and started dating. This didn't fit their values and they thought it'd risk my education. After a few big arguments they cut off my funding and I was told I had to move out. Part of me thinks I should have dropped out but I wanted to see it through to the end. I moved in with my partner and took on substantial student loans. I also worked during uni, but still took on a few tens of thousands of dollars in loans.  


I got a dream job after graduating but my area has high unemployment and I was laid off shortly after as part of mass layoffs. I went on EI and have been struggling to find a job; the story is always the same: I'm fighting with thousands of people with decades of experience. My employment insurance runs out next week, and my financial situation is abysmal.  


About a decade ago, my father was permanently disabled by a workplace accident. He fell into a few legal grey areas. Regular disability insurance refused to pay and he went without income while fighting a number of lawsuits. He also lost his pension; my parents financial situation has been abysmal too.  


Recently my father won a major milestone in his lawsuits. He's getting a small pension now but not enough to cover monthly expenses. The judgement includes me getting retroactive payments from the government to pay for my uni, as I should have been receiving benefits for him being disabled while going to uni. Its a hefty sum; equal to just under my entire debt. Since my parents aren't receiving any lump sum from their judgement they are claiming that they're ""entitled"" to this money.  


Despite this, I want to help them. My childhood up until I started university was privileged even after my father was injured. Its still true that they ultimately paid for half my education. If they pay off their mortgage, which it'd help them do, they'll no longer have a negative income. They've promised that if I give them the money they'll help me with my student loans down the road.  


My GF says that if I give my parents the money, I'm choosing their future over ours and that I would be an asshole. Her mother is trying to push my GF to break up with me if I do it, but my GF is leaning toward being a bit more understanding.

1831,Not the A-hole,"My co-worker has a history of asking to use my phone so they can check some ex social media, I think it’s their ex.

She got upset and insisted that it didn’t matter And she just needed to call someone. I decline saying I don’t know who your calling and I don’t need random people calling my phone looking for you.

1832,Not the A-hole,"Apologies for the long post, I think the details are necessary. So, I (21f) have always lived with my biological mum (44f) and my stepmother Steph (57f). My bio mum had me when she was 23 and in a relationship with my dad, they broke up when I was about six months; my dad was in a pretty low place until I was five years old and I didn't see him much til then (in case it matters, since then he's been an amazing, supportive dad). When I was about two, my mum met my stepmum, realised she was a lesbian and they've been together ever since. 
My relationship with Steph is fine but it's just that; fine, not great. She's always made it very clear that she is not my mum, I am not her daughter, I am not her responsibility etc. which is all true and I don't blame her for but it doesn't exactly inject a lot of warmth into our relationship. 

Here's the crux of the matter; as much as they can be, my mum and Steph are lesbian separatists. They really genuinely hate the vast majority of men and try to not have any men in their lives in any capacity. Growing up, I couldn't even talk positively about my dad without being ridiculed and Steph still gives my mum a lot of (joking) shit about having been a ""breeder"" and had relationships with men. Obviously they live in the world so they can't cut off contact with men altogether but they don't have male friends, they'll wait for a female cashier to be available in a shop etc. 

Last November, I met my now-boyfriend at uni and we've been together for ten months now. He's great, I love him a lot and he's proved a lot of the stereotypes I was taught about men growing up completely false. He's met my dad and a lot of extended family on my dad's side and that's all gone really well. I'm pretty sure this relationship is going to last a long time, but I haven't even told my mum and stepmum that I'm seeing someone, let alone introduced them. I just know even telling them is going to be a headache because they're really, really not fans of heterosexuality in any form  (I'm pretty sure I'm actually bisexual, but that would probably go down even worse than being straight; straight women at least can't help it, bi women are either traitors or straight women looking for attention). I know that if I bring him home, they'll be rude to him and horrible to me and try to make me feel guilty. But on the flip side, I feel bad; they raised me and I'm hiding a big part of my life from them. I also don't want my boyfriend to think I'm ashamed of him when that really is not the case.

My boyfriend says he is fine with not meeting them but he also says he would be fine with coming home with me if that's what I wanted so essentially it's up to me.

To clarify, I don't think anything worse than nastiness/mockery would happen if I told them about him/they met him. I know they're not going to cut off contact or kick us out or anything, it would just be an unpleasant experience. Am I the asshole here? Should I introduce them?",189,733,0.88

1834,Not the A-hole,"For the record, this guy is not homeless. He's an HIV-positive, physically disabled guy who lives in an addiction recovery program/independent living apartment complex around the corner from me in a city/state with a relatively generous social system compared to most of the country. His meals, disability payments, permanent housing, and other needs are provided for him and the complex he lives in is clean and nice -- not a shelter.

This guy hangs outside my building's door several times a week for the past two years or so (I've lived here for five). He's not at all threatening and likes to make conversation. I always say hello to him, shake his hand, have a chat and generally am respectful and friendly to him. However, without fail, two minutes into the conversation he always says ""I know I'm always asking, and I hate to be a bother, but my check doesn't come until tomorrow...could you *please* go to the ATM for me?"" He doesn't ask for spare change but a full-on visit to the ATM for cash. I always apologetically decline and cut the conversation short. Once or twice, I've bought him a coffee or a sandwich but have never given him money.

He also seems to think my fiance and I are wealthy because once when he's asked where we've been we said we were visiting family and he said: ""Oh, flying first class and drinking champagne?"" No, dude, taking the Greyhound to Baltimore but I digress...

I lost my job a while ago with about 1,000 of my colleagues and got minimum severance. Honestly, it's been depressing and I'm watching my savings dwindle as I look for jobs and freelance gigs. My fiance's salary is not enough to carry both of us for more than another month or two.

I'm coming home from grocery shopping last night and I see him hanging outside my building again. My stomach sinks because I know what's coming. I know I should walk past but he waves me down and I don't have the heart to just ignore the guy now that I've set a precedent for at least being tolerant to him. So he extends his hand for a handshake and I oblige, ask him how he's doing and without fail, two minutes in he starts.

I immediately lose my patience and say ""James, you *need* to stop asking me for money. I'm *unemployed.* I lost my job and can't help you. My fiance can't help you either. You get money from the state. I know food and housing are paid for because you've told me that. You can't go asking people to hit the ATM whenever you see them. It's annoying and makes me think you think I'm just a target. I'm going inside right now. Have a good night.""

He looked really taken aback and offended, but FFS I've been dealing with this guy for two years. Some people have suggested I let his housing facility staff know but I don't want to be a dick to a harmless lonely guy. 

AITA for shutting him down? I get that his life probably sucks but he's **not homeless** and while I have money to pay for my own essentials a little while longer, I can barely afford to hit the ATM whenever *I* want to.",89,572,0.95

1836,Not the A-hole,"I had this friend, we became close really fast. Eventually it became very obvious that she was insecure about her weight, I was as well. I just never made as many self depricating jokes about it as she did. I always did mention I wanted to lose weight though. One day I decided to stop making excuses and finally started running and eating better. I lost A LOT of weight and she started commenting on it. I was very happy then the ""you don't need to lose anymore weight"" or ""why do you want to"" comments started. One day we were shopping together and the smallest sweater they had in the store couldn't fit me so I asked for an XS. Rachel(not her real name) makes a snappy comment going ""are you trying to make me look bad?"" which I didn't get at all. It had NOTHING to do with her.

Anyway, I moved away and months later she came to visit me and I noticed for 75% of the trip she was very passive aggressive towards me, made little jabs here and there. And finally after she'd been gone for a week, I posted a picture on instagram from our vacation and I'd asked her if she thought it would have been thirsty and she said no. Later that day she tweeted something about someone being thirsty. I ignored it, but it bugged me through out the day. So finally I went back to go screen grab it and it was gone. Tried to let it go but at this point I was frustrated with her behavior, so finally, I asked her about the tweet and brought up the passive aggressive comments. She did not respond to me and deleted me and all MY friends off of her social media. And that was that. Never heard from her again.

AITA cause obviously I know she's very insecure but I'm not sure why that would equate to trying being passive towards your so called best friend or trying to put them down.",38,39,0.94

1839,Asshole,"My brother is 12, and he wants to go trick or treating with his friends tonight.

Here's the issues:

1. he will be the oldest there - the other 2 kids he'll be going with are also 12 years old, and they're all idiots. I've seen these kids run into the middle of a busy street on a dare. There will be no parental supervision.
2. he has a phone but rarely uses or checks it - I've talked with him about this before and he says it's not his fault he never remembers to check it and as he doesn't like talking on the phone he outright ignores any phone calls
3. they plan to meet up at 6pm and wrap things up for around 8pm - they live in the neighbouring town, a 20 minute bus ride away, and my car is at the garage, so we're public transport reliant right now, and after 6pm busses are hourly.

I've said he can't go because of the lack of supervision and his dislike of checking in, plus the logistics with the bus. He says I'm being unreasonable, I need to trust that he will check in, I can get him a taxi if it comes to that, and as he's nearly a teenager I should be treating him like one.

AITA?

Info: I am my brother's sole legal guardian.

He has never been trick or treating before.

I don't get off work until 7, so I'm not available to supervise from 6. I've said that the options are find someone over 12 to supervise or send me texts to check in (even just one saying he got there fine and another saying he's on the bus back) but he says he won't remember.

Update: He went anyway. He missed the 8:25 bus, the 9:25 didn't arrive, and I had to go in a taxi to get him.",400,1186,0.96

1842,Not enough info,"I am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

My sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

I don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

When Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

Amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

The final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

I was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

Unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

I assume they are from the man in front of me. 

A few seconds later another man walks over to the basket and starts placing the items on the checkout band. When he is done he leaves again to get some more groceries.

The checkout process of the man in front of us takes a bit longer because he is paying €200 in cash with bills of €10 so they all had to be checked if they were real. During this process the man that was still shopping came back and started a discussion with me because I was cutting in line when he was gone.

My folks do take at least part of the time off work so they can hang out with the kids, but they can't take off a full 5-6 weeks.  My folks never ask me for a dime to look after the kids (I sent them money anyway). They spoil them for those few weeks and take them on trips.  My kids are always happy to be there.

1848,Not the A-hole,"Long story so I’m sorry but the details matter. 
I’m 30 years old and have some pretty serious health conditions. 
Until April I was going to my grandparents house every day from 9am until 7pm to care for them both. In April we moved in with my in laws whilst we waited to find a new home, as they lived further away and I don’t drive I then went 3-4 times a week for at least 3 hours at a time. I’ve been caring for them for years now. 

In June my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and on Thursday we were told it was time for him to go into the hospice, however they had no space.
I went on Thursday until 9pm when I had to leave to sort my dogs out, I then went back Friday afternoon and have been there ever since. Helping care for grandad, cleaning the house ect. 
My grandad passed away on Sunday afternoon and my grandmas back pain was suddenly worse so she’s now bed ridden and can’t sit up at all. 

My uncle has gone on holiday he left the morning after my grandad passed and my father won’t do any actual care for grandma (cleaning her up, helping her use the bedpan as she can’t get up to the toilet). 

Since Sunday I’ve done everything alone, grandma has you up stairs every 5 minutes, she won’t let you stay upstairs but then demands you back to feed her, give her drinks, help her use the bedpan, keep her company, change the sheets ect. I’ve also been doing all the housework and I’m exhausted. 

My uncles wife has arrived and taken over but she lives 5 hours away and can’t stay indefinitely because she has children. 

We are currently waiting for the X-ray to verify but the doctor said he thinks it’s a crushed vertebrae and it’s likely to be months before she can sit up. 

I’ve been asked to return and stay. But I am honestly at my breaking point. I’m already a carer for my husband who has Aspergers I have 5 dogs and am due to move in 2 weeks. As well as my own serious health issues and mental health issues. 
I’ve been asked to put off moving. And be there to provide 24 hour care for my grandma. 

WIBTA if I said that they’d have to put her in a 24 hour care facility until she can move again?

I’m so tired, I’ve been caring for them non stop since Friday (first my grandad now grandma) and I’ve not been given any time to grieve. Everyone else has been able to go home and process and I’ve not been allowed. 

I don’t know what to do.

1849,Not the A-hole,"Hi, I will try to present this as neutral as possible to get a fair judgment

Background: my husband (30M) works 70hr/week and sometimes doesn't get much sleep. As a result, I (33F) take care of our 10 month old (still doesn't sleep through the night), work part time bec we rely on my income too, do all cleaning, shopping, cooking dinner and laundry. My husband handles virtually nothing else in our home or decisions when it comes to our son. He doesn't clean up after himself. I have been adjusting to motherhood poorly and have had moderate/severe post partum depression for which I am seeking help. Our family lives out of state.

Today, I asked my husband to please drop our child off at daycare since I have a lot planned for cleaning/organizing the house (I have been out of town with our son) and I have to return to daycare early for my son's Halloween party. To be honest I am further deterred by taking the time to put on warm clothes and a bra just to drop him off and return home only to start cleaning. The daycare is 1 mile from his work. We live in a busy city but everyone drives. I will be honest, my dad is here right now helping me which is relevant bc im not totally alone. My dad cannot drive our son to daycare. Also, I would prepare all the bottles, pack the daycare bag etc. I am asking him to drive and drop him off at daycare on his way to work. If he left ten minutes early he would not be late to work. To be fair to him, I only asked him about 40 min before he was to leave and not in advance.

My husband responds with a sigh and eye roll and says no, he has a process to his mornings and cannot take our son to daycare. He also said that if I am asking him to do so then I don't understand what he is dealing with. I respect the morning process as I also like to not jump out of bed and go. My husband's process involved cooking eggs, coffee, toast, relaxing, playing on his Nintendo switch and showering. So this would eat 10 minutes into his switch playing time

I understand that he works longer hours than me however, I find running the house, taking care of the baby and working part time to be very exhausting and would really appreciate help today. I do think it is probably a lot to ask but I just would really appreciate it. If I didn't have so much cleaning/organizing today and have to return to daycare early and/or was already out and about, I wouldn't ask him. Part of this is that I like to be efficient and its not efficient for me to get dressed and make a whole trip out just to return home when he is already heading in that direction.

AITA? I will take whatever judgment with my head held high. If I am TA then I will re-evaluate my thought process. Thank you for reading!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input. It has been helpful.  I do want to say that I am sorry that I have portrayed my husband as childish.  He works very hard and I feel regretful and guilty that I have portrayed him as a shitty father.  He absolutely is not a shitty father.  I know that ultimately it is my responsibility to take the baby to daycare but I really wasn't feeling it this morning so I wondered  AITA for feeling like he should help me out.  Honestly, I think I am just having a hard time mentally lately and am suspicious that I am becoming unreasonable/an asshole. Thanks again!",195,58,0.83

1852,Not the A-hole,"So, in trying to keep this short, my best friend (E) and I live in different states. I recently came down to visit him (I'm also male) to attend a party and finally meet his gf (A) of 1 year. We're all in our 20's.

I noticed A had a pin from a popular anime series that I like and we began talking about it for a while. E was not present for this conversation. I didn't mean this comment as an insult, but it kinda just slipped out of my mouth, and I told A she looked like one of the guys from the anime. In my defense, he's also pretty effeminate looking anyway, so I didn't think it was offensive. A didn't take offense, and took it as a compliment, and was actually delighted because the character was her favourite.

The next day, I got a message over facebook from E, saying that he was glad that I got along with his girl, but should think twice before telling a girl she looks like a male anime character. I thought maybe A was actually upset, but E said she wasn't and was ""strangely happy"" about it, but ""next time, don't tell a girl, especially one your best friend is dating, a boy because people might get pissed off"". I asked if he was angry at me, but he's left me on read so far.

I've had mixed feelings about the situation, because I really don't think before I speak. But A was happy enough about it, so I also feel like E needs to calm down, but that could also be me being defensive. Idk, reddit, AITA?

TL;DR - met my best friend's gf of 1 year for the first time at a party, began a conversation about anime, mentioned she looked similar to one of the male characters on the show (who turned out to be her favourite anyway). Best friend sends me a message over Facebook telling me I fucked up. AITA?

Today my mother (45) asked me if I knew where my old phone was and I told her that I gave it to my girlfriend. I got the phone from my mother back in 2017, it's a Samsung J5 2016, if that's important, idk. And she's had 3 new phones since then. She threatened to go over to my girlfriend's house and take back ""her"" phone, she thinks the phone is still hers and proceeds to rant about how I don't own anything since I still haven't got anywhere in life. 

AITA and should I tell my girlfriend that I'll be taking my phone back?

Edit: Thank you for the replies, guys! My mom probably will go take the phone back herself, if I don't, which I probably will.

I do accept my fault about not asking her about giving it to her, and it's probably the only reason why I'm taking the phone back.",24,69,0.96

1855,Not the A-hole,"I have a 50-50 split in custody of my 17 year old son. He's turning 18 next week, on November 3rd, when he will be allowed to legally drink. His mum and him had an argument, and according to her it ended with him swearing at her and her grounding him for a month. As we alternate weeks, she has asked me to continue the grounding at my place, and when I said that I'd planned on buying him a beer to celebrate turning 18 she said that I couldn't do that while he was being grounded, and I should wait until the month was over.

However, I have never set punishments that intrude on her time with him, I've always dealt with them in my week, and also from what she said of the argument, he was right. I know we're meant to be on the same side here but the argument, in short, from her own admission, was that he wanted to do another extracurricular with his friends and she said no because it would take away from his homework time, which I feel is an odd argument given that our son is a straight A student and can handle another extracurricular. The swear that got him grounded was when he said ""I'm not allowed to do fucking anything"", so it wasn't like he swore at her directly.

I'm torn on this because while I feel the punishment doesn't fit the crime, she's also been on my back lately for making myself the ""fun parent"". I have a bit more by way of income than she does so while she has to stick to a shopping list and meal plan each week I'm able to ask our son what he wants for dinner and get takeout every now and again, and our son hasn't said anything to me but she says he's indicated to her that he prefers being with me at my place.

It had been emphasized for me more ever since me and my sister had to live separately from a parents (they're in a different country, we live with a relative), but now that I am close to applying to colleges, my family members have been trying to talk to me about choosing a college that is closer to home and ""to think of my sister"". Now, the college of my choice is about 8 hours away from home while hers is only 25 mins away.  My family's reasoning is that it will be cheaper if we stayed closer to home which I understand since allocating money between two college students is not entirely easy. Their other reason, on the other hand, pissed me off as they are also essentially asking me to ""not forget about my sister"" and to stay close to her so that I can still look after her. Me and her have  compromised by only considering colleges that are only in-state and have talked to our family about our potential choices (they are still paying after all). Still, my family would always pester me about the costs and worrying about my sister and its honestly making me seriously doubt my choice to the point where I've started to avoid the conversation with my family altogether and have started to resent them a little for making me put my sister first before my future.

1860,Asshole,"I run a donut shop and I have an employee that I don't know what to do with. Katie is an excellent worker and incredibly loyal. I poached her from a grocery store a couple years ago and never regretted it. In the mornings I come in at 4am for the opening shift and at 5am I open the doors. I have one person who comes in around 6am, and then Kate is scheduled for 7am. However, my 6am person just quit and no one else was willing to trade their start time so I'm by myself from 5am-7am, until I can get someone hired and trained. I noticed shortly after hiring Katie that she arrives about ten minutes early and sits in her car reading until it's time for her to clock in. 

Given the fact that I'm down a person this kind of irks me. She sits in her car and watches as cars come through the drive-thru and doesn't come inside to help. Recently I took her aside and privately asked her if she arrives at work early to please come on inside because I could use the help. Surprisingly Katie got upset and reminded me that she ""drives an hour each way to work, through several different school zones, and major highway construction, she's never asked for excessive time off, has called out twice since I hired her, and frequently works later than planned so the high schoolers that work the night shift have time to get to work"". I told her that's fine and all, I appreciate everything she does for me, but maybe she can see it from my POV, and it's not like she'd be working for free, it's ten extra minutes on her paycheck and it's only until I hire someone else.

Basically she told me that when I hired her she warned me that 7am was as early as she'd be willing to clock-in and she isn't compromising from that fact. I also said something to the effect of ""wouldn't you rather be getting paid than sitting in your car in the dark?"" She told me she reads so she can relax after her drive. Anyway, she's been a little salty and now she's been threatening to leave. I didn't punish her for saying no, she wasn't docked hours, I brought it up a second time because we had been absolutely slammed and I was alone, hence her threatening to quit.

The way I see it, she's already here, she's in the parking lot, she wouldn't have to change anything about her morning routine because obviously it's working. All I asked is for a little extra help until I can hire someone.

Recently, a friend and coworker had a change in home life that inspired them to sponsor a request to make shifts permanent on a seniority based bid system. They had no objections to  before this.

The vote was cast and fell along mostly senior/junior lines, with one tie-breaker in favor of the change out of about 20 votes.

I'm not going to pretend I'm unbiased, I opposed the change, I am relatively new. I'm unlikely to see the light of day for years to come. I felt betrayed by a friend choosing to affect all of their peers' lives because they suddenly dislike the status quo.

As a twist, it turns out they miscalculated. They didn't predict what their seniors wanted, and they might not be guaranteed a spot on their preferred shift. They claimed they would either have to withdraw their tiebreaker vote, or would resign if they couldn't get their way. They refused to accept the new normal they were happy to force on half the rest of us.

I didn't use profanity or raise my voice but I called out what I saw as selfishness and hypocrisy. They accused me of singling them out from everyone else that voted. The (narrow) majority was happy with the change so they weren't expecting personal criticism, and I think it cut pretty deep.

Tonight we were at a banquet (we coach sports) and there was a microphone. A mic is like Crack to me, I can't help but be goofy. As people were showing up, I was talking to them over the mic, making wise cracks, taking musical requests, making funny or spooky noises, etc. My wife started getting mad at me and made me put the mic away. After the banquet was dying down I started to get going again on the mic and I had to stop again.

1869,Asshole,"My college has an annual event where local kids can safely trick or treat in the dorms the day before Halloween. The students are required to buy their own candy and have to pray they don’t run out before the event is over, which happened to me last year.

So tonight was this event and I was pretty strict with the “one candy per kid” rule, but I was really uncomfortable when a parent would approach the door with a baby (and I mean less than 1-2 years old) and expect me to give them candy on their behalf. This happened with parents who had other, more appropriately aged kids with them too, which was I guess more understandable. But mainly it happened with parents who had nobody else but the baby- they would just show up to my door holding a costumed baby and a bag and said “say trick or treat!” as if they deserve something for that.

After this happening more than a few times, I decided to put my foot down and deny candy to kids who weren’t old enough (can’t walk, can’t hold their own bag, doesn’t know what’s going on). From that point on I said to everyone else that night: “We have limited candy and want to make sure the ‘big’ kids get some.”

I wound up getting some criticism from a few parents, some made shocked or disgusted faces and one couple even said they wanted to complain to the resident manager of my building, who is 100% on my side on this.

Am I the asshole for thinking that it’s wrong for parents to use their baby, who is too young to remember their first or second Halloween, to get free candy for themselves by trick or treating?

**EDIT: I’m definitely NOT against giving candy to teenagers. Hell, I’ve even seen a few of my fellow students trick or treating at this event!

My husband and I live pretty far away from our families, but we’re really excited that his whole family is coming to visit us for the week of Thanksgiving!  We have a decent-sized house, so we have invited everyone to stay with us for the week.  

However, my BIL’s girlfriend is apparently allergic to dogs, and we have a ~13/14 year old (very furry) pup whom we obviously love very much.  Now, it’s probably not *impossible* for us to find a friend to watch our pup for a week, or maybe we could pay a dog-sitter to take her, but all things being equal we’d prefer not to.  The whole family (except for BIL’s gf) has met our pup before, and they all love her (and she loves them!)  BIL + gf are going to try staying here, and we are going to do our best to clean, but if it gets to be too much for her we’ve offered to point them to a nice hotel nearby.

On the one hand, our pup was here first.  She’s an important part of our family, like any good pupper should be!  OTOH, if the roles were reversed and I was meeting my boyfriend’s brother for the first time, in an unfamiliar city, I might feel left out that I couldn’t stay where the whole family is staying.

To be clear, I don’t think my BIL or his gf are being assholes.  They have not actually asked us to relocate our furry friend while they are here.  The gf did ask my BIL to rehome his cat when she moved in with him (a request he complied with) so removing animals based on her presence is not without precedent.  I’m just wondering if we are being ungracious hosts (and assholes) by not offering to do so.

I earn more than he does (I'm a lawyer), so I helped him buy a camera, lenses and everything he needed. I didn't pay everything, I'd say about half of it. He even has his instagram account where he uploads the pictures he takes.

Five months ago he proposed, and of course I said yes because he was the love of my life. We told everyone, and started to plan the wedding. Everything was great and we were really in love (or so I thought).

His laptop was stolen three weeks ago and we were going to buy the new one on black friday, so he could have a better one. However, he needed a laptop to edit his photos, so I let him use mine.

Last sunday I was home alone and someone knocked on the door. I opened and found a pregnant woman waiting for me, who asked me to come inside. I didn't know who she was, so I said no, but she insisted saying she knew my ex and had something important to tell me. Turns out he had been cheating on me for ALMOST TWO YEARS, and this woman was going to be the mother of his child. She told me my ex had told her we had an open relationship, so he could have sex with whoever he wanted. When she got pregnant, she asked him to help her and pay child support, but he refused and told her to stay away from him. And it gets worse: she's around six months pregnant, so he proposed to me after finding out.

I thanked this woman, and drove her home since she had come in a taxi. I got back home and packed my ex stuff so I could just tell him to leave when he came back (the apartment we live on is 100% mine, so no problem there). He came back, I told him that I already knew everything, he tried to apologize, blah blah blah, and finally he left with his things. However, his photos are still in my laptop. Yesterday he called me to ask for them, and of course I refused to give him the photos. After all of the emotional damage he caused me and this other woman, I think the least he deserves is to lose two weeks worth of pictures.

She wasn’t ever especially happy with him and I personally never understood his appeal, but he seemed harmless so I just went with it and supported her through their minor ups and downs and was happy for her when he proposed because it made her happy. 

Long story short, not long after the engagement she finds out he’s been unfaithful to her at least once. They in no way had an open arrangement, and she is devastated. Instead of leaving   she decides to go to couples therapy, and finds out he’s a self proclaimed “sex and love addict” and has been unfaithful to her their entire relationship with multiple people. She totally falls apart and even has to stop working  just to cope with the grief. Everything is a trigger. She cries all day. Won’t go out. Becomes rail thin from not eating. Etc. But she still doesn’t leave. 

It’s been over three months since she discovered who he really is, and the main way she spends her time now is going to group therapy for the spouses of sex addicts and couples therapy with someone who specializes in “sex addiction.” None of her therapists have advised her to leave the relationship, and instead actually encourage her to stay because he has “an addiction” and therefore he “can recover.” They also encourage her not to tell her friends or family about his “addiction” because we “won’t understand.”

The other day I told her that these therapists seem to be supporting him more than her future happiness. She told me she didn’t have to justify herself to me, and that what she needed was my  support for her decisions. I told her there was no way I could support her marrying a serial cheater, and that whether his choices can really be classified as an addiction (the American Psychiatric Association says it cannot, btw) shouldn’t make a difference when she’s in so much pain. I  told her she deserves and can find so much better (she’s kind, successful, funny, super hot etc) and that she has no real reason to stay beyond fear of being alone. She then told me she was really hurt by my lack of faith in her decision making, and even went so far as to say I make her feel unsafe. 

I think she’s the asshole because she has made taking care of her throughout this my daily emotional responsibility. She has forbade me from giving her any more advice, and only me to sympathize with her “trauma.” Meanwhile, she’s listening to any therapist or book who sides with sticking by your “addict”partner and isolating yourself from your friends and family who don’t agree. And she’s not getting better. She’s just as miserable and broken as she was three months ago. If anything she’s doing worse and seems to have no real aspirations whatsoever beyond “healing” their relationship.

My grandfather knows the tenants, not well but they've met and spoken a few times.  Well my grandfather has a huge soft spot for kids and gave me 2 dollars and said to give them to the kids as a treat. My grandpa grew up really poor and he and his siblings even went to an orphanage after his mother died and his dad couldn't take care of them, so he is always doing things like this. 

So the youngest one walks by and i kneel down and tell her here is a goodbye gift, thank you for helping pack.  She is super excited and said thank you.  I ask her to find her sister as i have one for her as well. She runs off and sister comes by a little later. 

I kneel down and tell her the same thing but when i offer her the dollar she looks at it and then gives me a side eye and says ""i want 2.""

I told her ""that is very rude. If someone offers you a gift, you do not complain or ask for more. You say thank you. So you can either accept this dollar and say thank you,  or I can give it to your sister who was polite and did say thank you. ""

She scrunched up her nose and said ""FINE. I guess!"" And made to snatch it out of my hand. I put it away and said. ""This is still not a polite way to act, and it is not a thank you."" 

I gave the second dollar to the younger sister, explained why and thanked her for her behavior. Surprisingly older sister, while obviously ticked, did not fly into a screaming fit like i expected.

I told the kids parents and said i just didnt want them to think younger sis had taken older sisters dollar.

1887,Not the A-hole,"This happened a long time ago, as in when I was 6 years old.

I am on the spectrum and the reason I state that is because when I was a kid, you can say that I looked like that generic autistic kid at school. I hardly communicated much because it's difficult to translate what's in my head into words/expressions and meltdowns were a regular. I state this because it's important to the story that still bothers me to this day that still gets referenced in my family. 

So here I am playing with my toys in my room by myself again because my little sister was recently born and is getting a lot of attention, which I was content with btw because I understood at the time. My Mom prepared me this is how it was going to be and I think I did a good job adjusting. I learned to entertain myself and even tried to get involved helping to take care of my sister, but I won't lie...it still bothered me that I didn't get to spend time with my Mom like I normally did.

So you can imagine how absolutely ecstatic I was when my Mom came in and said she's going to make me my favorite soup (semolina) and play together until bed time. I was so happy and excited that I came down immediately to the kitchen to help her. I got all the stuff out including the pot and coup bowls out and waited.

I thought that maybe I misunderstood and came too early because my Mom didn't come for a while. I ended up waiting an hour until I decided to go find my Mom in the house somewhere. She was playing with my baby sister again and even though I was really sad and about to cry, I didn't want to say anything to be mean so I just went back to my room without anyone noticing me and hoping my Mom will come get me when she was ready. 

Now it's getting close to my bedtime and I want to muster up the courage to ask my Mom why she never came to make my soup like she said she would. 

This time I see her just sitting on the couch talking with my Dad or something and it really looks like she just forgot about me and now I'm really trying hard to fight back tears. 

I was feeling a lot at the moment and I tried my hardest to say something and all that came out was ""I don't understaaand."" and that famous line has been repeated in my family ever since then. It's been used as a regular quote to poke fun at me because it resembles how jealous I was of my sister getting all the attention. I don't feel bullied by it or truly bothered by it because we poke fun at each other all the time with stuff like this; however I feel like this one thing is just not justified and that's what bothers me.

To this day I think I was justified in being upset that my Mom didn't fulfil the promise SHE originally proposed and got me excited for; but my parents think that I was just jealous of my sister and crying for attention. 

If I ever try to defend my side of the story it will always get brushed off; so I'm asking you reddit! AITA?

1888,Asshole,"I’m 28 and I owe much of my three years sober to my sponsor, Duane. He helped bring me back from the edge of many almost-relapses and basically became like a father to me after my own family didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. 

He’s helped me with my relationships, with navigating my new career and getting back on my feet. I met his wife who also appreciated the friendship we had outside of a sponsor context. 

I didn’t even know that Duane had been having a rough time lately with his addiction. He was sober for 21 years.

I got a call last week that Duane’s body had been found and his wife told me it was an accidental overdose.

The funeral is being held this weekend. I received an invitation from her yesterday.

The thing is, I don’t plan to go. I can’t square the sober man who helped me with the man who died of an overdose in his car in a parking lot. I almost feel betrayed by him, like I didn’t really know him at all. If he had died of any other reason, I think I could go, but not when this is how it happened. 

I told his wife that due to the circumstances of his death, I didn’t think I would be attending the funeral.

She seemed upset but understood.

I feel like I made the right choice, but with Duane gone, I don’t have very many people to talk to anymore about this especially.

1889,Not the A-hole,"My mom asked me to prepare some tea for her today. I was having a costochondritis episode but I agreed to do it anyways. It was just some tea and an apple so it shouldnt take long or too much effort. I peeled the apple, cut it and put it in a plate. Then I proceeded to make the tea. Problem was, I couldnt find my mom's teacup, so I asked ""where's your teacup?"" and she said ""I hid it"" (she always hides food and goods for her own consumption) so I proceeded to ask where it was and she was like ""I dont want to tell you"", so I spent the following ten minutes looking for the cup all over the house and finally found it. I went to look for some tea and couldnt find any kind of tea (which is odd because I usually drink tea everyday and it remains in the same place). I asked where the tea was and she told me she had hidden it and wasn't going to tell me where so I couldnt drink it. I then proceeded to look 10 minutes more for the tea. Finally, almost over, and in great chest pain for the effort of crawling to look for stuff, I asked where the sweetner was. ""I hid it"" she said, and I simply lost it. I agreed to a favour that was supposed to take 5 minutes and ended up in a treasury hunt that lasted 45 just because my mom thinks she owns certain foods in the house and doesnt let us eat them. I started yelling because in the process of searching for everthing a pack of flour fell and I ended up completely covered in flour and I had just lost it. AITA here? I personally think that its wrong to hide food from your family and then make them go crazy looking for them so that they can prepare you some tea. Opinions?

EDIT: thanks for all your insight and opinions guys! 

As for those who asked, I kept doing the favour because if I dont she gets irrationally angry? So might as well get it over with. 

As in regards to her mental health, she doesnt have dementia or alzhaimers, she's just a narcissist and refuses to get help. Either way I still question if AITA in these situations because I always get blamed.

1890,Not the A-hole,"I knew my MIL for ten years when my husband and I (F 30) got married. When we first met, she asked me to please call her by her first name. She's always been ""Sally"" to me.

The day of the wedding, Sally told me that since I was becoming her daughter, I would need to start calling her ""Mom."" Over the last year I've tried to respect her wishes, but it's incredibly uncomfortable, and I really want to go back to calling her Sally.

If I'm trying to get her attention in a group setting, I have to practically scream ""MOM!"" I think because mothers' ears are tuned to hear their kids' voices, and she's not used to hearing it in my voice. Everyone stares and it gives me massive anxiety. When I would slip and call her Sally, she'd become sad and sigh that she wished I would call her Mom. Now I tend to avoid addressing her at all or I ask my husband to get her attention for me, which is as awkward as it sounds.

I already have a ""Mom"" in my life. My actual mother, the woman who birthed and raised me, is offended by Sally's request since she doesn't feel Sally earned the title. My mom told me she would be upset if she found out I was calling Sally ""Mom."" No matter what I do, I'm disrespecting someone's wishes.

I'm comfortable addressing cards or letters to Sally as Mom, especially if it's from both my husband and me. Once I called her ""Grandma"" when I was talking to my toddler nephew (since that's how he knows her), and she got really excited and suggested that if I'm not comfortable with ""Mom,"" I could call her ""Grandma"" instead. Someday if we have kids, I will definitely teach them that she's Grandma to them, but Sally isn't my grandma, so it doesn't make sense to me.

I love Sally, and I've tried explaining all of this to her, but she brushes it off, changes the subject, or acts incredibly hurt that I would imply that she isn't my mom. She only had sons, so I think some of this unwillingness to acknowledge the ""in-law"" part is because she desperately wanted a daughter, and marrying her sons off is the closest she can get.

The well-intentioned gesture that she wanted to bring us closer feels like it's pushing us apart. So AITA if I don't call her Mom?

1893,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I work in a landscaping crew of 3 guys. Me, and we will call them John and Eddie. John is the foreman. I have a great relationship with our boss who has also said that he plans to let John go next week, because he frequently doesn't show up for work and wants to go home early all the time. Our usual hours are 7am-5:30pm this time of year, but it can vary from day to day. If it rains heavily we have the option to leave early.

Today: As soon as we clocked in today, John started whining about not wanting to work because it was supposed to rain in the afternoon. As well as he doesn't like working for the specific designer we had. Around 1pm it began raining lightly and John said I guess we are going home. I said screw that we have a job to do and it's not raining that bad and Eddie and I want hours so we can make our money. After arguing a little about it I told him to just drive back to shop and pick up a few more plants that our designer wanted to add. That way he didn't have to work in the rain, but could still accomplish something.

When he got back a little over an hour later it was raining heavier and he began helping us plant some plants. After planting just a few, he complains about the rain and says screw it I'm leaving. I said we only have like 15 more plants and we still need to wash off the driveway because it was muddy from the rain and dirt of digging around it all day. He says he's not doing it. He said he didn't care and then proceeded to leave when the second foreman we had onsite who was only in charge of the back of the house while we did the front said you sure aren't leaving until you at least clean the driveway.

He started to clean the driveway while Eddie and I planted about 5 more of the plants, but he wasn't halfway done before he said he's not doing it and was gonna leave for real. Eddie went with him as to not be left behind. I started working on the last 10 plants amidst horn honking, until he finally got out and came up to me saying let's go. I said there's only a few more plants and we still need to clean the other half of the driveway. He said I'll leave you I seriously don't care. I said I have friends who live close, I'll see if they can give me a ride, or I'll take an Uber, or the bus I don't care. So he left. I started chatting with the other foreman while casually continuing to plant the last few plants. His crew guys took over cleaning the driveway. After 10 minutes John came back and said he called our boss who said I was fired if I didn't go with him and that I wasn't gonna be on this crew after today. The other foreman said don't worry about the last 3 plants and go ahead and go. So I left.

1895,Asshole,"My daughter and I are having a discussion about a upcoming field trip that I would like to chaperone. The paperwork has already been submitted but there is a lottery as to who gets to attend as chaperone. According to her, not many parents  have volunteered to chaperone so there is a good chance that I will get selected. 

Today my daughter informed me that she would not like for me to go because ""kids are mean and they will make either fun of me or her, perhaps both."" 

I'm very active in my community and my girls are often embarrassed by the number of people who know who they are just because they have met me in some capacity (they look just like me). Example, a 6th grader approached her today asking if her mom used to do the PTA. This embarrassed her because it came from nowhere and she had never met this particular person before.

I would like to go on the field trip as this is her eighth grade year and I do not chaperone in high school. So this is one of my last opportunities to participate in this kind of way. When I chaperone middle school field trips I give my kids a wide berth to be with their friends without me over their shoulder, unlike in elementary.

She also wants me to let you all know that I plan to chaperone the 8th grade dance as well. This is my second child to go through middle school and the first one will tell you I did not interrupt her and her friends at the dance. I let them have their own fun and they would not have even known I was there but I drove them.

As an educator, I know how crucial it can be to have support from parents on field trips and in the classroom. This is partially why I am so involved. Teachers really need our support. I respect that it can be embarrassing for the kids the older they get which is why I give them plenty of room when I'm present.

So, WIBTA if I attend this field trip? Your verdict will determine if I attend or not.

Update: thanks for all of your input. It was a wild ride.

**I will NOT be attending the field trip.** 

This was a lively discussion that was fun until I posted here. Big mistake. While happy that she won, my daughter was angry because ""these people assumed a lot, why do they keep saying you don't listen to me? We are talking about it, you didn't just say deal with it"". ""They are making seem like you're a bad mom and that's not how I feel."" - so, I stopped letting her read the comments. I took a tally........ 

I **would** be the ass if I did not listen to my daughter's feelings and attended the trip. 

I'm also the ass for forgetting about the mean things that are said on Reddit and exposing her to that. 

Apparently, I'm also the ass for saying ""as an educator"". That came across as know it all and annoying. My bad. 

Somehow, I was downvoted for admitting that me wanting to go was about me? That was just weird. 

I want to thank everyone who had a involved parent that was also shy and shared their experiences. That was the most helpful for me. Hearing what it was like from your end was a tipping point in shifting my point of view. As an outgoing person my initial response to my daughter was ""well, let's think of some comebacks."" That of course is not something someone that is shy would do. I didn't think about some of the other points that you guys have bought up. Especially the one person that said their  mother was similar and it was awkward having strangers know who you are and proclaim ""I love your mom"" when you are shy and not outgoing. I never thought about it that way- thank you. 

Lastly, to answer the question of what type of educator am I, I create and run supplemental programs for the school system. Think, after-school programs and the people who come in weekly to teach a particular skill-set. I used to work in the classroom with special needs children before turning my volunteer work into a business. This is why kids know me, it's not because I'm hovering over my children. It's because I'm providing support for all of the kids throughout the entire school system that spans from elementary to high school. I didn't make that clear so, I get the assumption that I'm just hovering over them.

Thanks guys. 😊",126,153,0.85

We had invited him to a family event at my husband's house and he got very drunk and disorderly and kind of slurred his words at my husband's relatives the whole night.

We were only inviting plus ones that were married and frankly we didn't want him at our wedding because we were afraid he would cause problems especially since our wedding was open bar. We both attended their wedding and shocker the husband was all kinds of problems. (Showed up late got super drunk and hardly spent any time with his wife) 

They ended up adding a plus one on their invitation. We didn't say anything about it and allowed him to come. Even though we were already 10 guests over our proposed limit we made room.

We’re now 29 with three children who are 2,3,6 

My SIL is Ruby, she’s 30 and has two children, Harry (5) and Kelly (8)

I will admit when I was 17 I had  ONE date with Ruby, I picked her up and dropped her off, when I dropped her off I met her sister (my wife) and I knew I couldn’t date Ruby since I was attracted to Elena (I didn’t expect Elena to *date* me I just didn’t wanna be the guy dating a girl while being attracted to her sister) 

Well it turns out the attraction was mutual and we started meeting as friends, Ruby had no problem with this and she had no problem when we started dating.

Anyway our children are super close and Ruby is always around our home.

So when my eldest asked to go park with Kelly it wasn’t a problem, I texted my wife “going park with the kids because they wanna hang with Ruby’s kid’s, you wanna meet? Maybe grab dinner with everyone?” I got a response of “okay, not a problem, no thank you” 

We spent an hour at the park (I only tagged along because I wasn’t about to leave Ruby to struggle with all the children) and then the children asked for fish and chips for dinner so I texted my wife 

“Headed to get dinner with the kiddos, won’t eat with but will bring back our dinner, love you” no response, once the children ate I grabbed dinner and left.

Once I get home I tell you it’s like I had dinner with Satan my wife was calling me TA saying I still had a thing for her sister (I am not attracted to Ruby) and it wasn’t right to hang with Ruby without her

The gentleman got snippy with me and explained that I am responsible to teach him manners and that he should always move when an older person gets on the train. I don’t really have a problem with this premise. I HAVE in the past made him move for older people on the bus when there were literally no other seats available and he was the only young one.

1900,Not the A-hole,"I [26F] recently moved in with my boyfriend [25M]. I have a tiny 6 month old kitten and he has a 6 year old, 80 lb pitbull. The transition has been really tough as we've been going through the process combining our senses of decor and socializing the pets. I like his dog a lot, but at the end of the day, I'm really just not a big dog person. I had a lot of traumatic experiences with big dogs biting me as a kid, and I'm also very small (I weigh under 100 pounds, so the dog is about as big as me.) 

Boyfriend has always slept with his dog with him in the bed. It's really important to him, and he loves his dog, and because I love him, I didn't want to make him choose. I agreed that he could continue to have his dog sleep in the bed as long as he slept on my boyfriend's side of the bed, I didn't have to touch him, and my sleep wasn't impacted. It
It's not my preference, but I can live with that. My kitty also sleeps in the bed with us, but she's tiny so she takes up no space at all. Because I wanted there to be plenty of space for all of us, I purchased a queen size bed to upgrade from our full. My boyfriend thought more space was ""unnecessary,"" so I paid for it completely on my own. That was fine, I have the money and I'm happy to do that if it makes things go more smoothly while we transition to living together. 

The thing is, neither of us have slept at all since we moved in together. His pup has all the space in the world that he needs, and we have none. Last night, we got in a big fight because he wants his dog to be able to sleep ANYWHERE in the bed that he wants to... like next to me, between us, or on my side.  I'm already not a dog person, and this feels like a big inappropriate ask. He says I'm being really rigid by not even considering it, but I've already compromised here, and I think it's ridiculous to cater to the dog when the people in the relationship are fighting about it and losing sleep!  I start a new job soon that is a big step in my career, and I can't let my work performance suffer from lack of sleep. I'm so exhausted, and I can't start a new job like this. 

In addition, the dog is bed aggressive with my kitten and will snap at her if/when she jumps up, which is obviously scary, because I love my cat and I don't want her to get eaten. Pup has also gotten dirt in the sheets blood on the new duvet cover I got for us from chewing his bone until his mouth was bleeding. :/ 

I don't know if I""m being unreasonable. I feel that I've already compromised by buying a bigger bed for us and not picking a fight about his pup in the bed, and now it's my boyfriend's turn to compromise by having his dog stay on his side of the bed and being open to kicking his dog out of the bed if he's acting threatening to the cat or I need to just go to sleep and we need space.

1902,No A-holes here,"Okay reddit, please decide this for me:
Growing up I was never allowed to go trick or treating. My family went so far as to shut themselves in the basement with all the lights off just to avoid receiving any evil trick or treaters. This has led to my total lack of knowledge for trick or treating etiquette. For example, when I was 16 I was so excited that I was away from my family on Halloween and was gonna give t&t a try, but my friends told me I was too old. 

Well now I have a 7 month old and I just really want to go trick or treating with him. To be honest, I love showing him off. He's extremely social and going door-to-door meeting people will make his day. And, being completely candid, free candy would be awesome.

I had everything planned, costume ready, and then I had a dream that I went trick or treating and people were pissed off saying he was too young and I was just using him for candy. Now I don't know whether I should go or not.

WIBTA?

Update:
I just want to explain a few things:
Handing out candy at my house really isn't an option since we don't live in a well lit area and last year no kids came through the neighborhood. 

Our community no longer holds events because of poor attendance.

My plan was to just go around my small neighbourhood. I am surrounded mostly by elderly people and a few young single people. No one else has kids. I know for certain that some people would love it. We often sit out on our front deck and we'll get people walking past asking to see the baby or people driving past will stop and wave at him. I just have no way of telling what houses those people live in and am a bit scared to get the house of someone who doesn't care.

But I think I've decided I'm just gonna go for it. I'll go visit a nursing home in the early afternoon and take him around the neighbourhood later in the day if he's up for it.

Second update (if anyone cares):

Went to a couple nursing homes and it was really lovely. I'll definitely be going again next year.

I also hit up the houses in my neighbourhood. There were only 6 houses with their lights on. It took me 45 mins. They were so excited to see the baby and they all invited me in for a chat. They all also demanded to give him candy, despite me telling them that he couldn't eat it.

My childhood friend, let’s call her Becca, got engaged to her fiancé last summer and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was pretty surprised, since we’ve drifted apart quite a bit since we were kids, but I was happy for her and I accepted. I wouldn’t consider us best friends or anything, but we talk pretty frequently and see each other at least once or twice a month.

Becca’s wedding is this Saturday, and she texted me last week and asked what my plans were for the weekend before the wedding. I thought maybe she needed help with some last-minute wedding stuff, so I said I could stop by her apartment and help her.  

I could tell something was bothering her and she eventually started tearing up and said she was really disappointed that nobody had planned a bachelorette party for her. She said she thought we were really close and didn’t understand why it hadn’t occurred to me to ask if she wanted one.  

Maybe I’m just dumb but this is my first time being part of a wedding party and I honestly didn’t know I was supposed to plan a bachelorette, I thought the bride normally did it. I’ve only been to one bachelorette before, for my cousin, and she planned the whole thing herself. Also, none of the girls in the wedding party really know each other that well (the bridesmaids are her college bestie, her fiancé’s sister and a friend she met through work), so I’m not sure how it would even have happened tbh. 

At this point, it’s way too late to plan anything before the wedding. This is a really busy week at work, and I can’t ask for time off with this little notice. Friday night is the rehearsal dinner and obviously Saturday is the wedding day. I told Becca maybe we could go get drinks after she got back from her honeymoon to celebrate instead and she was like “I guess” and said it wouldn’t be the same. 

I do feel bad, but I also think she should have communicated her expectations to me. So give it to me straight, AITA?",116,207,0.88

1908,Not the A-hole,"My older sister went out of town for the weekend and she asked me to look after her 13 year old son for the weekend. I said sure, and she dropped him off at mine on last Friday. I live with just my girlfriend, so we have never had to worry about ""childproofing"" or hiding things that we wouldn't want kids to access.

We set up a bed in our basement for him. There is a fridge in the basement full of beer. In the middle of the night I hear some stuff getting knocked around the kitchen so I go to check it out, and my nephew is very clearly drunk. I go to the basement and see that he drank six beers. I gave him food and water, and stayed with him until he fell asleep, and gave him a stern talking to in the morning.

Sunday comes and I tell my sister what happened. She is furious at me and is yelling that it was irresponsible to have him in the basement with access to the beer. I said that he is 13 years old and it didn't even cross my mind that he would do that, he should know better. 

I thought it would blow over as time passed, thinking she would realize that it's not my fault. However, she is still just as mad. I tried calling her last night and she ripped into me again, so I told her that she's the mother and she raised him to act that way. She cursed me out and hung up.

1909,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend and I go to a Christian University where we must attend chapel three times a week, they are often held in large auditoriums as many students attend. Today I met him for chapel and he was wearing a very cheap looking blue anime-styled wig. His normal hair is brown and short, so this wig was a huge change. It looked like the character Marth from Fire Emblem's hair. I automatically said ""No, no, don't come near me. What are you doing? I don't know you dude, No"". I was laughing while doing this and extending my arm to keep him an arm's length away. He said he was doing a pre-Halloween costume for the day before Halloween, but he didn't have a costume on other than the wig itself. It looked very 'weebish' in my opinion and I  told him to just take it off, being serious for the first time. I said to him ""just take it off, it doesn't look like you are doing a costume it just looks cringy."" He automatically became upset at me and started speaking loudly, making people around us uncomfortable. We were sitting in bleachers with people all around us and he started saying ""are you serious? I'm just having fun. I thought you would actually be a loving and supportive girlfriend and let me have fun."" I stopped talking for the most part when he was getting louder and then when he had stopped I whispered, ""I'm sorry, I guess I'm just not that girl to lie to you, it just looks kinda cringy and embarrassing so I told you, we're in college after all. It's just weird."" He got up to storm out but when I didn't follow he came back and slammed down his skateboard making a large crashing noise so everyone turned to look, all while he was still wearing the anime wig. When he sat back down he said very loudly, ""why are you acting like such a bitch to me? Why are you being a bitch?"" I didn't say anything more and just tried to look forward and listen to the fucking kumbaya that was playing by the chapel band. I later apologized but I feel like I wasn't in the wrong for telling him to just take it off.",66,83,0.86

I looked and said ""oh no one is actually bringing in anything festive or halloween related. Someone is making meatballs and someone is bringing in pasta salad"" so  I signed up to bring candy corn. I thought it was funny but it fits the theme since people will be dressing up and whatnot. No big deal. 
I work right next to the sing up sheet and i can hear people complain about, 1 manager even made remark "" oh, candy corn what a contribution that is"" people know i cook and told me i should cook. I have deer meat and they told me to bring that instead and i said no. I'm not cooking all my deer meat and giving it away. I said i just won't bring anything in and not partake in the lunch.

My dad and step mom are working Halloween night, so they can’t take her kids trick or treating. Her son is going to go trick or treating with his friend and stay over night at his house.

So far my step mom hasn’t been able to set up a similar arrangement with any of my stepsisters friends. None of them want to take care of another kid on a school night and they don’t want to have to drive to pick her up and drop her of at her grandmas (who lives an hour away) where she will have to stay the night.

Her grandma is good to watch her, but because of a few health issues she cannot go walking around so much in the cold. She has offered to buy my stepsister some candy and watch Halloween movies with her instead.

My stepsister though still really wants to go trick or treating and my stepmother has asked me if I can stay home to take her. I said I would think about it.

My plans had been to go with my friends to universal studios. My friends mom had gotten a few tickets for their family, but some of them had to cancel, so she offered one to me for free.

I’ve never been, so I’m super excited about that. At the same time though I know my stepsister is going to be pretty upset about me saying no.",75,26,0.84

1914,Not the A-hole,"I’m coming home from work late around 11:30pm. It’s a Thursday night and the beginning of my weekend. I commute about fifty miles each way, and there’s heavy construction on the highway I travel. This particular stretch of road was down to one lane, with eleven miles of concrete barrier to the left... and fields, forests, and hilly areas to the right. No shoulder. 

Anyway the black SUV in front of me keeps swerving to the right, it seems like he’s trying to be bold and pass the car in front of him. After about seven or eight dips to the right, the driver goes too far, bounces off the road and veers directly into the barricade. The vehicles then careens to the right down a steep hill into a forest. At this point he’s too far down to see from the road. 

I pull over and call 911. I’m about done giving them all the information when a man appears in my window. The car behind me saw it happened and also pulled over, so I assumed it was another Good Samaritan.  

It was the driver. He tells me he’s okay and asks me for a ride. He asks where I’m going and I tell him, he’s going to the same town he says. I don’t mess around with telling him I won’t drive him away from the scene, I’m very clear up front that there’s just no way. He starts going off about how I’m shitty and that this was unbelievable. 

I wouldn’t normally call the cops on a black guy but when I called I had no way of knowing who was behind the wheel and legitimately believed them to be in danger. 

Regardless, I don’t know why you’re in the ditch but I know it’s nothing good... AITA for not giving him a ride?",39,39,0.81
1915,Not the A-hole,"Was sitting in my car in a parking lot, when some a stranger pulls up into the spot next to me and throws open his truck door. The door hits my car hard enough to shake my car. I got out to confront him about it but he just just walks off without giving me a second thought and ignores my attempts to get his attention. I checked my car and thankfully there wasn’t any damage that I could see but I proceeded to peel a plain white sticker about the size of a post it note off something I had in my car and write on it telling him to “watch (his) damn door next time” and placed it firmly on his door window. People I’ve told say putting a sticker on his window is considered vandalism but to me a sticker is nothing compared to if he had put a dent in my door or someone else’s. My car isn’t special but I would hate for him to be that careless next to a Mercedes or similar.

1916,Not the A-hole,"Yes, this debate is as ridiculous as the title sounds, but hear me out since this argument has been coming up for years. 

Background: My husband and I have never been on the same page about food. We both travel a lot for work and have insane schedules and neither of us enjoy cooking. We eat out a lot and do a lot of convenience foods. We both go to the grocery store, but shop very differently. I go multiple times a week to grab things we need for the next couple days and he will go less frequently for bigger trips. We have two kids (17 and 8) + an extra teenager living with us currently. 

Onto the snack fiasco: My husband has specific snacks he will buy for himself but he usually won’t want to eat them for weeks. By that point, it’s not uncommon that someone in the house will have already gotten into them. I’ve suggested he keep “special” snacks he wants separate from the household snacks in the pantry. It’s hard to police a hoard of ravenous teenagers diving into your pantry after school. There have been multiple occasions where my husband will decide he wants X snack and realize someone has eaten it and will get angry. When this has occurred, I always offer to go to the store and get the snack he wanted so A) he has the snack he wants and B) I don’t have to listen to him complain anymore because *I* get annoyed at him and think being worked up about someone eating a $3 snack just isn’t worth it. He gets irritated at this and says it’s the larger principle of him getting snacks he wants and someone else eating them. I get the “principle” - but I just haven’t been able to control it with the kids and I also don’t always remember which things he got special for himself. This all came to a head again when our teenagers ate a bag of chips he wanted. When he realized this had happened and started getting agitated, I tried to go to the store immediately to buy them as a solution. He got more annoyed and said he didn’t want me to go to the store, he wanted the kids to not eat his snacks. I didn’t go to the store that night but the next day, I bought him some bags of the chips and told him to just keep them in the car so he would have them whenever he wanted them. This actually escalated the fight as he said I was being a d*ck and was giving him the middle finger when all he wanted was for people not to eat the snacks he liked in the first place and that he shouldn’t have to store them in the car to have them not eaten. 

So... AITA for continuing to buy him the snacks he wants as a solution to when he complains about the kids eating them?

TLDR: My husband wants to have special snacks just for him that the kids don’t eat, but doesn’t want to keep them separate from everything else. When I offer to buy replacements, he gets annoyed and feels like it’s the principle of having his wishes respected in the first place.

INFO 1: The snacks aren’t a special snack that it’s clearly for him, it’s snacks everyone generally already eat (in this example tortilla chips) but that he will have gotten a specific brand he likes versus the ones I get (hence him feeling like “his” snack has been eaten).

INFO 2: RE: the kids... the snacks they’re eating are things we both regularly buy as snacks *for them* and store in the pantry. This overlap between what he thinks he’s buying for himself and what the kids think they can eat is where most of the rub is coming from. We have rules around food for our younger (eg: regulating sugary foods, etc.) so it’s not like a total free-for-all, though full disclosure, I don’t regulate what my teens eat and view, personally, what I put into the pantry to be fair game for them.",81,38,0.91

1919,Not the A-hole,"This was going to be my first birthday with a partner (I'm 21 and have had relationships before now but this is the first time a relationship has overlapped with a birthday) and we talked, I explained why I didn't like birthdays and don't celebrate them, and we mutually agreed to go through the day as normal and not do anything special. He wanted to go all out for my birthday, the way we did for his, with a large party, clubs, cake, presents, the works, and I said that I didn't want any of that, but I did agree to a piece of cake with a candle in it after dinner.

Birthday was yesterday. He wakes me up with pancakes, which is weird because he never cooks. I ask if this is to do with my birthday and he says no, he just felt like making pancakes, which I didn't buy for a second but I let it slide.

The morning goes by without incident, and then at lunch he comes and meets me. I ask why, because this is also unusual for him. He says he just wanted to see me and we eat lunch. He asks if I want to come by his place tonight, and I agree. After he leaves I find a birthday card in my bag from him, which I chuck in the bottom drawer of my desk.

I go to his place, the lights were out, I figured he wasn't home and flicked the light on. It's a surprise party, with about 15 of our mutual friends. I just tried to get through it. I was there, people were there, and the only person who knows why I don't like birthdays is my boyfriend, so none of them knew. I smiled, greeted everyone, was generally a good hostess, although it didn't help that there was a lot of alcohol, as I'm a recovering alcoholic (3 months sober).

When everyone left I said that I was going back to my place. My boyfriend asked why. I said I wanted to be alone. He asked if there was a problem. I said that I ""didn't appreciate being ambushed"" and that ""you did the one thing I specifically asked you not to do"". There was more but that was the main bit and he's now upset at me because he went to a lot of effort to throw this party and he felt I was being ungrateful, which I admittedly was, but I feel there was good reason to be ungrateful.

He wants me to apologise, I want him to. Neither of us is backing down and now I'm second guessing myself.

1920,Not the A-hole,"I \[32m\] live in an apartment complex that is a little run down. Each unit has a storage closet the size of two bathroom stalls put together that is separated from the apartment unit. So the door of each storage closet is in the hallway of the apartment. 

Yesterday I was coming home and I heard rustling from one of the storage closets next to my unit. There has been recent break-ins in the storage closets so I got a little suspicious. I stood outside the storage closet and waited and heard a loud shush noise. Then after about 15 seconds there was another loud ""SHHHH"" from the storage closet. It was unmistakable human noise, not the wind or anything like that. I was concerned that it might be getting robbed so I knocked on my neighbors door to see if she had anyone in there cleaning or looking for stuff as I heard rustling and shushing from her storage closet. She was a little short with me and snapped that there was no one in there and closed the door. I gotta admit the whole situation had my imagination running. Like if there was someone being held against their will in there. So I called the non-emergency police number and told them what I heard. They sent out two officers and asked my neighbor to open the closet. When she opened it, there was no one in there, but there was about 30 minutes in between me knocking on her door and the police showing up so they could've left in that period.

1922,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I want to be anonymous. 

So me(22/M) and my girlfriend(24/F) have been dating for 3 years now. I recently inherited a pretty big fortune, and I felt like it was the right time to move out from the apartment we were renting, to rather buy and move into a house. We have a child together and we are in it for the long run. I really feel like I can trust her, in our 2 first years together she didn't even know I was going to inherit anything, and yet we stuck together through thick and thin. The problem now is that she doesn't want to move to a house with me unless she is co-owner with me, regardless if I paid for the whole house. I feel pretty clueless to what I should do, her reasoning isn't just ""unreasonable"" & I understand a lot of it, I just understand myself as well. She says she doesn't want to live on someone's mercy, and that if we split 10 years from now she would start at 0 again, because she never worked towards buying a house herself as she didn't need to. 

I think what she is asking for is a tad weird, I'd never even consider leaving her for such a reason, but I defiantly need to know If I'm being an ass or if my actions and thoughts are understandable and justified. Price range is about $1-2M +/- so it is a lot of money. I feel it is a little weird to just give someone that much money. 

In the end I gave her some options with things I am more comfortable with:

**We could** rent until we one day got married, and then buy together as it would feel more normal for me. 

**We could** buy a cheaper house together and she would pay for half of the house herself.

**We could** postpone this conversation, and continue to live where we live now, to talk about it in the future.

She hasn't been as happy since I gave her those options, it's almost as if she feels she is entitled to getting half a house for free. I'm not exactly greedy, I bought her a car for her birthday 2 months ago. I just feel it should be on my initiative. Half of that house wouldn't hurt my financials even a bit, but as I just inherited what I now have and have been working for my money since I was 17 I still feel like it is a very big amount of money to just give to someone.

1923,Asshole,"I live in the state of California, where of course weed is legal. I use to smoke in my late teen years and stopped when I joined the military and for awhile when I got out. I was never a big time user...no waking and baking, going places high or work. It was more of an end of day kind of thing, even as a kid I would smoke and play video games.

I started using marijuana again about a year and a half ago, knowing that my girlfriend hates it. Not only does she hate it, but she refuses to have any conversation as all about it. Its benefits, is it really that harmful, recreational use or anything.  Before I started using I would bring it up casually in conversations and it always led to a very stern ""Fuck Marijuana"". Literally all conversations ended quickly when weed was brought up.

My weed usage is minimal at best. For those who are familiar with weed, I eat a 5mg gummie maybe once during the week, and then one on Saturday and Sunday nights. Even on the weekend usage it isnt till we have done what ever it is we have done that day be it chores, a date, errands whatever..I never do anything like that while high. I usually quickly eat one before we start watching netflix or if she is studying for school and I am playing a video game with some friends.

Plain and simple I maybe ingest 15mg of weed at best during the course of a week, sometimes never if work is a heavy load that week.

I know my girlfriend is strongly against it, to the point where she hates it. I told a group of close friends I use marijuana occasional and I keep it a secret, they all made it out to sound like I am an asshole...but its clear my gfs opinion wont change..

1924,No A-holes here,"Edit: So I managed to convince him to be a vampire by the logic that vampires can turn *into* bats. We changed out the wings for a cape, did white face paint and a little ""blood"" around his mouth. He was very pleased with this.

So, last night I posted something in r/kidsarefuckingstupid To my surprise it blew up and there are thousands of comments ranging from ""that's a four year old for you"", to ""You're a POS and a horrible parent"".  I'd like to get your judgement.

My 4 year old son wants to be a bat for Halloween. His costume, which he chose, consists of black sweatpants, a black shirt, a black hoodie and he wants to spray dye his hair black. The only bat aspect of the costume is a pair of wings that he refuses to wear for more than 10 minutes at a time. 

He also wants to paint his face black. To clarify, he doesn't want to paint his face like a bat. He doesn't want a black nose, or whiskers or a grey face, or a mask, or anything else. In his mind,  bats are black and his face should also be black. 

He is a blonde haired, blue eyed *white* child. I said he can't paint his whole face black and offered other suggestions, all of which he has turned down.

Now *I know* and *you know* that he's a four year old and has no concept of racism. Obviously, it's just a bat. It's not black face if hes a bat, right?

Here's the thing. If he takes the wings off, which he absolutely will. Hes basically wearing black clothes with blackface. It looks *really* bad.

I dont care because I know his intentions are completely innocent. But I'm not about to send him to school like that. At a glance, the costume could come across as offensive. I'm not worried about the other kids, I'm worried about the parents and teachers perception of it. I dont want him getting in trouble for something he couldn't even begin to understand at this point. I can't control how other people perceive things, even though I may find their perception to be ridiculous.

Of course, as his father I intend to educate him about what racism is at some point. But at 4 years old, over a Halloween costume, doesn't seem like the right moment.

So I simply told him he can't paint his face all black. The rest of the costume is fine. Again, he WILL NOT wear a mask and doesn't want face paint unless its solid black.

Am I an asshole, or does this seem reasonable?

I'd really like to hear your judgment in a sub which promotes healthy discussion. Maybe I can learn something or get advice on how to better approach a situation like this in the future. Some of the comments on the other post are incredibly degrading and just awful.",133,161,0.88
1925,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds bad, but hear me out; 

My husband and I, along with our two kids (ages 12 and 6) don’t live in the same state as my MIL. He’s retired military so we ended up settling down in his last duty station. This has never been an issue with MIL before. We used to have a great relationship with MIL. 

Over the years this cozy relationship has changed.  

She stopped answering our phone calls and would ignore text messages. 

During this time, MIL lived closer to her daughter, my sister-in-law (SIL). MIL would go to SIL’s home to cook, clean and spend time with SIL’s two children (ages 10 and 8). MIL has been with them for holidays and paid for SIL, her husband and children to all go to Disney Land together. 

Two years ago MIL, finally came to visit us for Christmas. She met our four year old for the first time. During the Christmas visit, MIL would call or receive calls from SIL’s children. During one of the calls MIL said, “Oh, I miss you! I wish I was there with you!” Since MIL was sitting in the living room on her cell phone, my eldest daughter heard the entire thing. She felt hurt that even though MIL was visiting with us, she wanted to be with her other grandkids.

During this visit, MIL floated the idea of a trip to Disney World for us. We would split the cost of the trip equally. The kids were excited. MIL goes back to her home and my husband and I think that maybe the relationship is returning to how it used to be. Wrong! MIL went back to ignoring calls and text messages. 

Fast-forward to this month. I’ve been pricing tickets and hotels for the Disney World trip and trying to contact MIL to let her know what I’ve found. No answer. She even forgets to call my eldest daughter for her birthday. My daughter is extremely heartbroken. 

Finally, MIL answers one of my husband’s phone calls. MIL has decided to move in with SIL. She’s been living with them for the past few months. MIL asks to speak with our daughters and she apologizes to my eldest for forgetting about her birthday. She claims that she’s been so busy and she forgot. MIL brings up the Disney World trip and the other two grandchildren immediately ask to come. My daughter looks at me with a “WTF?!” look on her face. MIL laughs and puts my daughter on the spot asking if she would like her cousins to come with her. My daughter stutters and replies, “I don’t know.” MIL laughs and tells the other children, “We’ll see!” 

My daughter was looking forward to this trip with her grandmother and now she’s not so sure. My husband is frustrated with his mom for even bringing this up since she already took her other grandchildren to Disneyland. She’s been around them for the past seven years and now lives with them. My children barely hear from their grandmother and haven’t seen her in two years. It is to the point they don’t even ask about her.

To Jill, Jack is just another kid her age who happens to be six feet tall and shaving.

This past August I was injured in an accident and as a result I’ve been mostly immobilized and homebound. My husband works two jobs and is only home for a few hours in the morning, when he gets the kids up and drives them to school. I have a SAHM neighbor, Nancy, who I’m friendly with because her daughter is friends with mine. Since my accident she has gone out of her way to be helpful, picking up the kids from school, bringing over meals, and helping to take care of the house, and I’m very grateful to her for this.

The issue comes in with how she treats Jack. She’s a very traditional sort of person and seems uncomfortable with how Jack behaves. If she’s taking her daughter and Jill shopping or to the movies and he asks to come along, she always shoots him down. Jack has told me that she’s called him immature for liking things like kids’ cartoons and toys and will ask him why he can’t act like a “normal teenage boy”. She’s volunteered to take Jill trick-or-treating with her and her daughter, but she’s made it clear that Jack isn’t invited because he’s too old for Halloween and should be out with friends like a “normal” teenager.

Jack is crushed. He LOVES Halloween and he was excited about going trick-or-treating. He doesn’t really have any other friends he can go out with and he’s told me he doesn’t want to stay home to pass out candy. I want him to go have fun with his sister, but I know if I insist Nancy take him, she’ll most likely ignore him or make snide comments and take all of the fun out of his night.

My husband has told me not to confront Nancy because she’s been doing so much for us, and he also thinks Jack is too old for trick-or-treating. AITA for thinking Jack should stay home on Halloween instead of having to deal with Nancy’s attitude?

1932,Not the A-hole,"
Last Saturday I was hosting a Halloween party, starting at 6 PM and going late into the night. Before the party, I took a drive out to the store to get some last minute supplies.

I live in an apartment and I have a private driveway. My street is a busy one, with crowded parallel parking along the sides. It's also always crammed when the nearby school has some event; a few times people have parked in my private driveway even though it's obviously marked as private. 

I come back to my place and there's a big minivan parked in my driveway. I'm annoyed but i drive up and down the street looking for another place to park. There's nothing, and I end up going to my place again and parking in the driveway behind the minivan. 

It's a longish narrow driveway and I knew I'd have to move my car to let them out. 

My friends started coming over to party and the car owner still wasn't back. It'd been like half an hour. My friends want to do shots and I'm not sure if I should; I won't drive after I've been drinking and I might need to move my car. But after some convincing from my friends, I decide ""fuck it, I'm not letting some random asshole keep me from enjoying my own party""

In a couple hours I'd forgotten all about the car, I was having a hell of a fun time at my party, my friends and I were all pretty hammered and were ordering some pizzas.

Someone knocked on the door and we assumed it was the pizza guy, my friend got the door and it turned out to be a big family group. They were saying they were boxed in and asking if the car owner lived there. 

I came to the door and I was like 'yeah it's my car but I'm shitfaced man, I can't move it now. Come back tomorrow, yeah?"" 

And the dad was saying something about how they needed the car to get home, they'd just stopped off for a bit, it was am emergency, they were running the school's homecoming and needed a quick spot to park, and they'd left a note and everything.

I went ""nothing you say is gonna make me drive drunk man, come back tomorrow""

His wife asked how they were supposed to get home, and I said to call a taxi. She said their family was too big, and I said ""call two taxis"" 

She asked if she could move my car and I said no, I won't let strangers drive it. She asked if anyone else could and I said no, were all hammered. 

I ended up just slamming the door because I didn't wanna spend the night dealing with that. They were gone when the pizza guy showed up.

The next day, I slept in till 3 pm because I'd been up mad late the night before. Plus being hungover. I found a note on my door that the family had been by to get their car and I wasn't answering my door and they have their phone number to call them when the car was moved. They threatened to call the police if I didn't work with them. Sounded really mad.

I texted the number saying I was moving my car, and then I left my house for my boyfriend's house for the night. Didn't really want another run in because they seemed mad, plus I wanted to see my boyfriend anyway

1934,No A-holes here,"Now before I get into this I just want to say I'm not against gender neutral pronouns, this isn't a political post decrying some ""SJW"" Whatever that means this week, this is about me, a colleague and my forgetfulness.

I have a colleague I've been working with for about 3 years and for 2.5 of them I've known that person as a male, they introduced themselves to me as a man with a fairly masculine name.

However 6 months ago they came out as gender neutral and explained that they'd rather be called a different, more gender neutral name and not be called any masculine pronouns, I was fine with the idea of this, they were able to do this without much fuss, this is LA 2019 afterall but my mind had other plans.

I have ADHD Type PI, it used to be known as ADD and one of the effects I experience is that once I do something a certain way, I have trouble doing it any other way and that sadly has extended to calling my colleague their new name and preferred pronouns.

The first few months I wasn't the only one that forgot but as the weeks went by more and more people got used to it and now it seems I can't go by a week without accidentally calling them by their original name or old pronouns.

I've tried explaining but they don't believe me and they think that it's just an excuse for bigotry.

I believe that you can be born in the wrong body and realize you're a different gender but after so long of calling them one thing I can't get used to calling them another, sort of like writing the wrong year in January.

They haven't taken kindly to me trying to explain it and they're threatening to go to HR if I don't stop but I can't.

EDIT: I talk to them every day and use the right pronouns most of the time but one a week or so I'll slip up and call them what they were introduced as.",751,1592,0.9
1935,No A-holes here,"My (33m) friend (33m) just bought a house. Since he’s gotten married and had a kid I see him sparingly even though we live in the same area (5-6 times a year). He wants to have a “painting party” where we basically help him paint the interior of his new home.

I hate painting. I painted as a summer job and it is miserable hard work. I would never subject any of my friends to that. I would hire painters. I understand with closing on the house money is tight. I never ask for favors like this and have done a lot of nice things for him (bought him Xbox this year...always travel to his neck of the woods when we hang out). I never expect friends to do these kind of miserable tasks. The only time I usually lend a hand is when someone is moving (I never ask for assistance on that either).

He’s not destitute financially, it’s just a way to save some money but I feel like this would be the equivalent of asking your friends over to help mulch your flower beds. It’s kind of part of the misery of owning a home. I already have joked around and said I’d bring over some housewarming booze when it’s done but I’m being guilted a little now by one of my other friends. AITA for feeling like this is something you should expect to handle on your own?

Edit: Just want to clarify I don’t begrudge my friend for asking (you don’t get what you don’t ask for). Just I also feel totally validated in laughing at him and saying “Nice try...I’ll bring over some nice booze and a house warming present when it’s over”

Update: Lmao now my friend who was guilting me doesn’t want to do it either and is thanking me for reminding him of how miserable painting was (he worked with me at the summer painting job) and we’re now ripping on him for the request calling him Tom Sawyer (in a good natured way...we’ve all been tight since middle school).

1937,Not the A-hole,"I have 2 sons and a daughter. I feel I have provided a great life for them. I helped them in their studies, spent time and vacations with them, and even provided monetary assistance with school, cars, etc. The goal was always for them to be independent. That said, the economy has been nicer to me than them.

In March of last year, my oldest had a baby with his wife. I decided to start a trust fund for my grandbaby so that he will be provided for when he goes to college. My daughter just announced her own pregnancy in July, so I gave her an early baby shower gift by creating a trust for her baby.

My younger son decided he and his wife were not going to have kids. That's fine. Personally, I think that's a good choice for him. I would love more grand babies, but he and his wife are not the most responsible of people.

Well, when I told my daughter about the trust, my son's wife started acting off. I come to find out later that both she and my son are upset about how I didn't give them a trust. But the trust isn't to my children it's to my *grandchildren*. Who am I supposed to give it to, their cats?

Personally, I am of a mind that they are acting entitled to my money. I told them absolutely not. That they were adults and could provide for themselves. That my older two children were taking on a financial burden and my goal is to ease that burden *off of my grandkids*. They claimed I was punishing them for being ""responsible"" and trying to force them to have kids.

Well, my son went complaining to his aunt (my sister in law) and now she's trying to convince him (edit: my husband not my son) to start a fund for my youngest. Like a ""housing fund"". I told my husband absolutely not and he thinks I'm being unreasonable.

1938,Not the A-hole,"Me (21F), my boyfriend, ""Joe"" (25M) and five of my friends (all 21) all decided to plan a trip to California for a week. We rented a house, it was close to the beach and super easy to get to the city, it was awesome. We all could basically go do our own thing with a few group activities through the week planned. My bf and I were super excited to go.

Our first night in, we decide to hit the liquor store and stay in. My bf immediately got uncomfortable. He doesn't like to drink anymore, and a few months back we had a fight because I got so drunk I lost consciousness and was verbally abusive. With all of this in mind, I told my bf we didn't have to drink. So the seven of us were hanging out on the patio, smoking (he and I did partake) while the rest drank.

A bit into it, one of my friends decides to play a drinking game of truth or dare. Bf got super uncomfortable. I kindly explained to the group we would play, but we wouldn't be doing the drinking portion of the game (though I really wanted to, but I wanted to respect my bf and make him comfortable and not lose control). It went well for about ten minutes. Then, one of the guys gets dared by one of my friends to strip to his underwear and ring next door neighbor. We all laughed, except for Joe, who got very angry with me. When they guy left the house, Joe sat up abruptly and whisper yelled, ""we're going!"" to me. I told the group we were tired, and they were good to continue to play and don't worry about being loud, and to have a good night.

We got to our bedroom, he basically berated me for half an hour, saying I have poor taste in friends and my judgement of character is terrible. I just let him say what he wanted, and he only stopped being aggressive when a comment he made simply made me turn on my side. I didn't say a word as he went on. When I finally spoke, I pointed out that:

1. Everybody was cool with our decision not to drink. Nobody pushed it or gave us a hard time
2. I also made it clear that neither me nor Joe would be doing nude or sexual dares to respect the relationship
3. Any dares I gave were not inappropriate-do a full split for ten seconds, burp alphabet, etc

After vacation, he made it a point a few times to say I should no longer be friends with this group. I don't want to do that. I cherish the fact we're all still friends and care so much about each other. All during vacation they asked why Joe was randomly so upset and angry and quiet, and I kept saying it was no big deal so I wouldn't drag everyone else down. They've even offered to hang out with no drinking/just smoking, but Joe still insists to me that they are bad people and I should not be their friends. 

EDIT: My drinking happened once where I got out of control. The night I yelled at him, I was told that I told him ""I'm sick of being treated this way, did you act like this with your exes, did they break up because you were so mean to them, I hate my life I'm so lonely"".

1940,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a dancer, but since that doesn’t pay the bills I have a demanding full time job as well. I am guaranteed one night a week off so I can go to the dance studio for lessons and technique classes.

I have two instructors- Adam and Vera -and we have lessons at the same time every week. My lesson with Adam is before group classes, my lesson with Vera is after. This is because Vera is also in charge of the reception desk on these nights, and it’s much more busy before classes (meaning we are frequently interrupted).

I’m friends with another of Adam’s students- Louise -who also takes technique classes. As much as I like Louise, she can be very self centered and has a hard time seeing past her own nose.

Once in the past, Vera rearranged my lesson times because Louise was running late for her own lessons and “needed my time slot”. That time I was upset and told Vera that I found it disrespectful to not consult me first before changing my schedule. She apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again. 

This past week, there was a visiting coach in our studio. For whatever reason, Louise decided she NEEDED to have lessons with this coach. I overheard her and Adam talking about it, and he suggested several available times. She refused each one and insisted that she could only take the coaching lesson during *my* lesson time with Adam. He tried telling her that he wasn’t available, but she guilted him until he came over to ask me to switch.

They were literally close enough that she could have walked over and asked me herself, but she sent him instead. He suggested that I flip my lesson times with him and Vera so that Louise could have the coaching lesson. I sort of resisted at first, but gave in under pressure. Louise never said thank you or acknowledged it.

Last night, Vera and I were repeatedly interrupted during our lesson. Adam and Louise even had the gall to interrupt us so Vera could take a video of them during their coaching session. Vera and I went slightly over our usual time due to the interruptions, and towards the end Louise came over and was trying to talk to us while we were dancing. We both ignored her completely, and she left in a bad mood.

In the end, switching for me was very inconvenient, and I don’t think Louise was at all grateful. She acts entitled to whatever time is convenient for her, and I don’t think she would switch times with me if I ever asked her. If she asks again, I’ll definitely say no, even though it will cause drama. 

My friends say I’m being reasonable, and that Louise and Adam were being disrespectful of my time. I think I might be overreacting. WIBTA for refusing to switch with her again?",19,104,0.94
1941,Not the A-hole,"So my mom tends to be very opinionated, and unsurprisingly she has a lot of things to say about my wedding next fall. She's very traditional and likes things to be done a certain way. I've already compromised on a lot to make her happy. She didn't like the style of the wedding dress I originally wanted, so I went with my second choice. She thought our color scheme clashed too much, so I changed one of the colors to something more neutral.  

Our caterer offers two choices of meals in their standard wedding package, and we decided to do one meat option and one vegetarian option because some of our friends are vegetarian. If we splurge for a third meal choice it's going to cost us nearly $1,500 more. We're paying for the wedding ourselves and really trying to stay under budget, so we have to stick to two meals.

We sampled a bunch of different entrees during our tasting, and the two dishes we liked the most were the lamb chops and the mushroom risotto. Seriously, it was some of the best food we've ever eaten. It completely blew us away.

When I told my mom we had selected our menu, she immediately said ""your aunt X and uncle Y don't like lamb"" and tried to get us to swap it out with a more traditional choice like chicken or beef. Apparently my sister's upset too, because she just texted me to tell me she though it was cruel to serve baby animals (she eats meat, for the record, so I don't understand why this is suddenly an issue). I pointed out that we were also having risotto and she texted back ""but I hate mushrooms."" Like, can't she just pick them off? I don't get it! 

Honestly, I've changed so many things about this wedding to try to appease other people, and the food is basically the one thing left that I have any control over. It's also one of the few aspects of the wedding my fiancé cares strongly about, and he really wants to have the lamb chops.

1942,Not the A-hole,"So I'm in the Army and I met this couple in the gym during deployment. We are into powerlifting and working out, so we all bonded quickly. We hung out together everyday after work, worked out nearly everyday, and did lifting competitions together. So you get the idea. We were always with each other for about 6 months. 

We are both in different units. The couple is from one unit and I'm another. So we dont see each other anymore but they visited me for a weekend at my base and it was fun! 

Now we still text a lot. We dont have a groupchat but I text both of them separate. Me and the guy were talking about how things are going with them when he tells me he needs to confess. I'm getting weirded out, but I ask him what's up. He then tells me that he cheated on his gf and doesn't know why hes with her because her family and friends are ghetto (she's black and hes white and they're both from texas FYI) So I'm thinking in my head, WTF why are you telling me this?! I then question why he did it and how it's wrong, etc. He says why can't I hook up with girls when she also wants to. Yeah shes bisexual, but she never hooked up with anyone. Idk why he's using that as an excuse..

I ask him if he's going to tell her, he says eventually. I just don't know what to do. She's also my good friend and I don't want him doing that behind her back... I decided to give him a few days to tell her. 

Cue to last week, about a week after he told me about his cheating. I messaged her the usual, ""hey, what's up? How are you and bf"" and she responds with how they're good and all that. So I figured he didn't tell her and after some prancing around asking if he told her anything I decided to tell her. Of course she didn't know and was freaking out and messaging him like crazy. She then send me a screenshot of their messages where shes telling him what I told her and he says that I'm full of shit and lying. Then he proceeds to tell her it was all a joke and he wanted to see how I'd react. She asks for screenshots but of course I dont have any of the convo because it was on snapchat, so it's gone. She thanks me and says she needs time to think. 

Now a few days after that ordeal I messaged her asking if she's ok. She is still taking things in slowly and is still with him currently. I dont know what they've talked about, but he had probably talked some shit about me considering he said I'm full of shit. He's been ignoring me on snapchat so I text his number and he said hes ignoring me because I'm fake and whether he cheated or not is none of my business. 

At this point now I'm so hurt. He was a really good friend of mine. He coached me in powerlifting, seen me cry and been there for me during my hard times when deployed. He told me something that I honestly wish he didnt even confess to me because it left me in such an awkward spot. They're both good friends and I was planning on visiting them in Texas in the future.

He's called and I haven't answered yet, but I've read is texts and he thinks he's in the right. Because his statements 'are proven by his experiences and I'm just being sensitive'. It's true that I don't know what girls he's been hanging out with.

1947,Everyone Sucks,"On the subway this morning, in a semi filled car(no seats but all standing room available) a class of kids I want to say 12-14yo got on with their teacher(or chaperone). There was probably twenty of them. They filled the section of out train car pretty much to the brim, and they were contained in our section. 

As someone with a torn meniscus, and bulging discs in my back and neck, sitting is pretty important for my commute. While sitting, some of the kids kept stepping on mine and my girlfriend's shoes, who was sitting next to me. I could tell this annoyed her, and it definitely annoyed me. While corralled in this section, they were constantly moving around. Not being overly crazy, but just not standing still. They refused to hold any grab bar, so when the train moved, so did they. Sometimes falling into us and other people.Out of three kids, one apologized to us for stepping on our feet.

One boy in particular was stepping on my feet since the second he got on the train. Now, I've had my feet stepped on plenty of times in the past, and I understand what it's like to be on a very crowded subway, but this was ridiculous.

At one point, the boy was literally standing on my foot. Like, not just a quick step, but fully standing on my foot.

Me visibly annoyed- ""It's ok bud you can walk on my feet as much as you want""

Chaperone-""He has a walking disability""

Me- ""Well does he want my seat?""

Chaperone- ""No""

She then moves him to the opposite side of her without saying anything to him. No one says another word.  There's no tension and everyone goes on as they were. 

I watch the kids feet, who is now standing in front of the person sitting across from me. He didn't move his feet once, stood still, and there were no issues for them. He didn't step on their feet once. To be honest, while speculation isn't right, the kid showed no signs of any disability for walking or standing.

This whole thing took course within 5-6 stops.

Once I got off the train, my girlfriend said I was being an asshole because I ""yelled"" at someone's child. I didn't raise my voice, but I was clearly being sarcastic and annoyed when I said something to him.

1949,Not the A-hole,"So I have a couple of kids. Some are boys. They are your typical 8, 10 & 12 year old rambunctious lads. They are all quite popular and all have an array of mates just like them - boisterous & hard to contain their bursting energy. Though they are all great kids who always try to do the right thing and are all very respectful. 

One day my 10 year old was at his mates place playing. A couple of other friends were there too. They spent most of the day in the pool, though about an hour before I picked him up they all went into the mates room to play PS4. 
The mate (of house) parents are a little generous to so said mate and he always gets what he wants whenever he wants it (their parenting, not judging). Much to the horror of my sons whom whine they only get good things at Xmas (my parenting, not apologising). 

Anyway, this boy had just been given a new iPhone 60 (don’t know what the latest iPhone is).  So the friends including my son were playing with it whilst mate (of house) played ps4. 

Of course they were all idiots (they are 10) and started jumping on bed (boy of house has a king size bed). Boy of house played this too though kept going back and forth to PS4.  This is the game they were playing - jump Hard like on a tramp to make the boy at the other end bounce high.  

So it’s my sons turn to bounce the end boy. BUT This end boy has the phone in his hand. Anyway my son bounces boy to jump high and as usual the boy does though he losses his balance and lands on side table on his hands to rebalance himself. Boy safe. Phone not. 

Screen is smashed of course. 

Next thing I’m there to pick up son. The  mother relays me the story. She is honest in her retelling (I checked later with my son). I’m horrified my son was jumping on someone else’s furniture and apologised.  My son had apologised also. The other mates had all apologised as well. 

I Said so sorry mate of house phone broke. She said thanx for apologising. I’ll get it fixed tomorrow and bring you the bill ok? I said what um ok. 

Anyway she did just that and I paid for it. Though I am furious. It could have been anyone of them that did it including the boy of the house. And why didn’t the boy who held the phone get a bill? Not that I think he should have but wouldn’t that have been more logical. 

For the record, if it was at my house and my phone I would not have blamed anyone but myself for trusting a bunch of crazy 10yr old boys with the latest iPhone. 

So is she TA or am I?

Edit: quick edit. Nobody is rich and no kid in this story is a “spoilt brat.”  We are all blue collar. The parents are going thru divorce so are plying their kids with anything to keep them distracted. I get that and do not judge. My “sprogs ” are not angels at all.  

I’m not a push over. Though I’ve been taught to be quiet if it maybe a social faux pas.  Money to me is a never ending social faux pas.  This is why I paid. Though I don’t believe i should have.  I’m more angry she brought money into this at all.",32,35,0.86

1954,Not the A-hole,"Alright, so I (21M) am a full time college student. I have to go every day of the week and I have to wake up really early every day so I’m pretty easily irritable if someone is bugging me. I usually just keep my headphones in.

Outside of the entrance of our school there are a few religious women who basically just advertise and are attempting give you pamphlets. They could be Jehovah’s witnesses, I’m not sure. Anyway I’m not religious and don’t want to be bothered with it, so when they said “excuse me sir” a few days ago I just said “no thank you” politely and walked away. This happened again the next morning, same thing from me. Whatever.

So I got up this morning and have my music up even louder so I cannot hear anything, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn out and it’s the same religious lady. I have to admit I was pretty pissed. I immediately shouted “what?!” at her. She just goes “Sorry, but excuse me sir, we’ve been trying to get your attention.” I shout again “And I’ve clearly told you I don’t want it! So fuck off with your religious nonsense”. The people around me gave me some dirty looks and I just continued walking to class, albeit awkwardly.

I can’t help think I might’ve handled this pretty badly; maybe I’ve should’ve been more polite, but I felt like I already had been up to this point. AITA?",1644,5032,0.92

1956,Not the A-hole,"Over a year ago the microwave at my office died. The company refused to replace it. They said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. This would take a long time. 

I wasn't having that. At the time I went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. Initially I kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. So I moved it to the office kitchen. 

Everyone who saw it at my desk is gone. It's just been ""the microwave"". Anyway, my wife and I bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. Our new home is close enough to the office that I can commute home during lunch. So I took my microwave home. Generally speaking I close the office and I'm the last one here. I took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. 

A lot of my peers are FURIOUS I ""stole"" my own microwave. Even the company owner and my manager are upset saying I snuck it out at the end of the day or that if I bought it for the office it should stay here. That was never my intention. I never communicated it , but I always meant to take my microwave home with me. It's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. I dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. Five bucks each or something. I said that and again more angry reactions. 

The screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. Saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and WE should buy another one. I'm not willing to budge here. It feels foolish that I should donate my personal property because people expect me to. 

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the input on this one. I guess I was honestly an asshole here. I didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but I think I was also stuck on the ""mine"" like a toddler. This is a bad situation for everyone. I'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.

Edit 2 : Just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. It was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. BUT since then it's a lot of new faces. Not justifying anything. Just providing more context to my actions.

Edit 3:
Obligatory ""this blew up way more than I expected!""

 A lot of people seem to be asking ""why doesn't your boss provide one"". I work in an insurance agency. We spend little time in office as possible. Especially the agents and financial advisors. The owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. She says that's how it was when she came into the business. Not a position I exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. At some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. Not justifying it. Just sharing. 

Right now I've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. Most people took the apology in stride. A few are angry for the sake of it. Planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. A few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. Just wanted to add this.

Final update : Met with my boss. It was a very mixed bag. I read a lot of comments on and off today. I decided to throw some weight around. Telling her how much I've earned her what I've done. I basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. I told her she created this situation. I told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. I asked her why I shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. 

She didn't like that. She told me this is EXACTLY why she doesn't like appliances in the office. If it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. We sort of went back and forth with this for a while. My boss asked me how would I like it if she went to my home and demanded I bring something in. She disclosed her annual salary. It's very similar to what I make. I called that bluff and asked about business profits. Told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. 

Negotiations broke down. At some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. She ended the conversation telling my boss ""quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home."" 

I feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. That woman is a SAINT. But I suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.

Edit whatever electric boogaloo: turns out at least one of my colleagues found this since it hit the front page. So that's... fun? But seriously y'all, posting ""quit immediately and now"". That's a bit drastic. I have a lot of gripes. But I plan on sticking with my job for a few years for experience. That's a funny thing you see on reddit a lot people say ""quit right the fuck now"".

I told her I was disappointed by her reaction as she sees them daily, while we only get to see each other every 4-6 weeks for a weekend at a time. I told her I wanted her to be able to do both things and we could find something that worked for both of us. 

In an attempt to compromise and minimize the impact to her schedule, I gave her multiple flight arrival times that evening and let her pick which one would work best. I mentioned that she could go to the event for a couple hours, leave early to pick me up, and then we could rejoin her coworkers when they go out for drinks afterwards. 

She insists I should spend the $50 to Uber back to her apartment to drop off my bags, then spend another $30-50 to meet them out at the bar.

1959,Not the A-hole,"I started working in this office about a month ago and have the lay of the land now. It's a very chatty office where we can all be working but still holding a conversation at the same time. I enjoy that, but have found that my life experiences are vastly different than these women. 

I was raised in poverty and had poor grades and was not able to get scholarships or anything for going to college, so I have never been. I started immediately in the work force when I graduated from high school and have been working since. All of the other people have college degrees, have traveled the world, go on vacation every year, get take-out frequently, own their condos or homes, have had big weddings, etc. Our common ground is that all of us really love to read and read a lot of different books, but most of us really love YA novels like by Courtney Summers and Nicola Yoon and Sarah Dessen.

Well there are a lot of times when some of them will be shocked if I don't have the same experience they do. We started talking about Christmas coming up and they were all shocked to find out that I only ever received Christmas presents because of school parties or things like that. 

The issue came up when we talked about vacations and I said I'd never been on a vacation like the kind where you travel away from your home. This shocked just about all of them and one of them wouldn't let go of it and kept asking what my family did for vacations growing up. 

I told her that we didn't get to take any vacations. She kept pressing and saying that everyone gets time off from work, and I said that my parents would often times have to use it to work their second jobs to make more money. She kept insisting that I must have gone on vacation somewhere, or I must have gone to summer camp or to a beach or something, everyone does that.

This really got on my nerves and I said ""Not everyone grows up in a middle class fantasy world like in the YA novels where the parents are rich and go to beachside cottages every year, and get Christmas presents and the kids always get into Ivy league schools. That's not real life.""

She has stopped chatting with me at work and some of the other women have told me that was an uncalled for comment, that it's not a fantasy world and that they're sorry my parents were ""neglectful"" of my childhood but that not everyone grows up poor, either.

1961,Not the A-hole,"Ok. So here's the sitch:  


My folks are old, they are on the way out. Could be a couple of years, could be ten... could be sooner.  


So naturally they want to get their affairs in order and leave a will to divide up their estate to their children. Me and my 3 (older) brothers.   
Their estate consists of, 3 titles of land all side by side. One 12 acre lot (no infrastructure), one 120 acre lot (no infrastructure), and another 110 acre lot (house, pool, carport, underground spring water bore, fruit orchard, multiple unaproved sheds and storage facilities plus more). They also have some shares and savings.

Originally their idea was to leave the 3rd block which has infrastructure to two of my brothers to share, my other brother would get the large undeveloped block and I would get the smallest undeveloped block.

The shares would be divided out somewhat equally based on the value of each bequeathment.  
I wasnt thrilled by this as I would be getting less land than the others, although it does have some redeeming qualities - it has good road access and is easy to connect to the electrical grid. however it is TINY! at least compared to the other blocks and it's much less private and lacks the degree of natural features (rainforest) that I would value in a property.

I have also expressed that I would rather share the main block with one of my brothers than get the smallest block or would rather get the other larger block and less shares.

But tonight my dad showed me a new ammended will in which My oldest brother would get the large and only developed block, one brother would get the largest undeveloped block and I would get the smallest block with my other brother just getting the money.

My oldest brother is already well set up - he has a house that is already paid out in full. He has a business worth potentially millions. He is fuckin loaded relative to the rest of us. He also married a woman of no small means who is also set to inherit a reasonable estate from her elderly and ailing mother.  
But my parents are christians - and in the bible the oldest son gets the largest inheritence.

I don't have a house. I don't really have any savings at all. I am paying off $20,000 of debt with my partner to help keep her in the country so we can be together. She has no prospects of inheriting anything at all as her parents own practically nothing. And I think this new will is Bullshit. 

I told my dad as much. In gentler words (slightly).

But he thinks I'm being ungrateful. That many people don't get anything and that I'm getting something and should be happy with what I get and shouldn't see any issue with the new will.  


Am I the asshole for thinking this is unfair and saying as much?",55,36,0.81
1962,Not the A-hole,"My sister and I (21 & 24F) have always considered Mom to fill the role of both parents. He got her pregnant, promised to marry her, and left for the most part*. She was given two toddlers to take care of as an immigrant, while managing a job as an ER physician. It was shitty to grow up in and led to a lot of depression and anxiety for all three of us. (I should probably mention that he married someone else a long time ago and my mom didn't find out until 2012. She didn't even find out from him.)


It's not bad enough that he did this to my family, but I have several older half-siblings put in the exact same position.  I've met them and sympathize with them, and they all have a bone to pick with Dad. (Dad didn't even tell them that my sister and I existed. When I first met my brother, he drove down to my dad and got into a screaming match.) 

I personally just feel hurt. I wanted a dad when I was younger, and it sucked not having one when I needed one. It made me really upset and I used to cry when I was a lot younger because I felt rejected. And I grew up watching my mom pine over someone who probably never cared as much about her. It feels terrible thinking about what he did to her and how lonely and lost she felt. But add to that the stories I hear from my siblings (no child support, hurting one of their chances to get into college, upset mothers and just being in this position in the first place) I can't help but demonize the guy. 

[As an added bonus, he convinced me to give him my SSN over the phone and then hung up when I was a teen (~9 years ago).]

As far as I'm concerned, I don't want to pursue a relationship with him, because he hasn't even apologized to any of us for anything. 

My mom says he's getting older (70+) and that he has a lot of regrets. She wants to forgive him because it's the Christian thing to do, and that's it. I can't subscribe to that ideology at all, because I went through pain and she definitely went through hell herself, but if that's what she wants, fine. 

My younger sister also wants a relationship with Dad that she didn't have when she was younger. She texts and video chats him all the time, gets money from him (I think), and their relationship seems good. That's fine too.

Where I draw the line is both of them convincing me to forgive and forget, asking me ""what did he do to you anyway?"" and basically saying I should buck up and let it go. My mom asks me if I've contacted him to say hi or wish him a happy birthday, and when I say I haven't, she gets angry at me. My sister thinks I'm a melodramatic blowhard and is just annoyed. 

I just can't. To me, it would feel like I'm saying his behavior in the past was okay, especially without him apologizing for any of it.

He sends my sister and I gifts every Christmas and birthday, and texts me occasionally to tell me he's thinking of me. And I'm not made of stone. I'm human, and I feel bad ignoring him. But he really can't be trusted in my eyes.

AITA?

TL,DR: My dad hasn't really been a figure in my life and did some shady things, one after another. Despite missing him as a dad, I can't forgive what he's done to my mom, sister, myself and my other half-siblings by abandoning us. I don't want a relationship with him nowadays, but my mom and sister get angry or annoyed when I refuse. They seem to have good relationships with him though. 

*Edit: I should clarify that I did see him again sporadically, so he didn't just ""leave"" to the point where we never saw him again. Apologies for my misdirection. To be fair, Mom would take us to the hospital where he worked about once every two or three months when we were little, and after that he would visit every two years or so, up until about 2011-2012.

1965,Everyone Sucks,"This story happened a few years ago and when I told this story to a newer friend he called us assholes.  

My friends and I used to rent a house in a downtown area that was on a one way street.  The house didn't have a driveway so we would have to park on the street.  We could fit four cars in front of the house.  The house was on the corner lot.  We generally never had any problems.  

Living down the street was an older (55f) lady named ""Gloria"" with her adult children.  She had her own driveway but would occasionally park in the street due to her kids parking in the driveway.  The problem began when she would park in front of our house.  We had no problem with her parking in front of the house but she would park in a way that no one could park behind her due to another driveway.  We could only park one in front of her and if someone parked in front of that car they would run the risk of a ticket for being to close to the crosswalk since it was a corner house.  We asked Gloria at least ten times to be more mindful of how she parked in front of the house yet she still kept doing it.  

Night of the incident.  We came home on a Saturday night and she had parked like that again.  My roommate and I were fed up.  So he guided me to parking within two inches of her back bumper.  I guided him within two inches of her front bumper and then we went inside to go to bed.  Seven a.m. she came and started beating on our door.  (She was an avid church goer) I was greeted with a hail of insults and that we needed to move our cars.  I said ok, shut the door and went back upstairs.  Thirty minutes later a cop was knocking on our door.  He asked us to move our cars and we said sure and walked out to move them.  She was still yelling at the cop about arresting us.  We said good morning to her and he just got in his cruiser and left.

1966,Not the A-hole,"My brother (age 45) has 2 sons, twins, age 17. They're not allowed to get jobs or learn to drive, as he doesn't want anything to detract from their studies. I've had many conversations with him where I've said that if they don't learn to multitask or prioritise or balance responsibilities this will screw them over in the long run, but he only sees short term.

I (29f) am 5 months pregnant with my first child. My husband and I moved into a new home about 6 months ago, and we knew it was a fixer-upper when we moved in, but didn't anticipate me getting pregnant so soon, so while the house is perfectly safe and liveable, the majority of the fixing up has fallen on my husband. I've been helping out but I've been doing a tenth of what he has been doing.

About a month ago my nephews approached me asking for help. Their plan was to sign on with an agency and tell their father that they were at my place during their shifts, and they wanted to know if I would go along with it. I agreed.

My husband then said (when the boys left) that as the nursery still needed painting and the furniture assembled, if they wanted to help him out with that then he'd welcome the extra hands, as we aren't in a huge rush and we had enough money to pay them for their time and effort. There were a few other things on the to do list like fix and repaint the fence and clear out and convert the attic into a guest room.

The next time we saw the boys they'd signed on to an agency, but they didn't get as many shifts as they hoped. We said if they wanted to help us out we could pay them £10 per hour. They agreed. The list was finished within a week.

We gave the boys the money they'd earned, plus a bit extra, and they each had exactly £350. One asked if we could do an IOU type of thing, where I kept the money safe for him and gave it to him when he needed it, and I agreed. The other took it home with him and said he was going to keep it safe.

My brother found the second twin's money, demanded to know where he got it from, and grounded both boys when they wouldn't tell him. I told my brother that I had given my nephew the money, and explained that he had been helping me out, and really laid it on thick with the pregnant thing. I didn't tell him that the other nephew had also helped.

My brother yelled at me, said it wasn't my place to do that, they're his kids not mine, and if he wants them to work he'll put them to work. He then said that by paying them £10 an hour when the minimum wage for under 18 is £4.35 I had ""spoiled"" them and that they would ""piss the money away"". I said that while I respect that he is their father, it was my money and my choice what to do with it.

For the last couple of months he had pushed me to go to therapy (granted, I'm barely coping from burnout/anxiety/stress, and it's a pain to have to put up with someone like that). Everyday we'd talk for a couple minutes before we started having an argument over it. He'd yell that ""you need help and I can't help you. You need professional help"" and cut the call. I finally bit the bullet to make him happy, and I'm in a crappy financial position because of it. But I'm doing therapy, *yay.*

 

I've been in therapy for exactly one (1) week and now his latest thing is that I should take sleeping pills to sleep. I get incredibly stressed out with work, and I haven't had a decent night's sleep since I started this job. But I absolutely refuse to take sleeping aids. 

 

I have really bad days, and I don't trust myself to be sad and alone in a house with a bunch of sleeping pills. I also know myself well enough to be afraid of being addicted to them (not to the chemicals per se, but addicted to the easy out of taking a pill and fast forwarding my life by skipping days asleep).

I told my father I would absolutely not even consider sleeping aids, and he called me ""immature and ignorant"" for not doing it. I confronted him with the fact that my parents' go-to offense is to call me immature/childish whenever I don't readily comply with them, and he promptly cut the call.

 

I have texted him that if our calls will be him pushing his latest easy fix of sleeping pills on me, that I'd rather we not talk anymore.

Recently my girlfriend told me she would want me to give her some gas money since she is the one always driving us to places. I told her I was contributing by paying for our date nights and also pointed out we always hang out in my place eating food that I have bought. After that, she dropped it. Now she brought it up again insisting it is not fair I won't pay for half of the gas. Then I told her okay I would stop paying for our dates and she should also pay for some of the food that she eats at my place if we are going to start paying half for gas. She got mad at this calling me cheap and childish. I think I'm being reasonable and fair.

1973,Not the A-hole,"Hi

I'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

In a nutshell my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.

When she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

Yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- Got muck/handprints everywhere
- Broke and refused to replace things in my house
- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- Left mountains of clothes everywhere
- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours
- Literally drained me emotionally and financially
- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- Kept leaving the toilet a mess
- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

When I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.

About a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

We are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

I feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

AITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


Edit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

UPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

After getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.
Like some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.

A while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX""

Some of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.

UPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.

A)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.

B)  She never gave BJs

C)  She INSISTED on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me ""Go down on me, or there is no sex""

D)  Never did anything else.  Vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",1729,15883,0.88

She lives an hour and a half away if I go on foot which is like a 20 minute drive on a regular day. But come on it was my birthday I was not planning to go through protest on foot without knowing if I was going to be able to go back on a cab or something. 

Also I was my family came to visit me and I couldn't left them hanging. I almost sure am not in the wrong here. But what pissed me off the most was that just before the day ended I sent her a couple of audios telling her that I'll go to see her tomorrow even if that means walking around protests, and that I couldn't just leave my family. And she answered me saying that she ""feels bad about the importance of her in my life"". And it really reads like a way to make me feel bad. AITA here?",46,188,0.96

1978,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: Around 4 years ago, my partner and I were looking at houses to move in together. At the same time, my MIL found out she wouldn't be able to afford the house she was in when her daughter moved in with her boyfriend. 

Long story short, we were both at school, not a lot of money so we said she could move in with us to help save everyone some cash. I was always under the impression that we all knew this was a temporary living situation.

Fast forward to now: it's been 4 years, both my partner and I make decent money while my MIL has not worked in the 4 years we've lived under the same roof.

Everytime we've brought up the possibility of living on our own, MIL has gotten super defensive and managed to guilt trip my partner until the situation gets forgotten about by everyone else for another 6 months. 

I don't know how to approach the situation anymore because I'm made to feel like asshole everytime I bring it up with either of them.

1979,Not the A-hole,"A little background here. Personally I don’t like dancing but she loves to. She’s pretty good at belly dancing and loves to show off her skill.

I have asked her to go out clubbing multiple times but she says it’s not fun if it’s just the two of us. She has this group of office colleagues and her “squad” (all girls) whom she goes out clubbing with.

She used to keep telling me stories of how they would dance with random groups at clubs and men trying to hit on her and at times groping her. These stories were getting under my skin but unfortunate so I ignored them and tried to be as supportive as I can.

Lately she started clubbing with her office colleagues and the insta stories and snaps of them dancing and her belly dancing jus for this one particular guy she keeps raving about got under my skin. I know this has a bit of jealousy undertone to it, but my feeling stems mainly from her outright refusing to go dancing with me. I told her how I felt and she said I am a being overtly jealous. I suggested maybe we should go out clubbing just for me to get over this but she outright refused and called me insecure asshole and we haven’t spoken for a day now.

AITA for calling out my girlfriend for clubbing with everyone but me?

EDIT: yes she is well aware of the fact that I don’t like dancing and the one time her squad  did ask me I refused coz I thought they were jus being cordial coz I was dropping her off. Also she makes more than me and her parents are super loaded so jus using me for money is out of the question. We have had other issues which almost led to us breaking up but she worked really hard and smacked some sense into me. Like she would  put up with our odd work schedules and travels 1-2 hours jus to see me ( I don’t). Yes I would like to trust her completely here.",380,1012,0.95

1981,Not the A-hole,"I’m a little brother and the youngest in my family. I have one older brother and my parents.

Recently I feel like my brother has become more rude towards me and I want to tell that to him directly when my parents are around, because my brother doesn’t listen to me as I am the youngest sibling.

As to why I think he is getting more rude, it’s because he would often shout at me over the smallest things like:
-I don’t react when he says a statement
-I try to say something while he’s playing a ranked match in his game 
-I ask him to take his stuff and his dirty tissues from my room
-I make a false  assumption whether big or small
-I have a different view

While I admit I do get irritated, I try not to raise my voice when he uses my computer to play a game he bought, he litters tissues and eats in my room, and other smaller things but whenever I tell him to stop he denies and says it’s not my room. I also always try to explain my point but he cuts me off midway talking about his point and not really explaining it.

To the other view I would be able to describe myself as I am sometimes annoying and very sarcastic but he always takes it too far and shouts at me.

I will make a list of other stuff that bothers me and might edit some more later here:
-interrupts me when I talk to someone
-takes my things without permission 
-doesn’t stop arguing when I admit I was wrong

In this case, am I just paranoid and will I be the asshole?",11,28,0.83
1982,Not the A-hole,"We never gave the option for a plus one. They've gotten the invites, RSVP'd that they're coming, and then written out ""+1"" themselves, most of them on the back of the invite. We have a set amount of everything, and have paid for an exact number of people to attend, but we also paid for 10 people more than we planned in case people brought plus ones without clearing it. However, the number of plus ones currently means we would need 20 extra seats, not 10. We've only discussed it with 4 or 5 of them directly, and they all said some variation of ""it's not fair that you invited me and not this person"". At this point it would be easier/cleaner to just uninvite the people who added plus ones without permission.

Would we be the assholes if we uninvited the people with plus ones?

&#x200B;

Info:  We invited complete units (parents and children, husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends) and of the 20 plus ones who have been invited, some are boyfriends/girlfriends we didn't know about, which we'd counted for and would be covered by the 10 extra seats, but some are people we didn't even think of, for example one of my fiance's cousins, who he is related to, has written one of her cousins as a plus one. My fiance is not related to, and has never met, her cousin, who is from the other side of her family. One of my cousins invited one of her friends who I have met in passing a few years ago and that's the extent of our relationship. We don't mind the people bringing dates, as right now we can fit those people in, but the friends of friends and relatives who aren't actually related to us aren't on the list.

We don't especially want to uninvite people but we're now concerned that even if we say to people that they can't bring a plus one they will anyway or if they talk and realise that one person still has a plus one and they don't they'll get mad. We think it would be easier to just have a blanket ban then deal with the drama.",670,2800,0.97
1983,Not the A-hole,"On the plane going to a holiday destination we try and save money by not booking designated seats and take whatever seats are allocated to us. I get allocated an aisle seat at the very back  of the plane which means I’ll get to be one of the first off and not have to queue as much at passport control.

Towards the end of boarding a man holding a baby walks in and says ‘those two seats are ours’ so I stand up to let him and the baby in. A woman walks in with him and just stands in the aisle looking awkward as I go to sit back down. 

The guy after a few minutes taps me on the shoulder and says ‘can you swap with my wife unless you want to sit next to a baby the entire flight, her seat is 19A’.

Here’s where I’ve been called TA. My response was, ‘I’ll go check the seat first and make sure it’s an ok seat’.

My rationale is, and I’m trying not to discriminate here, when you’re at a window seat it’s a lot harder to get up and go to the bathroom depending on who is sat next to you and I’ve had a few instances where I’ve been sat in a window seat next to a larger person and been boxed in with no use of the arm rest either. Also the seat I was giving up had nobody behind me so I wanted to check there was no situation where the person behind was going to poke their bare foot forward like you see in some flight horror stories. 

I go check the seat and it’s next to a Middle aged couple who dramatically sigh as I go to take the seat as they thought they had the row to themselves and turn back and give the couple a thumbs up to let them know I don’t mind switching.

The annoying thing is my girlfriend had a free seat next to her as the flight took off but the other person on that row got their friend to move to it as soon as the seat belt sign came off because the couple next to me fell asleep and I didn’t want to wake them up to move seats again.

So AITA for not giving my seat up instantly for a mother to sit with her husband and child without checking what seat I was getting first?",23,46,0.83
1984,Asshole,"Last year, I was on Instagram when I saw this girls picture. She and I went to the same high school and had mutual friends but never actually talk to each other. She posted a picture of her and her friends in a group Halloween costume which I thought was very nerdy and cool, so I started talking to her. 

Our conversations went from cold and very one sided to very personal and we happened to talk almost every day, so I began to develope a crush on her. I knew she liked a guy beforehand, so I never tried a single move on her. Not even once. My crush on her wasn't so big of a deal after all. 

So, fast forward to this year. We have become good friends, and I helped with her Halloween costume and party, but then, in the middle of the party, I had this thought: Why am I friends with her? I recalled a long time ago, when I asked her why she decided to open to me and become a friend of mine when at the beginning she was very cold and not-caring person, and she didn't want to respond. She said I wouldn't like her answer, and that ""it would change the way you see me, which I would deserve"", and ""to think that it can continue happening in that way"" (that's her exact words, I didn't understand either), but that conversation happened in august and I let it go.

Thing is I have grown distrust in her. I feel like whatever she's hidding from me it's really bad. And now that Halloween season (the thing that brought us together in the first place) is almost over, I realize I don't want to continue this friendship, the thing is I don't have proof she is truly hidding something bad from me, and I can't tell her I grow my distrust for her for something I told her I'd let go. I'm an introvert, and I honestly don't want to deal with conflict, so I'm thinking in ghost her and basically cut her from my life. WIBTA?",18,41,0.92
1985,Asshole,"I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",5992,24931,0.86
1986,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. Sorry kind of long post.

My main friend group consists of 5 guys, all 20M and we've been close friends since middle school. After we graduated highschool, we planned to go on a trip to Japan to celebrate, but the plans fell through as we realized we were broke kids. We pushed the trip back a year so we could all save up some money, but one year turned into 2, then 3, because we became busy with college and work.

Started dating my gf start of this year and things have been going great. She's met my friends and gets along with them very well and was invited to come on our trip (2 of my friends gf's are coming too). She was excited since she hasn't left the States before, and I haven't either so she really liked that we were going to share a new experience together. When she was invited the plan was to go next summer, so she had around a year to save up money.

The problem: A week ago our trip began to fall apart as all of our schedules would not line up, and we thought we would have to push back another year. However we realized that we could do the trip this upcoming December/January during the holidays, where we have ~3 weeks gap where we can get vacation from work/not have classes.


But moving the trip up means that my gf can't go. She has family commitments during the holidays and does not have enough money saved up, and I can't afford to pay for both of us. She was really down about this, so I promised her that the two of us could still go on a trip to Japan or anywhere else next summer. This seemed to cheer her up a bit and I thought she was ok.

But yesterday as I was going to buy my plane ticket she told me that she didn't want me to go. Her reasoning was that she wanted us to experience leaving the country for the first time together, and she was jealous that my friends gf's were able to go and have a ""romantic"" trip together. She wants me to just go on a trip with her next year and sit this one out because I ""could always have the boys trip some other time"".

I said I still wanted to go because it has been me and my friend's dream for years. This made her unhappy and she said I was ""abandoning her just to have fun with my guy friends"" and we haven't talked since. I did feel bad, and I told my friends that I was considering going. They decided that if I wasn't going then they wouldn't go either, since we made a ""pact"" where we would all go together (a big reason why the trip kept getting pushed back in the past, since there was always someone busy).

I did some thinking and I have decided I am going to go on this trip. My friend's and I have been looking forward to this for so long and I don't want to ruin it. But when I talked/vented to my parents about this they said I was being unfair to my gf, who also looked forward to the trip, and that I should prioritize my relationship over friends.

I’m the only out of her seven grandchildren to give her a call on her birthday. I’m the only one of her grandchildren to call her at least three times a week since she's been in the hospital to check up on her, because I know she is very lonely. I have always called once a week prior to her hospitalization. I feel like I am the one who shows that she cares for my grandma. Hell, my own mom doesn't call her own mom because she doesn’t want to send GM money. I feel like I was unfairly treated. I understand that my grandma is obviously feeling lonely because the only person who visits her is my uncle and my grandma is stuck in the hospital on her birthday. But, I am truly hurt.  
So, I told my mom what had happened and I started to cry again because I am deeply hurt. My mom got annoyed at me for crying and said that even though I did nothing wrong, I am inconsiderate granddaughter because a good granddaughter would understand where GM is coming from and why she is upset. She said that I would have tolerated her bullshit. My mom then gave me the silent treatment. My mom thinks I am being brat for being hurt and not being understanding. But, I feel like that is an unfair assessment. I feel quite alone in this situation. I came to my mother for emotional support but she turns me away and says I am not understanding. Yet, my mom hasn’t called her mom to give her a happy birthday. My GM called me after the incident and I ghosted her because my wound is too fresh. AITA?",68,164,0.91

1989,No A-holes here,"My nephew has never been an academic kid. He’s always loved working with his hands and hated sitting at a desk. 

He turned 16 and apparently went and dropped out of high school. He showed up at my shop where I work recently and asked for an apprenticeship. 

I was shocked to hear this news because his parents are both PhD university professors who feel very strongly about education, everyone in our family has at least a bachelors degree (I went to college and had a desk job for years before going back to trade school and I’ve never been happier than I am now.)

I told him he was welcome to have an apprenticeship if he went through all the channels anyone else would have to in order to earn one, then asked how his parents were feeling about all this and if he’d looked into GED classes and so forth. 

That’s how I found out his parents don’t know. I told him I couldn’t let him apprentice here without a parent signing a lot of waivers (true, even for blood relation) so he said he understood but asked I keep this to myself because he was going to tell them in his own way after he’d found a stable job so he could back up his explanation with a plan of action. 

I figure this is his life and whether or not I agree with his decision doesn’t matter, it isn’t my place to meddle. 

But every day he still hasn’t told them I start to worry. I don’t have kids so I have a hard time putting myself in my brother’s position. I’m seeing it more through my nephew’s eyes because I heavily relate to where he’s coming from.

He moved to the US with his family when he was in high school, and he's part of a friend group of six friends (four guys, two girls) who come from the same cultural background/similar families and all speak the same language. The problem is that when we're all hanging out, his friends still talk in this language, which I don't speak, and I can't understand what they're saying. They'll give me a short answer in English if I ask one of them a direct question but that's about it. My bf translates stuff for me here and there, but obviously I still miss out on a lot.

I've asked my bf many, many times to please tell his friends to talk in English when I'm around so I'm not totally shut out of the conversation, but he's always really reluctant to do it. He can't give me a clear reason for not wanting to ask them other than that it feels ""weird and awkward"" for them to communicate in English, which makes no sense. The few times he does ask them to use English, they'll do it for maybe a minute but then go right back to the other language.

So tonight we all went out to eat and I don't know, I was just so fed up with constantly feeling like the seventh wheel that I snapped. I wasn't rude and I didn't shout or yell or anything, I just told his friends it hurt my feelings to be left out all the time and I felt disrespected. They said it wasn't their intention to make me feel bad, but they were also really defensive about using their language. One of the guys got super upset and went off on a rant about how the language is part of their culture and accused me of trying to take that away from them. He said it's not their fault I haven't learned how to speak it and told me to stop policing the way they talk. 

My bf immediately jumped in and told his friends they were totally out of line to talk to me that way. But on the car ride home he told me I should have made more of an effort to integrate into the group and this whole conflict could have been avoided.

Idk why he's using that as an excuse..

I ask him if hes going to tell her, he says eventually. And I just don't know what to do. She's also my good friend and I don't him doing that behind her back... I decided to give him a few days to tell her. 

Cue to last week, about a week after he told me about his cheating. I messaged her the usual, ""hey, what's up? How are you and bf"" and she responds with how they're good and all that. So I figured he didn't tell her and after some prancing around asking if he told her anything I decided to tell her. Of course she didn't know and was freaking out and messaging him like crazy. She then send me a screenshot of their messages where shes telling him what I told her and he says that I'm full of shit and lying. Then he proceeds to tell her it was all a joke and he wanted to see how I'd react. She asks for screenshots but of course I dont have any of the convo because it was on snapchat, so it's gone. She thanks me and says she needs time to think. 

Now a few days after that ordeal I messaged her asking if she's ok. She is still taking things in slowly and is still with him currently. I dont know what they've talked about, but he had probably talked some shit about me considering he said I'm full of shit. He's been ignoring me on snapchat so I text his number and he said hes ignoring me because I'm fake and whether he cheated or not is none of my business. 

At this point now I'm so hurt. He was a really good friend of mine. He coached me in powerlifting, seen me cry and been there for me during my hard times when deployed. He told me something that I honestly wish he didnt even confess to me because it left me in such an awkward spot. They're both good friends and I was planning on visiting them in Texas in the future.

1997,Not the A-hole,"So, I am throwing a holiday party in December. It's not a Christmas party, it's a ""Heathenistic Holliday Party"" because I like the way that sounds. 

&#x200B;

After inviting some friends I realized one friend of mine gave birth *VERY* recently. Truth be told, I totally want this friend to come! However, I am not intending this party to be a good environment for an infant. My apartment is not baby proof, there will be some loud-ish music, and there's gonna be alcohol. 

&#x200B;

I understand it's hard for parents to find a sitter, and for a newborn it must be even crazier. However, while I have no problem with her child, I just think that the child should not come to this party because of the nature of this event, the apartment, etc.

&#x200B;

Now, I don't plan to un-invite my friend. Like I said, I am more than happy for her to attend. However, I wanted to see if I would be the asshole if I tried to politely ask her not to bring her newborn.

1998,Not the A-hole,"Ok some backstory. I'm a 17(M) I live with my parents(obviously) and my sister is 24 and still living with us with her husband. About a year and a half ago I decided to use it as my computer room as for it was vacant and no one had plans to use it so I took it my mom had no issues with this in fact no one did until now. Recently my sister and her husband decided to have a baby while still living with her parents(I know) but she said that she was gonna use my computer room for it and I need to move everything out of it by the end of her second trimester because there isn't room for a crib and decorations in her room.                                                                                       I obviously refuse and she had an absolute fit yelling at me telling me how inconsiderate and selfish I am. She goes to my mom she and her start yelling at each other and she says I want him out of that room by the end of my second trimester. My mom told her that she should've took it back when I was planning to make it my computer room a year and a half ago, and that she should start looking for apartments. Because she isn't gonna make me leave. She threatened to throw everything out my actual room and my mom was furious and told her not to touch any of my stuff. She accused my mom of playing favorites and stormed out of the house and drove and drove off. As funny as this might be to some of you I feel kinda bad. So am I the asshole for this.


Edit: I'm gonna answer some questions I see on this post 
1: I live in the USA

2: Her pregnancy was planned

3: I saw someone asking what state I'm in. I live in Utah



Edit 2: for all of you saying I don't need a computer room. You're right I don't but it's the principle of the whole situation she knew she didn't have space for it after I moved in to that room. So now just because she made the dumb decision to get pregnant, knowing she doesn't have space for it I should pay for it and give up my space?


Edit 3: A little more insight. This house is crowded. There's me my brother my sister my other sister(the one in the post) her husband my mom and my dad my brother is 16 my other sister is 14. My mom is a huge softie and would never kick any of her *babies* out without a valid reason. They both have jobs and really nice cars they're here cuz it saves money they could easily afford a 3 bedroom apartment. They also brought home a dog without my mom's knowledge or permission so at this point I think she's just tired of the new additions to the family",428,703,0.93
1999,Not the A-hole,"Hi. Throw away account, on mobile, etc.

My(26 M) sister (19F) is getting married next Friday in an LDS (mormon) temple. She got engaged in the middle of s
September and is getting married this weekend.

I recently removed my name from the church's records as of August, meaning i can no longer enter the LDS temple. No one in my family knew, and since I was able to enter the temple before I left my family assumed I would be able to see my sister's ceremony. I finally told them all this last Sunday that I had my records removed and couldn't attend the wedding. 

Since then my sister and FBIL decided i would wait in the parking lot and watch all my siblings' and guests' kids while the ceremony happened. I don't want to, like at all. There's 30+ kids and I don't want to watch them all by myself, I was planning to go grab breakfast with my dad, who also can't go into the temple, then head home get ready and head to the reception.

WIBTA if I told my family and guests I can't watch the kids and stuck to my plans?

Edit: Since almost every comment has asked, she sent out texts/emails/fb messages yesterday saying that if they haven't found sitters for the ceremony yet I would be in the parking lot and available to watch any kids. I did not know about this until about 5-6 o clock today and about 13 people have responded so far. My sister and FBIL have made plans for babysitters for the reception already, young women 12-17 have volunteered to watch kids in different rooms of the chapel during the ceremony already. It's not uncommon in the mormon church to do this. However they did not have any plans for the ceremony. It was up to the parents to find a sitter for that time.

Edit 2: Thanks for your responses, it helped me see that I am not being over dramatic and that this is indeed crazy of her to ask. I'm going to talk to her about it again tomorrow. Good night everyone.",310,1527,0.97
