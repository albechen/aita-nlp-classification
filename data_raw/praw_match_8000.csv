4,Not the A-hole,"About a month or two ago me and my SO had visited Italy for just under two weeks roaming from town to town. 

Throughout our stay we had constantly met African males that would like to shake your hand and just have a chat with you. Initially I thought no harm to it. We had a chat to this guy but the conversation changed into him asking if I did some boxing or a little weight-lifting. I saw there was another male close by which I assumed was his friend so alarm bells started ringing for me. So I told him we had to go and we parted ways. 

From this point on, we constantly had encounters with men like him asking for a handshake - typically found in more touristy places. I understand that they could be kind and genuine but after encountering around an average of 3-4 guys like this on the street it just felt like there was something up.

Coming to the end of our trip we sat down for lunch at a restaurant before we flew home. I didn't realise this at first but in this town I had already told him to leave us alone. At this point I was quite fed up with these guys so I 'snapped' at this guy interrupting us having our lunch. 

I was clearly frustrated when I told him to leave us alone and so he doubled up, squared up to me and asked me why? In my frustration I used the term 'you people' when I tried to explain how these guys constantly harassed us throughout our trip and how annoying it was. I knew from saying that I was instantly in the wrong. 

He then went off the handle and started telling me how I was racist and how he was struggling. I was back tracking as this was not what I meant at all, the restaurant owner came out and tried to usher him away but the gentleman was in full swing of his argument. 

At this point, I just wanted him to say his piece as what I said was wrong. He said his piece and I kept quiet in order for him to go away. Of which he did. 

Since then it has been bugging me. Was I in the wrong for wanting to be left alone? Am I uncovering something that I didn't know about myself? I hate hearing the phrase 'I'm not racist but...' - but in this situation I felt like it had applied here. I'd appreciate just honesty in my actions here. 

Thank you for reading.

&#x200B;

TLDR: There needs to be context but essentially - African street man asks for a handshake and I told him to leave me alone using the phrase 'you people'.",83,95,0.93

6,Asshole,"I work at an office where I’m allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the “no jeans policy.” She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

Problem is, for the past few months that I’ve been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. 

I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

I said “Well, the girls get to wear jeans.”

“No they don’t.”

Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn’t allowed to wear jeans. 

In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn’t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

AITA?

EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can’t say I’m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn’t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",4343,23686,0.9
7,Everyone Sucks,"I (18F) was home from uni, and my mum had told me clean the house. I did, and was just going to get some water from the kitchen. My brother(23M) was there refilling his water bottle from the fridge water dispenser. His attention was completely on his phone not the bottle, so it spilled onto the floor and down the sides of the fridge. This is not the first time it happened. 

I told him to clean it up, because i just swept and mopped the house (which he did not help once btw). He said no, its just water. I pressed again because i will not do it. He said no and told me to fuck myself. Ok i told him he’s a POS and went and poured water in front of his bedroom, which he a few hours later did the same back to me. His birthday was in a few days and I was originally thinking of giving him a gift card cos idk what he likes, but i decided to buy a mop because I still wasn’t over his immaturity (still am not). 

The day comes around, its just me and my parents and one family friend at our house. We cut the cake blah blah, time comes around for the presents to be given. I go after the family friend, and its pretty obvious my gift is not the conventional gift bc i wrapped the cloth part(?? The wiping part, not the pole lol) and i just left the pole on its side. 

He opens it, and just stares at it and looks back up at me and asks why i gave him that. I tell him so he can use it to mop the floor next time he spills something because I’m not going to do it. He looks pissed but couldn’t say anything because of the family friend. Parents look confused/angry and family friend looks like she just wants to get out of there. 

After she leaves my parents blow up at me for embarrassing him and them in front of family friend. I tell them about the incident, and they tell me that i should just take care of it since he’s my brother, and that I’m his younger sister so i should obey him??? I tell them that i cleaned the entire house by myself but he cant do one simple thing, and my mum just told me to leave it because my brother is like that and i should just put up with it. 

My brother went and poured more water in front of my bedroom and on my room’s carpet, great!!!. I tell my friend who said that what i did was funny, but my dad and my brother have not spoken to me for a few days and my mum says this is what i get for behaving like that. AITA??


EDIT/ UPDATE:

 Idk why im writing an essay for this but I have to write down my thoughts to this. Anyway thank you everyone for all your replies, it really put me in my place and also put everything else in perspective. It’s not just about spilling some water, its the fact that I cleaned a house that I dont’t even stay at everyday and my brother barely lifted a finger, and then he came and completely disrespected me when I asked him to do a very VERY menial task. Yes i retaliated in an extremely immature way and have understood that I was as equally a dick as my brother. 

I have apologised to him for embarrassing him and got him a Visa card as his real present lol. Although as many suggested I tell him how i felt about his behaviour, I have done this in the past for various other situations and all have backfired on me. He has an unusually big ego, and is extremely traditional so anything I say as a retort to his unreasonable (imo) actions, I guess is an insult to him so he just tells me I have no right to tell him that. 

Whatever,, I leave tomorrow for uni and won’t be coming back for a few weeks so I might as well just brush it under the carpet to leave on a good note. I have also apologised to my dad for embarrassing him, and mostly to mum - she was really sad at the state of our family, so I felt really bad for her. 

My dad, my mum and my brother were all born and raised in India, in very traditional households, so I guess that shows the root of their blatantly backwards mindsets. If I had not cleaned the house, my brother definitely would not have, and that meant my mother would have to do it all by herself, because surprise surprise my dad is the same as my brother. I think I’m her only solace, because she knows she can rely on me to do something, because my dad and brother definitely won’t from what I have lived through. She’s technically in the same boat as I am, she just thinks its okay, since she was raised that way. That’s a whole different problem though. Also I’m not going to cut ties with them - I do try distance myself from my brother and my dad sometimes, because we clash often.

Either way, I’m leaving tomorrow and like some comments have suggested, I am focusing on saving up as much as possible, so I can move out permanently. Best wishes and thanks to everyone.",356,1701,0.95

9,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I sat down right before the person in the next table at a Vietnamese restaurant. We ordered in English (for context, we're in an English speaking part of Canada), then the person in the next table orders in Cantonese to the waitress. The waitress, being Vietnamese, has no idea what that person said, and both of them made eye contact with me, hoping I can translate for them.
  
I could have, but I looked at them like I didn't know what the guy in the other table was talking about. Me and my wife we're speaking English to each other, so they didn't presume that we both knew Cantonese when I gave them a blank stare back. The person in the next table proceeds to order in a heavily accented broken English, he still got his order.
  
My wife says is not nice that I didn't help, and that we just came from a trip where we were the foreigners and asked locals to help us translate.  
My point is that we would have been translating for the next table the whole dinner, and I rather talk to her without being interrupted because the table over felt it's more convenient not to speak English. And even if he didn't know, it's not our job. Also to add that during the trip, I whipped out my Google Translate whenever an English menu (or helpful bystander) wasn't available.",39,95,0.92
10,Not the A-hole,"This happenend over 5 yeaars ago, so no advice needed. 

I was the main tenant of a 3 bedroom apartment and two of my roomies left at once (they finished their studies and went to another city). I was looking for two new roommates but instead bonded quickly with another woman who was working full-time and wanted to rent two rooms for herself. One as a bedroom, the other one because she was doing home-office 2x a week. 

We agreed and everything went fine for \~2 months until she realised she got pregnant. Since she already rented two rooms at the flat she was sure she could just stay and use the office room for her child. I, however, told her she needs to leave because there is no fucking way I will live with a child. I told her she can stay until she finds a nice apartment but I don't want to deal with a screaming child and overall issues connected with it. She couldn't understand and said I was looking for two other roommates anyway and that she won't leave because she liked it here and can save money by living in a flat. We got in a fight and she has accused me of not showing solidarity with her situation and that this could happen to any woman, which I didn't find relevant in any way and just like she was playing the solidarity-card to get her way. 

Long story short, I quit her contract. She had over 3 months left to find a new home which is more than enough given her income and she - indeed - found a nice but rather expensive flat. Offtopic: She even left earlier and told me she won't be paying for the last month since she wouldn't be there. I knew I could easily find two roommates because the apartment was central and great, so I didn't do much about it, but wtf?

Yesterday, I met her and she just gave me the 'asshole stare'. Well am I? 5 years later I still feel like I would have done the same. A baby is not just a roommate and her financial situation was pretty stable. I would have been open to negotiations if the latter wasn't the case, but I still feel like it's my right to live in a child-free flat.",54,56,0.94

14,Not the A-hole,"We(9 college young adults) went for a short stay at the beach over the weekend. There were giant floats for rent and most of us were chilling on them on the water while enjoying the sun and breeze.


One of the girls, lets call her Lisa(good friend of my friend, not really close with me), had been constantly splashing me water and giggling away when I told her to stop. She was poking fun at the float I rented, a pink whale, which she said suited me(yeah, I am fat). She then kicked my float repeatedly until it toppled over, and I fell into the water as she laughed. Have to say the sea water was really salty, almost as salty as my feelings.


I swam up to Lisa(guess what, whales can swim!), grabbed hold of 1 end of her jellybean float, and with a sharp twist toppled over her float too. Lisa fell into the water with a scream. That would have been the end of my petty revenge, except that I did not know that Lisa could not swim, and the water was pretty deep there.


With the help of a friend and a stranger nearby we managed to drag Lisa to the shore. She was panicking so hard that she tore the strip on her bikini, and yeah, looked pretty much revealed. She also had makeups on her face which smeared with sea water and tears, guess she never intended to get wet at all. Lisa spent the rest of the holiday indoors and never stepped onto the beach again.


Even though nobody among us openly blamed me for it, I could sense the awkwardness in the air. Lisa completely avoided me and we haven't spoken a word til we parted.


Earlier on the friend who was close to Lisa messaged me and said that I should apologise to Lisa. I am not sure about that. I do feel a little guilty for toppling her float but on the other side, I think she asked for it. AITA?",336,926,0.96
15,Not the A-hole,"I (16f) live alone with my mom. Lately I've found my phone in different places then I left it, sometimes with my screen unlocked. I assumed my mom had been snooping though my phone. 

Instead of asking her (which probably would have been the mature thing to do) I started googling baby names, screenshotting baby outfits, texting my best friend 'the news', and more along those lines. 

Well my mom confronted me about it, which proves she's been snooping. She was worried and upset, and very angry when I told her I'm not pregnant (relieved too, but also angry). 

From my POV, I've never been secretive with my mom, I try to be as open as I can be. I get good grades, don't skip school, and the biggest trouble I've been in in the past few years was for trying a cigarette (which I told her honestly about). So it hurts that she wouldn't trust me, or ask if she thought anything was wrong. 

From her POV I can understand I caused her a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety, and that you can't always trust teenagers to tell the truth. But I'm still hurt by the lack of trust. 

AITA?


Edit: School and my parents both covered internet safety, cyberbullying, guarding personal info and all that about a year or two/three ago. I'm not sure if that's why she snooped, but I'd like to think I'm at least reasonably informed.

I didn't think it was relevant but I pay for my own phone plan, and saved up enough for half a phone, my mom covered the rest for my birthday.

INFO: I didn't change my password because I thought that would just make her more suspicious  IF she was snooping.",471,3156,0.97
16,No A-holes here,"My wife and I were driving to get lunch, I was shotgun and she was on the wheel. Normally I drive, but it was a nice day and she wanted to be the one in the driver's seat. 

The problem arose when she opened the window to let in some cool air, and then screamed like a banshee and nearly gave me a heart attack. I'm talking ""I just saw the ghost of my dead grandma in the middle of the road"" type of scream, accompanied by a sudden swerve to the right. I bolted upright thinking we were about to be in a head on collision with a truck. Nothing seemed amiss, other than my wife sitting stiffly and unnaturally as if she had just realised a snake was sleeping in her lap. I couldn't find any reason for her outburst until she whispered me: ""a ladybug...!""

Jesus H Christ. It had already flown off too, if it had ever even existed. My wife was nearly crying with terror, and while half of me wanted to leap into comforting her, the other half wanted to chew her head off for giving me the fright of my life over a damned ladybug, a creature so benign and harmless that I cannot even conceive how someone could be afraid of one. I told my wife to pull over into a rest stop, and gave her an angry lecture on how irresponsible she had been, and how dangerous her reaction was. She has no phobias towards insects, she simply panicked. As much as I love her, I feel she needed 'tough love' from me, because her reaction endangered us, and the other drivers. Not to mention the fact it took 10 years off my life. I took the wheel and she spent the rest of the drive smouldering and silent. 

I apologised to her later on, when we were both of cooler minds, but I was left with the lingering feeling that I was too hard on her. But, I justify it to myself by thinking that now she might think twice instead of immediately panicking when she sees a small insect.

20,Not the A-hole,"I was at work, it was 1:00, and my son called me and said ""your never gonna believe what happened to me"" and then said he was in the hospital because he broke his pinky finger by getting a door slammed on it. He was VERY casual about it, he was joking on the phone, he said it wasn't that bad and that mom was coming to the hospital soon. He sent me a photo of his finger in a cast/splint, it looked a bit bruised but it wasn't a super serious break. I had broken two of my toes when I was 24 and it was very painful when it happened, but once it was fixed up it wasn't so terrible. I told him I would pick up his prescription on the way home from work at 5:30, and he said it was fine, and that they were gonna get it. So he had known I was coming home from work, we made that clear. He sounded absolutely fine with it. I didn't think this was a major deal at all. I mean, it would be to an extent in that he had a broken finger, but not a massive deal. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, my wife calls me and is absolutely furious that I would stay at work when our son was in the hospital with a broken bone (she kept on emphasizing 'broken BONE' almost to make it more serious than it was... a broken finger is not exactly as bad as a broken arm or leg). She was yelling at me to the point where I could barely even get a word in. I honestly got a tiny bit upset at her because sometimes she does this thing where she gets upset and talks so fast that you can't get a single word in, and eventually I just told her goodbye and hung up. We continued the conversation through text. For one, I couldn't leave work, I had an important meeting at 4:30. Two... its a broken finger. He was apparently mostly ready to leave home soon after my wife got there. We don't often fight, its been 19 years of a good marriage, but sometimes when it comes to medical issues especially she can get very upset. I kind of expected that from her, and we fought again later in the night but eventually dropped it. 

&#x200B;

A week later at dinner (and by the way, my son is absolutely fine, luckily it was not his right hand finger), she brings it up to my cousin and brother and their family (half joking-half accusation, kind of like a ""can you believe this guy"" thing) and it seemed like basically everyone at the table sided with her. She exaggerated it a tiny bit, but she didn't exactly lie. I am honestly curious now after that dinner, am I the asshole?",66,80,0.93
21,Asshole,"I'm a freshman in university and I am on the fencing team. When people hear about my fencing they tend to ask a bunch of questions since fencing is an unusual sport, and so I usually show pictures of my fencing gear. A few days back though an acquaintance of mine heard that I was a fencer and I decided to grab my gear and show him. We were in the lobby of the dorm and there were only a couple people around so I got out my fencing blades and showed him some things (we did a mock battle). It was really fun and nobody got hurt. A dorm adviser walked by and I said hello to him (he didn't respond).

Later in the day I was called to the front desk and the adviser told me that he had reported my fencing gear and was going to see if I was even allowed to have it in the dormitory (even in my room). If he bans my stuff, I don't know where I'm going to keep it (I don't have a car or a locker or anything). I didn't know he even had a problem with me having fencing gear in the building and if he had told me to stop I would have put it away. It's not even a real sword. It's just as safe as any other sports equipment (hockey stick. golf club).

He told me that if someone got hurt by it he would get in trouble so he wanted to cut his losses by just not allowing my fencing stuff in the building at all. I guess my main grievance is that he reported me without even talking to me beforehand. He didn't say anything when I had my stuff out, and he didn't give me a chance to show that I'm responsible. Obviously now that I know it bugs him, I'm not going to take my stuff out of the bag unless i'm with the team. I don't want to cause trouble. I was just trying to show my friend some stuff.

22,No A-holes here,"So, I’m a single dad of 16 year old boy. We have good relationship. He doesn’t hide stuff from me and he talks to me about everything. 

Two days ago, he was doing something in kitchen, I was there too. He had his sleeves little rolled up and I noticed bruises on his wrists. I asked him about it immediately. He covered them and told me that he bumped into something. I didn’t believe that, he bumped both of his wrists on something and got bruises on exact same place?  And they were all the way around his wrists.

I asked him to roll up his sleeves more. He got nervous made a huge deal about it. He said that he didn’t need to, he had nothing to hide, etc etc.He was yelling,he stormed up to his room finally. Later he came downstairs, said that he overreacted and actually showed me his arms. He didn’t have any bruises except on wrists. He still didn’t tell me truth about those, but I left it alone for now.

I told my best friend about it. He thinks that I was in wrong for making him uncomfortable. I don’t think I was, It’s not like I asked him to strip down and stand there butt naked, I asked him to roll up his sleeves.

25,Not the A-hole,"Visited my inlaws for the past week. My spouse was not present...the inlaws and I usually get along very well.

This past week, his family was rude amongst themselves, in their language. We have two children - a 2 month old and a 2 year old. One cries a lot (normal), one is very energetic (normal).

His mother berated anyone who spoke to them in English- saying that since I dont speak their language they are learning a bastardized version (think Spanglish), and complaining that no one will sleep past 7:30am with them around (nevermind that I gladly take care of my kids, and let people sleep in - literally to 10am or later).

They also volunteer to watch the 2yo (never the babe - ""we aren't lactating,"" -- I obviously leave milk or formula), but then complain about it. Literally, they will volunteer to take her with them when they walk their dog, and then complain about her presence.

Over the last year, we have been storing our older daughter's clothes with his parents- in anticipation of baby #2.

Baby #2 arrived, and this past week, when we attempted to collect the stored clothes, discovered his mom had repacked EVERYTHING. I had meticulously packed stuff by fit and season. She started repacking by tag size (without asking)....but got tired of it, and ultimately put everything for 6-12 months in 4 bags (Ziploc totes - XL and XXL - so pretty large).

Upon seeing the 4 bags (they aren't small), my husband became angry with me that we had do much clothes. I told him the his mom repacked everything, and this was really the next 9 months of clothes.

His response was ""she wouldn't do this."" (She's done thus before and ruined 75% of my professional suits - which were also stored due to pregnancy...and he knows this).

He confronted her, and she told him she did, in fact rearrange everything. He sat down to coffee and breakfast with his family (after telling me he wouldn't make me breakfast until I finished sorting the clothes).

He thinks I'm an angry asshole for 1) saying we won't be visiting his family for Thanksgiving, and 2) calling him out for not being honest with his family about their behavior and why we won't be visiting in the near future.

He says he's ""not starting a fight,"" and he's ""keeping the peace.""

Am I the asshole for saying 1) I'm not putting myself through that stress again; 2) don't blame the babies for your family's bad behavior (which is exactly what I said).

To be clear, I don't think I'm an asshole for bowing out of the next family function - the difference is I'm happy to say 'nobody wants to put up with my kids and I can't deal with the stress.' But he thinks this isn't fair to his parents.",29,37,0.86
26,Asshole,"I’ve recently gotten a promotion at work. With the salary increase it should help make us a little more comfortable at home (we have a 1 year old) to add onto it. 

Anyways, my wife’s birthday was a few days ago and we had her family over and a few of my family to celebrate the occasion. 

I actually got her a few things (one of them was a household appliance, the rest was personal things for her that she had wanted) the household appliance thing pissed her the hell off by the way. 

So I spent what I would say a reasonable amount of time trying to get her a nice gift, and basically spent a few hundred dollars on her for her birthday. 

Well... when she opened the gifts she was not happy. The look on her face said it all. She made a passive aggressive comment because others took notice of her dislike. It went something like “Oh I was expecting a little more money to go into this” she played if off as not upset in front of people, as soon as they left she confronted me though. 

“Seriously... this is all you got me? Where is that extra money going to go to if you’re going to be cheap with me on my birthday?” Even with the promotion, I was planning not to spend anymore than I usually spend.

27,Not the A-hole,"I was home at around 12:30 at night when there was a knock on my door. 

I was in bed and figured whoever it was had the wrong house (sometimes we get food deliveries for the number opposite ours) so would realize that and move on. 

The knocking kept on for another thirty seconds or so and I started worrying it was my mom who was staying with me and she’d gone out for a smoke and gotten locked out. 

An average looking guy was standing there knocking on my door but looking out at the street. I said basically “can I help you” and he said he’d been carjacked and his phone was in the car and he needed to come in and call someone to get him. 

I took a second to think about this and basically thought to myself “I’ve got my kid and my elderly mom in here. If this were to somehow go bad am I confident I could handle it by myself?” The answer was no. 

So I said through the door basically “listen it’s late and I don’t know you but I’ll tell you what I’ll call 911 for you and you can wait out there.” 

The guy said basically “I don’t know if they’re still around there man you have to let me in I saw his face what if he comes back?” and I said “sorry I can’t do that I can. I call 911 to help you or I can call 911 to have you leave my porch” 

So he said “you’re really not going to let me in?” And I said basically “it’s late and I can call 911 or you can go but no you can’t come in I don’t know you.” And he left. 

My mom was up and was coming over just after this exchange and said “who are you talking to the baby is asleep who’s here” and I explained the situation and she said basically “the guy was carjacked and you didn’t let him in?? That’s wrong. You help a person in need even if it’s inconvenient” and I was like you know I didn’t know him and I’ve got you and (the kid) in here and she said basically “you’ve got to give people the benefit of the doubt. That’s what’s wrong with society today is we won’t open our doors for our neighbors.”

So obviously now having heard that I feel like a total dick.

29,Asshole,"So, the title is probably going to be my wife's takeaway from this. I'd probably phrase it differently but here's the gist.

My wife's sister (SIL from now) is getting married this weekend. She and her partner have been engaged for over a year and have been planning this wedding since.

SIL lives interstate, while most of the family lives around where we do. So on a few occasions she's come down to see us and sort out things like bridal party dresses and whatnot.

This is where the problem sort of starts. My wife is on SIL's bridal party and they're all wearing the same dress. They all bought them months ago and now my wife is telling me that the dress is making her feel uncomfortable. That it makes her feel like an idiot. She's upset because she went to her mother to talk about it and she basically told the day is about SIL, that no one will care what she looks like unless she stands out, which she will if she wears something different.

I tend to agree, the only trouble I'm having is that my wife is 6 months pregnant, and that is contributing to her discomfort. I obviously have some stake in her emotional state and I don't want to make her upset.

So that's that. WIBTA if I told my wife that her feelings about a dress don't matter?

&#x200B;

Edit: I've got the general gist of the judgement. I've been speaking more to my wife since posting, getting the details of everything that's going on.

30,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I don't want my friends to know my family issues.

First some back story - I'm 18F, he's 64M (I'm from his second marriage). When I was around 5 my dad left me, my mother and my 1 year old brother to live and work on the other side of the world for 9 years, where we barely saw him. Of course this was for the good of our family and not really an abandonment thing. When he came back I was 13 and a totally different person. He naturally still treated me like a child, and I already disliked that there was suddenly a new person who was going to be living in our small house forever, so I grew distant.

As the years passed I only grew more and more angry and bitter with him, simply due to the way he was. It wasn't anything too specific, but just the way his personality was. He's nosey, always asking where I've been or who I've been talking to. And when I say it's none of your business, he gets even more inquisitive as to why I'm ""shutting him out"" when in reality I just hate coming home to a line of questioning.
He seems genuinely confused why I don't treat him the same way I treat my mum, who's basically my best friend, when it's pretty obvious to me. He hasn't been around to develop that bond, and he doesn't seem to understand that everything he does is very very annoying.
Imagine you go into the kitchen to make coffee (he sits out there because there's no other space for his computer) and all you get is ""what are you making? Do you need a spoon? Isn't it too late for coffee? Do you need me to turn on the light?"" While he also leans over your shoulder for fuck knows why.

I just want him to leave me alone, but he doesn't seem to get why. He comes into my room unannounced, when I go up there to get away from him, and constantly berates me. He really wants me to be a nurse, when I wouldn't do that job in a million years, then complains that I'm a lazy good for nothing spoilt child. 

If it helps I recently learnt I have ADHD, and I was also told he has high functioning Aspergers, so that could possibly be a factor of our constant fighting? Or it may be personality. 

Basically I see family like coworkers or roommates; you aren't obligated to like them or even really pretend you do. To me family doesn't mean anything, if I don't like you then I don't consider you family and will cut you out ASAP. This might be a harsh but it's the way I am. He tries to counter this by saying he's my father and I can't treat him the way I do, but to me that title doesn't mean a thing. 

Tldr I just want to know if I'm the asshole for being cold towards him when everything he does and says makes me want to scream.",17,41,0.87
31,Not the A-hole,"I feel terribly after what happened this weekend reddit, but I need you guys to judge me honestly so here it goes. 

My friend group in college went out to the bar this weekend, and one of my friends (Katy) got super wasted.  Halfway through the night she became so drunk she could barely walk on her own. I was a little buzzed, but I never get that drunk.  Unfortunately she became the target of unwanted advances from creepy guys and our friend group decided it was for the best if someone took her home now and made sure she was alright.  

I live only a block away from her apartment and I said I would and I left with Katy.  I will be openly honest that I have a big crush on Katy, she's smart, funny and really pretty.  On the way back she wanted me to give her a piggyback ride since she couldn't walk so I did for awhile and halfway home I got tired and let her down and she held my hand/leaned on me the rest of the way back.

When we got to her place, she started vomiting profusely.  I held her hair back for her and cleaned the vomit off her face/hair before telling her she should get to sleep.  She then said no please stay with me, I'm feeling terrible, just stay the night.  I knew I should have left but I caved to my instincts and stayed.  She cuddled up against me in bed and rested her head on my shoulder before falling in a deep sleep.  I feel asleep soon after.

The next morning she freaks out and calls me many names and said I shouldn't have stayed over no matter what.  She says she's sorry for her behavior last night but I should have just made sure she got back home and left.  I told her I was sorry, and I just wanted to make sure she was alright and nothing happened last night.  She says she understands, and that she knows I didn't do anything, but still said it was extremely gross and innapropiate that we shared a bed.

She then stopped talking completely for now.  AITA?",837,1454,0.96

33,Not the A-hole,"Backstory. I worked at an agency, (one that helped military vets), and I met a guy that started talking to me because he heard I was a Marine veteran.  We made small talk and he let me know he was a former Marine as well, so of course we hit it off.  Now I didnt think much of it because this guy knew his stuff...weapons, different units, deployments, he knew the info better than I did.  Fast forward a year later...I was on his Facebook for some reason and noticed there wasnt a single picture of him in uniform, (very odd as most military vets have something to show as they are usually proud of their time in).  I asked him about it and he says...""My Mom doesnt like seeing pictures of me from when I was in so I dont post them).  The wheels started spinning now, but i let it go for now.  Fast forward some more and I'm at a bar where my coworker happened to work before he served.  Got to talking to one of the workers and they told me some info about this person...said hes a compulsive liar, and that he worked there during dates that coincided with his military service.  Again, the wheels are spinning but I still dropped it as he was considered a pretty close friend now.  It wasnt until I was talking to another friend one night that i found out guy in question used to date his sister.  Apparently he told her he was a Marine as well but she worked for a National Archives agency and she looked up his info to find he never did serve. 

I'm heated.  Hes now been a good friend of mine for over a year and he works at an agency that heavily benefits military veterans.  I couldnt let this go on any longer as I am extremely against false valor.  I brought it up to my boss and an investigation insued.  They of course found him to be lying and immediately terminated him.  Our workplace also notified all other workplaces in the state about him and he eventually moved out of state due to not being hireable.

34,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half. He let me know early on that he has a daughter from a previous relationship that he has full custody of (his daughter’s mother is nowhere in the picture and never has been).

We’re both guys (not relevant), and his daughter is 14.

I was introduced to his daughter 6 months into our relationship. She’s never really liked me.

I’d try to be nice to her and talk to her but she never really responded to me.

My boyfriend said that she’s a little shy, and he asked me to be patient with her.

She ignored me for a while and then she started to be very rude. She would make offhanded comments about me, insult me, and told me that I was “using” her dad (?). She made a lot of baseless assumptions that weren’t true.

My boyfriend never took any disciplinary steps. He only ever explained why what she said was inappropriate / mean and that she shouldn’t say things like that, but he’s never asked her to apologize to me and he’s never grounded her.

When I approached my boyfriend about the issue, he said that his daughter was having issues coping with another person (me) being in the equation, as its only really been him and her for a majority of her life. (She sees a therapist for her issues).

I’ve had to put up with the constant insults and accusations for a year. I don’t care that she doesn’t like me, but it was getting tiring.

It happened again last night. I was having dinner with them at my boyfriend’s place and she made another offhanded comment.

I snapped and told her that her dad was likely to abandon her or something if she kept trying to push everyone else away from him and keep him to herself, that he won’t be able to put up with her forever and that she should just get over herself.

She started crying and then she went up to her room. I hadn’t intended to make her cry or anything (and I kinda feel bad for that), but I didn’t know how else to get my point across in a way that she would understand.

I’ve never seen my boyfriend get upset before that moment. He asked what was wrong with me, and told me what I said was uncalled for. I told him that it *wasn’t* because she had been provoking me for a year now. It was bound to happen.

This was probably unnecessary, but it was a heat of the moment, and I told him that her awful behavior was his fault because he does nothing to fix it, and that he should stop sheltering her so much because she really needs to grow up.

He told me that I was being childish and he went upstairs to comfort his daughter. I ended up just going home after that, and he hasn’t responded to any of my texts yet. It’s almost been 24 hours.

Maybe I didn’t have to be so harsh, but I really didn’t want to be disrespected anymore. I’ve considered sending an apology to my boyfriend, but I feel like an apology isn’t necessary if I was right. AITA?",181,58,0.72
35,Not the A-hole,"I moved into an apartment where there is a shared living space in the middle, and bedrooms on either side, i have my own room, and he shares a room with another roomate, but they are never here so they aren't part of the equation. My roomate, lets call him jon, has his xbox in the living area, with the tv against the wall that is shared with my bedroom and he stands 2 feet from it when he plays. The problem is that he seems to have anger issues and will literally scream and curse at the tv, without a headset on, he's talking to himself, screaming at the tv. So essentially during the day when he is playing he is screaming at my wall like a 12 year old who just learned to swear. It has gotten to the point that the people above us, below us, and across the hall have texted me complaining and knocked on the door asking him to stop. He will apologize and go right back to screaming until he is out of breath and his face is red. Management of the apartment refuses to step in in any way.

I am the name on the internet bill, and with the agreement we have he wouldnt pay towards the internet for the first few months since the lease reimburses a certain amount to go towards internet, so we worked it out so i would just pay the full amount monthly until the lease stopped reimbursing, then we would split the bill.

The same day I received the request, I also got another job offer and consequently resigned. The decision was not related, but did affect my notice period that I was originally going to give (from 3 weeks to 1 week which is the minimum).

I work security: my job entails stopping cards, and confirming that everyone who goes on site is supposed to be there.

He started 2 weeks ago, and I had just gotten in.  My bus drops me off at ~6pm, so I just get set up and play on my phone until my shift starts.

So first day with him, I'm still getting changed (PPE, steel toes, and tossing a work shirt on), and he's already packed and out the door.  I mention that his shift ends at 6:30, and just get ""I know"" as a response.

Today I get in earlier, ~5:55.  He packs up, waits for me to finish getting ready, and a car drives up.  He mentions that it's my first car, but he'll cover for me.

The split between us was very civil. There were no court battles, arguments, or disdain. We were young when we got married and we did not understand what we were getting into. Sure, there is hurt, but we have each moved on. She has remarried. I have not.

Her family was always very open and heartwarming to me. I was always included and inspired from them.

45,Not the A-hole,"The backstory: I love my niece, I really do, but she can be a real handful. She's cost myself and my partner thousands of dollars in damage to our property (pouring stuff down the dry cleaner vent, holes in the walls, broken phones, smashing heirlooms, etc). I understand you have to watch young kids, but I do. I even get criticised for keeping a close eye on them. And the majority of the damage has been done when her parents were present.

We had to look after her for 2 weeks. We discussed with her parents ahead of time about this issue and cleared it with them that, if she broke something, she would ""work it off"" in an age appropriate way.

&#x200B;

It wasn't long before she broke a few things, including cutting up a stress ball and hiding the evidence. It wasn't worth much to us, but could have been toxic if our pets had found it before we did. We had her sweep the bathroom floor (she did an amazing job), clean the walls near the light switches, and the last job was to clean the toilet.

&#x200B;

The toilet situation: Absolutely NO harsh chemicals like bleach were used, I'm allergic to them. While my partner was putting on gloves for her, I did a thorough clean of the toilet, including sanitising the seat. I switched out the toilet brush for a clean and unused one afterwards. Her cleaning amounted to us pouring in the toilet cleaner, her bobbing the brush up and down a few times, and a single wipe of the seat. We gave her calm guidance, and monitored her the whole time, including for any sign of distress. She was apprehensive at first, but handled it like a pro! Afterwards she was so proud of herself, we praised her, and thought it went well.

&#x200B;

The aftermath: She told her parents that she learnt how to clean a toilet. They blew up. We couldn't explain that it was clean, no bleach, that it wasn't out of anger. They said it was child abuse.

I got really upset that I could have hurt her without realising it. I went onto parenting sites to see age appropriate chores. All I could find on cleaning toilets is that it shouldn't be for ages <10 if harsh chemicals are used, given the danger there. Now I'm confused and upset. I had thought that it went well, we were able to drop the issue without anger or frustration, she took a lot more care of our stuff afterwards, and she seemed really proud and happy with herself.

47,Not the A-hole,"I  order food delivery 1-2 times a month when I’m at work using a well known food delivery app. As part of the ordering/payment option you choose what tip to give. As I have an odd request for delivery (requires driver to park and then walk to my location, as I can’t leave the immediate area where I work) I always leave a good tip (20-25%, and my orders are usually in the $150 range as I’m ordering for a group). Well, the last 10 times I’ve ordered the driver has not brought the entire order. Usually one entree or multiple appetizers are missing. As work is hectic I don’t usually have the chance to check the order when it shows up, and only find out when things slow down and I have time to eat. I think the driver should be checking the order before they leave the restaurants, but they clearly are not. Tonight really pissed me off because the driver told me as he was giving me my food that the restaurant called while he was on route to deliver to say they had not given him an item and I would need to call the restaurant or the app customer service to pursue a refund.

So my new plan is to leave the lowest tip the app will allow and put in the order comment that I will pay the rest of the tip in cash when they show up with my entire order. WIBTA for this plan?

EDIT: I expected to get a bit of an education about how the delivery system actually works, as I thought there would be some drivers who would comment.

So today I was running some errands, and one of my stops was the bank in a local strip mall. As I approached the bank, there was an older lady (60s?) with a dog that was wearing a green vest labelled ""Service Dog in Training"".  An older gentlemen (also 60s?) was yelling at her. My curiosity was piqued. I stood a respectable distance back, but close enough to see and hear what was going on. And I watched.

The man was up in her face yelling about how both she and her dog are divas, and this is an open space and his dog can do what he wants if he's not hurting anyone. The lady was yelling back that it's a service dog in training and she asked him to keep his distance.

(I got here after the incident that caused the yelling happened, but I suspect that the man's dog approached the woman's service dog in training and she asked him to give her space, causing this blow up).

Anyways after a few minutes of yelling they both noticed me standing there. I was clearly engrossed in their altercation and my pose and distance made that obvious. I got asked what I was doing and said, ""Um, listening to you guys yell.""

61,Not the A-hole,"I [28M] have considered going to Ohio for Thanksgiving this year to spend it with my dad [56M] and extended family. I live in Tennessee and my dad moved back to Ohio a few years ago to be near his parents and siblings as they age, plus my sisters and I are all grown and scattered about. So I’ve seen my dad maybe 7-8 times in the last 3 years, and even though we aren’t super close, we get along and I love the old man.

We also have one big thing in common: football. I grew up watching Ohio State games with my dad every fall. We’d always grill out and have a great time, but I haven’t been able to watch a single game with him since he moved away. Because of this, and upon discovering the Ohio State-Michigan game (biggest game of the season for either team) falls on Thanksgiving weekend, I thought that would be a perfect time for my daughter [6F] and I to make a trip up.

This past Friday rolls around and my younger sister Liddy [20F] calls me to chat. I hadn’t made any decisions about Ohio at this point, just some general thoughts on the idea, but I figured she might want to go if she didn’t have any other plans. So I ask her if she’d go if I finalize plans.

Well, turns out my 3 sisters were out to dinner a few weeks ago and Abby [25F] tells the other 2 that our mom [56F] is planning to use Thanksgiving for her wedding reception with her new fiancée [~65M] because she anticipates us all being there.

This rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons.

-She plans to commandeer a big holiday to make it about her and her marriage.

-She only told Abby and the rest of us only know because she’s spilling the beans (because Abby wasn’t told to spread this news).

-She expects us to be there without clearing it with us first. I have two kids, Abby and Liddy have serious boyfriends, and Annie [30F] is almost always traveling, so you have to let us know this type of stuff well in advance.

Those things alone are reasons for me to not want to go, but she’s also onto her 4th marriage. She has made it increasingly clear over the last year that she isn’t super seriously in love with the guy, just that he’s got acceptable qualities and she’s lonely and needs financial stability. So we never expected a reception or anything notable in the first place.

As soon as Liddy told me about this, I decided to finalize plans to go to Ohio for Thanksgiving. I was probably going to do it anyway, but the way my mom is handling this whole marriage/holiday thing, I’d rather just not be around. 

So AITA for going all-in on my plans to make sure I’m not around on my mom’s “special day?”",17,39,0.91

Recently she saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. Apparently she’s super scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough to make her jittery. 

Luckily most people voted that the spider stays, but a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign of poor housekeeping etc. I must admit I was a little peeved at this, especially because we are a pet friendly workspace and Michelle’s own dog comes in to work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and Michelle doesn’t bother keeping her on a leash or anything.

My boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, I straight up refused and told him he wouldn’t ask Michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a LOT less threatening than a poorly behaved dog. He ultimately agreed and since then all she’s done is go on about how I don’t care about her feelings and that I must enjoy watching her suffer.",2055,11957,0.9

70,Not the A-hole,"First ever Reddit post, hopefully this is right. 

For background info, my stepsister and I have been related ever since I was ~2 years old. Her and I don’t have a great relationship whatsoever, and she purposely does things to hurt me and piss me off.

My stepsister and I have been going to school together since middle school after I moved in with my dad and stepmom. Ever since we entered high school, she had started this thing where she refuses to get out of bed in the mornings, despite me waking her up constantly. It’s not something I want to do, but it’s only to help out my parents  (who will be late to work if they have to drive us to school). She gets mad at me, yells at me, throws a fit, all that stuff. Normally, I would understand why she’d be cranky, as when I’m being forced to wake up at 6 a.m. I’m pretty cranky too. Although, there’s this huge difference between the two of us. She likes to stay up all night blasting the television or talking on the phone while I prefer to go to bed at a decent time. Another thing is, she likes to constantly cause a ruckus and keep the rest of me and our family up while we are trying to sleep. I try to get over it, but I’m downright tired of being forced to fall asleep much later than I need to, and then having to deal with her berating me when I wake her up much later than I actually get up. Not only that, but our bus arrives around 6:30, it normally takes ~10 minutes for any normal person to get dressed and have time to gather their belongings and grab a bite to eat. Instead, she locks herself in the bathroom the entire time and refuses to let me take the two minutes I need to brush my hair, brush my teeth, and take a quick pee when I need to. Just this morning she locked herself in the bathroom the entire time and refused to let me in, and subsequently she was angry with *me* when she missed the bus because I “woke her up too late.” I didn’t even get a chance to wash up this morning and had to go to school looking like I just stumbled out of the morgue because I woke her up and she decided that she didn’t want to get ready because I “woke her up too early.”

I’m extremely tired of having her berate me for not waking her up earlier (which would mean I have to wake up earlier) but then having her complain at the same time that I wake her up too early. She has tons of alarm clocks, she just refuses to use them. I’m thinking of just telling her to wake herself up if she keeps treating me like shit because of it.

TL;DR: My stepsister gets mad at me for waking her up for school in the morning. WIBTA if I tell her to start waking herself up if she’s going to treat me like shit when I’m only trying to make sure she gets to school?",39,35,0.92
71,Not the A-hole,"This happened a long time ago, but I was prompted to remember it thanks to a post I recently saw in another subreddit, and now I can't help but wonder if I was the asshole.   


I used to be a server. Once, when someone had given me their credit card, I saw that they had written ""CID"" on the back. Having never seen it before, I asked what it meant. They explained that they had their card stolen one time, and no one ever bothered to check the signature and the thief spent a ton of their money. So they started writing ""CID"" on the back in the hopes that people would check if it ever happened again, but no one ever did. I felt bad for the guy, and I remembered that, so I started making a point to check people's cards and ask for their IDs any time I saw it. If I could stop some asshole from stealing a guy's credit card, I liked to think I would.  


Most of the time, this was fine. I even earned a lot of praise and extra tips for it by people who were pleased that someone *finally* asked (it's apparently *extremely* uncommon). Then one day, I see it on the back of a card given to me by a couple I had hit it off extremely well with. Much to my shock, the couple told me the ID was left at home. I don't honestly think they were lying. The name matched what she had been calling him, and they didn't seem to sweat it too much, apologizing a bit but otherwise unfazed.   


But if I asked for the ID and they didn't present it, what was the point? It seemed like, if I was just going to run the card anyway if they didn't have ID, then I was as bad as anyone else who didn't bother to check. I asked for an alternate method of payment. They kinda laughed uncomfortably, like they couldn't believe I was asking. Honestly, I couldn't either, but I didn't foresee it being a big deal. They didn't have another method of payment. At this point, I almost wish I would have just run it, but I didn't really know what to do and I had already taken it way further than I had ever intended. So I told them I'd hold on to the card while they ran home to get their IDs or another form of payment (I didn't want to let them leave without paying the bill- they had already eaten the food).   


They did, and I kept the card. When they came back, cash in hand, they were furious. They never said anything to my manager, but I certainly didn't get tipped. I kept checking the back of IDs after that, but at that point, it was more habit than anything. I don't know if I'd ever stop someone again after such an unpleasant experience. All I know is I very quickly went from feeling sympathetic towards people who wrote that on their cards to hating them.   


So everybody, AITA?",133,349,0.95
72,No A-holes here,"I’m 22 and have been living on my own for 4 years but I still listen to my parents say because of their life experience and reasonable thinking.

78,Asshole,"So my wife gave birth 8 months ago. During he pregnancy she was having trouble sleeping so I bought her a pregnancy body pillow that was a lot more comfortable for her. However even after giving birth she prefers sleeping with the body pillow rather than me. She just says she's used to it and finds it more comfortable to sleep with. Maybe I'm being just being dramatic but it feels like she just doesn't want to sleep with me. I'm often sleeping near the edge of the bed using a separate blanket and I just feel a lot more lonely. 


I brought all this up with her and she told me that I'm ""being more of a baby than our new born"" with all this and to just deal with it. This led to a big fight where we were both yelling at each other. I don't think either of us said anything particularly hurtful but it's not the norm in our relationship to raise our voices like we did and argue for as long as we did.  

Outside of this our relationship is more or less fine. I mean I obviously still love her and I'm sure she still loves me. 

Basically AITA for starting an argument over something like this?


This is the pillow I bought (removed link since people think I'm trying to sell the pillows lol)- 

https://imgur.com/a/fGeD2N0 (Please click this link before commenting, I think some people have misunderstood what I meant as body pillow. The one she has is more like 2 body pillows + a regular pillow) 


e: Some people seem to think that I'm jealous of the pillow. This isn't the case. I don't think she loves a pillow more than me. I just would prefer we sleep together and not with a pillow between us.

e2: I didn't think this was relevant but just so you guys know we have a nanny that takes care of the child from Sunday - Thursday. We both take turns on Friday and Saturday nights when we have to so it's not like I'm expecting her to do everything. 

Also I am not asking her to cuddle with me all night or let me spoon her or vice versa. I just would like it if there wasn't a pillow between us.

81,Asshole,This happened yesterday and I don’t know if I was in the wrong or not. I (24 F) was at Macy’s shopping for a perfume for my mom. When I was there I noticed an employee who would alway get a bit closer to me when I would go to a different aisle. At first I didn’t think much of it and just continued looking around. What started to piss me off was when she kept asking if “I needed help” or “if I found anything I liked” every five minutes. I would alway give her a fake smile and just walk away somewhere else. I decided to look at the Mac makeup for a bit and there she was again pretending to clean around the makeup aisles. At this point I had enough and asked her if she had a problem. She looked at me confused and asked me what I meant. At this point I started raising my voice at her and told her that she needs to stop following me around and if she thought I was stealing from the store. She looked at me scared and said “sorry” before she ran off. I told my friend about this and she told me that it’s their job to ask customers “if they needed any help” and that I was a major bitch.

82,Not the A-hole,"Firstly, all my friends and aquaintance know I have a pretty strong anti-drug stance. You wanna do it that's your own perogative, but I don't want it around me. Side note, I also live in a place that weed is legalized. 

I (30F) have a friend (34M) crashing in my guest room while he tries to find his own place. He's been here 9.5 weeks and I've charged him a total $500 to stay here (monthly I pay $1400 rent + approx $100 utilities). I knew he smoked occassionally but up until now he's been respectful of my rules and doing it far from the house. 

I have a 5 year old dog and make everyone aware that rottweilers are food hounds so please do not leave things out.

So today I was getting ready for work. I got out of the shower and was going to take my dog for a walk. When I come across a chocolate bar on the ground that has close to a third eaten. I pick it up to inspect and realize its an edible, and as an added bonus the top ingredient is cocoa. (Cocoa is also quite toxic to dogs).

One square is the dosage for a person, and my dog has eaten 3 squares. 

I angrily text my roommate and first his only response is wondering how he got it (dude you leave your door wide open and everything is thrown around your room, it's a wonder it took this long tbh). 

He finally replies not to worry, that the dosage is low and the chocolate will at most make him poop. Meanwhile my vet is telling me to bring him down, that they can see him immediately. 

I obviously take my dog to the vet, fuming that my roommate is still downplaying it like it's no big deal. He actually seems more peeved that my dog ate his stash. I am upfront that he is the one paying most or all of the vet bill. 

He and a couple of friends are ganging up on me saying that I overreacted and didn't need to go to the vet (sorry I've never experienced this before?) And that I should have waited it out instead. That he isn't responsible for what my dog does.

EDIT

83,Not the A-hole,"My roommate is a slob and I’m a neat freak. Prior to her moving in, I wasn’t aware of this. 

I had done my due diligence in setting clear boundaries and making sure we were on the same page when it came to cleanliness around the apartment. She assured me there would be no problems and that she takes cleanliness very seriously as well. 

For the past month, she has been leaving her dirty gym shoes in the front hall. Normally, I wouldn’t have a problem with this, it is a shared space after all, but her shoes smell like an animal died in them. I don’t think it’s fair to subject your roommates to unpleasant smells. 

I’ve asked her multiple times over the course of the month to either keep the shoes in her room, clean them, get a new pair, or to just ensure in some way, shape, or form that they don’t stink up our entire apartment. I’ve even texted her some life hacks that she can use to deodorize her shoes. 

She has blatantly been ignoring my requests despite telling me that she’ll take care of it. They smell horrible, so I’m assuming that’s why she hasn’t bothered keeping them in her room. She knows how rancid they are. 

My friends have stopped coming over while my roommate is at home because they can’t deal with the smell either. Unless I stay in my room with a heavily scented candle, I can’t stand staying in my own apartment. 

I made a post a while ago where I posed the question of throwing her shoes out the window. Everyone clearly noted I would be TA and so I decided not to mess with her property. A lot of people mentioned putting them in a bag or dealing with them some other way. However, I didn’t think this was a viable option because that would just enable her to do whatever she pleases because she knows I’ll end up dealing with it my own way in the end while she gets away scot-free. 

I ordered a poop spray from amazon and a pair of slippers. I proceeded to spray nearly half the bottle on the pair of slippers until they smelled just as rancid as my roommate’s gym shoes. I left them in the front hall right next to her shoes. 

Sure enough, when she came out of her room to go to the gym, she noticed the horrible smell and banged on my door to get rid of them. I have decided to just leave them there to give her a taste of her own medicine. 


AITA?

EDIT: for everyone telling me to put her nasty shoes in her room myself, I can’t do that because we keep our rooms locked. I’m guessing she doesn’t want to keep them in her room because she knows how horrible they smell.",501,3689,0.97

86,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago, but I just remembered it when I saw another post about bar seating on this sub.

I went to a bar by myself one night. When I got inside, I realized it was more crowded than I was expecting - the bar was full and there were people hanging out behind the bar standing around. I almost left because I really wanted a calmer place to hang out and have a drink, but I realized there weren’t many good options in the neighborhood so I decided to stay.

While I was ordering a drink, I noticed there was an empty chair at the bar - there were a few bags resting on it, but no one sitting there. There was a group of girls standing nearby, so I guessed that the bags belonged to them. I asked the nearest girl whether anyone was sitting in that seat and she said “no”. Then I asked, would you move your bag so I can sit down? And she said “no” again. I argued with her a little bit but it was clear she wasn’t going to budge so I dropped it. Luckily, another bar seat opened up after a few minutes so I got to sit down anyway.

I felt like it was rude of this group to take up a bar seat in a crowded bar just so they didn’t have to hold their bags. Standing is no big deal if you’re in a group, but it’s pretty awkward and uncomfortable if you’re alone (as I was). But I told a friend about it and she thought it was reasonable to claim a “bag chair”. After all, the bags would have been taking up some standing room if the group had held them - and the standing room was crowded too. So, who was in the right here? Was I an AH for asking them to move the bags? Were they AH’s for refusing to move the bags?

“I always sit there.”
-“Oh well... it won’t bother you if you sat somewhere else wouldn’t it?”

The kid suddenly starts screaming for his mother and she came ASAP. The kid told her in tears that we ‘stole’ his favorite place and pushed him away while doing so (we didn’t even touched him). His mother comforted him and told us with a painfully forced smile that they always sat there since he was a baby and that it was ‘their special spot’. I politely told her that i wasn’t planning on moving since we had this table first. The kid starts screaming, letting himself fall on the floor while his mother started to yell at us for being ‘rude and unreasonable people’ and that her son is autistic and doesn’t likes changes. People were now looking at us and quickly the manager came. They clearly knew each other and the mother started to say that they were loyal customers, coming every 2 Friday nights since the birth of her son and that she wouldn’t be throwing a fit if the manager didn’t just banned all those rude young people. 

The dad just stood there and glared a bit at us but that’s it. After a couple of minutes they left while pulling the kid out of the place. 

My friend told me that we just had to move to another table to avoid such thing since autistic kids/people will get frustrated if things don’t go their way.

A friend of mine (Vincent) decided he liked it also and went out and got it done (poorly i might add!) at the time i was pissed of because if we both had it, and he had it first it would appear that i was copying/imitating him, or we was part of some sort of 2 man gang and the tattoo was our initiation! 

Fast forward 3 years and Vincent had became a part of the local white power movement and we lost touch pretty fast, he went out and had more tattoos added to his back, Swastikas and various other symbols of hate but he had the tattooist merge the images so it seemed like one big piece over multiple small tattoos!

He then went and died of 'misadventure' (Uk's fancy way of saying accidental drug overdose) and about  4 years have past.

Our bathroom smells of it and it makes me sick, but on his skin it amplifies and it smells like straight up cotton candy vomit.

100,No A-holes here,"My partner and I have finally decided to officially get married. We decided that we really wanted to do it next year for a milestone anniversary - however, before we had officially told anyone, my partner's brother announced his engagement. Awesome news, and they're both so excited - as are we! They will also be getting married next year, with my partner and I as best-man/maid-of-honour.

Part of what my partner and I had been discussing - and the reason we're taking so long to say anything - is the fact that neither of us want a lot of fuss over our nuptials.

101,Not the A-hole,"I  (17F) am aware I have a fantastic life. I will graduate high school  this year will likely not have any problems paying for college. I have  never faced any major hardships in my life. I have a stable, supportive  family. I am very grateful for my life.

My  cousin (26F) did not grow up like I did. Her dad lost his job when she  was in high school and the whole family (5 people + her pregnant sister)  had to survive on a Chicago public school teacher's salary. On top of  that, she got cancer when she was 17 and almost died. Then she got  cancer again when she was 19. My parents didn't even tell me when she  got cancer (I was 8) because they thought it would traumatize me.

I  always looked for her approval as a kid. But over time, her attitude  towards me started to change. When I was about 10 I started to hear her  talk with her sister about how awful my dad is and how he 'walks around  their house and acts like it's a shithole' and how he 'gives everyone in  \[my cousin's\] family unsolicited financial advice.' I felt a bit upset  that she was saying these things about my dad, but I didn't say  anything.

One day she took me to  the zoo and mentioned how her first job was there. I asked her about it,  and then she (in my view, rudely) told me to go get a job so I could  understand. But then she followed up with ""well, I guess you'll never  even need one. Your dad can buy you everything.""

My  parents have been telling her to get a job or go to college for several  years. They say that since she is almost five years cancer-free, she  needs to think about moving forward with her life. College, job, own  place, etc. She cries every time anyone talks to her about any of that.

I  know she's had a very rough life compared to mine, but I feel like she  hates me. The last straw came when I was accepted to a prestigious  summer writing program for high school students. She insisted on  accompanying us on the drive there, but spent the whole 3 hours in the  car talking about how w*hen she was my age, she had cancer. Her life could have been something completely different if she'd had my opportunities.* She said *she  was a much more devoted writer than I was, but life just hates her and I  would never understand because I'm 'a privileged rich kid.'*

When I returned from the camp and started to work on my college essays, she made another one of those '*I could have gone to college but CANCER had other plans; you're lucky you have a dad to buy your college'*  comments. I said I work very hard and I'm just a teen trying to do my  best in school and I didn't deserve her comments or guilt.

103,No A-holes here,"So my (35m) wife (35f) and I moved to her home country (medium income  country) around 2 years ago. My in-laws moved from the capital to the  province (1h flight) a long time ago and they had a house in the capital  that was unoccupied. Legally, the house has been transferred many years  ago to my wife but my in-laws still treat it as their house. We take  care of all taxes and costs related to the house (around 10k USD/year).  Half a year ago, my mother-in-law got really sick and my wife asked her  to come over to our place as medical care in the capital is way better  than in the provinces. She got diagnosed with late stage cancer and has  started treatment. My wife is her main caretaker and basically had to  pause her life to take care of her. She had been with us ever since and  probably has made up her mind she will stay here for years to come. My  wife and mother-in-law never had a good relationship and her being in  the house has put a lot of stress on everyone. On top of that my  father-in-law now drops by whenever he wants, sometimes staying up to  two weeks with us and treating it as his house. He has a business in the  province so can't stay with his wife here in the capital as the bills  needs to get paid. The business is not doing so well so we save him  quite a lot of money by taking care of the house upkeep that previously  was paid by him. However having my mother-in-law living in with us has  become unsustainable. So either we move out, leaving them with the house  costs and the care of my mother-in-law (which will be difficult as she  can't join my father-in-law in the province due to unavailability of  medical treatment and he can't join her here because of the business).  Or our preferred solution is to put my mother-in-law in an apartment  nearby with a caretaker (paid by us) and my wife checking on her  regularly on her. We all save money in that way and we can go back to a  healthier relationship with my in-laws. But you could also see it as  basically kicking out my mother-in-law out of her own house.. what do  you think? Reasonable request or assholes?",18,45,0.91

And when they finally gave my money I was at school and my mother said that she'll get it for me and I was okay with that but when I my mother came home she gave me only 450 dollars (keep in mind I was supposed to get 1200$) and I asked where is the rest of it she said 'I spent it on taxes and what house needed' and I said that's okay but you should've asked me before spending 700 percent of my money and she went nuts about how she was spending all her money on us without complaining about anything and how I didn't need that much money and I said you should have just asked and she is acting like I am the asshole now

110,Not the A-hole,"I've been involved in fasting for weight loss and health benefits for almost two years. I genuinely believe that fasting is an underused resource and have read scientific studies that prove there are numerous health benefits related to fasting. I myself have completed numerous water fasts, my longest being a twenty day supervised retreat. Fasting has helped me with a skin condition and has also helped me manage my weight. 

I belong to a Facebook group for water fasters. The group is moderated by a man who promotes an electrolyte powder to help you manage energy levels during extended fasts. The group leader promotes this lifestyle as a way to tackle weight problems and *all* health conditions. 

Whilst I believe that fasting can help with issues like psoriasis, acne, and even things like diabetes because it gets insulin levels under control, I do think there is a limit to what can be achieved with fasting. People post on the group about their goals and often share progress pictures about weight loss and improvements to health. The community is really encouraging but treat fasting and the electrolyte powder as this sacred thing that can't be criticised. Medicine is treated like poison and doctors are hated in the group. There's a big thing about how pharmaceutical companies don't want us to know about the secret of fasting or we'd all be able to heal ourselves and they'd make no money- I believe this to an extent but I think there is a line. 

Recently, a man joined the group and posted an accountability thread. He has a brain tumour and is refusing chemotherapy or radiotherapy or surgery. He says he recently discovered the group and the electrolyte powder and the moderator of the group is personally coaching him on his fasting journey. He says he won't be having any medical interventions because he doesn't want to poison his body and after talking to his coach he now understands that doctors don't care about healing him. He believes the surgery will kill him. He's posted pictures of himself and his young children and says he's fasting for them. 

I want to intervene and ask him if he's considered talking his options through with his doctor again but I also don't think it's my place to tell anyone what to do with his body. I just worry that he's drank the kool aid and committed to something that isn't all it's cracked up to be. His fasting coach is very militant as are the rest of the group. He has children he wants to live for and I feel some moral obligation to step in but I'm scared that I'd be crossing a line. I just sincerely don't believe that fasting can cure cancer and while it's a great tool for health a brain tumour won't just go away with fasting.

Her dog is 50 pounds and my own dog is 60 pounds, I live in a 550 sq ft apartment. Watched her dog last year for 7 days and it was incredibly stressful.. her dog peed on my rug and isn't crate trained so anytime I confined her in the bathroom she destroyed the wall frame. Her dog also howled and cried if I tried to contain her somewhere, which I needed to do because of the potty issues. The dog also broke into my food bin and ate half a 25 pound bag of Origen (a very expensive food). I received a verbal thanks but just one ""thanks!"" and it was a hugely inconvenient thing for me.

I really want to say no to my friend. It's just too much, our dogs are both too big and the fact her dog isn't crate trained makes it even more difficult.

128,Not the A-hole,"This is happening today if it matters.

My wife works a 9-5 and I work at home. I'm also a SAHD technically because while I'm working, I contend with our children, 4F and 1F. My wife makes about 25% more than me per year because my work is contract based, not salaried, so some days I work, some days I just hang out with our kids. And when I do work, it's never a ""I need to be doing this at this time"", it's all around deadlines. So I can work while watching the kids at my own pace. It's a system that's odd but it works for us. I only mention all of this because I spend more time with the kids and almost never have time away from them for myself.

Three or four times a year, my wife uses her PTO to visit her parents with our children. They live about five hours away and I always make the drive. Sometimes I join them but it's usually I drive them, come home, then a few days later go pick them up. We live in a city but her parents are in more of a rural place. But they also live in a mansion compared to us. Tennis court, inhome theater, big inground swimming pool, parks aplenty around. It's really fun and therapeutic for my wife and children when they go because I'll admit it's very relaxing.

Yesterday I made that 10hr roundtrip and dropped them off, looking forward to 3 days of being alone. I'm caught up on work, gardening, house maintenance, so these next 3 days are purely for me to relax. I can play my violin which is rare because we have a 1 year old, play videogames, go see a movie. I have a little itinerary planned like I usually do. This is the time I can recharge.

But I got a text while I was asleep last night saying that our eldest 4F is not having fun/being a sourpuss/being a grumpygills that she has to stay there and wants to come home. My wife decides that they should all come home and honestly, I just want my free time. I don't want my kids to associate my parents in laws house with negativity but this is unfair to me to literally drive for 10 hours, sleep for 5 hours, then have to make another 10 hour drive. I told my wife to ""suck it up"" and she'll come around, she's just expressing immediate homesickness and will turn around. This has happened before, just not at this level. Our daughter is having tantrums, etc which is new but I still want to wait it out.

Obviously I haven't said yes or no, just suggested she wait it out but I want to know if I'm being the asshole before I make a final judgment. I'll probably relent but still upset that this is unfair because I haven't had free time alone in months.

134,Asshole,"This really isn't a big deal, but I just wanted to know.

So this friday, me and my family were watching TV and saw an ad for a new episode of the show ""Ninja Warrior"". Our country's version of this show is fairly new, im not sure how long its there in the US.

Someone (not sure who) asked what season this is, and I said 2 and my dad agreed. My brother said it was the 3rd season and we told him it isn't. We told him it isn't and argued a bit, and right before I opened up google to see it, my mom said as a joke we should bet on it.

I said let's bet for a chocolate bar, and my dad, who knew I was right, told my brother we should bet on principle (I googled it and I think it's called ""Gentlemen's bet"", sorry, translating this from the original conversation is weird). My brother insisted he was right and was very confident, and I told him if he's so sure lets bet on the chocolate bar. He agreed even though my dad didn't like it.

I googled it, and to no surprise, it was the 2nd season, my brother tried to argue and claim it wasn't and how he remembers it's the 3rd season, and I told him that if he can't prove it, then I won the bet.

A few minutes later, when we were at the kitchen, I went to take the chocolate bar he had from his drawer, and my parents told me not to, and that I shouldn't take it from him. (probably cause he's young and they felt bad)

I insisted that I won the bet, and even though he doesn't accept it, I proved there were only 2 season. After some convincing, eventually my brother agreed even though he didnt think there were 2 seasons. My parents were still unhappy with it, but knew its my brother's decision. I ate the chocolate bar.

&#x200B;

To me it looks like I won fairly, and that I actually taught him a lesson about losing, and that he's got to know he's gonna lose some bets in life, where my parents won't be there to help. Later, when I talked to my friends they said it's a bit asshole-ish because it's his chocolate bar and he's a 10 year old boy.

Just for quick background, I've had bulimia since 15 (I'm F26 now) but I also suffer with depression. This group is mainly meant for people with depression and panic disorders, though a lot of attendees also have different addictions.

So last week I was talking about the cycle of recovery-relapse in eating disorders and compared that to alcoholism, except the fact that people take alcoholism more seriously. One of the guys disagreed because he has issues with alcohol abuse and he said that you can get cured of eating disorders, but not alcoholism, since it's often also genetic and damages your brain.

In the end we argued briefly because I thought he was being ignorant. You can't permanently cure eating disorders either most of the time and if you ask me, it's even worse because you can't live without food (you can live without alcohol though). He just doesn't understand that because he's never had an ED.

But then when I thought about it, I never had a drinking problem, so maybe I'm being ignorant by comparing these two.

My comment wasn't even meant to attack people with alcoholism, I just wanted to compare two similar addictions in my opinion that are taken in different ways in society.

We would hang out every other weekend and sometimes after work. Having fun and enjoying each others company.

A few months ago he came to work without saying hello. Something that's good to mention is that I work as a receptionist, so when you leave and come to work, you walk pass me.   
At first I was a bit confused, but didn't think much of it until he, on that same day, avoided me. He would walk pass me quickly and not even look at my direction, ignore me and just go out.  
This happened for a few days and I always called him after work to make sure he was OK, I started getting worried that maybe something had happened that made him sad or so. When we talked on the phone, he was normal. 

As time went by this started happening more and more frequently. Some days he would treat me like a stranger and some days he was back to normal again. This was really hurting me. For a long time I tried to tell myself and think ''Don't take it personally, maybe he's just going through something behind closed doors''. But no, I quickly realized that he was doing this specifically towards me.  
He would treat me like a stranger but with other coworkers, he was himself. Happy, talkative and basically himself. Even to coworkers he barely talked to! And I'm supposed to be one of his closest friends?

We could sometimes hang out on the weekends and as soon as Monday came around, we were back at square 1. Even if he took the initiative to ask me to hang out.

I've tried talking to him about this SEVERAL times, at least 5 times. Telling him how it really hurts me, asking him why, asking him if I've done something and I always got the same answer.  
''I have nothing to be mad about, you haven't done anything''. He would literally laugh and try to sweep it under the rug every time so I eventually gave up.

One day I just looked at him and didn't say hello, he looked me like something was wrong with me and said ''what?'' in a pretty rude way. I then snapped and asked him ''what the fuck is wrong with you? You've been acting like a dick'' in an aggressive tone, but I wasn't loud at all. He has used this as an excuse for his behavior even tho he has done this SO MANY TIMES before I snapped.

This started bothering me so much that I took a step back.

Now days we don't hang out or talk. I've yet to know what I've done wrong. I've been nothing but nice to him. Every time he wanted company for anything, I was there, If he was out late and wasn't able to get home he slept at my place, I helped him clean his house voluntarily for the sake of making it easier for him and I could go on and on.

139,Not the A-hole,"This is going to be a bit of a whirlwind, but I will try and make it as quick as possible..

December 2018, I left my husband for a plethora of reasons that were overdue by about 3 years.  We have 2 children together, a 5 year old and a 2 year old.  I actually left him for another woman, who I somehow fell in love with.  This woman has 2 children also, and also left her husband for me.  In March 2019 her and I moved in together.  Now, she has a small SUV and I had a Chevy Traverse, that was in absolute terrible shape.  I kept dumping a ton of money into it.  I think over the course of 4 months I dumped about $3000 into it and the last time I got it back from the mechanic I drove it for about a week and my radiator went.  I was just completely done with this car.  I told my girlfriend I was going to trade it in for a new car to just stop dumping money into the Traverse.  She was obviously fine with it but asked if I was going to get another 7 seater so we can fit us and our 4 kids into one car when we go places together.  Now here is the thing, I only had the Traverse because I got a really good deal on it a few years back.  I absolutely hated the car.  I hated how big it was and I hated having to park in different places in parking lots because I needed more room to back up in it.  I hated everything about it.  So, I did not want another large car.  The other thing is, my credit is less than stellar so I knew getting approved for a car loan would be pretty difficult.  I looked around and went to a few car dealers and ended up getting approved finally at a Jeep dealer, so I got a nice 2019 Jeep Compass for a hefty monthly payment.  But who cares, at least I am done dumping money into a car that is worthless.

&#x200B;

Now, my girlfriend was absolutely pissed off that I did this.  She said I had no intentions on moving forward with her because of the car that I bought and I should have bought another 7 seater truck to fit all of us for the maybe 1-2x a month that we all go out together.  I told her we could literally just take 2 cars if we have to, to go to the next town over which is probably the furthest we drive.. and if we wanted to go somewhere else further we could just rent a car for a weekend or whatever.

&#x200B;

I told her I didn't think it was fair that I should have to pay $400+ a month for a car that I absolutely hate driving just so we can all fit in the car once in a while.  She disagreed and told me I was selfish.  I don't disagree that it was a selfish decision somewhat, but why can't it be?  I have to pay for it and drive it everyday.  Let me know if I'm the asshole.

Please note that I don't have anything against people with autism, I don't find that in itself to be offensive, and if my bf were autistic it wouldn't be a problem for me in the slightest. 

Anyway, one day it just slipped out to my boyfriend. I was on a rant about my mother and it just came out-  ""And catch this shit- my mom thinks you're autistic bc you share weird stuff on your FB and said her Mac cheese was dry."" 

It wasn't meant to be a big deal, he didn't even care. He said he would joke about it with her the next time he sees her. He did tell his parents, however, since they are very close. 

My mom messaged me yesterday- I guess my sister told her I told my bf. She exploded, saying she can't trust me, saying I've ruined all chance of her and my bf having a relationship, that she can never meet his parentsz that I should tell his parents all of my dirty laundry to make it fair(????)and that she'll only speak to me now if he's not around, and she plans to never speak to him again bc I made things awkward, among other horrible things a parent should never say to a child. She was so upset she was screaming, calling me an effing b----, saying I've ruined everything etc. I was just so taken aback and hurt by what she said. 

So please tell me- am I the asshole? Im really not sure if I effed this one up.. I never intended to cause so much drama with one sentence. I'm just so confused.",191,988,0.95
145,Not the A-hole,"I know this sounds fucking ridiculous. That's because it is. I promise, this isn't a shitpost. 

So I [20M] am a university student. My uni has a café/coffee shop and a bar on campus where students can purchase food on their lunch breaks etc. I rarely actually buy food from either of them for two reasons; 1) I receive no financial support outside of SFE, which really only covers my rent, bills and groceries, so I generally can't afford it and 2) I'm a recovering anorexic and still have a lot of issues eating food I haven't prepared myself bc I can't know 100% what's in it. Note I am working though those issues and I've improved infinitely from a year ago, but I've still got a ways to go before I'm fully better. Usually for my uni lunches, I'll make a big pan of soup on a Sunday, portion it off for the week and take it in a thermos.

This weeks soup in French Onion. One of the girls in my friendship group at uni is pregnant and currently very sensitive to smells. When I began eating my soup today she immediately began to retch and asked if I couldn't eat something else. Apparently, the smell of onion just turns her stomach lately. I said no because it was all I'd brought and she pretty much begged me to go buy something from the coffee shop or something because it was making her feel ill. I told her I can't afford that, and today is kinda a high anxiety day for me so I don't think my ED brain could handle it. She asked if I couldn't just wait and have lunch when I get home (in 4 hours) but I said no again, because I was hungry and anyway my therapist has suggested to me that eating my meals on a bit of a routine could be beneficial for my recovery. She eventually got up and left and some of our friends went with her. Those friends are telling me I was being a selfish, inconsiderate dick because she couldn't stomach the smell, and I really feel awful. However, other friends are assuring me it's fine and that I didn't do anything wrong. From the point of view of strangers, AITA?

Edit: just answering some questions that are coming up a lot. 

1. I'm not entirely sure exactly how pregnant she is but I believe it's around nine weeks. She isn't showing yet but she's telling people. 

2. We were in a dining area. The cafe and bar on campus don't allow for outside food, so there's a sort of ""packed lunch"" area with tables and like microwaves and that where you can go if you bring food from home. You can also get takeout from either the cafe or bar and take it there so its often busy. There were no other tables that were unoccupied. There is outside seating but it was raining today.

Edit #2: other things people keep asking. 

1. There weren't any unoccupied tables so my only option in finding somewhere else was to look for an empty classroom. I technically could've, but I had very limited time for lunch and looking for an empty room would've probably taken a good chunk of it.

2. She wasn't eating herself. She and another woman in the group were going to meet another friend for lunch later on  

3. She 100% for sure knows about my ED. I've known her since secondary school and she and her friends used to tease me about being underweight and call me anorexic for years before I got diagnosed.",1668,8281,0.95

147,No A-holes here,"Long story short, I (24F) am in the navy. I spend long periods of time away from my boyfriend (30M) stuck in a submarine.

I am 100% faithful, but sometimes I *fantasize* about some of the men there. I usually start out fantasizing about my boyfriend, but it gets more and more difficult the longer I’m away from him. I see these other guys every day and it’s easy to visualize them. I figure no harm no foul since I would never cheat.

My boyfriend asked if I ever fantasized about anyone, and I answered him honestly. He got upset with me and said that he meant “celebrities or other unattainable people” and that he didn’t like me fantasizing about men I’m in such close quarters with. He also said it hurt that I wasn’t thinking of him when I was gone and that he thinks of me.

I told him that it’s not that I *don’t* think of him, but that it gets harder to visualize him the longer I’m gone. And I assured him that it’s all just harmless fantasy and that I’d never actually *do* anything because I would never cheat on him, and that even if I wasn’t with him the last person I would shack up with is someone I’m going to be *stuck on a submarine* with because that’s a recipe for disaster, and he said that I just didn’t understand because I was a girl and I took offense to him just brushing it off as me not understanding, and told him it was totally unreasonable for him to dictate what I *fantasize* about when I’m only faithful to him.

We’re at a stalemate. One of my guy friends said he understood my boyfriend’s point, but one of my girl friends said that he was being ridiculous. So now I *really* don’t know what to think. AITA?",116,52,0.74
148,Not the A-hole,"AITA      I moved out of my parents' house spring 2017 after my parents kicked me out when I turned 18. my younger sister (~14 att) had a friend going through troubles at home. He ended up moving in about 6 months after I was gone. He has been living there since then, visiting his real family over the weekends.
     
     While I was in high school, I was considered maybe kind of a bad kid. Skipped all the time, bad grades, low motivation, smoked weed, fought with my parents, got arrested, whatever. Definitely left a bad taste in their mouth, unfortunately. Basically the reason they kicked me out. While growing up, my mom would tell me she would ""get rid of me"" or ""put me up"" if I was misbehaving. Instilled adoption as a fear factor. 

      In the past year, I've absolutely gotten my shit together for a young person. Paid my whole lease up front, paid off court fines, got a great job, and I dont hate waking up every day. Could absolutely have a respectful relationship with my parents if they were open to it. However, 2 weeks ago they told me they decided to adopt this person. They held a party and told me publically so I would have no room to ask questions or show any negative emotion.

    I started talking to my siblings (I have 3, including the one who brought him). They said basically they love him a lot and he is great. Very easy going, hilarious... and that things have been much smoother since I left. There hasn't been fighting or turmoil and they're honestly ""better off"". My mom usually accuses me of jealous when I point out the better treatment my siblings get. Or sibling rivalry because I ""never forgave her for having more kids past [me]"" (oldest of 4)

  My parents have been taking photos and making facebook posts, taking him out to eat, buying lots of gifts, etc. We are poor and those are things that they absolutely did not do for me. It makes sense that they are just overcompensating to make him feel welcome, but idk. I'm glad they love their new kid.

And this kid doesn't have a TERRIBLE homelife, its just very unstable and he didnt want to move an hour+ away with them.

[Edit 1]: I feel like I didnt paint a good enough picture of how unstable and emotionally abusive my parents are. They would use screaming tactics to scare me into corners, belittle me, threaten me, physically hurt me rarely but it was always was in weird ways like pinching or throwing shoes (I could avoid by ducking), or soft spatulas that's didnt /actually/ hurt. They would make big announcements like that they are getting divorced, and growing up it was that we were moving across country to be with my dads side.

By telling me the news in a public setting, I dont know if they were trying to embarrass me or just put me in a situation where I couldnt have an extreme reaction. Something i have not done in years. One commenter said that my quick and recent stability is due to different surroundings, which is a great point I'd like to make. I think I love my parents and they always tell me how much they love me and how smart I am, but they are also capable and have done things I would not consider love. Then again, so have I.

My mom hasn't had a job my whole life, then got one and cheated on my dad 6 months in. She does not get out of bed and gave said sister her car, so she doesn't have to take them to school or use it. Claims pain, only smokes weed and takes pain pills to help

[Edit 2 typo and info] I also just wanted to say as an adolescent, before I actually was so, I felt like a massive burden on my family. Financially because we were broke and four kids, waste of space and everything because there was so many of us and small house. I contemplated suicide because of it. I told my mom because I was young and confused by them, she didn't get I was confused and told me to shut up because I'm being dramatic",52,208,0.89

He was obviously crying. I asked him what was wrong but he didn’t answer me so I didn’t push him more. 

 I went downstairs and told my wife about it. She went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. She came back and brought him food upstairs. When I asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn’t anything important and told me to drop it. I got kind of upset because I want to know what was wrong and I’m his parent as well.

Would I be the asshole if I politely asked customers not to call me names. Or would I just get disgruntled old men?

Edit for more Info: it's only old white men. It is classed as normal here but I wouldn't say it's cultural. If it were Women of colour or even gay men then I'd say it's cultural. But being cultural means they are including me where as in these cases it's just them doing what they want. 
I'm in Australia if that helps.

I'd also like to add I've been in customer service since I started working 10 years ago. And I have shrugged it off like we do.  But it's getting increasingly worse.

Extra edit just for the long sexual harassment debate: 
The odd pet name is fine and is not sexual harassment but the straw that broke my back is in the span of 3 minutes a guy called me luv, darl, Hun, sweetie and winked at me. It's not sexual harrasement but it is highly sexist and enough to make me feel sick for the rest of the day.",135,78,0.81

I’m minding my own business eating and reading on my phone when a group of five guys walk in. One of them approaches me and says “Hey man would you mind moving down we have an extra guy and need some more room.” I politely tell him no because I have this full spread and am just enjoying my food and really don’t want to stop to move all this stuff down.
So the guy proceeds to throw a tantrum with his ignorant buddies essentially making me feel uncomfortable because I refused to interrupt my dinner and accommodate his request. Mind you they have a party of six in a restaurant full of large tables that could easily accommodate his large party yet here they are hassling me when I was here well before them just having a meal quietly.

I have seen this man eat peanut butter. I have seen him put almond milk in his coffee.  He ate pastry I brought for the office. Pastry with nut cream. There is no way he is for real.


But why would I bother with it? Because he is such an asshole about it. Everytime someone brings food he LOUDLY questions them about it and then gives a speech about his ""allergy"".  A month ago one person brought a cake to work. For their birthday. Which was such s nice thing and everyone loved it. Almost everyone. This fucking guy starts asking about the cake. Does it contain this or that. Poor girl wasn't sure if the cake had any nuts or not. So he made another speech. In the end he goes and I qoute ""Maybe next time make sure everyone can enjoy the treat.""



It's free cake. She could have said fuck it I'm not bringing anything. But that is not what pissed me off the most. Last Friday he refused to shake my hand because he saw me eating a protein bar on my break and it looked like it had nuts in it.  I spent the whole weekend thinking of ways to expose him.

154,Not the A-hole,"I was waiting at a coffee shop for a friend who was coming to visit me from out of town [relevant in case someone asks ""why not just leave?""], and within five minutes of getting my stuff and sitting I notice a woman across from me staring. Didn't think much of it at first, sometimes people daydream, sometimes people think they know you, sometimes they're actually looking past you, so it didn't bug me. I periodically look up to see if she's still staring, and she is. To an almost creepy degree. If she sees me looking, she looks away, but when I catch her unaware she's not even blinking.

So I look up, make eye contact and say ""hey, how are you? Do I know you from somewhere?"" to which she responds ""No, I don't think so"" and then looks down at her phone. I figured that'd end it and moved a table down. Another minute or two passes and I sneak a glance up and she's again completely honed in on me. Her cup is empty with the lid pushed inside, so she's not even staying there with food, just sitting there staring. I don't keep glancing up but I can very clearly see her continuing to stare through my peripherals. I do an exaggerated eyes wide open stare back at her for a good 10 seconds and say ""is there anything you need?"" Doesn't answer, but looks away again.

By this point I'm uncomfortable because this is the sort of staring you'd read about on letsnotmeet. Thankfully my friend shows up. I want to leave, but my friend just got off a bus and wants to sit with a bagel. I switch seats so my back is mostly to her, but my friend can see her. Another ten minutes go by and I notice my friend keeps glancing at her, I tell her she's been staring at me the entire time. My friend says ""yeah, she's going to stare a hole right through the back of your head if she keeps it up"" and laughs. 

By this point I'm pretty frustrated and creeped out, and I finally turn around, do those hand binoculars that kids do and look right at her. She immediately looks down at her phone again, and I said ""you've been sitting there with an empty cup staring at me for the last half hour not saying anything, that's honestly pretty rude. I was hoping you'd take multiple hints or at least speak up if you had something to say. Do you think you could either say what you want to say or stop staring at me? Thanks."" This was at very low indoor volume. Only myself, my friend, the woman and the table beside her would have heard.

She immediately left. My friend said that was extremely rude of me, and that she was probably just into me. I told her that she wouldn't be making the same argument if a guy leered at a woman he didn't know for a half hour without talking when she was visibly uncomfortable, and that adults should know not to stare.

If it had only been brief or she talked or smiled or something I would have been totally fine. But this was 99% silent staring for a half hour after I expressed discomfort. Ever see that scary ""Momo"" sculpture? Envision that stare without the smile.",74,299,0.95
155,Not the A-hole,"I guess the title isn't super accurate, it's more me not moving her phone out of the rain. I'm 18F, my sister is 15F. 

My sister has a bad habit of leaving things laying around, shoes at the top of the stairs, food where the cat can eat it, her school books so she has to rush around to find it in the morning, etc. 

Probably the most important thing is her phone. She leaves it anywhere, has lost it for real 4 times in the past 3 years, and ""lost it"" somewhere where we had to retrieve it later at least twice a month. 

I've been keeping her phone safe (moving it, taking it with us when we leave somewhere) for a while, but I'm getting pretty tired of it. I don't think almost 16 is too young to care for your own things. 

So a couple of days ago, she left her phone in the backyard. I warned her not to leave it there since it was going to rain, but she did. And I didn't move it. 

Our mom came home about an hour later and got upset with my sister, until my sister told her I warned her it was going to rain. Then it was my fault, because I knew and I should have moved it. 

Was I an asshole for not moving it? I just got sick of it being my responsibility. I was 15 not that long ago, I know how it is, but I still took care of my own shit. Plus I even warned her. I do feel bad my mom has to buy her a new phone now. 

AITA?

Edited for clarity: I told her I wouldn't get it from outside and it was going to rain soon. I figured that would be enough. She said ""I'll do it later
""

Edited again: When I broke my phone when I was 13 my mom got me a cheap replacement phone, I could only call and text. So people saying my mom's out a lot of money, I don't think she should be. I think she should do the same thing to my sister, especially since this isn't the first time.

Another edit: She does not have ADHD or ADD.


UPDATE: I just came home from work and showed my mom this thread, she still doesn't agree with me leaving it in the rain, which I can understand, but agreed that it's not my responsibility and that from here on out I don't have to look out for it/move it/find it anymore. Tomorrow she's buying my sister a flip phone, if she can take care of it for the next 6 months she'll buy my sister the same model of phone she had now, which I think is fair.

We have everything planned  and we have a midwife helping us. In case of an emergency we should be able to reach a hospital in 10 minutes.

Just yesterday, as we where discussing and planing the birth, when I told her that I want our daughter to go to one of our parents a week before the birth, she told me that actually she wishes that our daughter stays with us, and be present  at her siblings birth.

I bought it from her for her stated price. It worked fine, a little slow but totally fine for what I needed at work. 

That was a little over a month ago. 

She then saw me and said she tried the new iPad and it wasn’t what she’d anticipated so she was going to stick with her old one and she wanted to return my money and take it back. 

I had already downloaded all my work files on there and was never going to find another at that price. If it had been like, 24-72 hours afterwards and she said “I’ve changed my mind” ok, fine. But a month?

162,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so here's the background: I have 3 kids that range from early to mid-teens. They're good kids, thoughtful, respectful, empathetic to others, and really smart young human beings. The older 2 are hard-right on the political spectrum, however, and it concerns me.

I'm center-right, and my wife is maybe slightly more conservative than I am, but not much. Support gay marriage but pro-life, would like to see formal attempts to improve gun control but I believe the police are critically undervalued, support the concept of unions but believe that trade agreements should favor our country or at least be balanced, etc. I kind of cross lines a bit, and so does my wife.

My two oldest kids, however, being younger and more raw in their beliefs, are more political firebrands. They both bought their own MAGA hats, which I don't own. They both loathe ANTIFA, dislike Democrats as soon as they hear their political party, and don't understand the concept of balance in our political system.

I've been trying for months now to calmly prod them in their political beliefs, trying to temper them a bit. The problem is that they're always ready to get louder and angrier when they're challenged. I understand that it's also got a lot to do with their stage of development, as narcissistic tendencies in teens tend to make them less amenable to compromising their beliefs. These conversations turn into arguments, not on my side, particularly with my oldest.

For example: my oldest was discussing gun control and how the only form needed was background checks, and the government shouldn't ban bump stocks or semi-auto rifles. I challenged him on it, always remaining even and calm, showing him the other side, and how mass shootings are becoming more and more commonly committed by persons wielding semi-auto rifles or fully auto. He got more and more angry, and in the end said he didn't want to discuss it any further.

Now, they both get instantly irritated when I bring up a challenge to their beliefs, and they don't want to discuss it with me. I don't provoke, but when they talk about whatever podcast they were listening to, if I don't feel the same way, I push back calmly. They get defensive and angry, and tell me to stop arguing with them.

AITA if I keep pushing back against their beliefs, or should I let them sort it out?

165,Asshole,"Disclosure: this is my girlfriends story, rather than mine, this will be from her point of view.

I work in retail. I have a coworker in her 30s who we will call Becky. Becky has some sort of medical condition that I or any other coworker know nothing about due to confidentiality. All we know is that she passed out last year while working register and busted her head open, ambulance was called. Becky is always leaving work early. Some days it’s an hour or two, and some days she decides she needs to leave after an hour of her 8 hour shift. She complains of headaches, tiredness, drowsiness, and general discomfort.

In retail, especially the store I work at, we often need every person to work their full shift especially if it is a closing shift, or else everyone else gets off late and has a heavier workload. The hours are thin as it is. I understand if Becky leaves early on her scheduled shifts due to people with disabilities being a protected class and the possibility of being sued etc etc. The problem is that she is constantly taking shifts that are put up on our app by people needing a cover, yet for almost everyone she decides she will leave at closing time instead of with everyone else after the store is done, or she leaves after a one or two hours of a 5 hour shift. Very rarely does she not leave early.

Tonight I was working with her and she’s on register and I am working in the kids section towards the back. My manager comes to tell me the plan for closing and says that Becky said she is leaving at close instead of staying with us for the 2 hours of recovery of the store that is included in the shift (Sunday, 4pm-9pm, close at 7pm). I messaged her on our staff app with a screenshot of the shift she took from someone and told her that she really shouldn’t be taking shifts she won’t complete and that it is unfair to all of her coworkers, pointing out that the shift was a 4 to 9pm. She immediately asks if our store manager is still here, our part time manager (multiple part time managers) told her no and she showed him the message. He didn’t care too much because he believes the same thing as I do and is a friend of mine, so he just gave her the number of our store manager. She is most likely going to complain. I’m guessing I will get a slap on the wrist or written up at most because the store manager knows I am good sales associate, but I need to know Reddit, am I the asshole?",76,98,0.94
166,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my friends know my account.

I am 19 years old, and I just started university this year. I live with my parents, and we are about to move to a smaller house than the one I grew up in. Their marriage isn’t typical. My dad is a closeted gay man, and my mom is very resentful, but she is also chronically ill and he takes care of her physical needs. I help take care of her and they have both liked having me around as a buffer between them because they fight when they're alone.

They sleep in separate bedrooms but present themselves to the outside world as a happily married couple, and I help them keep their secret from relatives and friends. There are 2 bedrooms in the new house, and a very small room in which we can fit a single bed. It has glass doors and clearly wasn’t meant to be a bedroom. The TV is right outside of it.

My dad wants to give my mom the largest bedroom, take the medium size bedroom himself, and put me in the tiny room. I don't want the tiny room because there'll be less privacy, it will be noisy with the television, I won't have room for much stuff, and I want a quiet space to study. My dad would only sleep in the tiny room and keep all his stuff in my mom's room anyway.

I told my Dad that I want the medium room. He got mad and told me I should just be glad to have a place to live rent-free, so I offered to move out. I feel like refusing to give me the medium room is a sign that my dad doesn't respect my contributions to the household (I cook for my mom and help out more than the average student living at home). My mom doesn’t want me to move out, and my dad says I am selfish and demanding for threatening to leave if I don't get the medium room. AITA?

ETA: Just to be clear, my dad DOESN'T want me to move out, because I cook for them on a regular basis, serve as a buffer between him and my mom, so he is mad at the possibility of me moving out instead of taking the tiny room. Rent is not the issue - no amount of rent would make him want to give me medium room.",51,71,0.95
167,Asshole,"I was out with my wife and teenage daughter. 

Teenage daughter has a shellfish allergy. 

She ordered a pasta dish that was topped with scallops. It was described as “linguine in cream sauce topped with scallops” 

She said “can I get this without the scallops I am highly allergic to shellfish.” 

Waitress said no problem. Great. 

Food comes to the table and I don’t see any scallops but I detected a really fishy smell and insisted my daughter wait. I tasted it, the sauce definitely had seafood in it. I asked the waitress what was in the sauce and she said she’d ask. She comes back and is rattling off the ingredients — chief among them — oysters. 

I flipped out and demanding to see a manager. It took a while to unpack it all but what we learned was the waitress told the kitchen to leave the scallops off but didn’t say our party had a shellfish allergy. 

My daughter could have gone into anaphylactic shock. I was irate. I just kept thinking what could’ve happened if she’d been eating here alone or with friends who didn’t know she was allergic. 

I let loose on the manager, saying basically “this could have gotten my kid killed. I want to know what you’re going to do about it. We told our waitress she was allergic.” He fired the waitress. 

I thought they’d do something like add an allergen warning to their menu or instruct the staff to ask if tables had an allergy but honestly I was happy they fired her. I figured it would be a good lesson for her. 

But now I’m looking back on it and wondering if I should have taken it that far. On the one hand, it was so dangerous what they did. On the other, it is a person’s livelihood.

170,Not the A-hole,"Last year in November my dad began to have an affair with a woman. At this time I was seventeen, I grew suspicious because he lied about having a meeting at work and that he wouldn’t be able to pick me up from school but his iPhone locations didn’t show being at work.

A month later, my mom found out she was pregnant and our suspicions about my dad cheating were confirmed after my mom checked the cellphone records and checked his messages. My mom then had a miscarriage, and I, his 17 year old daughter, held her through it while he was out with his mistress. It’s still hurts to think about. 

My mom begged (even forced my sisters and I to do it with her) for him to stay and to go to family and couples therapy. But, he said he needed to get away from us and moved out to an apartment. He left the house for my mom to pay and both my sisters had to put their life on hold to move back in and help my mom financially. The worst part is , not only did my mom forgive him, she wished him happiness, and helped him move out. To top it all off, my mom talked to his mistress and confirmed that she knew that my mom was pregnant when she was having an affair with my dad. 

My dad then would pop in and out of our lives leaving my mom to go on an up and down spiral. Anytime she’s trying to get better: going to therapy, making plans to move, going to the gym, etc. My dad comes back saying he wants to work things out and then leaves again. My sisters and I were left constantly picking up he’s pieces and trying to hold her together only for my dad to break her all over again. All the while his mistress tells my mom that she loves my dad and she doesn’t want to hurt our family and that she’s a good woman. She tells her that she’s godly and has morals. But she knew what she was getting into by having an affair with a married man. Not only did she ruin a twenty five year marriage but she also ruined a whole family.

Fast forward to now, my dad is back and has been staying at our house and I can’t help but feel super resentful and I harbor a lot of anger and pain. He came back in our lives like nothing happened and never even addressed his affair or if he’s still with his mistress or not. 

I want to message her to tell my side of the story and what she’s put my family through. To really put in her mind that she is in fact not close to a good human being. I want my words to stick with her and emotionally haunt her for a long time. But most of all I want to clarify whether she still has a relationship with my dad or not, because if my moms not addressing it then I will, I genuinely cannot watch her break again if he leaves and I can’t stand being around him anymore not knowing if he’s still with her while he’s with my mom.

WIBTA if I messaged her?

TL;DR: Dad had an affair, gets back with mom hasn’t said if he’s still with mistress or not . I, the daughter, wants to message mistress to ask.",60,67,0.92

172,No A-holes here,"I recently finished graduate school and started working as a doctor (not a human medical doctor) at the same workplace I've been working seasonally at since I finished high school. A lot of the staff here call me by my first name (since they've known me almost 10 years), and I really don't care whether they call me ""Firstname"" or ""Dr. Lastname"" (although all of the other doctors here go by ""Dr.""). Even many of the more recent hires, who have only known me as a ""Dr."" call me by my first name. I don't mind this at all, and have stated multiple times that I don't mind this. 

One of the people who has worked there for a couple of years calls me ""Miss Firstname"" a lot, and for some reason this is really bothering me. I think it's that he's making a point of titling me, but using the wrong one, not just skipping the title and going for the more casual first name. He did do this before I finished school as well, so it's not like this has changed, although he is the only person at the company who's ever seemed compelled to call me ""Miss"". If I ask him to stop, AITA, since I have said repeatedly that I don't care what they call me? I wouldn't mind if he called me ""Firstname"" only, but the addition of the ""Miss"" keeps getting under my skin. Do I just need to get over it?

On the way to the airport, I got a call from my ex. One of my daughters was in the hospital.  She was scared and wanted me to be there. My daughter’s condition was not life-threatening but was serious enough to warrant an overnight stay and a multitude of tests.

I told my girlfriend I would drop her off at the airport and told her to enjoy her vacation. I let her know what was going on and, to my surprise, she blew up at me. She told me my daughter was fine, it wasn’t serious, we had planned this for months and months, and I don’t prioritize her at all. 

Admittedly I got angry and told her my kids ALWAYS come first, period. Yes, my daughter wasn’t going to die, but she was scared and not feeling well and in the hospital.

I dropped my girlfriend off and she went ahead without me. I went to the hospital to be with my daughter.

Haha good joke Mandy. 

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew?

176,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I have a set of 3-year-old twins, one male, and the other female. For this post let’s call them Jessie and James. Through the years, my twins have been called a variety of nicknames, by myself and others.

Here are some examples.

Frick and Frack-My parents call them this.

Phil and Lil-Their middle names are Phillip and Lillian.

Bebe and Cece

Thing 1 and Thing 2

Mario and Luigi

Fred and George

Gred and Forge

Butch and Cassidy

Walker and Texas Ranger or TR for short.

Zan and Jayna-I'm trying to teach them to say ""Wonder Twins powers activate.”

Despite the nicknames, my children know their birth names and respond to them.

The twins are at the age where if they see anything interesting, they will run towards it or wander away if I take my eyes away from them for one second. They are very fast. Chasing after one toddler is a pain in the ass, chasing after two at the same time is pure hell.  Since we live in a fast-growing suburban area where cars are becoming more and more prevalent, my ex and I decided that for the children’s safety to get them toddler backpacks with a harness and leash attached. 

When I was showing the one, I got Jesse for the first time, she asked what it was for. I told her because she was Speedy Gonzalez the Fastest Mouse in all of Mexico and Daddy was not fast enough to keep up with her. James asked what his name was. I told him he was the Roadrunner Meep Meep.

Both kids got a kick out of their nicknames and I showed them Looney Tunes for the first time.

Thursday, I got an angry call from my ex asking why in the hell did I give our daughter an offensive nickname. Apparently, at daycare, Jessie was chasing James around yelling she was Speedy Gonzalez the Fastest Mouse in all of Mexico and James was saying Meep Meep the entire time. I thought it was hilarious and I told her I didn’t find anything offensive about the name, but since she had an issue with it, I won’t call Jesse, Speedy anymore. She said, I was being a racist for not taking this seriously and I couldn’t give the twins any more nicknames anymore. 

My ex has never had any issue with any of the other nicknames before. She is the one that called them Bebe and Cece, based on the twins from the Proud Family and the Gospel duo. I told her, I’m not going to stop with the nicknames and I figured if I have to refer to Jesse and James being fast again, I’ll just call them Flash and Kid Flash. Nope, she said I lost the right to give them nicknames when I didn’t think about offending others with the name Speedy.

I understand the stereotypes associated with the character, but I read that Speedy is thought of highly by Latin Americans, so AITA for calling Jesse, Speedy?",160,312,0.94

179,Not the A-hole,"It was my birthday weekend this weekend and as I’d moved cities last year, I made the trip up to where I used to live to meet some friends. I was staying at one of my friend’s places for a total of two nights which is something I did sparingly last year after moving cities. As where he lives is expensive, he still lives with his parents (who I know quite well and are very reasonable people).

Tonight, as we were coming home from our day out, I overheard his parents complaining. I caught the last sentence as we walked inside, which was “how can you be brought up to not bring a gift to someone else’s house when you’re staying for two days?” (About me).

Naturally I would understand this as it is a courteous thing to do however I had a few issues on this occasion. For a start, they are aware that I’m low on money as I’m in the process of job hunting. Second, this is the first time I have been at their house since May and only the third time this year that I’ve been there. Third, I haven’t been any inconvenience to them in the time I was here: yesterday we were out all day and bought our own meals etc., and the same today. Whilst I really do appreciate them putting up for me always, the extent of their commitment this time was pumping an inflatable bed in their attic and the cost of money for two showers. We were out all day both days and there was really no other inconvenience to them. Fourth, it’s my birthday. I know this isn’t a major excuse but I feel like it’d be a bit strange to give gifts on my birthday when I’m in this financial situation. I always offer for my friend to come and stay with me but he declines as we both know there’s nothing to do where I’ve moved to.

I’ve always been gracious as I really do appreciate them being so accommodating but I couldn’t understand why they’re so mad this time. I’ve always been well-mannered and I always make time to speak to them properly whilst I’m there as I’m interested to see how they’re getting on. We live in the UK so giving gifts is (in my opinion) only relevant if the hosts are cooking a meal, if it’s a special occasion like Christmas or conditionally. Though I know these conditions vary between families. I should also add that I visited about 10 times last year and bought them a bottle of wine on my final visit as a thank you (though I’m aware that my friend’s parents were expecting a gift by that point anyway). Perhaps it was a build up of not getting gifts on previous occasions?

I asked my friend about it and he thinks I should get them a gift absolutely no question. He thinks it’s bad that this isn’t a staple principle for me but I see it as a situation where everyone has different values. I know my parents wouldn’t expect gifts after a low-maintenance two-day trip and neither would my girlfriend’s, but maybe I’m wrong. Reddit, am I the asshole?",71,53,0.84
180,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR Home Health nurse, patients treating me like Uber, have I gone too far with boundary setting.

I’m a home health nurse, I drive to see 6-8 patients a day over a wide region, and each visit can take 20-90 minutes.
Lately, maybe because of our very on demand world with Uber etc, patients have become unreasonable with scheduling demands that I don’t feel are appropriate. It used to be there were always those 1-2 patients, now it’s the majority. What should be 8 hr days turn into 12 hr days, 7 days/wk catching up on visits because my schedule becomes so inefficient, zigzagging all over town bending over backward to accommodate the whims of people who should be treating this like a medical appt but instead treat me like a concierge service.

Examples: Wanting me to come at a specific time for a non medical reason such as when they prefer to have lunch, that’s when they watch the news, they are going to the mall/bank/etc, the plumber is coming. Another thing that really gets me is if they want to reschedule for an earlier or later time they’ll say “that way you can have the afternoon off”, or “you get to sleep in”. These people think I fall from the sky just for them and don’t realize I will work the full day regardless of what time I see them.
Taking calls or dealing with other business while I’m there and expecting me to wait. Actual examples: booking a flight for 30 minutes, stopping a visit to have a couch picked up by upholstery company and complaining how ‘inconvenient’ it is that I arrived at the time I we scheduled.
Not allowing a 1 hour window of arrival and refusing to let me in if “late”.

So now this is what I do:  when we schedule our next visit they have 2 choices of arrival windows that I give them based on knowing where I’ll be when, and whether the visit is time specific. UNLESS they have a medical appt, they get no exceptions. If they can’t accommodate I tell the office to restaff since they are too busy for a nurse, and also they may need to be re-evaluated for whether they need HH since they aren’t prioritizing it.

if they take a call and it goes over 5 minutes, or deal with any other issue for more than 5 minutes, I leave.

I don’t chat much anymore, since the more we get to know each other I feel the more they can lean on my empathy toward their situation and then I end up agreeing to accommodate them. 

One of the agencies I work with has complained that I’m refusing too many patients now, saying I need to be more flexible. The last issue was a patient texting me an hour before our visit (scheduled for 1pm) that they won’t be home til 6pm so they need me to come after that. In traffic its an hour drive each way. No, I said I’ll be home making dinner at that time, the agency can send another nurse who works evenings or the caregiver can do the wound care. I’m not a 24/7 on call service.",59,293,0.94

182,Not the A-hole,"So obviously this is being put on a throwaway, but without any more delay here's the situation.

I just moved out in August to go to an in-state university and I'm a freshman (M18). I absolutely love it. I live in an off-campus apartment that's designated student housing. There's 6 of us total in the apartment: 1 other freshman, 1 sophomore, 2 juniors, and a 33-year-old married man.

So there's some guy at least 10 years older than the rest of us living with us, no big deal, he's cool. Except he's 33, he's not a student, he has a wife and kid living back in California where he's from, and he's a store manager of a nearby gas station/convenience store. 

To make matters weirder, He's in a shared room with me. There are 4 private rooms and 1 shared room in our apartment, and he's in the shared room with me. He's also got a gun, which is against the lease. He also makes us call him one name, which is very different from the name his packages are addressed to. 

The last straw for me was this week when he told me his brother was coming, which was fine with me if he was hanging out here. However, he conveniently left out that he'd be sleeping on the floor in between us. 

I'm always super passive, I like to stay in my own lane, and he's generally a nice guy, but It's starting to bother me and honestly makes me kind of nervous, especially when I was told I'd be put with tenants my age. This guy is:

* Lying about his name
* Living in student housing, though not a student
* Breaking at least 3, if not 4 terms in the lease

and to put the cherry on top, he doesn't do his dishes, doesn't help clean our bathroom bedroom, and the room constantly smells like his feet. So WIBTA if I talked to the landlord about it?

183,Not the A-hole,"Am I the asshole for making this a thing?

Last night- I was checking the weather on my wifes phone. I wasnt snooping, but my phone was plugged in elsewhere so I just grabbed hers.

After I opened the phone, two texts came through from one of my best friends. In short- the first one said he had been drinking. The second one was that it wasnt fun as he was with his wife.

Background:  We all know each other well. My wife is best friends with his wife, I’m best friends with him. We live a substantial distance apart but we go out of our way to see make plans to see each other every summer. They were in our wedding and we in theirs. 

Anyhow- I read these messages, which was weird, as i had sent some texts earlier in the day to him that he hadnt responded to yet, but now he is texting my wife. 

There was no context to the texts as all precious texts had been deleted. I wasnt aware of that my wife and he texted at all. I asked why there were no precious messages, and my wide said it was because she recently updated her phone.  When I showed her that there were messages on this same phone from 2017, she admitted to deleting the messages as she thought id be angry. She said that the extent of their talking was sharing music they liked and funny memes.

This for me would be weird if it was true as neither have ever made mention of the songs or albums they had learned of from one another or shared any of the memes? 

Also- the most recent texts doesn’t align with this being their norm. 

Anyhow- my wife and I had it out. I see it as disrespectful for them to be talking behind out backs, and my wife, at minimum should not be listening to him slag his wife. 

I also sent him a text and said that I saw his messages, and they werent cool by me and that I had to think about whether or not we still could have a friendship. He replied and was apologetic and said that they mostly texted about music. 

Funny- in knowing this  guy for 10 years- he has never had an interest in music beyond listening to whatever is on the radio.

186,Not the A-hole," So I (20F) have a friend (20M) who met a girl (18F) this year; they're in the same class and were friends for a year until she admitted having feelings for him. They decided to try things out (from what I know it was clear for both of them that they were only trying, not actively getting into a relationship), but about a week later he realized he didn't have any feelings for her and broke things up.
It made her very angry and she tried to guilt trip him, and this led to him asking for my opinion on the situation (via messages).
After telling me how she'd been acting, we both agreed that she was being very immature. I won't go into details about her behavior so as to not make this whole thing too specific, but the main point is that we both agreed that she was being immature.
Fast forward to a month later, they're back together for some reason.
She told him that since they're now in a relationship, they shouldn't hide anything from each other, so she'd like to see the messages me and him exchanged when he was asking for my opinion/advice (my friend is very passive so he said yes as soon as she started to insist).
She became furious upon reading that we both thought she was acting immature, and she demanded via him that I apologise to her. 
I tried messaging him about it but he would delete all the messages after a few minutes because he didn't want her to know we're still talking out of fear of making her angry.
I didn't apologise because she was being hostile and I stand by what I said.

187,Not the A-hole,"Ok so this is still kinda recent.  New secret acc

Me and Roommate 1 live together in a 3 bedroom house thingy. We rent evenly and recently got a third roommate (R3) Me and R1 have been renting in the same place for 3 years. 
 
R3 is allergic to peanut butter.  On the first day of her moving in she saw my baking cabinet and informed both me and R1 that she is allergic to peanut butter. We kinda panicked at first bc we eat a lot of peanut butter. But R3 informs that she simply cannot eat it and doesn't mind if we eat it and to just make sure we clean dishes very carefully.  No probs. 

I love baking and I decided to use my friend's oven for baking (she's cool with it. We bake and just chill together. She lives maybe 4-6 blocks away) whenever I use peanut butter bc I'm honestly just scared to make a mistake. 

Where the conflict happened:
I sometimes leave some baked goods for the house because hey who doesn't like sweets. Most of the time I make brownies. I often store them those cute plastic bags you get for like birthdays. I make 3 bags:
1 for me personally (not in the kitchen;  just in my room) 
1 for the house (peanut butter) 
1 for the house (no peanut butter) 

I didn't have any labels at the time and markers didn't write on plastic, so I texted both R1/R3 which bag had peanut butter and which didnt. (purple bag = peanut, orange = no peanut). We made a group chat for this kinda stuff. I go to college/work after and when I get home R3 is pissed at me. She explains that she almost ate some of the peanut brownies and that I should've put labels on them. I explain that she should've read the text because I did inform them that I make separate batches. I asked where the peanut butter batch was and R3 explains that she threw it out bc it was dangerous to her. I got angry and told her that THAT was bullshit bc she herself said she just couldn't eat it and she didn't have a right to throw it out. R1 says we need to just get over it but I'm still upset. 

Since then, I don't bother making a separate batch of whatever I bake (so I won't modify or change the recipe) and I have texted this in the group chat. Well;  R3 is pissed because she constantly sees food that looks good but she knows she can't eat and R1 says I'm basically taunting her. But I think it's fair since I'm not purposely adding peanut butter to these recipes, I've baked before she got here, I did tell them I wouldn't be changing batches, and the separate batch thing was only my accommdation for R3. But R1 says that it's still a dick move to not make a separate batch for R3 because there's still the smell of food in the house and she doesn't know if I decided to use peanut butter or not.  I say I'm not baking for her and whatever I put for the house is leftover extras.

One day she tells me that she's gonna go hang out at her house for a few hours or so. That's fine with me, just keep me updated and shoot me a couple texts here n there.

I really only saw myself ever wearing a simple wedding band and a big rock on my finger just wasn't me. But for whatever reason, he still went for a nice ring with a beautiful, quality diamond. It is a beautiful ring, but I only wore it for the 6 months we were engaged, and then when we got married I only wore my wedding band after that. I just find it more practical, it doesn't have a diamond sticking up that can catch on things, and it is a less flashy ring, and just more ""me"" style-wise. I maybe pull my engagement ring out of the safe once a year if we go somewhere nice and get dressed up and even then it is only because my husband suggests I wear it.

Now this ring was given with love but I truly feel more sentimental about my wedding ring than the engagement ring. WIBTA if I suggested to my husband that this engagement ring (probably worth at least 5K) is wasted sitting in a safe 99% of the time and we could sell it and put the money towards something else (mortgage, car loan, family vacation, etc.)? We are not struggling financially, but I we are also pretty practical people who don't spend wastefully either. This ring might have been the biggest exception to that.

EDIT: A few of you have assumed some things that aren't true. So to clarify.

1. the value of the ring is not 5k. 5k is what we could probably get for selling it (well the diamond, really). The original price was way more.

2. The ring was bought on credit with a down payment by my husband, and I paid MORE than half of the ring off at the time when we combined finances.

3. The ring is not symbolic to my husband. He didnt want to look like a cheapskate (and wasnt sure I really meant it when I said to buy something cheap) so he spent way more than he should have. He is not upset that I never wear it. He never wears his ring either. He knows the wedding ring is the meaningful one to me. For our anniversary he had our kids birthstones set into it because I wear that one every day.",133,327,0.94

My dad got a DUI and has to go to mandatory AA meetings. Since he's not allowed to drive he asked me, and I agreed. 

I've driven him four times now, and it's been pretty awful. He's extremely critical of my driving, and not constructive criticism. Just mean comments, and not just about my driving. 

I've told him once that if he doesn't stop he can walk to his meetings, he didn't. I told him that was the last time I drove him there. I guess he didn't take me seriously, for the next meeting I had 7 missed calls when I usually picked him up and apparently he missed it.

199,Not the A-hole,"While this is a post about shit, it isn't a shitpost.

I am part of a race known for its spicy food (hint: it's in Southern Asia). Unlike other people of my race, I DESPISE spicy food. It makes me feel terrible, especially when I'm on the toilet the day after. Also, I'm a teenage boy if that makes any difference.

So my family and I were at a social gathering with family friends and we happened to be eating a potluck-style dinner. There was a lot of spicy food present so it was a little difficult to find something that I would enjoy. I finally found something to eat and sat down. My parents saw what was on my plate and kept making fun of me for not being more adventurous with my food choices. I just dealt with it as I have in the past by saying, ""I don't like it.""

That did not work this time and they kept pushing me by asking why. I didn't want to be gross so I just said that spicy food makes me feel weird. That was not a sufficient answer to them and they asked in what way. So after 5 minutes of constantly being criticized for my food choices, I was pissed and said, ""Because it burns like hell when it comes out the other side."" They had a disgusted look on their face and ignored me for the rest of the night.

When we got home, they yelled at me for embarrassing them in front of everyone. (It really wasn't in front of everyone, we were on a sofa near a corner of the room so I doubt that many people heard.) I know what I said was gross but they kept pushing me for an answer and I was tired of their BS. My parents claim that I was overdramatic and there was no need to be so inappropriate.

To help with that, I've established a budget that I try to keep minimized every month since I moved to the area alone and live by myself plus have other bills and student loans to factor in. I usually just barely break above even and this has been on going for almost a year now. I live in the NOVA/DC area, so rent here living alone is pretty expensive. My girlfriend and I got into a argument today bc given how her family has invited me over a few times for dinner and treated us to dinner out, I should pay for them and her this time. Last weekend, we took a vacation to a resort and weeks before that we ate out as well, so I suggested maybe splitting the cost between us. She thinks I'm being selfish in thinking only about saving money vs the gesture of how they've treated me to food and how I should be thankful this time around. I feel like I'm in the wrong, but I can't feel like defend my stance on trying to save money. She's helped me try to save, and cook to cut down on expenses.

205,Asshole,"I (25M) rent an apartment with two roommates who I connected with via Craigslist - a young woman about my age (who’s the property manager and daughter of the landlord), and her boyfriend. I work late hours, and her boyfriend spends about half the time over at another residence, so a lot of the time when I come home from work later at night, she’s all by herself in the room, and usually still awake.

Whenever I come home and she’s still awake, the inside chain (which is very firm and sturdy) is on the door, preventing me from opening the door even after I’ve unlocked it. I will knock, and she’ll always come right over to unlatch the door for me and let me in. She’s said that she does this for “safety reasons”, as we live in a somewhat sketchier-than-normal (though not horrible) area, and says that, “being a woman alone late at night”, adding an extra layer of protection to the door makes her feel safer and more secure.

I personally don’t like her doing this. It bars my entry to the house, and while it only causes me a 10-20 second delay getting into the house, it’s annoying that I can’t enter my own property that I pay for and upkeep without someone else’s permission. And, while she always leaves the door unlatched when she goes to sleep, I’m worried one of these days she’ll forget and leave me locked out of the room.

I approached her about the situation a handful of times, getting firmer and firmer with every “no” or vague answer she gave; and eventually she agreed (very reluctantly) to stop chaining the door at night. Am I an asshole for wanting to get into my residence without hassle?",359,357,0.94

Both of us are devastated right now and grieving, especially my fiance as she has been having severe depression the past few weeks, so this doesn't help her at all.

209,Not the A-hole,"Background: Several years ago, I was seeing someone, Mark, casually. We got along well, enjoyed each other, and after about a year despite taking precautions, I got pregnant. We hadn't specifically discussed what we would do, and to make it more complicated, we found out early on that I was pregnant with twins. He was uncertain at first, and decided after not too long that he wasn't ready to be a father. I didn't want to force him, and I'm super fortunate to have a job that allowed/allows me to support my little family, as well as a wonderful social network. So, we parted ways, I let him know when the boys were born, and I asked that he at least keep me up to date on his contact information, in case of emergency, or if they wanted to meet him some day.

On to the issue: My sons are now almost three, they're beautiful, sweet, gregarious little dudes, and I don't have a single regret in the world. I recently got engaged to the love of my life (John). Shortly after we announced our engagement, I heard from Mark again, first time since a few weeks the boys were born.

He didn't mention the engagement, but I'm pretty sure someone told him, and that's why he reached out. I won't lie, I was taken aback, and I just don't like the idea of adding him back into the mix and making things more complicated... So this could for sure be coloring my responses, and I want to be sure I'm being fair.

Mark wants to see his sons. He specifically talked about seeing them ""a few times, where \[they\] can play"" and ""see how it goes"". To me, this sounds like he wants a trial run or something, and then decide if he enjoys it enough to see them more. I told him that although I'm absolutely open to him seeing the boys and being part of their lives, I'm not comfortable with what seems like a trial run setup, and that I would like him to decide, or we could meet and discuss, whether he wants to be an ongoing part of their life, and what that would look like. I also told him that if he does want to be involved, that I'll be expecting him to pay some form of child support from here on out, although we'd need to figure out what that looks like.

It's been three years, he's met them only once, and as awesome as my kids are, they're still a serious handful, and parenting isn't something you just get to do when it's fun. I don't want someone in and out of their lives, I want them to have consistent, loving people around. Mark got pretty angry, accused me of being with John just to replace him, and basically of trying to extort money from him and keeping his kids hostage. I feel like I'm trying to put reasonable expectations and boundaries out there, but I don't want to deny my boys the chance to know their father, and I'm worried that my kneejerk reaction is too strong and I'm being unreasonable.

So AITA for expecting my ex/my kids' father to be around consistently and help financially if he wants to be around at all?",81,86,0.87

211,Asshole,"This happened yesterday and my wife was legitimately pissed, although I fail to see how it was my fault. 

My wife loves lattes (I don’t drink coffee), and we have an expresso maker with a removable tip for the milk frothing steam wand. I make the lattes most of the time, and I always wipe the tip down with a wet towel when I’m done. I can always tell when my wife makes a latte, however, because she never wipes the wand down, and it’s left covered with dried or even burnt milk. Since I tend to be the next person to use it, I end up scrubbing the dried and burnt milk off. 

Yesterday afternoon, my wife was washing dishes and I noticed that the tip was covered in dried milk. I unscrewed it, held it between two fingers, shoved it in front of her face, and threw it in the sink. Fast forward a few hours and my wife notices the tip is missing and asks me where it is. I explain what I just said to her, and she concludes that she must have thrown it in the garbage when she emptied the sink drain strainer. 

This turned into a big argument over who had to dig through the garbage bag to find it. My wife said it was my fault because I’m the one who put it in the sink and that there was no way she would have known it was there (she also tried to claim she wasn’t washing dishes - she was merely sorting ones to go in the dishwasher and ones to be hand washed). I think it’s her fault because she’s the one who left it dirty and, you know, actually threw it in the trash. She got so worked up (many FUs were directed toward me) I ended up going to bed while she stayed downstairs for an hour mad about it. 

TLDR; wife threw away a tiny item for the expresso maker. Thinks it’s my fault because I put it in the sink to be washed.

Update: It seems the verdict is somewhere between YTA and ESH, so I ended up digging the tip out of the garbage. Thanks Reddit.",69,243,0.95

227,Asshole,"I love my kiddos and I will always step up to help them when they need it!  Here's our story:

My daughter's boyfriend moved in with the family while they were still in highschool.  He was living in another state and was supposed to be home schooling, but that turned into full time working and no schooling.  Because of how serious the relationship was turning out to be, we moved him to our place and got him into school so he could graduate, with honors I will add!  He lived in the house rent free while going to school and several months after graduation.  My wife and I decided it was time to start charging rent.  We divided our rent by the amount of people living in the house and began charging them their share, ($200/per person).  They moved out into an apartment of their own about a year later.

Fast forward a year later.  My daughter broke it off with her boyfriend and asked to stay in our home temporarily while she got back on her feet.  Unfortunately, we no longer had a bedroom for her, but we opened the house and the couch for her, for free.  A few months later her boyfriend came back into the picture and now they are both living in the house, sleeping on the couch.  So the wife and I told them they both need to start paying rent again, $200/per person.  They both said they didn't think that was fair and my daughter got upset because she would charge family if the roles were reversed.

It gets a little more complicated because we are moving to California, where rent is about two - three times more expensive then where we are now.  We told my daughter that her portion of the rent will increase to $500-$800 a month depending on the cost of the house.  She is frustrated we are asking her to pay rent at all and shocked we would ask for so much after the move.

So, am I the asshole?  Should I be letting her stay rent free indefinitely while she figures out how to go from starving artist to successful artist, (she is a awesome photographer).

Edited to add some additional information:

We live in a 1300 SQ foot four bedroom house.  Rent is $1550, utilities usually run around $500.  With my daughter and her boyfriend moved back in, we now have seven people living in the house.  My daughter understood and agreed to move back in knowing she would not have a room, with the understanding it was only temporary.  We physically do not have a room for her to move into, otherwise she would not be on the couch.",329,702,0.93

230,Not the A-hole,"I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

As I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn’t available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn’t available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a “inconsiderate little bitch”. As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said “what’s the point of customer service if they won’t help you?” 
At this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said “I just hope whatever you give birth to isn’t a total c*** like his mom”. The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn’t care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn’t say much (I’m 6’2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

Now, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she’s ok. 

Ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

I still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?

EDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment. It was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, I meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn’t even have the chance to get a Kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her.

231,Not the A-hole,"For our friends birthday we went to town. Throughout the night my wife was drinking at a steady pace and getting tipsy, normal for a night out.

After an hour or so of drinking, it became noticable she (Wife) was getting very drunk. I suggested that it was a good time to call it a night, but she insisted it was okay. She didn't seem blind drunk at the time, so I agreed to stay.

After half an hour, we left the bar. We decided to sober up a little, so decided on getting food. Whil walking, she stumbled into a stranger and fell off her feet. She then fell into a road. There were no cars around. Again, I suggested that we go home. She couldn't string together a sentence or remember details such as our address.

I decided at this point that she no longer had capacity, and we needed to go home. Our friends called me misogynistic, controlling and told me that I can't speak for her. If she has ever been this drunk, it's been in a safe environment, not in the middle of a busy town on a Saturday night.

Friends continued to call me names, swearing at me and telling me that I need to let my her live her life. Annoyed with this, I wanted to at least sit her down. A friend an I carried her into the takeaway. As we ate I continued to express my concerns, they told me I was ruining the night. After around 20 minutes of back and forth, we called a taxi for the group to go back to a friends house.

In the taxi, a friend told me that I ruined the night. This hurt, as I was only trying to care for my wife. After getting back to the friend's house, she was too drunk to walk at all. Luckily, the friend allowed my wife to bunk with them for the night. When carrying her up the stairs, she tumbled and almost fell back down a few times. Once we got her into the room she'd be staying in, she vomited all over me and another friend.

I decided I couldn't stay in the house, I was angry at a lot of our friend group. I texted my wife letting her know that I'd walk home and that I'd pick her up in the morning.

Once I picked my wife up, I had a chat with a friend from last night. I expressed my concern, telling them that I don't beleieve they had prioritised the safety of my wife. I also explained how upset and hurt it made me when they ganged up on me when I wanted to take her home.

They rolled their eyes, telling me that there was never any need to worry. I reminded them of the events last night, and they told me that she was fine and I needed to stop trying to protect her. I don't know how to process this response, so I'm making this post. Am I the asshole, and should I apologise?

**TLDR:** Wife and I went out for a friends birthday party, she got stupid drunk. I told her it was time to go home. Friends told me to stop being misogynistic, and that she's her own person. She ended up not being able to walk and threw up over her friend.

233,Not the A-hole,"Hello, this just happened today and my family is split apart on what i did was right or wrong.

**9 Years** ago, we moved to our house, and a family friend lent us a wheelbarrow for additional work on our house. Years passed and the wheelbarrow got really really old and it's tyre blew off and the wheelbarrow itself was about to shatter. It lasted for more than 10 years but yeah. We were clearing our garage of random junk, so i put all the junk into the wheelbarrow and struggling to move it to the local garbage dump i threw it alongside the other trash. I returned to the house and my dad asked where the wheelbarrow is. I responded with ""That thing was breaking apart and the tyre is all deflated, we don't need it and its taking us a lot of space, so i left it there"". Of course, he got mad saying it was not ours to throw away, and the friend might need it, etc. I responded ""If he would have wanted it, he wouldn't have waited nearly 10 years to get it from us, besides, it's gone. The dumpster-divers took it."". He got mad and demanded that i would pay for it if the family friend wanted it back, which i gladly would; but i doubt he will have ever wanted that piece of junk back. I left the room and now my sister and dad say i am the asshole, while my mother and I believe that thing needed to be gone.

234,No A-holes here,"Long term relationship, I’m always around their family so I know them pretty well. 

His parents got divorced when he was around 5. His mom got full custody (they didn’t want a judicial battle) but his dad stayed very close. It was an amicable break up so their parents are still friends to this day and go out together, dad comes over every weekend to have lunch and watch movies with them. It’s honestly as good as a divorced couple can get. 

The issue is, even though he loves his mom he deeply dislikes and resents her. And I get it because she can be a handful sometimes but it’s nothing out of the ordinary. From what I’ve observed and what he has told me about his childhood she’s just a regular mom with regular mom flaws. 

He idolizes his dad though, and I get it because his dad is very very nice and sweet. He’s great, but my boyfriend always talks about how great he is in comparison to his evil mom. 

Now this is me wandering into psychology but I feel like he only feels this way because his mom had to do all the educating. She was the one who had to say all the no’s to him growing up. Whereas dad only came over on weekends with a gift or a ticket to the movies or a trip to the beach and let the kid do whatever he wanted. 

It started to bother me because he really resents here and once again the mom is evil for doing all the educating and the dad is fun and only does fun things. I mean obviously if I only spent weekends with my kid I’d do whatever he wanted and then I’d just drop him off at mom’s so she can be the one to force him to do his homework and brush his teeth before bed. 

It feels like a huge injustice to me that he’s an adult now and still can’t see things this way. He keeps bad mouthing his mom around me and I’m willing to start taking her side. Maybe point out what I said here to him. Would it make me an asshole to meddle like this and give my unprofessional opinion on his family dynamics?

TL;DR: my bf’s parents got divorced when he was young. He resents mom basically for educating him and idolizes his dad who only came over on weekends, did a couple fun things and then left him to be educated by mom. I think it’s unfair that he still resents her for it and sees him as a hero and it bothers me when he speaks ill of her. WIBTA to point all of this out, given that it’s very personal?",75,284,0.95
235,Not the A-hole,"My wife is 8 months pregnant and we know we are having a daughter. She and I had decided on a name and this came up at dinner last night. The name is Fatima. To be clear, we are both white Christians, our connection to the name is only as I am going to explain below. One of my friends friends said we would be culturally appropriating the name and more or less said we would be racist assholes if we did this.  I was blown away by this as I had never considered it. To me the name is a tribute to two women who cared for me as a child.

Here is why we chose the name: I have CP due to mistakes made by the doctors who delivered me. As a result I have very significant physical limitations. When I was a child this meant that I couldn’t walk at all until I was 5, and couldn’t walk without a walker until I was 12, even today going more than the length of my house without a walker is a difficult task. It also meant that I has significant issues feeding myself, washing myself, and performing just about any other everyday task that most people take for granted. With years of therapy I can largely do these things on my own, but the fact that my wife is dedicated to helping me is a godsend.

In any event, the point is that as a child I needed large amounts of help. My parents used a portion of the malpractice settlement to hire in home help for the laundry list of things I noted above.  The first person they hired who was with me from 3 until I was 11 was named Fatima. When she was ready to move the next person who was hired also in a total fluke was named Fatima. She was with me until I was 16. These two women are like second mothers to me, they were at my wedding and are in the family pictures of the wedding, I talk to them both at least once a week. As much as my parents these two women made me who I am today.

Given the huge role these women have played in my life, as a tribute to them my wife and I decided well before she ever got pregnant, that if we had a daughter we would name her Fatima. I saw this like naming a child after a grandparent and she is of the same mind. When we told the Fatimas that we planned to name our daughter after them they were both flattered and supportive. 

So, my question is this, is our tribute inappropriate? Will we be the assholes if we go through with our plan?

Edit - a couple of questions about where we live, we live in the mid Atlantic region of the US.

Second edit - huge thank you to everyone who has responded so far, my wife and I were quite worried last night, I haven’t shown her this post (I did tell her I was making it) but I feel much better, I was really worried I was missing something big. 

For those suggesting using Fatima as a middle name, thank you, it’s certainly something I’m going to talk about with my wife. I have friends who actually go by their middle name with friends and their first name professionally, so it’s certainly something we are going to think about.  Thank you all for providing this worried dad to be with some assurance he wasn’t being an insensitive jackass.

What I suspect is a final edit: well I learned what RIP my inbox really means today. In any event, thanks again to everyone who offered an opinion. To the few people being cranky with me for calling my kid “christian,” chill, seriously, it was for context as in my area I had never met a Fatima who wasn’t Muslim. Obviously we will be raising our daughter in our faith, but if she grows up and chooses to follow another, or even no religion, that’s her choice.

I learned a ton more about our chosen name, it’s history, and some other christian denominations, so thank you all.",631,2257,0.94
236,Everyone Sucks,"My dead wife is always going to hold a special place in my heart. It’s not like I talk about her all the time, but I do have tons of pictures of her/letters from her that I keep and I have them all sitting in an attic. 

Sometimes I will reminisce when no one is around, it’s not like I do it often. But I feel like I owe her that much and she didn’t die with us not loving each other. 

I just got married to my newer wife two years ago. She’s great and all, but one time she got pissed at me. When I wrote something on fb about my dead wife, It wasn’t even bad. I’m friends with her family on Facebook still and they came to my wedding. It was just a small tribute. 

So I said I wouldn’t do it again. Then she got mad a different time because she found me looking at photos/reading notes from her that I still have. She said I need to let her go, and that she knows that I loved her but your life is with me now. 

I don’t do this often, it’s just on occasion. The final straw is she saw me comment on a family members fb about her. 

Then she said this... do you love her or me more? And she wanted me to answer the question. I told her enough, and I never want her bringing up her name again. Never do I want her to say her fucking name again and drop it. Basically, I did tell her to shut the f*** up.

She told me I’m not sleeping with her tonight and go sleep on the couch and fuck off. 

Here’s the thing, out of respect for my current wife. I do not bring up my dead wife often. I try to avoid talking about her altogether because of how she feels. I do these things all away from her, and she’s still judging me for it.",1016,2648,0.94

241,Not the A-hole,"I’m 22, just graduated and moved to a new city and all that jazz. Exciting!

Well. I came home to my family for a few days to get a break from work and stuff, and I got handed theee Rubbermaid containers. My mom told me that anything that didn’t fit was getting thrown away, as she was clearing out and redecorating my childhood room. 

To make it clear, my family doesn’t need this bedroom for anything. My siblings have rooms, we have a guest suite with two little bedrooms. We’ve got space. I asked why this was happening so suddenly, and she said my room looked childish and I didn’t need it anymore.

So yesterday, she asked me to make lunch for my siblings while she dropped her boyfriend off at the airport. I said, “sorry, I’ve got to go throw away my childhood, so I can’t.” She told me I was acting like a brat and should be thankful they kept my room through college because her parents didn’t. 

Am I the asshole (or am I acting entitled, I guess)? I feel like this is all very sudden, and I’m still very much trying to find my footing in an entirely new city, and now I feel like I don’t have a home to go back to. Having to winnow everything I owned in that house down to three containers was hard, and I spent most of last night crying. She told me to stop being so dramatic. 

I honestly don’t know. I don’t want to talk to my mom at all right now. Is that rude?

Edit: seems so far like I’m the asshole. And that’s okay—that’s why I posted. I’ve got some growing up to do. I’ll leave this up to get more opinions, but I wanted to clarify one thing: it’s not really about the room. It’s about the three bins. I couldn’t fit a yearbook in the bins and asked if she would mail it to me, if I could have another container, etc., and she said no: I only get to keep what I can fit. And because it was late, no post offices or storage places were open, and I leave this morning. That probably doesn’t change anything, but a lot of people are focusing on the room, so I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t unclear in my write up!

Edit2: So. Weird edit here. I called my dad to say bye and tell him it was nice to see him, and I brought up that leaving my childhood behind was hard. My parents are in the process of getting divorced, and they haven’t legally decided who gets the house, but my mom is living in it right now because my dad travels a lot. 

Well. He said she never told him about this and that all renovation right now needs to be agreed upon. He called her and then me again, blah blah. Turns out the rush was because she was hoping to claim the house by getting rid of most of my stuff and repainting and all that. I’m super taken aback by the whole thing, and pretty sure that that’s not even the way it works anyway. Idk, man. Adulthood is weird so far. Not sure what’s going to happen, but the garbage pickup later today was cancelled. It might just be postponed—I really do recognize that I’m not getting a shrine here—but at the very least, I think I’ll be able to more fully go through my things when I’m back for Thanksgiving. 

So... guess that’s that. I’m at the airport, but I told my mom I’d call her when I land and we can talk through all this. I don’t like that she was potentially using me as a divorce pawn here, as I’ve tried really hard to stay out of all of it. But it also helps slightly to know that the rush was for a reason, if that makes sense?",404,1799,0.95
242,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend (25) was into ventriloquism as a kid, and did it at a talent show. He bought a ventriloquists dummy, which he used pretty often between 10 and 13, and then he just put it down and never picked it up again. Since we started dating he learnt that I (23f) hate ventriloquist dummies. That one episode of Buffy freaked me out when I was a kid and a while ago we took my nephew to see Goosebumps, which has a ventriloquist dummy as the main antagonist, and it scared the fuck out of me. My boyfriend noticed and made fun of me, and I explained it, and after that whenever we saw a ventriloquist dummy (which admittedly wasn't very often) he pointed it out and made a joke about it scaring me.

He went to visit his parent's at their house about a 2 weeks ago and found his old dummy. He took it back to our flat and while I was at work, he hid it in the shower. I got home, went to shower, and screamed when I was face to face with that thing. He laughed his arse off and eventually apologized and said he wouldn't do it again (I was really freaked out which gave way to being annoyed so he probably felt like he had to).

I thought that was the end of it, then the next morning I got up, went to get some cereal, and it was in the cupboard. More screaming ensued and another promise to not do it again. In the last two weeks I've found it 5 more times. In the laundry basket, in my work bag, in the wardrobe, the bathroom cabinet, and taped to the ceiling above our bed so when I lied back it was staring back at me. That was the final straw for me. I jumped up, yanked it down, and told my boyfriend that if I ever saw the dummy anywhere but the case he kept it in ever again I'd throw it out. He apologized again and agreed that he would cut it out. This last one was a few days ago.

Then this morning I got home from a graveyard shift (started at 9pm, worked until 6am), I was ready to go to bed, and when I got to the bedroom the dummy was in the bed, with its head against a pillow like it was sleeping. I picked it up and brought up snapchat, and I sent my boyfriend a video of me throwing it in the garbage, and then I went to bed.

I've woken up to a bunch of messages saying that the dummy had sentimental value and he couldn't believe I would do something like this, but I did warn him that if I saw that thing again I'd throw it out. It's literally just in the garbage can in the kitchen, and the bag has been recently replaced so the dummy is the only thing in it right now, but I refuse to go get it or apologise for putting it in there. I'm just starting to wonder if I've gone too far.

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: PLEASE stop saying the dummy has been moving itself around. I know it's not true but that doesn't prevent the image of it climbing out of the bin and coming to get me.

INFO: I recently took out the bin bag to throw it away, so the only thing in the bin when I put the dummy in there was a clean bin bag. There is nothing in the bin except the dummy. The objective wasn't to ruin the dummy, more to prove that I meant what I said about binning it. It's in the kitchen right now.

UPDATE: He has come home, taken the doll out of the bin, and sat it on the dresser, facing the bed. I feel like it's watching me.",412,1634,0.96
243,Asshole,"I am a first year medical student at a small school (~100 students per class). Last year, when applying to med school, I took advantage of the hosting system that schools offered. Basically current students would let you stay at their apartment the night before for free, because the application process is expensive (I spent around $6000 in total on it). I had 6 interviews, and used a host for 4 of them.

Now that I'm a student, I'm being asked to host now. I said yes once as it was a student from my undergrad. Overall I didn't like it. Her flight got delayed so I had to stay up much later than usual waiting for her. I have a roommate, but I have to provide the towels and bedding. We each have our own bathroom, but mine is in the common area so I am the one who has to share hers. It's just a little awkward having a stranger sleep on your couch.

The thing is though that the school is desperate for more hosts. They basically beg us to host. I don't want to host any more, but that would lead to either the same classmates of mine hosting constantly, or forcing these poor interviewees to Shell out more money for a hotel. Morally I feel wrong ignoring the requests to host as I benefitted from it last year, but I also feel like I shouldn't be obligated to host strangers. AITA?

Update: Thanks everyone for the judgement. Seems like leaning towards YTA but plenty of NAH mixed in. I think the problem is that I have lived in this apartment for 2 months and I've had guests for approximately 30 nights so far. 6 were my friends and my mom, the rest were roommates parents, significant other, and my interviewee. It's been way too many nights of guests, so I've been avoiding more hosting. I was never considering never hosting again, which I should have mentioned. But the school asks a couple times a week which is too much for me. Even if it makes me a little bit of TA, I'm fine with saying no most of the time now so that I can be comfortable and able to study well in my home, but I do plan on hosting at least 6 or 7 more nights this year.",52,36,0.87
244,No A-holes here,"Some very relevant information: My father bought a watch he loved before he died. He was always into planes, constantly on planes, took some flight school lessons. He got a Breitling, a very high end pilot's watch. One of the major features, in fact - the selling point for my father, was that it had an emergency beacon, similar to an airplane's black box. In the wildly unrealistic situation where the plane crashed and he survived only to be lost at sea or something, he'd have a ridiculously good chance of being found.  Here's the issue. I'm about to start working as a flight attendant. The love of travel, combined with my father's passion for airplanes that rubbed off on me, has kind of made it my dream job. His love of watches did, too, and the dream watch that he bought is my dream watch . . . with one exception. The technology for beacons has changed, and his watch isn't as (hypothetically) useful as it once was. Meanwhile, Breitling, the same company that made his watch, has made the same watch, ""2."" It's basically the same, but with more modern beacons. I want it for all the same reasons my dad wanted his, the biggest difference being that I can't afford it. I suggested selling my dad's watch (which was left to me, specifically) to finance the bulk of the purchase and my mother kind of shit a brick that I would throw away my dad's watch. I get wanting to keep things that were important to him, and I get that I can save up and buy the one I prefer later, but I genuinely think my dad would be on my side. He was super practical. When he was dying, he would say stuff like, ""I won't be sending you signs from the other side. When I'm gone, I'm gone, and you need to move forward."" I think if he were here, he'd tell me to sell the watch for one that did the job better . . .and I'd still think of him every time I checked the time. My mom is upset about the idea, but she never even understood why he spent so much on a watch in the first place. 

Edit: Comments have made me realize something very against my case. My father *would* tell me to sell the watch. My father would *absolutely never* allow me to hurt my mother's feelings, and now I can't do it without her blessing. Crap.

Edit 2: Addressing some frequently brought up things because people are still commenting and it's too much work to do it individually. 

1) The old watch cannot be fitted with the new transmitter.  The old watch was a massive one, the new one is actually a Flavor Flav necklace. 

2) I felt I was pretty clear in my O.P. that the feature would be almost guaranteed to never be used, and that wasn't really the point, but I did feel the need to add that while surviving a plane crash and becoming lost at sea happens basically only in Tom Hanks movies, I do climb, ski, backpack, and a half dozen other activities that could result in SAR calls. If all my friends owned the watch, a couple would still be around.  It's one of those things that's totally useless, until it isn't. 

3) Yes, I could definitely buy a transmitter that is not part of a luxury watch for pretty cheap. After reflection, when I said I wasn't sentimental towards his watch, I was half wrong. I'm sentimental about why he chose it, and I'm sentimental about how similar we are in that respect. I would feel more sentiment for a watch chosen by our shared thought process. Neither of us would would wear the old watch feeling like it was the perfect watch while the better one exists.

4) There are accusations that I'm not even a watch guy because I misspelled, ""Breitling."" Yes, I know how to spell it. My guess is that I misspelled it at some point and my phone just remembered it that way, then I didn't catch my mistake because 10 hours of driving for Uber will turn your brain into pudding. Also . . . what non-watch guy would sell that watch to buy a more expensive one? They'd buy something else with the money or just show off the one they have that's still a notable piece. This is kind of just a weird logical jump, to me.

5) Sent Breitling C.S. an email.  Nothing yet.

6) ""NTA, but don't do it!"" is probably the most common response. On that note, I get it, but he left a lot of stuff behind, and over the years since he died(15), we've sold or kept things along the route.  I cried when we sold his convertible. I still have the plate. His law school class ring was second to his marriage certificate in terms of treasured possessions, that's not going anywhere. I get, *and feel*, the desire to keep the watch, like everything else we've slowly let go of, but, for me, I think the scales tip towards moving forward from this thing. We've parted with so much of his stuff that I was actually surprised that my mother objected to parting with the watch. So again, she thinks it's more special than I do, and I put her feelings over a watch, always

Nothing romantic or sexual ever happened between us since we split. Matt has made mistakes over the past few years and now the building is being foreclosed. Which is where myself and two of his other close friends will now step in and buy out the debt, stopping the foreclosure, in exchange for each 1/12 ownership of the building, which equals exactly one appartment. 

The legal part is being handled by a notary and is not of concern here. The debt is 150k, each of us three people will foot one third. The building, if sold in a proper way, should go for somewhere between 800 and 900k. The plan is to bail out Matt and his building, and then we try to sell the building in a timely manner. 

Dominic, my current boyfriend of a year and a half, will have a huge issue with this. I already know that. He always disapproved of me staying in touch with Matt (who is not my most recent ex, and the only ex who I still talk to). I never budged to cut contact because there is nothing at all going on that my boyfriend should worry about. But he will end things with me if I told him I put 50k into that property. 

For me I see it as a win win situation. Matt doesn't want to let the property go for in worst case half of what it's worth. I see it as a great investment. The money would come entirely out of my savings account, which Dominic has no insight into. It will not have any financial effect on our relationship.

251,Not the A-hole,"Very long story but happy to answer questions. Basically my niece (brother’s daughter, 13) lives with me (F32) and my mum (63) because her home life with her mother (37) has gotten really bad since her dad passed 3 years ago. My niece (let’s call her L) has matured massively in the 6 months she’s been living with us, and chooses to stay with us. She doesn’t want a relationship with her neglectful and emotionally abusive mother, but we are trying to get her to rebuild it. She also has a younger brother and sister who still live at home, and recently her mother has stopped all of us from seeing them because L won’t go back home. 
Anyway, L agreed to meet her mum a couple of days ago to try and work on building a relationship. Things were fine at first, but soon into the meeting her mother told her that she ‘might have cancer’ because she’s had a smear test and they’ve found abnormal cells. (I, myself have shown abnormal cells 3 time and have two treatments for it - so I know how routine the procedure is and how easily this can happen)
When L came home from the meeting she was in tears thinking that her mum might die, obviously feeling guilty that she currently doesn’t have a relationship with her, and also pretty devastated because she’s already lost her father. 
I personally think it’s a disgusting thing to say to an already damaged child, whether the severity of it is true or not, and I can only think it’s just for attention and emotional blackmail. Also this is just one thing on a long line of the the problems she has caused for L. 
Am I being a cow or is she really the asshole?

EDIT (for clarity)
my mum and I aren’t forcing her to have a relationship with her mother, we have told her she’s old enough to make her own choice and if she doesn’t want to see her then that’s up to her. however, she is getting pressure from her mums side of the family so I think a part of her feels guilt-tripped into making an effort, so we just support her choice. Also, we are taking matters to court to get access to the other two children, as we feel she is withholding them so that we’ll make L see her.",45,129,0.92
252,No A-holes here,"To begin with I would clarify that I love dogs and have been in previous long-term relationships where my partner have had a dog, without any problems. I would probably have a dog myself if it weren't for my current job situation.

My(M) gf(F) got a request from an acquaintance if she would like to take over/adopt her daughters(F16) dog(M1-2). A small ""handbag dog"". Apparently her daughter didn't have enough time to take care of it.. My gf borrowed it for a week and fell inn love with it, and adopted it.

It early became clear that the dog was way to spoiled and overly attached to my gf (it was like this with the previous owner too). She couldn't go take a shit without the dog started crying and barking outside the bathroom. And every time I would come visit, it became so jealous when I touched or even spoke to my gf. The dog started biting me, eating my clothes, barking and humping me. When I tried to correct him by speaking to it or firmly grab its neck skin to pull him away (not hurting him), the dog would act up and make a cry, and my gf would jell at me for hurting him, and it all would be turned over to become my fault, and the dog continued. My gf is not capable of being strict with the dog, or not in the right way I believe, she talks to it in a child's voice, the dog does not respect her or me. The dog does whatever it wants, and you have to speak to it numerous times before he listens.

We have had a couple of arguments about the dog. I don't like it, we almost never argue, and its stupid to argue over a dog.When I bring up the behavior of the dog, I automatically become the bad guy. Shes is always forcing me to say/confirm that the dog look so cute, and its so nice. But I don't thinks so, so that also becomes a problem for her. She can't see that the dog is not respecting either of us. And I think that is the most frustrating part for me. And the argument she uses back to me, ""you haven't been to a dog training course"" ""and ""you don't punish dogs"". And shes right, I haven't been to a dog training course, but she has.

I also talked to someone with experience with several dogs. And they told that when someone gives away a dog for free like that, its a red flag. I feel that my gf may have been tricked to take a dog in a condition that is ""irreparable"", especially for someone that's not strict enough.

I work abroad, so I see my gf in the weekends every two weeks or so. So i want the days with her to count, and be nice. I just bought a house, and I would love for her to move in eventually. But I don't want to house a dog that doesn't respect us. On the other hand I think it would be nice for her to have a dog when i'm at work, so I'm all for a dog.

TL;DR - I think my gf's dog is a bad dog and it's disrupting our relationship.",58,88,0.91

Me, my wife and my (16 year old)son live in an apartment, so we share the bathroom. He always took long showers(30 minutes or so), but lately he’s been taking it too far. He gets in bathroom for an hour, two hours. 

Last straw was few days ago when stayed there for 3.5 HOURS. That’s just not reasonable in my opinion. I told him that he wouldn’t lock the door from now on and if he took longer than 40 minutes I’d walk in. He’s not happy about it.

My wife thinks I’m being too strict and not respecting his privacy.


More info: he has his own room and he can lock door any time he wants, so he has privacy. I’ve talked to him multiple times and he just ignores me. He also doesn’t take his phone in there(some of you suggested that I turn off wifi while he’s in there).

On their weeks they barely spend time with the kids unless it’s the weekend, but the kids LOVE my ex and think their house is like a playground. I spend a lot of time with them and teach them so many things but it’s like my house is the boring, normal life house and ex’s house is the party house. The kids are 4, 6 and 10. 

For example, my ex hired two babysitters to take care of the kids while they’re at work. Except ex is paying extra to use Elsa and Anna impersonators instead of regular babysitters. 4 and 6 year olds LOVE frozen and always tell me about them. 

10 year old loves to play games. Ex I think has a big projector screen to play games on, so now my son is treating my TV like the downgraded version. He likes to invite his friends to play at ex’s house but not my house as much. 

Ex takes them to Disneyland roughly once a month. I can’t afford that. 

I mostly make meals for the family. Ex has a lot of food delivered, never properly learned to cook. The kids have asked me to order food from the places my ex likes but again, I can’t afford that. Once a week or so is fine but regularly spending $100 on the family’s meal is too much.

Lots of things like this. I had enough and sat the kids down to tell them the important thing in life is time together.  I told them that when ex pays for these things all the time that is not the way to a happy family and it’s better to have a parent who can be with you than a parent who is at work all the time.

262,Not the A-hole,"My parents are Irish and Dutch and live in Scotland where I was brought up; they've always been a little overly strict and judgemental of me - for example, my dad still considers my vegetarianism 'a phase' after 9 years; when I graduated with a 2:i (in physics from St Andrews, no less) my parents simply told me I should've gotten a 1st (despite the fact I worked jobs, volunteered, did sports, and was incredibly ill for the whole of university). I became independent at a very young age (financially and otherwise) and once I left for university I would return maybe twice a year for a few days if I had to, despite my parents living only an hour away; we just don't quite see eye-to-eye.

After graduating this summer I moved to The Netherlands in order to do a PhD; the thing is - my parents holiday 7x per annum and my mum is Dutch. My brother, too, loves The Netherlands and keeps telling me dates that he and his gf are planning on coming to The Netherlands.   Aside from Brexit, good working conditions, and incredible research, I moved here to be further from my parents. 

Very shortly after I had accepted my PhD offer, my parents announced that they were coming to visit to avoid Brexit and had booked hotels etc.; they hadn't consulted me and (as it turns out) I'm actually back in Scotland prompting some nasty comments about being ungrateful and selfish. I have no doubt that they'll be rocking up whenever suits them, alongside my brother, because it's a cheap excuse for a holiday. They all already have presented a list of dates they want to be in The Netherlands for - mostly things which benefit them (Eurovision, Koningsdag, their birthdays, Brexit day) - and are using me as an excuse to justify coming over.

I don't think any of them fully understand the amount of pressure and work a PhD puts on a person. I'm not going to be able to drop everything I'm doing to entertain people (who are never pleased) for a weekend: I'll have shiftwork which will involve very early mornings and very late nights; I'm being sent to various institutions to learn how to work apparatus.

She wants to take my surname on marriage, I feel strongly against that I said to her that'd be very weird, she's not my dad's son. She's also suggesting we get joint surnames (hyphenate them together), I don't like this idea either as I'm not interesting in taking someone else's family name.

She's telling me I'm being too controlling over her agency to pick her name. She is also upset that I'm not interested in ""showing unity"" with our names. However, I'm very adamant on my stance on this and nothing right now is making me willing to change my position. She doesn't take my surname and I don't want hers. She does feel strongly with unity in names and often ends with fights where she cries that I don't respect her choice.

Legally, she can change her name to whatever she wants (within the law). To that extent I certainly can't actually disallow or stop her from legally changing her name. What I can do and what I am doing is very much not giving her my blessing and voice disagreement of her taking my surname.

I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.

This summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.

I didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.

I'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.

L has mentioned getting a puppy in the past, but knows my cat doesnt do well with other animals. She also cant really afford it, and the plan was to split it with her bf, who she dumped last week but theyre back together now

A few days ago L told us she was going to go look at a puppy with her bf. S and I raised our own suspicions, mine regarding how my cat would not be okay with a puppy, and S about how it doesnt seem like a good idea to take that on in an unstable relationship. L said that she cant keep basing her decisions off of a cat that HATES her and assured me the puppy would only be at the house when her bf couldnt be home, but never specified how often that would be. I kind of shrugged it off, thought it was ridiculous and shed snap out of it

The next day she was complaining about how both of their parents think its a terrible idea, she doesnt know what shed do with it during breaks bc it cant stay at her moms house, should she be putting her money into this when she can barely afford rent, should she get it with her bf when he wanted to be single last week, etc. I told her I didnt think it was a good idea. She said she couldnt consider my opinion because Im biased due to my cat. Again, I shrugged it off. Not gonna happen

The following day was the big decision day, and I realized that the possibility still existed for her to get a puppy. Mind you she never once explicitly asked us for input, or considered the input we had given, in her decision. I texted her and assertively told her I didnt think it was fair that we had no say. S has been pretty neutral about it, she thinks its stupid but she generally avoids conflict. L replied saying that the cat hates her, itll only be here for 8mo, she DID consider me by having it stay primarily at her bfs house, and I hurt her feelings because IM not considering HER happiness. I explained that the cat was part of the living agreement. Her well being will definitely be affected by this, and Im not sorry that shes a primary factor in my discontent

Then she told me she already got the puppy, but shes been SOBBING and distraught because she thought her friends would be supportive and I made her feel like shit.

In the car Rebecca was sitting in the front seat. It was a long journey to the wedding venue and she spent most of it taking pictures of herself for snap chat or whatever like most people her age do. 

It was a warm sunny day so we had the car windows open, and Rebecca was sticking her hand out of the window and eventually her face to ''feel the breeze''. I warned her several times not to do this, and eventually Rebecca's glasses ended up going flying off her face. We were driving fast on a motorway so there wasn't much chance of us being able to go back for the glasses. 

Rebecca needs a very strong prescription (-26) so going without glasses isn't really something she can manage. She didn't bring a spare pair with her but she does have one at home. She was upset and asked if we could go back for them. However, we were far closer to our destination than our home, and going back would take hours and we would miss the wedding. The younger kids were getting restless and spending the entire day in the car would be very frustrating for them. 

At the wedding Rebecca was upset at being unable to see anything. Her siblings had to guide her around everywhere and she felt ''humiliated'' at having two younger kids literally dragging her around everywhere. She didn't know where to look in photos and couldn't see what the bride and groom looked like. 

When we got home Rebecca got Amanda to get her spare pair of glasses, and as soon as she put them on she ran off to her room and we could hear her crying for a long time. 

I told Amanda what happened and she was not happy with me. She asked how I could be so ''irresponsible'' as to let our daughter be blind for hours.

To keep the budget low, my fiancé and I left people off the list that we would have wanted to come because the guest count was getting too high. Also, we did not give most of the single guests a +1. To be honest, I didn’t want my parents to have to pay for random tinder dates that the single ones would have brought along. The only single guests that got a +1 were the ones that wouldn’t know anyone at the wedding. 

One guest we invited is a family friend. We did not give them +1 because they (as far as we knew) were single and are a longtime family friend so they will know plenty of people at the wedding. We recently got back their RSVP card where they scratched out the “1” signifying the number of seats we were giving them and wrote in a “2” with a “please!? Love ya!” written under it. 

I told my parents, they laughed at the audacity, but ultimately have a “what can you do” attitude and included them in the count. I want to disinvite this guest’s +1. I feel like it’s rude to automatically assume we can accommodate extra guests, especially since we left people off to keep costs low. I feel like if they thought us giving them 1 invite instead of 2 was an oversight on our part, they should have called us to at least have a dialogue about it and see if we could accommodate instead of automatically assuming.

A few days ago, she found out she is 8 weeks pregnant. It's already a high risk pregnancy because she had an IUD when she conceived. Well, she's not the most financially stable so she had asked my wife and I to adopt the baby if she makes it full term. We happily agreed, as we are a lesbian couple and IVF is about ten thousand dollars.

Fast forward to this morning. My wife recieved a message asking for a ride to the grocery store for some Sprite, as well as a ride to the pot shop so she can ""stop throwing up"". Now, my wife had just woken up and was not quite thinking straight. She said yes, but we had a few things to do beforehand so it would be a little while.

A couple hours later, my wife brought it up to me. We both agreed that taking her to get weed was something we couldn't do if we were going to adopt her baby. I sent our neighbor a message and told her ""I'm sorry, I can't condone smoking while pregnant."" She proceeds to go off on me saying we are no longer their adoption option, that she smoked with both of her boys, that her OB is fine with it, and ""yes I smoke, but that doesn't impact my children.""

We don't know at that point if he was only emotionally cheating or if the receipt from the hotel meant he actually met up with her. My mom listened to him and agreed to give him another chance (I saw another as I said this is a long story and this was one of many chances). 

I wrote my dad a long letter at the time and basically said ""listen if you want to leave mom, do it but don't cheat. I don't care of you leave and then start a relationship, but if you leave mom for this woman you're cheating on her with, I want nothing to do with you, you won't be invited to my wedding (I'm engaged), and you'll never meet any kids I have.""

I did this because the woman he's been cheating on her with is also married and has also been harassing my mom (she called her at work from different numbers so my mom wouldn't know not to answer, taunting her and telling her she was a dumb fucking bitch). She's evil and if my dad wants to be with her I want nothing to do with either of them.

I'm now in my 30s and kept my promise to myself, and barring visits from close family I never have company over, it's bliss. However, about a month ago my brother (26) had a break-up and was kicked out of his apartment, so putting family over my own hang-ups I invited him to stay with me for a few weeks until he gets back on his feet. I was fine with this. Take note that he doesn't pay rent, buy his own groceries, etc. He's here for free, using my utilities and has free access to the food until he leaves. Guest, not tenant.

We're now having a conflict because he's been trying (and in two instances, actually going ahead and doing it) to invite his friends over to my place. The first time, I came home from work to see him and his friend sitting in the living room. I asked his friend to leave, and told my brother he knows how I feel about my space, and that he had no right to invite someone over without asking. He apologized, until the next day where he began a trend of nagging/complaining that he wants to be able to have his friends over, making a variety of excuses/justifications and compromises such as they'll stay in his guest room, they'll only be over for a little while, they'll be respectful and so on. These conversations might happen 3 times per day, everyday, for the past week. Each time I refuse.

Fast forward to this thursday. I once again come home to hear my brother talking to someone in my home gym and listen. He has two friends over working out. I again kick them both out immediately. This leads to a major argument where my brother calls me an asshole, tells me that he's going through a hard time and doesn't feel ready to go out anywhere and socialize yet due to distress from his break-up, so he wants to invite friends to come over for support and socialization since he ""needs it right now"", and that there's ""no reason for me to have a problem with it since he can have them over when I'm out so they don't bother me.""

My argument is that it's my home, and I don't want anyone I don't personally care for inside of it. I don't want them on my furniture, using my stuff, sitting on my toilet, drinking from my glasses. It makes me uncomfortable, and that should be enough. I told him it's my house, not a support group, and that he's staying rent-free as a guest and has no right to go over my head. I told him nothing stops him from going to their house or meeting elsewhere if he wanted to.

He refused to drop it, so I told him that he has another week to find an apartment for himself. I know I'm a (very content) recluse, but am I an asshole?

Edit: In his defense, his friends aren't rude people. But I still don't really want these people in my home.",271,1732,0.97
280,Not the A-hole,"I (17F) work in my family's small restaurant that we opened a couple weeks ago (the size is closer to that of a small cafe's). Its very casual, and has gotten some great reviews online, attracting quite a crowd during the evenings. One lunch service, which is much more quiet, a man sits on our patio with his wife. the bar is less than 5 metres away, and the double-door is open, and my mother is by the window talking with a supplier. Normally people come into the bar, order a drink and we take it to them. these people insisted on staying outside, and left a review saying that we were 'bad asians' for being lazy, and called out another waitress for playing on her phone on the job. (in reality, her son had an accident in another country, and she had to contact her ex-husband in the same country to look after him.)
He then publicly states that noone should go to the restaurant, because he himself had to walk to the bar and talk to the barman, and that people should go to the place across the street to get served 'with a friendly smile', on the facebook page for our town, despite our apologies and free beverages. (he didnt actually order anything.)

so upon reading his comment, i got angry and left a passive aggressive reply. it involved me saying that:
-the lady on the phone would be very happy yo hear that she has an admirer- his wife should be jealous!😜
- that we really apologise for being lazy to the point that that he *actually* has to stand up to grab a menu,
- that we're super thankful that he took the time to write a very, *very* long message on tripadvisor AND facebook. 
- and that us asians are sorry we've disappointed him this time, and that next time we can be more like *those* asians, if he'd like. 😉

this quickly gained much support online, and hes had a bit of hate already. both out of defense of our restaurant, but also due to his not-so-friendly delivery. 
However, i feel like ive gone too far- he gave his opinion (badly said, but still) yet we attacked him as a popular local business for it, leading to other people bullying and ridiculing him online too. AITA?",74,33,0.78

282,Not the A-hole,"I was traveling in for business the majority of this week. I suggested my husband join me for the last night of my business trip and then we would also stay one more night on our own. My flight was purchased using my companies travel site and my husband booked his on his own. 

We both have TSA Pre Check, but for some reason it didn’t print on his boarding pass- and we didn’t notice until we were pretty far away from the check in area. Neither the pre check not regular screening line were long. I told him I would meet him on the other side because I really didn’t want to hassle with taking out my toiletries nor lap top (I hadn’t packed them strategically for quick access, so it would have meant busting open my carry on suitcase and digging towards the bottom to fish them out). He said okay then walked to his area. 

We both got thru security in less than 10 minutes and I was standing near his checkpoint when he passed thru and he saw me immediately. 

When I went up to him he seemed irritated that I didn’t stay with him, so asked if he was mad and he said he wouldn’t have done that to me. I apologized, but really don’t think I did anything that terrible.

284,Asshole,"Hello good people, this question has bugged me for quite some time and a recent incident convinced me to come to this sub to get an answer. 

I live in the US and drive on the highway for 2-3 hours on trips quite often. I don't drive too high above the speed limit, I use my signal to change lanes, and I'm a defensive driver, so all in all I consider myself a relatively safe driver. If I'm on long stretches of highway, I typically get in the left most lane and set my cruise control to 10 miles above the speed limit (or what traffic is currently going) so I don't have to worry about switching lanes and keeping my foot on the pedal constantly for long periods of time as I get foot cramps really easily that are painful and annoying on long car rides. However, I realize that some people want to go faster than 10 miles over the speed limit, but I always figured going 80 mph in a 70 mph is a reasonable speed and there's usually an oppurtuntity for people to pass me in another lane. 

However, I was driving the other night on a trip and I did my usual thing. Things were fine for a while, but then a large truck came up right behind me and began tailing me. There were plenty of opportunities for the truck to get into another lane and get ahead of me, but it continued to tail me, getting dangerously close to me. Finally, the truck switched lanes, sped up, and then jumped back into my lane. They then proceeded to brake check me, forcing me to slow down. To prevent them from doing anything further, I changed lanes and slowed down to around 65 mph in a 70 mph zone on the highway.

290,No A-holes here,"My mom has a history of not taking no for an answer, even when it comes to politely turning down a beverage. She is a MEGA fan of a particular country artist. I am not a fan of country music much in general, and don't care for this particular artist. I have gone to country concerts with my mom in the past, to artists that I at least find somewhat enjoyable. 



Her favorite artist is performing in my area tomorrow. We had a conversation earlier this week that went as follows:



Mom: Have you ever seen (artist)?


Me: Nope.


Mom: Do you want to? He's in town this weekend.


Me: Nope.




So today, we are out and about are near the ticket office. She stops ""just to see what's still available."" When she's done, I see her walking toward me with a little envelope in hand. I observe that she bought tickets to tomorrow (Sunday) night's show. She says ""Well you said you've never seen (artist)!"" To which I remind her that I also said I don't want to. She tells me they are front row, I stick to my guns. I have zero interest and I have to work Monday morning, I don't want to be out at a concert until 11pm the night before. She looked very disappointed and defeated and said she would try to find someone else to go.

293,Asshole,"My wife (28f) and I (30m) had a baby who is now 3 months old. When we were trying to conceive, her dad (83m) had 2 massive strokes that have now left him bed ridden, with very limited use of his legs and his arms, due to all that, plus his age, we are fairly certain this will be the last grandchild he will know (the rest of her siblings have no interest in having kids any time soon) 

When we found out were having a boy, we decided to name him after her dad, Jackson, with 2 middle names after my own dad (James and Robert) When we told my parents the name, my dad showed his dislike for it, and suggested his own name, we explained that we were naming him after my wife's dad, but that his middle names would be after him, he seemed annoyed but didn't bring it up again.

When our son was born, everyone called him Jackson, except my dad, who refers to him as JR (his own initials) my wife didn't say anything at first, and I didn't think to much of it. Now that our baby has gotten a bit bigger, she has actually expressed her annoyance in it to me, and said we should say something to my dad, as my wife finds it disrespectful. I admit I was taken back, as I don't think it that big of a deal as it  is his grandson as well, and he should be able to call him what he wants. My wife got a little upset and said that  our sons name means something to her, and that she will express so to my dad herself. I told her not to cause drama over something so small, and to move on from the fact that my dad will refer to our son as JR. She is now hurt that I am brushing off something important to her, but I honestly don't think it be worth what the outcome will probably be. AITA

Edit: well then, I wasnt expecting so many responses lol, but, just to clear a few things up (sorry if some of my explanation  was hard to understand);

 My son's first name is Jackson and his middle names are James Robert, plus our last name, so as some of you pointed out, he does have 3 names from my dad.

It's actually my wife's dad that is much older and has unfortunately suffered from strokes, not my own dad. We did name our son after him, not only because we like the name, but to honor him. 

And I guess to give an actual update, I feel like more of an idiot then anything, and my dad is being a dick in this situation. My wife did in fact bring it up to my dad (much to my annoyance at first) she just politely asked him why he never calls him Jackson, and he laughed and actually said ""why would I even flirt with that idea when JR is so much better"" I fucking thought wifey was gonna go Laura Dern in BLL (yes I am  a man, yes I watched that show, and yes I think those women are nation treasures, moving on now)

My wife then reminded him that he should flirt with the idea because Jackson is indeed his name, and she would disagree with JR being better, which is evident do to the fact that's what her and I both decided on. (This is the exact situation I was refering to that would happen) 

Dad says he's grandpa, it's his first grandson and will continue to call him JR and then brought me into it, asking if  I mind. At this point, I was more pissed off at my dad for openly admitting he had no intentions of calling our son by his name, and then telling my wife he could care less how she felt about it (which I am also TA for, I accept my fate, thank you Reddit) and told my dad to refer to him as Jackson, ( no sleeping on the couch for this guy) 

My wife then more or less told him that if our son chooses to go by a nickname, then that would be fine, but because he's a baby and can't decide for himself, he came out of her juju, so she speaks for him right now ( and I ain't gonna disagree with that)

Honestly, bad jokes aside, I feel like an idiot for brushing it off, my FIL is an amazing, strong man and father and I am very proud to have our son named after him, and I let the thought of what I perceived as petty conflict, overlook what my wife was feeling, and I am an ass for that.

Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, my dad is very pissed off right now and I guess I will see how that plays out and where we all go from here.",998,4583,0.95
294,Not the A-hole,"I met her about 6 months ago. I thought she was really attractive and we hit it off (flirty behavior, her touching me, her asking the group who here is single, etc)

So I thought there was something there. So the her group of friends invited me to hang out with them. The group would hang out often (approx 2-3x a week). So for the next couple of weeks, I hang out with the group. During these events, I thought she was into me (we would dance together, she would jump on my back and I would give her a piggy back ride). A couple of weeks into this, I asked her if she wanted to go on a date with me and she said no. I was taken aback but her answer. She said she didn't want to lose me as a friend so then she said she would go to dinner with me but as friends. I told her I'm not naive, I can take a no for an answer and I've been rejected before. If she wants to be friends, I can still be friends.

So from then, she wanted me to hang out with the same frequency as before. At first, I didn't want to appear to be a ""nice guy"" who just wanted to hang out with her just because I wanted to date her so I kept hanging out with the group.  I didn't even see my best friends as much as I did her.

During this time, she was still really flirty. When she hanged out with my friends, even they commented on it. A noticeable incident during this time was one time we were suppose to hang as a group but everyone bailed so it was just me and her. She wasn't happy I started invited another girl to hang. I think her words were: ""No, don't invite her, I just wanted to hang out with you tonight."" I had thought maybe she didn't know how she felt also, so I asked one of her friends about it and learned she had a crush on someone else, so I dropped it.

After this, I started to get over my crush on her and realized we're not that compatible together. Her and her friend groups (while nice people) aren't the type of friends I normally hang out with. We just have different interests. I would only do something with the group if they were doing an activity I would want to do but I wouldn't just do something with them just to hang with them.

With this realization, I started rejecting hanging out with her group when there was a conflict or if I didn't want to do the activity (before I would always hang out with them). During this time, she would keep texting me as before (every day) but I wouldn't keep up with my replies and then stopped replying to her all together. Some of these messages  started getting weird. Examples would be:

>I miss your face

&#x200B;

>Aw, you look really happy in this story. I miss your laughter \[in response to an IG story\]

&#x200B;

>We're hanging out tonight and I'm thinking of you!

I really stopped responding to these messages. But I still get them once a week from her. No one else in the group messages me.  So what's the verdict? Am I an asshole?",47,53,0.93

296,Not the A-hole,"There's a few people to keep track of so I'm hoping this makes it easier:

* Me
* Katie- my daughter
* Ben - my ex husband and Katie's biological father
* Percy - my partner of 6 years
* Lisa - Ben's wife
* Chris - the mother of one of Katie's new friends.

Katie is 13. Ben and I divorced when she was 4, and we have 50/50 custody, so she stays with him every other week. They have a pretty good relationship. Katie refers to Lisa, Ben's new wife, as ""Lisa"", not mum or stepmum or anything like that.

I met Percy when Katie was 7. He moved in a few years ago, when Katie was 10, and he tries with Katie, but she's not nearly as close with him as she is with Ben, the same way she's not as close with Lisa as she is with me.

&#x200B;

Anyway, Percy was picking Katie up from a friend's house. Chris had never met Percy before, but had met Ben, so when Percy came to knock and get Katie, Chris asked who he was. Percy said he was Katie's father, Chris says ""no you're not"". Katie heard the exchange, comes to the door, and says ""oh, that's my mum's boyfriend"". Chris apologised for the misunderstanding.

Percy brought Katie home, and I saw them arguing as they approached the house, but couldn't hear what they were saying. They get in, and Katie immediately goes to her room.

Me: What happened?

Percy: We had a fight.

Me: I can see that. What happened?

Percy: \[recaps what happened with Chris\]

Me: And then what?

Percy: I drove her home, we talked and now she's mad at me.

Me: What did you talk about?

Percy: I just said that to stop stuff like this happening again she should tell people in advance that she has 2 dads. She said she doesn't have 2 dads. She's got him and me, I've looked after her, I've been there for her for 5 years.

Me: You know she loves you, but she's so close with Ben it's probably just weird for her.

Percy: I've been in her life as much as she has, I'm her dad too as far as I'm concerned.

Me: But you might not be as far as Katie is concerned. Lisa has been with Ben since we split up, she still calls her Lisa. I get why you're upset, but this should not be such a big deal.

Percy: Ben left you! Both of you! I'm the one that stuck around!

Me: Ben is Katie's dad, you are my boyfriend. She will call you both what she likes. Get over it.

Percy left. He texted to say he'll be back later but I feel insanely shitty. I told Katie to call them both what she likes and not feel pressured, and I know that was the right thing to do, but I feel like I could have handled the actual argument a lot better than I did. AITA?

In terms of ""get over it"". I was worried that giving him validation, by saying something like ""give it time"" or ""she'll come around"" would give him false hope. Katie has said to me that she has a dad, and a mum, and she's not about to start calling Lisa ""mum"" any more than she's about to start calling Percy ""dad"". I felt in the moment that if I didn't communicate that this was Katie's choice and he had to decide if he could work with it, and instead gave him false hope that she'd change her mind, it would only make things worse because he would think there was a possibility she could change her mind.",954,7376,0.94
297,Asshole,"To be honest I've always been very insecure about my general self. As expected I was never particularly popular in elementary and middle school, but I still had friends. But then my family moved to a new state.

I went to a small high school and in mid-ninth grade, I became one of the popular girls. I was shocked but delighted, until I realized they only let me in the group to be the laughingstock they needed at any given moment. I hated it, but my love for being popular was stronger.

As expected we bullied a lot of other girls, but one in particular we bullied very harshly at least once a week. Let's call her Sarah. I'll admit that I bullied her a little more harshly and frequently than any of the other girls, because I was desperate to have my own laughingstock, all to my self. I also knew that Sarah was more confident, had a better relationship with her friends, and was kinder than I was, which just gave me more incentive to hate her.

Sarah eventually had enough of all that bullying she got and was homeschooled for 12th grade. After I graduated, I spent the summer distancing myself from everyone from that high school. I'm now in my second year of college with different people, and I have a couple of friends, similar to my state in elementary and middle school.

Last night I became curious of how Sarah is doing, so I searched up her Instagram. She has a ton of friends and seems to be living her best life, which I'm happy about, since I'm older and more mature.

Come my birthday my parents had told me that they only had enough money for the bed ($150) but the sheets and new mattress would’ve set them back another ~$200. Meaning that they would pay a price of $350 for the bed overall. I asked if I could get the desk instead and that I would help pay for it or the bed when the time came. I need my desk, it’s where I spend all of my time and how I communicate with my friends, as well as how I do homework.

Once I asked for the desk instead of the bed, I was yelled at and called ungrateful and lazy and was told that I “suck as a human being”. I don’t think I was being unreasonable considering the cost and my side of it. So reddit, AMITA for asking for the desk?

Instance 1: we went to a bbq in support of our local salvation army.  we are waiting in line, when Jake sees someone on a scooter under a gazebo with about 5 other men. I tell him it's someone else's scooter, not ours to touch. The guys were a little sketchy looking, and I try not to pass judgement but I used to work with high-risk offenders and almost all of them lived at the Salvation Army, so I'm very cautious. She offers to take him over to see the scooter. I couldn't hide my reaction. I was like ""uhhhh NO?? I dont know those men"", and she started rolling her eyes, and said ""it's just someone's bike in a public space"" and scoffing at me. I reiterated that she was absolutely not taking the toddler over to a group of people who are strangers to us, and that I'm trying to teach him that he isnt entitled to other people's stuff just because hes interested. She rolled her eyes, scoffed again, and that was that.


Instance 2: yesterday she came over and brought an apple in that she found in our yard. We dont have an apple tree. Truth is, Jakey found it at daycare and we left it outside and told him we were going to give it to the birdies. But this was context she didnt have. So she comes in and says ""I found this in the yard, I thought Jake could have it"". She was going to just....give him a completely random piece of fruit she found in the yard, no apple tree in sight, no idea where it came from.

He is used to being an inside dog and I did not think he would be happy staying outside all the time. I ended up working it out with some friends for him to stay with them for a few months until I moved back out of my parents house.  They have a dog themselves so they were comfortable taking him in. I paid for any vet visits but he stayed there pretty much full time.

As I got older I would go to her house to pet sit, for dinner, to play games, or we’d just meet for lunch. She got married about 7 years ago and I also became close to her wife, another aunt. During all this I was in and out of relationships, some they met, some they didn’t. But for some reason they really latched on to my most recent ex. 

My ex and I were together for about 2,5 years and about 2 years in we started having major problems. A couple months in to our “problem time” my aunts invited me over for brunch. It started as brunch but what it really turned into an accusation. They started telling me that I’m not trying hard enough, that I’m giving up, and telling me I should go to counseling and it’s my (now) ex to work on our problems. I left in tears because I felt cornered that they were ganging up on me. I was also told by my ex during one of our fights that they were talking to him, he was hanging out at their house (he worked close to them), and they were offering him a place to stay when we would fight. To my knowledge, they still communicate with him.

If it matters, my ex and I split because he was a liar (finances and criminal history mostly), played a victim, and used me as a crutch.

Since then I’ve only been to their house for family gatherings where everyone is there. I don’t go to events with just them anymore, and frankly I don’t want to be around them. I realize I don’t “own” my ex and they can have a relationship with him if they want, what I’m most upset about is they chose to believe his side of arguments over mine after knowing him for only 2 years.

305,Not the A-hole,"Ever since I was ten years old, my sister has been having me watch her kid every week day until 12 am. She would drop her then three year old daughter at my house, say a quick thanks, then leave. I wasn’t the only one at my house of course. My dad was there while my mom was at work. But my dad never helped me watch or take care of my sisters kid. He would just stay in his room doing God knows what. It was hard for me because I was still a kid and was busy with school work at the time. And when ever I acted ‘immaturely’ (mind you I was 10) my sister would say, “ You’re and aunt now, you can be acting like this!”
One night, I had to watch my sister’s kid again. It was late and I had a test the next day. My sister’s kid (who was the most annoying person I met) kept me up all night. She was playing her show really loudly in my room and refused to turn it down. She was also doing something else really annoying but I can’t remember—it was years ago. My dad wouldn’t do anything either. I asked him to make my sister’s kid sleep in another room, but he said no. He knew I had a test the next morning. I won’t lie, I started ugly-crying because I was so frustrated and stressed out. Whenever I would bring up my sister’s kid and how she was a brat and never listened to me, she never believed me—or refused to believe me. That made me the most upset.
My sister has a baby daddy who only spends time with his kid on the weekend in case you were wondering. He doesn’t even watch his kids. They had a ‘falling-out’. I overheard my mom and sister talking about it.
A good year went by when I didn’t have to watch my sister’s kid. That was because my sister got a  live-in babysitter that my mom was paying for. Also, big whoop, my sister got pregnant again. And by the same baby-daddy. They weren’t even dating. She just wanted another kid that was fully related to her previous daughter. 
After that year was up, the live-in babysitter moved to South America ‘cause her visa was up. I was back to babysitting not just one kid, but two. And every single weekday. My sister’s older kid became even more annoying if that’s even possible. And the younger kid was sweet but it was hard to take care of one year old. At this time, I was only 12 and really busy with school. I found myself so stressed that my head would hurt so bad. My dad started watching the kids a little bit more, but I was doing most of it.
Around this time, my sister started dating again.  She would ask me to watch her kids on the weekend too. I have no idea why but I said yes. I think I am a major pushover. I AM a major pushover. And my sister’s older kid was completely nasty to me now. She wouldn’t listen to me and kept making a mess around my house. I would tell her to clean it up and she would make a bigger mess.

My wife has been calling me an AH lately because I have refused to buy her bottled water. I tell her no because she always drinks half a bottle, puts it in the fridge and will do this with several bottles and cycles through them. In my mind, she is being spoiled because she can easily drink water from the tap like I do. It saves money and the taste isn’t horrible. However she disagrees, and says that she would rather have bottled water to drink because the tap water tastes “terrible” to her. She is pregnant and currently a stay-at-home-mom to our one year old, so she doesn’t have the funds to buy water herself.

I had no idea what kind of coin that was, only that it was made with silver and look really old. I lost the coin somewhere in my early teens and I never thought I would have seen it again.


I found the coin among my old stuff a few months ago at my parent's and had it melted and made into a ring, which I wear it either on my finger or around my neck as a pendant. 


My relatives did not take it well when they knew about it. They said that I have been disrespectful to my grandfather and devalued the coin's worth, since it probably worth was much more than the ring it was made into. 


I think the opposite, that the fact that I am wearing the ring every day is the proof that I value my grandfather's memory. It was by luck that I found it after so many years and for sure I wasn't going to keep it in some dark corner and probably lose it again. AITA though?

I don't like long posts, so I'll make it short.

I (20f) promised my boyfriend (24m)  that I would make him cookies. I had never made cookies before, but I have made a banana cake, so I thought would give it a go.


I made half chocolate chip, half real pieces of chocolate bar pieces chocolate chip cookies. 


They turned out so delicious! I was so proud of myself that I handed them out to everyone at work. Mind you, I told everyone that they were only allowed to take one. I, myself had eaten three.


By the end of the day, there were only 3 left, and my boyfriend said that they were delicious,and he was grateful, but he wished that I had thought to leave more for him.


We both don't like fighting, so we agreed this was not important enought to start a fuss over, but I just want to know if I'm in the wrong here. 


Additional info: He says I am a textbook people pleaser, which he says he both loves and hates about me, and he stated this is one of those situations where he hates it.


TL/DR: Made cookies for the first time for my boyfriend, ended up being so proud of myself and sharing it with everyone, leaving only 3 for him. He's mad. AITA?

317,Asshole,"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.

Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.

I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?

I decided to post the tickets for sale on line and not go. He has made this incredibly frustrating and not fun. I told him I would go if we can’t sell the tickets or he can take someone else if he has someone who wants to go.

323,Asshole,"Here is the scenario, my (34 yr old M) parents own a condo near Disney World. Growing up, we spent all of the holidays at this condo and going to the parks, which is why Disney is one of my favorite places on earth. On top of this, I have found out that Disney is going to be revamping Epcot and by the time I go with my family and kids, it will be totally different.
My parents are now retired and have decided to sell the condo for some extra money. My wife (31) and I have a lot going on right now as we have a 13 month old daughter and she is 20 weeks pregnant with our son, so I understood that it may be very difficult to visit the condo one last time. I am also saving up my leave at work for when the baby is born, so even more difficult to get there.
Today, while driving in the car to lunch with friends, my wife said she might go to her hometown (an hour from where we live) to visit family in October for the weekend. She said it would be nice if I came, but not a big deal if I didn't. For awareness, I love her family and we are together all of the time. It's not like I don't see them often. It also happened to be a weekend where I already have Friday off, so I was thinking I could leave Thursday after work and come back on Sunday morning and spend a couple of days at the condo and see Epcot. She doesn't think it's a good idea that I go since she is pregnant and we have a one year old and its a plane ride away. This is our dilemma. Please discuss!

Edit:  Thank you for all of the comments, I have decided not to go, but I wanted to add some additional things.

1) My wife and I did this post together, in fact she suggested it so it is not that we don't talk.  I would even venture to say, my wife thinks I talk to her too much.

2) There were no financial constraints so it wasn't part of the discussion.

3) I would love to take the 1 yo, but it would be her first trip ever and we wanted to do that together. My wife can't fly right now because during the last pregnancy when she flew, she blew up like a balloon and spent two days in bed.

4) Yes, high risk pregnancy due to my daughter being 1 month early.

324,Not the A-hole,"Edit; Extra info because it was asked for, I am 27, I pay rent for a room in my family's house that I moved into after I split up with my ex girlfriend two years ago because quite frankly it's cheaper than getting my own place and I was starting therapy at the time so thought it'd be easier to move back home.

Small tidbit of backstory, my parents have had consistent issues of not respecting boundaries throughout my whole life, and I have constantly grown up putting their needs and parenting their insecurities above mine, a problem which has me in therapy trying to undo this damage and learn now how to set healthy boundaries with people.

So I need to know if I'm the asshole here because I honestly have no healthy gauge for this at all, and my parents will forever insist that I am indeed the asshole for making my needs hurt and being disatisfied with their behaviour when I express them.

I have asked my parents repeatedly to respect when the door of my room is shut to respect my privacy as there was a consistent issue of them opening my door whilst I was meditating or studying etc. And distrubing me.

Whilst they've sorta begrudgingly now accepted this demand, they've now taken to a new method of interrupting me even when this boundary is in place. And that is by repeatedly calling my name and knocking the door from the other side with the franticness of someone being chased by an axe murderer.

Just now such an event was occurring and I was preforming physiotherapy exercises, so was not in a position to talk. My dad was getting audibly angrier and more panicked with each knock, until I eventually angrily told him to go away, and that I was exercising. To which he replied ""well you should have told me that""...

After I finished my exercises I went and found him and asked what he wanted. He told me that there were two bikes in the shed, but they may not be in good condition, in response to an earlier question I had asked my mother.

I thanked him for the information. And told him that was helpful. Then proceeded to ask him ""did you honestly feel that information was so urgent to tell me that you felt you had to get pissy with me when I didn't respond?""

I reminded him of my earlier request for privacy, and he responded that he did give me privacy, and I replied ""hammering on my door until I reply doesn't feel like a respect of my privacy"" to which he replied ""well if a sign says do not enter don't you want to know why you can't enter it?..."" Which just made me feel like he was being completely dismissive of the point and not respecting my feelings in the slightest so I walked away.

Am I the asshole? I feel like he has a completely warped sense of entitlement and urgency. If I don't reply to his messages or phone calls right away, I get 20 missed ones. If I'm trying to have a nap, I have him hammering on my door 20 times untill I respond. Just leave me a message and I'll get back to you ffs",25,29,0.89

326,Not the A-hole,"Last weekend my family went to a wedding out near my grandparents’ house a few hours away. They live in a really small town so the woman who was bartending at the reception, Lori, knew my grandparents. I’d estimate her at like 60-65 years old. She’s retired and works events as part-time jobs. 

Early on in the night, Lori seemed to be hitting on my 25-year-old brother, but we all laughed about it because it seemed harmless. Later, I saw her leave the bar to take photo booth pictures with a bunch of the groomsmen. Kind of weird, but maybe they asked her to join them. Who knows. As the night went on, everyone was talking about how she was hitting on my dad, my cousins, my uncles, etc. but we still thought it was kind of humorous. 

What pissed me off was when I was dancing near my grandpa and heard her ask him if he wanted to dance, or whether his wife (my grandma) would get mad. He said no, but she kept hovering around the dance floor near him until I physically boxed her out. Keep in mind that the reception was still going on, so she literally left her job at the bar to go over to the dance floor. 

The next morning we were all talking about her and my grandma seemed upset when I told everyone about her asking my grandpa to dance. I guess all the women in the town dislike this lady because she hits on all of their husbands. So I decided to call the resort where the reception was and tell them about Lori. I explained that she was hitting on men young and old, taking pictures with the groomsmen in the middle of the reception, and that she left the bar to try and dance with my male family members. 

My grandma told me today that Lori got fired, and all the men in my family keep telling me I’m crazy for actually calling and getting an old woman fired because “bartenders just flirt for tips”.

330,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, so, (TLDR at the bottom)

My step mother (F, like 45-50 years old) has made a habit of needing to bring her dog everywhere with her. And I mean everywhere - movie theaters, restaurants, literally any type of public outing. The dog is sweet, but the dog is brought along under the guise that it's an emotional support/therapy animal. The problem is that the dog is not really a therapy animal, and its behavior in public is really telling of that.

About 5 years ago, my step mom found a website where she could purchase a fake therapy dog badge, in order to bring her dog with her everywhere. It has a picture of the dog on it and everything, and I'm almost certain this is probably illegal to do in some areas. When walking in someplace like a restaurant or movie theater, she always makes a big show of pointing out the fake badge, and truly does claim she needs the dog for emotional support. She has never been diagnosed with any condition that would indicate she is truly in need of an emotional support animal, the dog has never received any type of formal training to fit the role of a therapy animal, and it becomes very evident in public that this is the case. 

For example, in restaurants, she holds the dog in her lap, where it will occasionally put its face or paws on the table (where other people eat). Once, she (and my dad) got into a shouting match with a manager at a restaurant who called my step mom out on this behavior, and stated it violated health code for the dog to be basically sticking its head in her glass and eating off her plate. I was mortified by the whole thing, as I've worked in the restaurant industry before and understand how this could be a problem for other guests visiting the restaurant, and is potentially a liability to the restaurant. She then brought the dog to a different restaurant the next day, acting like the victim in the whole thing.

I am a huge animal lover myself, and somebody who does suffer from anxiety and panic disorder - I know how animals are so loving, and can really improve mental health status. At the same time, I think it is beyond unfair that my step mom brings her ""therapy"" dog with her everywhere - like an accessory and because she thinks its cute - while there are people who really do need trained emotional support and service animals with them. My birthday is coming up soon, and I'm even having anxiety knowing that my step mom will probably bring the dog out to eat with us, and am so tired of the constant dirty looks we get when out in public because of the dog clearly being a fake therapy dog. 

WIBTA if I ask my step mom to stop bringing the dog everywhere when I hang out with her and my dad?

That wasn't a generic lover platitude, I think her curves are sexy as hell. She's blessed in that the extra weight went ALL to the right places. No hanging folds anywhere, just curvy to the max. I love cuddling her, love how I can position myself on her back and put my arms around her and my hands on her boobs (which she loves too) watching Netflix in bed together and love everything about her butt and would give so much to have it myself.

She seemed hurt and like I wasn't celebrating her accomplishment.

Here's the truth: if she loses the extra weight I won't find her as attractive. No I'm not going to dump her and she'll still be beautiful but her luscious curves are the sexiest thing about her.

She wanted to work after college but we had a child and she decided of her own accord to be a SAHM. This is all fine to me, I make enough to support us all.

That is until I broached the idea of a new guitar. It's just about $5,000 after taxes and etc. This is literally my only hobby that costs money. I might spend only $2,000/yr on personal leisure, so while this new guitar is a big purchase, it's really the only thing I can entertain myself with. She said this is too big of a purchase and gave me an emphatic ""no"". It's not even a thing of ""we can use it on xyz instead"", it's ""you can't buy things that cost this much"".

I know you shouldn't spend money without spouse approval for something this big, but I disagreed with her reasoning that $5,000 is just too much to spend on something. It doesn't hurt us financially, so why not? AITA?

I had a friend named Jack. Five years ago, Jack met Jill. None of the women were really fond of Jill, but since Jack was single and Jill had finally stopped making plays for our boyfriends, we tried to make her feel welcome in the group. They married last November and Jack died in January after a short, unexpected illness. The entire time he was in the hospital, Jill refused to let anyone visit except for two of the groomsmen from the wedding, Ryan (best man) and Chad. Chad was one of the aforementioned boyfriends, but by this time he was single too. 

Jill pulled the plug, Jack dies and we all are devastated. Go through a weird as hell funeral where Jill seems more annoyed about having to do it than grieving for her husband. Later that night, she texts Ryan to see if he can come over to cuddle with her. He didn’t.

Two weeks later, Chad starts chemo. His brother Bob starts rounding up the care team only for Jill to swoop in and coordinate. Bob starts to suspect, he complains to our friend Belle (a nurse at the hospital where Jack died), and she tearfully shares she’d seen something at the hospital while Jack was in the coma.

He was being such an asshole to his nurses & techs. Saying the most disgusting & verbally abusive things, getting physically combative for 0 reason, using racist & sexist slurs, resisting care, and despite all that he was on his call-light every few minutes for things he could do himself. 

It pissed me off, and I let him know. I'm not sure if I'm proud of it or not, but I yelled at him & told him off. I don't remember everything I told him, but I made it clear it was fucked up and even though I loved him I couldn't be around him treating his care providers like shit. I left, and now I'm home. 

My parents think he's old and has the right to be ""crabby"", I think he's gone past what he has the right to be and is in unacceptable territory. AITA?",31,25,0.89

337,No A-holes here,"This situation has been ongoing the last year and is causing a lot of damage in my family. 

Little backstory. My parents divorced when I was 15, mom never remarried and my older brother and I are very close to her. My father remarried maybe 6 years later to a woman who had 3 kids already. There was never a discussion on my fathers end about what him getting remarried entailed, and what my brother and I thought about having step siblings as well as a step mother. If he would have, we would have told him we’re happy but not looking for additional family. Glad you’re getting married and happy for you. Fast forward and I’m now 36, my brother 38, we don’t consider this woman our step mother or step siblings. 

We like this woman, glad she’s making my father happy  and all, but don’t consider her or her kids “family.”  We’ve had our problems with her, but always tried to make this right and let my father do his thing. Now to the problem. My son is about to turn 1, and my father keeps pushing grandma title on me. I’ve told him 3 separate times now that we would prefer to save grandma for my mom and my wife’s mother, not step parents. My brother has told my father the same thing. She has her own kids and when they have kids, she will be a grandma, but since she isn’t my mom, these aren’t her grandkids.  So am I the asshole for not wanting this woman to be called grandma?",303,918,0.95
338,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my aunt and uncle got married yesterday, and I (17M) wanted to wear a suit. My mum didn’t wanna pay for suits for all 4 of us kids (14M, 12M and 5M) so I said I’ll wear my suit. She said no as it’s black. I have a white shirt and red tie. I was pissed but I didn’t think much of it or complain. Instead I wore a polo top, chinos and some brown shoes.

We got to the wedding and literally ever other man in the room was in either a suit or had a suit shirt on. I was mad. I complained to my mum and my stepdad and they both got angry and said to get over it, no one actually wants to wear a suit and everyone will change when we go to the party afterwards. Everyone else I spoke to said the same thing.

I messaged one of my friends who’s incredibly into fashion and he said that what I was wearing wasn’t a wedding outfit at all. What do you guys think?

341,Not the A-hole,"My mom and I live 2 hours away, so she comes to see me pretty often. This friday she told me ""___, I'll be there tomorrow"", which caught me by surprise since I was planning to do something else, so I told her ""I wish you had told me this before"", to which she replied ""I'm doing this now, but I also said it before."". I said to her I didn't remember being warned, but it was fine. She told me then, ""it's okay, I'm not staying at your house"",  as in she was vising the city, not MY PLACE per se. I realized she was kinda upset, but I didn't feel like arguing so I just let it go.

The next day I insisted: ""are you coming here today?"" and she said the same thing ""yes, but I'm not staying at your place so I don't bother you."" Again, I could sense how passive agressive she was, but talking to my mom is like a minefield and I didn't feel like stepping on a mine, so I just let it go. 

Today she was absolutely pissed, told me no other mom needs to warn in advance when they are visiting their daughter, that I should have some sense because now she's staying at someone else's apartment as a favor and that she is always willing to have me in her house, even if I don't tell her in advance I'm visiting. When I told her I had something else planned and I'd like to be free to receive her, she told me I didn't need to be home - she has a key - and by saying that, I was suggesting she couldn't be in my place unsupervised, as if she would steal something or snoop around. I was ASTONISHED, I've never seen someone distort my words SO MUCH. I never said I didn't want her there, all I said was I wish she'd tell me in advance. 

I feel like there's nothing absurd in what I asked of her, but my father said 1. he'd be upset too and 2. I shouldn't have said anything because I ""know how my mom is like"" and because she has a key anyway, so the fact I had other plans didn't really matter. I'm feeling terrible because she's pretty mad at me and I know she'll hold this against me for a week AT LEAST. I feel like if I tell her I'm sorry, I'm also kind of saying I'm fine with not being warned in advance, which is not true. I'd still highly prefer being aware of when she's coming to visit.

For more info: I'm 21, I live alone and she's just here for the weekend, came along with my stepfather to do something for my stepbrother. Also, english isn't my first language, so sorry for any eventual mistakes.",28,42,0.85

344,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my friend has my main. 

So, my [F24] boyfriend [M26] and I used to live with a friend [M24] of ours. We had problems with him not having his part of rent or bills every month, but he always had a dime bag. He would buy new sheets for the girls he was trying to sleep with, but he had 1/4 of what his rent. I would try to talk to him, but he would laugh and say ""okay mom.""  My boyfriend and I wasted a lot of our money covering for him. 

Our friend is someone who works the bare minimum and jumps between living with different family members, because he eventually gets mad and does something stupid they kick him out for. He spends every penny he has because ""he's stressed so he's treating himself.""

He still comes over to hang out with us at the apartment my BF and I have. My friend and I were close a few years ago, and he got me through a very dark time in my life. His heart is in the right place, but he can't get his life together, no matter how much I try to help him. 

He has asked us multiple times if he can move in, but we always say no because we don't want to be put in the same situation we were in a few years prior. Last night, our friend texted me asking if he could move in, as he had almost fought his stepdad and he was talking about kicking him out. I told him if he did move in, there would be conditions.

His stepdad was the last relative he has to live with, as he's screwed up his relationship with pretty much every other relative of his, so I can't help but feel bad because I know he doesn't have other options. But my BF and I are starting to plan our lives together and we are finally financially stable. 

When I texted him these conditions, he got mad and acted like it was my fault he wasn't going to have a place to go. 

1.	$400 pet fee for *your dog* before you move in, per apartment rules.
2.	You will pay half of rent total per month, as you will have your own bedroom and bathroom and *my boyfriend* and I will be sharing one. (about $550 per month for you)
3.	Your name will be on the lease. 
4.	All uitilities will be split three ways 
5.	You'll need to contribute $40 per month for groceries. If you do, I will cook for three.
6.	*Your dog* will need to stay up to date on vaccines, flea and tick preventative, and heartworm preventative, as our dog is. 
7.	*Your dog* has to stay in your closed room when no one is home as *our bulldog* doesn't always get along with other dogs. 
8.	If you want to contribute $10 each month, *your dog* can eat *our dog's* food. If not, you will supply your own food for him. We have half a medium bag of dog food that *our dog* doesn't eat anymore that you can have.

AITA for listing these conditions? My BF doesn't think they are too harsh, as he doesn't want our friend to move in, but the part of me that helps people thinks ""YTH"" because I know he needs help.

Update: We're not letting him move in. Thank you all for being so nice about my uncertainty.

Edit 1: Wow, this blew up. Currently accepting friend applications.

Edit 2: Thank you all again for being so kind. To the people asking why I layed out the conditions when I had no intention of saying yes, I actually had every intention of saying yes when I layed them out to him (because I'm an idiot who can't learn a lesson) I wasn't sure how he was going to react to them, but when he did get mad when they were first layed out, that was when I started to second guess myself. Thinking they were possibly too harsh, I posted on Reddit to get an outside opinion. When Reddit confirmed that it was not a good idea, my friend texted back and said he would accept them (probably because someone else had told him he couldn't move in), but by that point I was completely done with his bullshit, and everyone was right, he was probably going to be a shit roomate again. I agree the half rent was probably a little harsh, but a lot of people I know do that, so I thought it was what you were supposed to do. The dog thing was also too harsh as well. His little shitzu already lives in his room now, and has lived in his room for the last five years, but it's still
not fair. I also wasn't asking for equal payments to go towards food and dog food. I buy all of the grocerys for my BF and I because I love to cook and like to use certain ingredients, so I just wanted him to contribute a little bit of money towards it.",186,1777,0.96

347,Not the A-hole,"Tonight was long, exhausting and quite possibly could have gone better. 

Before tonight my partner had spent the last few days in hospital with our 4 month old son. She wanted to spend the night out together and have a few drinks without our oldest child (4, austitic). 

We went out for dinner at around 6pm with our 4 month old, 2 year old and one of her friends. Dinner was great kids were happy and partner plus friend said they were going to have a smoke. During this time I took the 2 year old into the playground and had the youngest with me in the pram. 

~20 minutes later at 8pm my partner returned gathering her credit card and exclaiming that shes going to the poker machines with her friend and will be back soon... this is where things went downhill. 

Whilst they went off to have some time together I stayed with the kids at the playground waiting for there return so we could go home. We had arrived in one car and I had the least amount to drink so I thought best to wait it out while she had some de-stress time.

Time went on and on and at some point my phone battery died. Tantrum and bottles later I had two very tired kids ready to go to sleep yet still no sign of mum and friend. I spent some time walking around looking for a clock as children are not allowed on premises after 10pm yet could not find any in sight. 

10pm rolled around as i was asked to leave with the children. Heading to the car I still had yet to hear or see any sign of them, baby had woken for bottle and toddler ready to tear the roof down. After feeding the baby and putting both kids to sleep I started doing laps of the small car park in hopes they would show up.. for 40 minutes. 

At 10:40 I bit the bullet and left to source a phone charger to atleast try make contact. Upon turning on the phone, no missed calls or messages. I called my partner, fuming at this point and told her we were asked to leave to which her response to her friend was ""what should we do, I want to stay out for the night"" 

This just added fuel to the fire as I was extremely frustrated from making the children wait so long and late with no effort to communicate these intentions to us. 

I left and told her no to bother coming home tonight as she won't be welcome. She has since caught a taxi to her friends house where they will be staying the night. 

AITA? I feel like I was harsh and know she needs a break, it hurts knowing we waited for so long for her under the idea she would be back. I'm so conflicted on where I feel here :/",63,173,0.93

So Sunday is kind of our day together. I don’t work on Sunday’s and we usually spend the day together. We recently moved into our new home and a new neighborhood and have everything we need set up for the baby. 

Anyway, she is a little over 8 months pregnant and needs me to do a good amount of things for her and needs me to do a little more of my fair share of the housework. That’s fine, I’m ok with that

I mention that because she relies on me more and more as her pregnancy is ending. So a friend of mine reached out to me the other day and said he has an extra ticket for a football game cause someoke bailed, so I said yeah without hesitation. 

I got home and told my wife, then she started becoming angry/upset. Claiming what if she needs me or something happens or if someone breaks into our home and she’s scared(we live in a low crime area). Or if the baby somehow came early .She said I should have asked her first, and she hopes I’m not this selfish when our baby comes. 

That pissed me off because I’m not selfish. I’ve done so much for her.",263,316,0.9
351,No A-holes here,"EDITTED:: Update at the bottom.

SECOND EDIT TOO!::

Fall asleep on the couch for an hour at 5am. 6am rolls around and I'm startled awake by my wife's voice; ""The kids are up too early and are keeping me up. I'm fucking tired. You need to get up and deal with them. I'm going back to bed.""

So normally I take these things with a grain of salt. Not much gets my ire up, usually just mild discontent, but this morning I'm pretty pissed off.

We have two kids. I'm a stay at home dad, she's a career mom. We've had hiccups getting to where life works for both of us but we've figured it out. Also, I'm an insomniac that averages about 18 hours of sleep in a week, where she is one of those people that will cut your eyes out if she isn't clearing 8-12 hours per night at least 5 nights a week.

So my issue here is that there is literally no circumstance that could occur where I walk into a room with wife and say what she said to me, without her then either leaving to stay at a hotel, laughing out loud and telling me to get over it, or getting furious and telling me I'm being selfish. If I did it from a dead sleep? I legitimately feel there may be bloodshed. 

WIBTA if, when she wakes up, I basically start a conversation with her to call her on it? I'm thinking starting along the lines of ""You would lose your mind, or maybe kill me later, if I were to cold wake you and say the same thing,"" and tell her either to do it gently next time?

Ongoing. She's back in bed and I'm just watching cartoons with the kids.

::
Update:: Wife is up. Called me in when she first woke up and asked if I wanted her to take the kids out for a bit, feels bad about waking me up and, as she put it, ""having an epic temper tantrum."" 

Had a laugh, told her that I had just posted about it on AITA instead (she doesn't browse here but hears about it from me) and not to worry about taking the kids out; she has to leave for work in an hour so I'm just happy it was acknowledged and we got to talk about it in better spirits.

Thanks for the input everyone!

She's very creative but doesn't have the digital skills we need (there were other applicants that were just as creative and had digital skills). To give an idea, her resume was done in MS Word stock template and she listed Letraset as a skill. Initially we didn't give her an interview. I copped hell from dad, mum, sister and grandparents. Mum was even crying.

So, I caved and put her into the pool of people we were going to interview. She interviewed ok. Portfolio was weak and showing no digital skills. Even gave her a week and +3 extra days no one else got to do a skills test. She did not pass that.

I personally stopped by parents' place to inform her she wasn't being brought on board. She ended up heavy crying telling my how ungrateful I was and how disappointed she was in me.

A couple hours in, most of everyone at the table is finished, and we all are talking. Everything was going fine until my brother brings up how a distant relative of ours just bought a very expensive car (around $300k). Everybody, including myself was very proud of him being able to do so. 

For some background info: None of our close family has ever been even close to rich. Everyone else at the table lives a “normal” middle class life. 

Then, my brother mentions that none of us at the table will ever be able to achieve that level of success and we’ll only ever be able to attain max an Audi or a BMW in our lifetime (practically anything under $50k).

I say that’s not necessarily an indicator of success anyway because many people buy luxury cars like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes all of the time and they can’t afford them. But they do it anyway, but that doesn’t mean they’re successful. And I mention often times people who buy those cars can’t actually afford them, as they’re on ridiculous loans or get them repossessed. 

My brother disagrees profusely and continues to debate with me about this. This debate (more of a conversation actually for the most part as it was just calm back and forth of our own personal opinions, and not trying to disprove each other’s opinion) goes on for 20 mins with a couple other people chiming in, but for the most part just being between him and I. 

I realize it’s going on too long and starting to make other people feel uncomfortable as my brother is now starting to get mad so I just say “agree to disagree” and that it’s okay that some people have different definitions of what being able to afford something means. 

He doesn’t accept this at all and continues to argue that my point is stupid and illogical. And that there can only be one definition of affording something. I refuse to talk any further and he starts to get more mad. He then starts making it personal by making comments about my lifestyle and how I have a “poor mentality” and that I will never get far with that. He starts to criticize my personal purchases and talk about how his purchases and lifestyle is more successful than mine. 

I continue to ignore him, until he mentions “you keep that poor ass mentality and when you finally save up and can only buy a little $20k car, you’ll see it’s a poor, broke ass mentality.”

I then call him a horrible person for being immature and for making a simple debate turn into him belittling me and attacking me personally. I also say that everyone in the family knows he’s a horrible person but no one ever wants to call him out for it. 
It starts to get awkward so shortly after, everybody decides its time to leave and we all end up going home.

AITA for insulting the host in front of the entire family? 

Edit: the initial “debate” was not an argument. In fact, it was more like a conversation for the majority of the 20 mins. The conversation was mostly about our own personal opinion and why it is, not actively trying to disprove each others opinion.",22,44,0.88

To cut a long story short her son arrives and *immediately* starts causing shit. Running around the place, demanding to eat all my snacks, opening my things to look around for toys, and demanding attention constantly. I tell him to watch TV and just let me relax but he seems determined not to listen to a word I said. Finally I get him to calm down and sit after bribing him with ice cream I was saving for the weekend he shuts up and finally settles down. Or so I think.

I go back to my room to browse reddit and try to relax but after a while I hear my cat let out a giant yowl. I immediately run to investigate and find the little shit standing there with my cat backed into a corner, back raised and hissing. He immediately backs away when he sees me but I just know he's done some shit and after I question him and he breaks out crying and saying he just wanted to play a game with the cat. When I go to take him back to the lounge to sit down I see not only has he been harassing my cat, he's smeared ice cream all over my new **white** couch and on the carpet below. I should add in here he is a 7 year old not 3, there is no reason for him to make such a mess other than a basic lack of respect. 

At this point I am really angry, especially after seeing my poor baby in a state because of him, but trying to keep it cool. I tell him he's to clean the mess he made but then he starts to throw an almighty tantrum and start screaming and crying at the idea of having to face a consequence for the mess he has created. I've had it by now and I tell him he's going to sit in a room until he can calm down and behave and not terrorize my cat and cause giant messes in my house. I take him to the guest room and shut the door and say he can come out only when he starts acting properly. Spoiler alert, he cries the entire time which is honestly ridiculous and he's still there and sobbing when his lovely mother and her darling hubby arrive to pick him up.

We met up recently and I apologized, she accepted. Not gonna lie, I was open to whatever happened. Whether she wants to be friends or date, I wasn't going to bail on friendship.


She made it clear she had a BF which sucks but I'm OK with. Eventually we started texting daily and hanging every week.


Something odd I noticed was she would always complain about having no money. She would suggest we'd go to mid priced places to eat, but then say ""I didn't get paid from work so won't order anything"". 


And I just end up eating by myself. I've bought her food before when she was unemployed but she has a job now. Anyway she recently told me that when she was broke she went on tinder dates with guys to get a free dinner. That same day she brought up to me which places in my city do the best steak.


I told her I don't eat out often unless its a special occasion. She asked again about 5mins later and I changed the subject. We were supposed to hang out most of the day but she cut it off after 2hrs to go home after she dragged me to a restaurant she likes and we didn't get anything. She let me know she only had $25 in her account that has to last 2 days.


When she got her uber she started to cry.


I messaged her saying this just friends thing doesn't work for me and I don't want to go out for meals anymore and she just goes ""sure, thanks for letting me know"".


I text her a week later and ask how her week went. She didn't reply. After that I sent an angry text basically accusing her of trying to push my buttons to get free stuff from me and the friendship is officially over. AITA?",179,567,0.86
370,Not the A-hole,"I have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only I can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

Queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching. Queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". I don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. I'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when I regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think I'm an ass for good now and I had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

371,Not the A-hole,"Just happened this morning, some reference to UK law may be different to USA in the right to stop someone.

So I had finished a night shift, tired no sleep etc and headed to a local Lidl to grab some food and bits. Got a couple of nice steaks for the wife and I this morning. Headed to the self checkout area and scanned my stuff. As usual for Lidl there was not many staff around and I had the usual self checkout anger inducing experience of taking stuff on and off the scales etc. Got to the end and waited a sold 5 mins to have my bottle of wine approved by someone. The screen flashed up to say an item was security tagged and the staff member pressed ""OK"" to override it. I paid and placed all my stuff in my backpack and went to make my way out.  

Lo and behold the door scanners started beeping but confident I'd paid for everything and not seeing a security guy I carried on.  

(full disclosure I was a store detective years ago, From what I remember the rules used to be for detaining a shoplifter in the UK you should actually see the thief select, conceal and make off without payment before they are allowed to detain someone obviously I'd done none of these things.)

I was making my way across the car park and a security guard finally catches up with me and grabs my shoulder which immediately gets by back up.

He says I have to come back to the store, I asked why. Apparently I have ""stolen something"".  

I tried to stay fairly polite and replied with no I haven't and you haven't seen me steal anything and made to walk away again. He tried to grab my backpack and continued to insist I go back to the shop. 

Bearing in mind I'd just finished 15 hours at work overnight, had endured the frustrating Lidl staff less checkout experience and then been grabbed twice by someone I was a little frustrated. I told him if you think I've stolen something call the police otherwise piss off and leave me alone. I also added that if he touched me again I'd put him on the floor (not proud of that...and I probably wouldn't of!)

I got to my car, went home, told my wife and apparently I'm the asshole for not just letting him search my bag. She didn't see my point that, I had no need to do that, legally or otherwise. Normally I might do just to speed the process up but they lost my goodwill when I was grabbed and his opening line was I've stolen something.

So...AITA?

TLDR; Securty gates went off in the supermarket, security guard chased me across the carpark and said I'd stolen something (I hadn't) told him to piss off and carried on.

EDITED TO ADD: A few are saying I should have just shown the receipt and be done with it.  This was in my bag as well.  Had he not put his hands on me and said outright ""you've stolen something"" I probably would have. It was those actions that made me think...nope gonna just go.  As I said above, in the UK it's illegal to detain someone (against their will) unless you have physically seen a theft taking place.

373,Not the A-hole,"Ok so I'm an 18 year old college student. My parents got divorced like 7 years ago. I have pretty split time with them. They have always been on bad terms and can barely communicate, but I had a lot of freedom on if I wanted to spend some time at either house. Plus the houses are relatively close, like within walking distance. 

Now my parents are 2 complete opposites. My dad is super chill and very understanding. He gives me plenty of freedom and as long as I communicate with him, we're good. He's very supportive of me and I enjoy being with him.

My mom's also a great parent, just a bit more on top of me. She needs to know details of where I am what I'm doing. This isn't a problem, the slight problem is that she guilts me and wants me to spend more time with her and the ""family"". The ""family"" is her boyfriend and my half sister. I love my sister but I've never been close with her boyfriend. Since the beginning I've never fully liked him and that remains the same. Overall he's gotten more tolerable. 

Since I've turned 18 I've been wanting to just live with my dad. I want 1 place to stay at and overall I feel like I function better there. I have a lot of freedom and our relationship is great. I conveyed this to my mom tonight and she went off. I knew this would be difficult for her, and tried to remain sympathetic while being confident in my choice. She said that I'm extremely selfish and she cannot believe my decision. She said that I'm not an adult and cannot make that decision. Exact words being, ""18 is just a number"". 

She also said I have way too much freedom as is, that I have no responsibility and that I can't do anything on my own. 

She went on about how I isolated myself from her and the ""family"" while also isolating the myself from the house in general. Saying that I have always had a bias to my dad.  When honestly I guess I did because I could have more time to myself there and also my consoles were there and stuff. Also my friends being around there. 

She asked what's so terrible about going back and forth every week and her house in general. I told her nothing, just that I want 1 place to be. So am I the asshole for wanting this? 

P.S. I can provide more specific details if asked and will answer what I can. It's honestly difficult for me to think about everything at the moment.

(Oh yeah a fun little tid bit I forgot was that she called me weak. Said that I let the divorce define me and change me and that it was weak of me. Reminder they got divorced when I was 11.)

375,Not the A-hole,"So I thought I was fine, but I got bombarded with a few comments saying I was taking advantage of somebody for buying dice off of them so I figured I'd come here because now I'm unsure.

To start, I'm a bit of a dice collector. Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.

So tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that’s not cool.

I couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.

He has 3/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.

However, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.

376,Not the A-hole,"First off, this is all speculative for now. My fiancee  and I aren't expecting a child yet, but we've talked about it a lot and are planning to start trying in the not-so-distant future.

Recently, out of the blue, she made a comment about having spoken to her mother and 'agreed' that our child would be christened/baptised. 

As background, we both attended Catholic schools. I am not from a Catholic background and am in fact an atheist. My partner doesnt have strong beliefs of her own, but her maternal family is Catholic (non-practising - if that's the right term - they don't go to church etc.).  

Now, I knew that her family was Catholic before our relationship started - and to be fair I did think that it could become an issue given that I'm an atheist. My experience over the years we've been together, though, is that their Catholicism really isn't a big deal to them. They're aware I don't believe and it really hasn't been a problem.

I have strong beliefs of my own, which I needn't air here. I don't have anything against people that believe, and certainly wouldn't wish to offend anyone, but given my beliefs I would feel like a big old hypocrite if I just allowed our child to be christened ""because that's what people do."" 

I don't intend to push my beliefs onto our child, but am uneasy about them being signed up to a life in which they're taught - from an early stage - that these things are true. 

If they come to believe on their own, I will of course respect that, but having them baptised as an infant - before they can think critically - doesn't sit right with me.

So... WIBTA for objecting to our child being christened/baptised?",92,78,0.86

I've always told him that if we had a son I'd want to name him Christian. And if we had a daughter, I would want to name her Grace.

He never asked where I came up with the girls name, and I never offered. But he's always agreed that he's okay with both of my choices.

384,Asshole,"Some context: I live with an older sibling and we both are listed as renting together, and just recently had my SO move in with me and said sibling.

I moved in with my sibling, with the agreement of paying half our shares for bills. But once my SO arrived this started souring. Financially it hasn't been stable before my SO arrived, my sibling and I worked at temporary work agencies until they found a well paying government job, while I still worked jobs at minimum wage. That being so, it's mainly been a 60% to 40% load on us. I being the latter. However I now have a job that will put my sibling and I equal in pay. All boiling down to that I don't want my SO getting a job for two reasons. They're applying for disability which has been in progress for months, with appointments missed because of their disorder and lack of transportation. (We lived separately at the time and my SO didn't have a phone.) Working while applying will get them disqualified for disability. And the other being that I'm willing to put in more money to cover my SO part of the rent. It's very difficult for my SO to do things without support, which I am more than happy to do. Reminders of keeping themselves clean, eating enough, ect. My SO has severe depression and anxiety, alongside autism. All of this is a horrible combination. When there's arguments between anyone, my SO will shut down and not talk to anyone but me. My SO and I talk about their health and thoughts a lot together, and are in the process of getting them therapy and medication refills. My SO is on food assistance and receives a small cash allowance from our government so my SO is contributing to the household and has taken over getting groceries as a share of their own.

Now the argument between my sibling and I is this: My sibling wants my SO to contribute more by getting a job and paying a third of rent, because they believe my SO is just leaching off us and riding off of my sibling's success. They're arguing that my SO will never grow as a person if I shelter them. I and my SO don't believe that they are ready for getting a job at this time. We argue that my SO is bringing in at least some income and has taken over a bill, saving both my sibling and I money, while also having extra cash to help. My SO and I aren't saying that they won't get a job in the future, a large part of it being we're waiting for paperwork from the government. We are also looking into agencies that work specifically with those under the autism spectrum to get jobs if disability fails. (We didn't learn about the disqualification if you work while applying until an hour after this argument. So we didn't argue that with my sibling.)

Original post:


I'm sitting in the kitchen and this friend of my daughter (12 F) who is spending the night starts talking about anal beads (I ask her to stop), then sexting and finally sex swings. Clearly she didn't stop.

My daughter (10 F) starts asking for more info about anal beads and I say no. Not right now at least.

I go tell my son (I'm fucking shell shocked at this point) and he tells me she (12 year old) went with them to see 'Good Boys' yesterday. Apparently her mom went too and explained these things to her. My son is friends with her older brother.

History: This girl taught my 9 year old (at the time) what (bad things are - mod removed previous post) is. I'm getting frustrated because I always thought I'd teach her about these things when she's ready. And I definitely didn't think I'd have to teach her about anal beads or (bad things) at 10 years old!!

I'm not prude or religious or anything like that. I will always keep an open discussion with my kids. But, am I the asshole if I tell the mother of this girl that I don't want her daughter around mine? It's getting to be too much. The mom is super sensitive and gets mad at me if we have other plans and the girls can't see each other. I also don't want to upset my daughter and she can't see her friend.

388,No A-holes here,"So first of all, there is a problem student in my Algebra 1 class who also plays freshman football. He is constantly derailing the class. He raises hell on a daily basis. Here's some of the things he's done:

1. Won't sit in his assigned seat
2. Creeps up behind teacher, taps her on her head, and says ""i'm taller than you""
3. Points at people (including teacher) during class and screams ""YOU HAVE HERPES""
4. Demands the teacher turn every light in the room off and threatens to strip naked if she doesn't.
5. Runs amok in the classroom yelling at people in the middle of a huge, summative test
6. Yells at other people to ""SHUT UP!"" when they try to ask the teacher a legitimate question

Unfortunately, he's also the freshman football star. He looks and acts no older than ten or eleven years old, and still the teacher won't discipline him. She constantly threatens to send him to the dean, then never does. The administration doesn't know about it, because the teacher absolutely will not discipline him.

This guy typically wastes 15-25 minutes of a 35-minute period, causing us to go unprepared into tests and hurting our grades. 

I don't want to be the antagonist ""tryhard"", or the guy that ruined the football team. But this dude could cause 30 people to fail Algebra 1. Tough situation here, AITA for risking the fate of the football team to save Algebra 1? It's almost impossible to do any work at all.",30,50,0.88
389,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I have two siblings: ""A""(27) and ""M""(28). I turned 30 this year. Back in 2015 my mother passed from cancer, leaving her home and her assets to ""A"" and I. I had graduated from university but “A” had never attended post-secondary. With no real work experience and a Bachelors degree that was practically useless I dropped my dream of law school and went back to school briefly while working whenever possible to ensure that bills were paid. “A” obtained part-time work. I transferred the all the bills into my name. Eventually, I graduated and obtained a full-time position with benefits and enough income to survive but not much else. ""A"" has a healthy bank account because his inheritance has barely been touched and while he's offered to transfer some bills into his name, no effort has really been made on either of our parts. 

Around 2017 my father came back into my life. We have a good relationship. He wants to see me go to law school but he would like ""A"" and I to keep our current house because housing market. I get it but I’m not particularly attached to living in a house. The maintenance is another of my responsibilities. ""A"" does some household cleaning but nothing when it comes to repairing, doing extensive cleaning, or any other things that need to get done around the house. Further, ""A"" will never be able to afford to buy out my half and I’m uninterested in the house.

It has been several years now since our mother passed and I feel I've done my part in giving “A” opportunities. I've put aside much of my life/interests for years. But life is hitting me hard. I work, I struggle to pay the bills, I drive ""A"" to and from his retail job most days and work overtime as my job requires me to travel frequently all across southern Ontario.

In my spare time, I have been studying for the LSAT which I never wrote prior to 2019.

Our father wants me to attend part-time while continuing to work my full-time job. This would commit me to maintaining the house, the bills, working full-time, doing law school part-time and continuing to give ""A,"" who can't drive, rides to and from work as well as performing any chores requiring driving (groceries, etc.) and graduating later. I think it’s unrealistic. 

Another of my father's arguments is I’ll leave “A” high and dry if we sell the house and split the value 50/50 (roughly $350,000 each). I think it's perfectly fair as, (a) ""A"" is not my kid, (b) I've given ""A"" years to pursue something but he hasn't, and (c) I have to take my own interests into consideration. All of this has been discussed with “A” and my father.

In addition, my paternal grandmother is the Landlord of a small complex in the downtown core which my father runs and he and “M” live. “A” could also come with me.

I feel like the best choice for me is to commit and take law school full-time. I know my father (possibly “A”) will never approve but I think I have to do what is best for me in this case.

391,Not the A-hole,"I love birds, and I'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. I've had them for about a year and a half. When I first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

She then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. She got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

Every time I went over to her house, I told her that it needed more attention. It just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. Its food and water were probably only changed once a week. It was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

I told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. And despite promising to do better, she never did. 

I asked her if I could have it. She got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

I felt really horrible every time I went over there. I decided I wanted to steal it. I felt like I could give it a better life. It could even make friends with my 2 birds. I just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

So I did it. She was in the bathroom, and I took a shoe box I had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. It was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. I left without even saying goodbye. 

Soon after I got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. I said that I'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. She once again used the argument of, ""Its my bird, I can do what I want with it.""

I took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. It began chirping for the first time I had ever heard. It seemed very happy. 

This was all 3 days ago. My friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying I'm being an asshole. So Reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so huge. 

I honestly went into this thinking I was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. She didn't. Like I said, I would have given it back if she had. 

I guess I just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. Which now, after reading the comments, I understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

Today I offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. She took it and is letting me keep the bird. But she still hates me. Honestly, at this point, I couldn't care less. The bird is safe. That's all that matters.

These past 3 months there were no employee of the month announcements due too “the owner being busy” and when they where just announced yesterday nearly all of the employees who had been their for a while where pretty pissed. 

The employees of the month for these past 3 months where 3, new employees, who where part time and generally not known for being the best employees. One of the people who got employee of the month was a girl who we just hired 2 weeks ago who has only worked 6 shifts, the other 2, a girl and a guy, are both bad workers who have been written up for lates, language on the floor and fighting with customers. 

Due to everyone being pissed, i asked my boss about how the employee of the month was selected in our works groupchat. We use this to contact our 2 store owners who are seldom actually in the store. 

Anyway my boss replied “we use numerous methods of critic” and a bunch of nonsense that wasnt very descriptive. So i said “well i know a lot of employees are frusterated about the recent employee of the month choices and those answers are not really answering anything” 

Nearly all of the other managers commented about how i was being bitchy and hostile and that i was just mad becuase i didnt get it.

394,No A-holes here,"Ok, so I AM the asshole in this story in several ways. But I'm curious if I am an even bigger asshole for being upset with how my wife is reacting to this situation.  I'm at the character limit, ask info. 

My first asshole move - I was put on a performance plan at work, and didnt tell my wife.

I didnt tell my wife because I didnt think I was going to get fired. I was getting good feedback on my progress throughout the plan, some notes were made about where I needed further improvement but the tone of conversations was ""good job, we're getting there"" and my boss and I were regularly discussing projects and events that I would support which would take place well past the end of the plan. In this plan, they can decide to fire you at any time, but the day I actually got fired was the designated end date of the plan.

I should have told my wife, hands down, even when I thought my job was safe. I knew I wasnt performing to the best of my abilities for a number of reasons, which I dont want to list because I'm afraid it will just sound like I'm making excuses. I thought I was doing ""enough"", but if I had been doing my best this would not have happened.

So I told my wife, and she was initially supportive, although obviously upset that I didnt tell her it was possible for me to lose my job. However, since about 20min past that first conversation (a couple days ago), the support has evaporated.

For example, today when she got home from work, I got the silent treatment in this fashion:

I said hello when she walked in, got nothing. I asked what she wanted for dinner, got nothing. I suggested picking up sandwiches from a place she had mentioned earlier in the week, got nothing, I suggested a few things we have here I could cook, nothing. 
I give up for about an hour, then I say ""so that sandwich shop closes in less than an hour, want me to-""

""Fine.""

""..ok, I'll run and get it?""

""I'm coming with you.""

I fully understand she has a right to be upset with me for not being upfront. But I feel like I need her support right now. I know I fucked this all up, and I need to make it right - but the fact is we could live off of her salary alone (roughly matches my previous salary), I'm getting paid 6 months of severance pay, and we have a healthy savings. We dont have kids, our only debt is a car we could pay off tomorrow without touching our emergency fund. Getting fired is still not good and I am an asshole for getting fired, even bigger asshole for not telling her I might get fired, but come on - I'm the one who got fired! I am not in a good way right now.

Part of my struggle performing at work is mental health related, and we had discussed in previous months how I did not feel she was supporting me in bettering my mental health, and she agreed and said she would try. Well, now is when I need that support more than ever.

Am I being a childish asshole? Or should my wife be capable of simultaneously being upset with me and helping me cope?",211,277,0.93

396,Asshole,"I’ve got a coworker, Juliet, that sits next to me. That I have worked with for the past 3 years. I honestly find her unpleasant to be around. 

So tomorrow Im having a bbq. I invited the group of coworkers that I hang out with at lunch along. They’ve pretty much become my friends there.

Towards the end of the day. A newer coworker that I’ve recently really gotten along with came over to my desk and asked what time they should come over for the bbq and if they could bring anything. Within earshot of Juliet.

After they left Juliet goes:

“So, you’re having a barbecue?”

I said

“Yeah, I thought I’d have one while it still feels like summer”.

She said “cool” and got quiet so I thought that was the end of it.

But anyway a little while ago I got a text from another coworker who is a mutual friend of both of ours. The text said:

Hey, Juliet doesn’t have any plans this weekend. It is okay if she comes over too, tomorrow?

398,Not the A-hole,"Note, this isn't a case of me not wanting to help my sister if she asks, which she hasn't, she's 25, if she wants the help of her big brother, I'll give it to her.

Anyway, a few months ago my sister got herself a fuck buddy, the guy is the textbook definition of a Hobosexual:

>Person who jumps into relationships to have a place to live.

Anyway, this has caused a lot of issues between my mother and sister, they used to talk for at least an hour on the phone 3-5 times a week, however this pregnancy has driven a wedge between them and my sister.

So now I'm getting phone calls from my mother 3-5 times a week instead, which I honestly don't mind, it's good to have a chat to mum, catch up.

However all my mother wants to talk about is my sisters pregnancy, which, and I'll be frank here, I don't give a shit about.

Plus my sister being up the duff isn't fun for my wife, as we have been trying for 5 years and done 8 rounds of IVF, still no kid. So really, I'm not interested, it's ""Huzzah, yet another person I know is having a kid"" essentially.

Anyway, I told mum last time I'm really not interested in discussing my sisters pregnancy, which is all my mother wants to talk about, she got a little huffy and hasn't called me for near 2 weeks, I talked to my dad about some other stuff, and he said ""By the way, you've really upset your mother""

For context, I live about 1,500km away from my parents, my sister lives about 40km from me. If my sister wanted help, she knows I'm here to help, but she sees no need to call me and discuss this stuff.

So, AITA for not actually being interested in her pregnancy?",69,349,0.95
399,Everyone Sucks,"I decided tonight that instead of slaving 2 hours making a homemade pizza, I'd try out Domino's pizza, as the price was pretty good and I generally was exhausted and willing to settle for fast pizza. I placed an online order for two large, regular crust pizzas with two toppings - pizza A and pizza B. I place the order around 4:50pm.

I leave immediately after ordering as it's about twenty minutes from my house. I get there at 5:15pm, check the tracker, and it's done! I go on and pay \~25$ and leave in a rush to go home and feed the troops.

I walk in and flip open the box - pizza B is a thin crust and burnt. Picture a flatbread pizza, definitely not what I ordered. Toppings we're right but the entire pizza experience was wrong. My son only bit into a single piece before I told everyone to drop it and only eat pizza A while I sorted it out.

5:30pm. I call Domino's and recap my pickup and order, which they acknowledge. I explain the problem.

D: let me credit you a *free medium two toppings* for your next order!Me: thanks! Can you send someone with the replacement large, two topping regular crust via delivery? I'll wait for it.D: sure, it'll be about 35-45mMe: got it, see you soon! You have my address?D: no...?Me: um ok it's -gives address-D: -repeats address back-

&#x200B;

I tell everyone, and we finish the one pizza among us 5, and wait.

6:30pm. I call back.

Me: hi, I called about the incorrect order, and you said you'd bring me another large pizza?D: umm yes, but I credited you a medium two topping?Me: yes, but that's not my dinner.

I repeat that I would like a large delivered to my house

D: oh yes I'll have it made right now, about 20 minutes.Me: you have my address right?D: yes, -repeats address back to me-

...

7:20pm. No pizza. Everyone starts to fend for themselves.

I grab the flat cold burnt pizza and hopped in the car. I go back to Domino's.

Me: hi, I want my money back.-i once again recap everything above, explaining how I've now had enough of waiting and just want my money back-D: ok sir... But you ate the first pizza right?Me: yes but I was expecting the correct second half of my dinner to arrive sometime before bedtime.D: ok.. I can only refund you the money for this pizza.

I try desperately to explain how the entire evening was ruined.

D: oh it's over here sir.-pulls out the pizza that was supposed to be delivered-I can only give you your money back on this pizza since you ate the first one..

I told them I refused to leave until they refunded me.

D: but didn't you eat the first pizza?

\-more back and first exactly like this-

They finally gave me the exact change back in cash, and I quietly thanked them and walked out.

&#x200B;

While recounting it, I caught myself using words like ""deserve"" and ""customer service experience""..

AITA for expecting and insisting?

Edit: the pizza was on the oven when I went back,for pickup, not delivery. Also fed my kids before 2.5 hours , but that's how long this entire debacle took

Edit 2: accepting judgement with my comment. I'm trying to fix some errors in my replies due to how I worded things, as some Redditors have chimed in. Younger, in my context, meant not adult kids. I should have clarified that point in my OP.

Conclusion: I am the asshole, both for my behaviour and my attempts to justify and clarify through comments. It was coming off twisted due to writing on mobile, and not clarifying my kids age and abilities. I should have just left the OP to be judged and moved on.

Thanks for the feedback, I was looking for some insight on my actions, and the revelations have been unpleasant, it's what I asked for. 

As I stated, I will be stopping by Domino's today to apologize and offer to pay for the pizza.

400,Not enough info,"I've had numerous discussions/arguments with my husband over this subject. He minces a couple cloves of fresh garlic and adds it raw to whatever he's eating. When he does this (at least twice a week), he freaking REEKS of garlic. And not just his breath. His body, hair, clothing, anything he touches smells like garlic sweat. 

I find this smell horribly unpleasant. If he closes himself off in a small-ish space (like our bedroom), the entire room stinks. There have been occasions when I've chosen to sleep on the couch rather than share a bed with him and endure the burning sensation in my eyes and sinuses. The smell LITERALLY causes me discomfort.

Last night, it came up again. I mentioned that I can't stand the stench when he eats raw garlic, he argued that it's not fair for me to tell him what he can and can't eat. I argued back that he can eat what he wants, just lay off the raw garlic. He argued back that I can't ask him to give up his ""favorite food.""

This nonsense continued with him insisting that I needed to say the words ""You can't eat what you want,"" and I kept repeating variations of ""Your garlic consumption causes me physical discomfort."" I even tried drawing a hypothetical comparison for him: it would be like if I started dousing myself with a perfume that made him feel sick, but I didn't care how it affected him because I really liked it. This made no difference to him, he just kept saying that I have no right to tell him to stop eating garlic. 

After several minutes of this argument escalating and going nowhere, I was on the verge of crying out of absolute frustration, so I told DH that he needed to walk away and leave it be before it got ugly. DH (32M, btw) very maturely rolled his eyes, mumbled ""Whatever,"" and went to our bedroom.

So I need to know, Redditors. Am I out of line here? AITA?

Edited to add: I've never asked my husband to stop eating garlic altogether. I'm only asking him to stop eating RAW garlic so EXCESSIVELY and so FREQUENTLY.",69,38,0.77

403,Not the A-hole,"This happened some years ago but for whatever reason has stayed relevant.  The details are pretty straightforward.  I’ve never had kids of my own and am dating a girl who has a 10 year old son.  We’ll call him Derrick.  Derrick and I get along great.  One day, we decide to take him to a theme park because he’s a kid and I’m a kid when it comes to roller coasters and such.  Great combo.  At one point Derrick says he needs to hit the head and asks if I need to do the same.  I tell him I’m good but I’ll wait outside the restroom until he wraps up.  My girlfriend looks at me and says “fine, I’ll take him.”   She grabs his hand and starts marching him into the women’s restroom.  Now, this is where my lack of parenting experience may have failed me, but I said, “you can’t take him in there.”   My thought process here is that he’s 10 years old.  First, why are we hand-holding a ten year old to the restroom, and second, are we creating a potential legal situation with a minor?  After a bit of back and forth I end up taking him into the restroom, but the aftermath resulted in her refusing to speak to me for over a week.  Her justification was along the lines of feeling that he may get kidnapped or assaulted if he’s by himself.  She never let this go.  To reiterate, I have never raised kids so I’m willing to accept I may be in the wrong here from a parenting perspective.  It’s not the act that concerns me here, it’s the age.

404,Not the A-hole,"I live in a place with street parking. Directly in front of my townhouse fits about six cars if they are all parallel parked properly. One particular car about a week ago, was parked about half a cars length from the very front spot. Therefore only five cars could fit. If he had scooched up to the pole where no parking begins, more cars could fit. 

Mildly annoying. I live across from a CrossFit gym and they use street parking, so a spot is hard to come by a lot of the time. I work a long ass day on Monday, he’s still there. Tuesday. Wednesday. Still there. My annoyance turns into rage because I probably have some anger issues. So on Thursday when this mother fucker is still in the god damn same spot, I get to googlin’.

48 hours with no movement is breaking a city bylaw. I call the city people, tell them the situation. They agree to issue a warning tomorrow if they can verify the situation. If he isn’t gone two days after that, they tow. 

I, even with my petty ass anger, ask them if he still isn’t gone by then if they’d do a wellness check on him, because who parks their car for a week on a busy street? It’s not a nice car, so I wouldn’t assume they have a second one. This actually triggers the cop I was talking to to question me “do you have any reason to believe they need one?” in a suspicious tone, but I just reiterated my case that it’s weird. 

So I tell my roommate this saga. They say it could be any number of reasons they left if there. Maybe they’re depressed. Maybe they lost their license. Etc etc. Completely guilt tripping me. “Would you want someone to do that to you?!”.

405,Not the A-hole,"Ok reddit. Here goes. My wedding is next month. My maid of honor, lets call her chloe is planning a bridal party. My other friend, lets call her Lauren, is a bridesmaid. We all met at work and have a pretty good group of friends, they are my closest.

Backstory: I grew up with an addict dad and dated addicts in my younger years. I was also hooked on pills in my late teens but cleaned up when I got pregnant. At this point Im kind of weary of addicts and their behavior. Lauren and her boyfriend have become alcoholics in the last few years.

My maid of honor chloe called Lauren today to talk about the bridal party. Lauren only wants to talk drinks. Chloe tells her we are having a cider since its a fall themed party and I dont want liquor for various reasons (I cut out drinking to lose weight, party is in chloes religious grandmas beautiful home, kids have school next day, we dont want to baby sit people etc).  Lauren says ""what about us Chloe, we want liquor"". Chloe tells her I dont want it, and she doesnt want it in grandmas house, and she's hosting and doesnt want to get drunk. Also MOH quit drinking a few months ago and I have an alcoholic friend whose in recovery. Im so fucking proud of them both.

So Chloe reiterates no liquor and says ""borntobreewild doesnt even want to drink until the wedding because shes counting calories and cant drink liquor because of acid reflux"". Lauren then says she will just make vodka soda because shes on the keto diet and that doesnt have many calories and I can just not drink it if I dont like it. Vodka is my least favorite liquor even if I could drink it, but her favorite. She wants to bring it to a party where I DONT EVEN WANT LIQUOR. 

We will have beer and wine at the wedding reception so its not like Im asking people to not drink at all. I dont think Im being unreasonable, especially because her and her boyfriend have pissed people off and made fools of themselves drinking before and I want the party and wedding to be a good time for everyone.

So, WIBTA if I told her in no uncertain terms no liquor at the party or the wedding or she can just fucking stay home?",59,149,0.93
406,Asshole,"I should start this by saying I live in Washington by Seattle and the rest of my family lives in Missouri by Kansas City. Im in the navy and have been away from ""home"" for 8 years having maybe seen my siblings for a total of 60 days over that time while my parents make annual visits to see me.

Recently my parents came to visit, see their grandkids (2, 1, and 2 months), meet their new granddaughter, ect. While they were here they said that they had come up with a plan for a family vacation in 2021 at the start of the summer.

They want to rent a huge house on the beach somewhere for a week and me and my 3 siblings to all bring our families and stay there. Cool plan. Like we used to do when i was a kid. Then they kind of dropped it and just continued their visit. 

Yesterday my dad started a group chat (which took less than 20 minutes to turn into chaos) with all his kids and their spouses to discuss this family trip 2 years from now. As people were talking they were exclusively naming places on the east coast, more specifically north Carolina beaches and whatnot. I tried to suggest that they come to the west coast instead so my wife and i didnt have to wrangle 3 kids under 5 on a plane and we could instead drive. Its cheaper and more convenient for us as well as being the same beach setting they wanted on the other side of the country. 

I was immediately shot down. ""We dont want to go to California"" and ""yeah but ive already been before (for maybe a total of 10 days)"" were thrown out by my sisters. 

I lived just maybe an hour north of the beach they wanted to go to on the east coast for more than 4 years. I dont want to drag my whole family back to a place we used to live for a vacation just because my siblings for some reason have their hearts set on one specific spot. Also, during all of that time none of them took the time to literally have a free vacation there and visit me. 

After some back and forth i flat out told them if they werent coming to the west coast we were not going with them. I brought up cost vs time there as well as that i didnt want to vacation where i had lived. I said if they come this way id be happy to make a trip down the coast, but not across the country. 

I want to see them because i havent seen much of them in years. They havent even met my children. But im not wasting $2500 on plane tickets, paying my $800 portion of the house, as well as paying for food and any of the activities we would go out to do. It does not seem worth it to me when a vacation that is much more convenient for us as well as cheaper wont happen because they simply refuse to see the west coast for their beach. Im NOT flying 3000 miles with kids so small.

AITA for refusing to see them if they wont at least try to come this way?

Edit: they are in the exact middle of the country and would have to travel the exact same distance either way to get to the coast. Also, i wasnt trying to say they cant have a vacation without me. Simply stating if it was that far away we wouldnt be attending.

Edit 2: they are flying half way across the country either way. Im simply asking them to fly the exact same distance west instead of east.",57,26,0.9

408,Asshole,"For some background context, I (22) have a blended family with one bio sister (20), two stepsisters (25 & 28) and a stepbrother (30). My mom & their dad have been together for a majority of our lives (15+ years) so growing up we all became very close, spent all our holidays & vacations together, etc. I truly don’t consider them “step” siblings - although we’re not blood they are my family.

This past fall, my stepsisters got engaged. The younger sister chose me, my little sister, my step-sister, and her closest friends to be her bridesmaids (no MOH). However, my mom was the one to inform me & my bio sis that we wouldn’t be in our other sisters wedding even though she chose TWELVE bridesmaids - including her new boss, a distant cousin, and a college friend she hasn’t seen in years (her bio sis is the MOH). Although I’m closer to the younger sister, I was genuinely hurt that my oldest sister picked twelve bridesmaids but didn’t include us. My other siblings also thought this was a terrible move on her part.

Admittedly, I became a bit passive aggressive whenever the wedding was brought up. For example, my mom said I needed to wear a more formal dress for the wedding because “we’re family so we’re expected to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests” and I responded by saying “if my sister wanted me to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests, she would have made me a bridesmaid.” My mom & step-dad get upset whenever I say anything remotely negative about her wedding, but I think they’re reacting this way cause they were also hurt that my sister didn’t include us.

A few weeks ago, my other sister got married. At the reception, family members asked if I was excited to be in my oldest sister’s wedding a few weeks later, but I awkwardly had to tell them me and my little sister were not asked to be bridesmaids. A lot of them were shocked and genuinely upset that she isn’t including her stepsisters in her wedding party. Our grandmother (my step-dad’s mom) was especially upset since she considers us all family & didn’t understand why she would pick all those other people over us.

I’m not sure if anyone’s actually told my sister how upset they are, but I do know my mom & step-dad are pissed at me. In my mind this was a complete slap in the face and has permanently damaged my relationship with my sister (though we clearly weren’t as close as I thought in the first place) and I have a right to express my frustration and disappointment. However, they think I’m overreacting and need to stop bringing it up, especially since her wedding is in a week and they think I’m going to cause problems for my sister on her special day.

418,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago, I lost my cat to something unknown, we didn't get an autopsy. She was a huge help for my depression and meant a great deal to me. My sister was even the one who drove us to the animal hospital and saw my distress as I realized she wasn't going to make it. Shortly afterwards, a friend of mine got me a cactus to help me feel better, which was also in coincidence with my cactus dying. Anyone that knows me knows that I love cactuses too. Not too long after that, another friend of mine also got me a cactus. Here I was, moved by my friends with my two cacti while I mourned my cat. 


Skip to yesterday and I get a text from my older sister: ""I broke your cactus, sorry."" I called her and asked her what happened, to which she replied: ""You put them in a bad place, and I bumped into one. It broke, so I threw it away.""


I thought she meant she threw the pot away, considering both my cacti are less than 3 inches tall and wouldn't be terribly bothered by a short fall. Turns out, she threw the cactus itself away. I wasn't home at the time and I didn't want to argue over the phone so I remained calm and asked her why she threw it away. She thought it wouldn't survive. I was a bad mix of heartbroken and pissed off inside. Both of my cacti mean a lot to me. Not only do they remind me of my cat, but they remind me that people outside my family do care about me; these gifts were probably the most thoughtful I've ever been given, especially in a time where I felt extremely insignificant.


Luckily she only threw them in the kitchen garbage, not the outside bin. When I got home, I dug Barnaby out of the garbage and put him in a new pot. I didn't ask my sister to dig him out because I knew she wouldn't. When I asked her about what happened, she was firm about stating that I shouldn't have left my cacti where I did and that it was my fault it broke.


Barnaby is in a temporary plastic pot now until I get a new one, and both my cacti are in a safer spot. When my sister got home today, I vented to her that I was hurt how little she cared for something that she knew was of great importance to me. Her only apology was the ""sorry"" at the end of her text. She got upset with me saying I was overreacting and that it's fine, nothing bad happened. I tried to explain again multiple times to help her understand my frustration but she became more agitated every time until she told me she ""never wanted to hear the word cactus again"" and that I was attacking her. I feel awful when she says that because nobody deserves to feel cornered in their own home. She said I was only mad because a couple weeks ago I asked her to take out the recycling for me because I'd forgotten and it was Sunday night, and I'd taken out the trash for her earlier that day before I left. She said she would take it to the bin, but not out to the curb because I hadn't taken the garbage to the curb (it wasn't garbage week).

This was 2 months ago and she doesn’t take care of the dog at all. Doesn’t buy her food, she doesn’t have toys, she doesn’t live a good life. I told my kid that she had to take care of her 


My best friend since childhood had spoken to me about wanting to adopt a dog. So I said I would let her have my daughters Lab because she really is a great dog, just a big love baby. But my daughter doesn’t take care of her and I can’t keep her because I’m allergic. 

My daughter told me I was a terrible mother and person for taking a dog from her home and just giving her away, and that I was a monster for not talking to her before, despite me telling her the conditions of keeping this dog that I’m allergic to. 

AITA?


ETA because someone said this was good info that I failed to provide

There was no waiver to have the dog returned if the situation didn’t work out. My daughter did in fact adopt the dog while my husband and I were out of town. She adopted the dog from a local rescue that was having an adoption special and was overflowing. I’ve never had to sign a waiver when adopting an animal, maybe it’s a state by state basis or rescue by rescue. 

I would have never given the dog away if 1) my daughter was a good animal owner which she is not or 2) if my friend wasn’t a good animal owner or if I wasn’t allergic. So no legal trouble. Just within the family problems.",24,47,0.9

423,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much the title, my bother (few years older than me) recently moved back home (he used to live with our dad). 

Everything is going alright. But.. he masturbates very loudly. If he's upstairs and the hallway door is open we can hear it downstairs. 

Right now I go downstairs and put on music, but I don't want to hear it. He's my brother. Plus I guess if it was reversed I would want to know? I'm not 100% sure if he does though. When he moves out here he's planning on finding roommates, so I guess that's another reason to talk to him. 

The only reason i can find not to tell him is because it would be super awkward for him, but someone has to tell him at some point right? 

WIBTA if I told him (and asked him to keep it down (in the gentlest way I could))?

Edit: I'm his younger sister, dunno if it's relevant but it makes it more awkward.

Edit two: Thank you everyone for replying! I will tell him though im not sure how yet. I'll read some more comments and figure it out. 

As for asking my dad to do it, he doesn't live here, so I'd have to ask him to drive 3 hours just to tell my brother. Plus he never mentioned it before when bro was living with him. Sounds even more awkward for everyone. 

Some people suggested to leave a note if I'm too embarrased to talk to him, but it's not really my embarrassment I'm worried about. Still considering it though.",207,1113,0.96
424,Not the A-hole,"I'm taking some college coding classes for my degree. I'm pretty good and enjoy it, whereas my friend doesn't and was worried about it. I told him if he was worried, he should join my class and I'd be willing to tutor him and help him out however I could. This is a hard course in general but there is a professor that is considered better than most - originally he was scheduled for him. I couldn't join him because a) there were no spots left b) it wouldn't work with my schedule anyway. So he joined me.

Long story short, our teacher is brand new and hasn't got the hang of it yet. Her homework assignments are hard. I'm still handling it well, but my friend isn't. 

After we turned in the first assignment, we had a quiz scheduled the following week, so I met up with him on a Saturday morning and taught him everything I knew for almost 7 hoours with a break in between. We made a custom program together using aspects we needed to learn. He kept asking me if this was somehow helping me in the process, and I was honest and said no. I'm doing this because he's my friend. He offered to buy me lunch, but I declined and said if I really wanted something I would be charging you for tutoring by the hour. After a couple times of asking to buy lunch, I finally relented and said just buy me a slice of pizza or something and we'll call it even. When we left, he felt good about the quiz.

Now on quiz day, we sit down and the teacher hands us our quiz. The quiz has 3 questions. The first one was to write down part of our assignment 1. I have to admit, the quiz was pretty hard, but I tried my best and felt okay about it. After collecting the quiz, the teacher asks us how it went. A lot of people said it was harder than they expected (it was our first quiz ever). My friend spoke up, clearly agitated and started yelling at the teacher that he hasn't learned anything from her or our TA, and that youtube helped him more than anything taught in the class. The teacher was clearly in disbelief and basically said ""Excuse me?"" and he went off on her again. Class ended and we were walking out as a group. My friend started yelling at me, asking why I begged him to join my class, how it was my fault, how I made him buy me lunch and he spent a bunch of money, that I rubbed it in that I could charge him a lot for tutoring, using every cuss word you can think of, and told me to fuck off. We were walking back to our cars and the last thing he said to me was to basically leave him 'the fuck alone'. I haven't texted him since he told me to leave him alone and he hasn't tried either.

Also I need to note, he ended up dropping the class that very night, lost his tuition money, and needs to retake it next semester. The following class, our teacher spoke to us and told us she was throwing out the quiz and had an honest talk with all of us about how she can prepare us better.

425,Not the A-hole,"It’s my day off and unfortunately I am on an important call with the IRS (issues from my previous job). My current boss wanted to ask me if we sold something yesterday because she couldn’t find it(our store has a high theft rate). I didn’t reply because I have to press the numbers on my dial pad. Since I didn’t answer she starts calling me I immediately press decline because I’ve already had to re-start this IRS call 3 times to attempt to contact a representative and the issue is time sensitive. I feel really bad for pressing decline, but I’m also annoyed because this is a recurring thing that happens between my boss and I (where she panics because she can’t find a product and decides to call me on my day off to ask where it is).

She said I looked tired. I was tired but nothing extreme so I just said ""I'm fine, thanks."" But then she asked several times again during thr lesson and I was really worried I looked ill or was doing something wrong. She then come over to my desk and asked me if I everything was okay at home. So many people heard, and I was mortified. I told her everything was fine and if I could just do my work. She asked if I was being hurt at home. I said no, which is true. She then asked a bunch of more questions of a similiar nature, and loads of people were listening. 

I was fed up.

I said ""I am not really comfortable with you asking these unecessary questions, especially where everyone can hear, so I am going now"". I proceded to walk out but she tried to grab my arm at the door. It was hard not to smack her. 

I went to the principals office and said I didnt want to be in that teachers class because she was awful and I moved classes shortly after. I also left a complain about her (for grabbing my arm).

The teacher cornered me and said I needed to get back in her class immediately or there will be consequences. And I did the worst thing I have ever done in my life. I told her to fuck off and never talk to me again. I told a teacher to fuck off. I felt like such a bad kid.

428,Not the A-hole,"Today I (M 30) messaged my girlfriend (F 33) of about a year and asked if she wanted to go out to a pub garden as the weather is nice this week and it's probably the last hurrah before autumn closes in for the year.

I suggested walking to a pub 1.4mi away through a lovely park on a paved path, which we agreed on. 

After returning home from work and waiting about 40 minutes for my gf to get ready I asked her if the pair of shoes she was wearing were comfortable before departing.

We set off, chatted on the walk, drank, ate, looked at doggos in the pub and started to walk back.

My gf does no exercise - like none, the entire time we have been together. She is unfit by her own admission and has been a bit of a shut in since going off work about 3 months ago.

10 minutes in to our 30 minute walk returning from the pub my gf started complaining that she was full, had consumed a few G&Ts and that ""people don't do exercise after going drinking"". I reminded her it wasn't far and that people hike between pubs all the time. All was light hearted at this stage.

After another 10 minutes of jovial but constant moaning on the same topic, I got to the point where I offered if she wanted me to call a taxi. I said this in a manner that suggested 'I don't think this is necessary but if you're really going to moan about it ceaselessly then I'll call a taxi'. She refused and we carried on walking whilst I teased her about her moaning over such a small walk, the moaning continued.

With about 10 minutes of the walk remaining we had slowed to a crawling pace and she was complaining that her feet were aching, I tried to encourage that we didnt have long to go and continued to tease her about her moaning. I said I imaginee her soles would be stinging as her shoes were flat with no cushioning.

We finally arrived home, still on good terms. After taking her shoes off she reveals blisters on both of her heels one around the size of a small watch face the other a small coin.

I was sympathetic and said do we have any blister plasters. My gf took this opportunity to re-emphasise that she had blisters to me in a serious and non-jokey way which I apologised for not believing her previously.

After another few minutes of being guilt tripped for her blisters I gave up on the conversation and said thanks for moaning for 20 minutes and now guilt tripping meand ruining a quite nice evening.

We've been arguing over the fine details off and on since.

AITA for mocking her thinking she was being lazy and a bit of princess, despite offering to get a taxi and asking if she had comfy shoes on before leaving?

I know this sounds like two 10 year olds not a couple in their 30s...

edit: Thanks for all the comments, on both sides. I went and apologised again for playing down her discomfort as well as over-reacting when we returned to the house. Have been holding frozen peas to her blisters 😑",99,69,0.84
429,Not the A-hole,"I had to go the ER after being sent there from my primary care doctor, as I was experiencing some really weird symptoms (a strange rash on my body, my blood pressure and pulse were super high, and I had a pretty high fever). I routinely take pain medication for a disorder I have that caused me to have to have 3 surgeries, one of which complicated things even more. Naturally, this is all on my chart so the hospital was aware of my medication usage.

I've had to deal with doctors assuming I'm an addict before, but I figured it would be fine that time because I was literally sent to the hospital (my doctor even called ahead to let them know he was sending me there) and had visible symptoms that had nothing to do with opioids or opioid use. However, the doctor refused to take me seriously and ended up leaving me in a room with the door closed for 6 hours as my symptoms got worse and worse.

At one point during this, a nurse came in to put in an IV. As she was doing this, she informed me that the doctor was taking his time to see me because he assumed I was in withdrawal. That was ridiculous, because I had even brought and shown him my full bottle of medication (the pills were stamped too so he could see what they were and that I wasnt trying to pull off some sort of half-baked lying scheme to get meds) so he'd know it wasnt withdrawal. I got pissed about that and asked the nurse to please let the doctor know that I was not in withdrawal, they could test my blood and find out for sure if they didnt believe me. She ignored what I'd said and instead responded with, ""You know, these sorts of issues happen a lot less to people who find ways to fill their days and be productive. You should really consider getting a job."" 

To be clear, I HAVE a job. A full-time job with a major tech company. Her comment was the cherry on top of an already shitty experience. I flipped out and said ""Bitch, I have a job. Its full-time with [X company] and I probably make a hell of a lot more than you do. And I dont treat my clients like pieces of shit like you do."" I definitely raised my voice as well.

I admit, that was probably over the line. But she was making assumptions about me and treating me like garbage. My friend who was with me at the ER got really embarrassed, called me a dick, and left.

I ended up finally being admitted to the hospital after a few more hours and after a few days, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition that was causing all of my symptoms.

I've been considering reporting the nurse and the doctor. I know I told them off, but I feel like I was justified. My friend who was with me still thinks I'm an asshole for blowing up at the nurse and thinks reporting them would make me an even bigger asshole. I really truly believe I was justified, but I want some other opinions before I potentially damage two peoples' careers. AITA?

**Edit for some extra info:** I was there in that room for a total of 12 hours before I was finally just admitted, and at that point they hadn't even run any tests to see what was going on. They took a urine sample when I first arrived but that's it. One of my symptoms was also a really bad rash, which I dont believe is associated with withdrawal and they could have learned that I was not in withdrawal by checking my blood or even just acknowledging the full bottle of pills I had with me and showed them. I also did request a new nurse and doctor, twice, but nothing ever happened.

**LAST EDIT:** Thank you all for your comments and thoughts! This has given me some perspective, and while I definitely should not have responded so harshly and rudely to the nurse, I will be reaching out to the hospital to find out what avenue I need to take to report this. I think it's clear to me that my response to the nurse was wrong, but the way the whole situation was handled by the hospital and their staff was egregious and needs to be reported. If my illness had been more serious and time-sensitive, the outcome could have been much, much worse. I worry that others in similar situations may not be so lucky. I'll keep an eye on this thread and may respond to more comments, but it's getting to be past my bedtime so please don't be offended if I don't or haven't responded. Finally, for any skeptics or folks wanting more detailed info, just click through to my profile and you can read my comments. I've been fairly responsive in this post, so there's a bit more info there. Thanks again everyone, and have a great night! :-)",1355,7542,0.94
430,Not the A-hole,"This literally just happened like I'm sitting on the plane and on Reddit as to not deal with reality.

I booked my flight home months ago and purposely picked an aisle seat up front so I can stretch and get off the plane early.

So my row has three seats. I get on and there's someone in the window seat. Then this older couple in their 60s (maybe 70s) gets on and the husband is in the middle seat. He then asks me ""would you mind switching with my wife so she can sit with me?"" My first thought is sure no problem, but when I ask him where her seat is, it's all the way in the back like more than 10 rows and in a middle seat. I politely say ""I'm sorry but I would rather stay here as I paid for this seat and I like being up front."" 

Then this chick behind in the row over goes ""oh come on, just switch with them.. you're alone and they're older than you"". I felt so awkward and again said no, I'd rather not. She then huffed and puffed at me and this older couple is still standing by me awkwardly, waiting for me to cave, finally this high and mighty chick decides that she's better than me and says ""I'll switch with the woman and you have my seat since you really need a front seat"".

Whatever, I switched with her because it was still aisle seat and only one row back. But now I feel like an asshole and people are looking at me like I'm a bitch.

AITA?? This couple isn't handicapped in any way, just older... Even then, they should have booked their seats together, right? Urgh.",275,875,0.94

433,Not the A-hole,"Recently my s.o and I have lost our roommates and finally have a place of our own. We love the space and have never been able to have our own place. Around the same time by much older brother lost his well paying job and has been barred from working in his field in the state he was living in. So he and his ""ex"" drug addict girlfriend moved into my recently deceased grandmother's place. I should explain as well I don't know my brother well at all. He was grown and out of the house by the time I was a toddler and we have never really talked in my teen or adult years besides here and there at finally gatherings once every few years. Well no my grandmother's house is selling and he needs to relocate. At first my mother asked if he could stay in one of our spare bedrooms and to be honest we are doing nothing with the space at this time. She had explained he had other options so it wasn't a big deal if we said no but that it would be the easiest and most convenient option for him. He had yet to find employment so he would be able to pay rent. I should mention he had been staying at my grandmother's for months and has been presented with job offers in retail and ect but hasn't taken any of them.   I discussed him staying with us with my s.o and we both agreed he didn't know or trust him enough to have him her alone with my s.o l so I told him and my mother no separately.

Now flash forward a few weeks and my grandmother's house closes in a few days and my brother hasn't figured anything out as far as a living situation goes. My mother has again asked me if he can stay here for a sort while and said my brother has taken some of the job offers that were presented to him. But now the message has changed to is being about his only option and that the other options would be in areas were it would be hard for him to find employment. I stood my ground and gave a solid no again but I'm feeling a bit of guilt for it. There are just too many red flags that I can't ignore. So hive mind, am I being an asshole?

434,Not the A-hole,"So it’s a really tricky situation for me because I love and respect my bf very much but I’m worried for his siblings. 

My bf and I moved out this month and are enjoying our freedom but the fact that his younger siblings are still stuck in the same house as his parents nags at me. My MIL and FIL  are some of the most self absorbed people I’ve ever met. Their perception of reality is mind boggling and because of that, there’s no way to have a rational conversation with them about the things that need to change. Just some small examples: his mom runs a small daycare even though she’s unlicensed and can’t manage it herself, (makes her youngest child play with one of the kids every day as well as having my bf’s grandma over to help watch them). The house is a complete mess and is infested with beetles, centipedes and spiders. There’s mold that grows in the bathroom and no one will take care of it (I had to go out and buy cleaning supplies because it was turning black). Besides that, the father is emotionally abusive and screams at everyone whenever he doesn’t get his way. 

My bf doesn’t want to call anyone YET because he’s not in a good place to handle the repercussions which I understand but while we are keeping to ourselves, the kids are suffering. I don’t think they’re in immediate danger but one of the kids does deal with depression like my bf and I and I’m extremely scared he’s going to be pushed to a breaking point by being there. I don’t want to betray my bf but I know that he won’t call or do anything without my “nagging”. So WIBTA for calling despite my bf’s wishes?

Edit; to anyone who sees this I did call.. they can’t promise that his family won’t find out it’s me which I’m scared of. I feel really shitty but hopefully it’ll be a wake up call. It was a welfare check btw

Edit again; I’m pretty sure she knows it’s me. My bf had to work today and she just showed up at his job trying to get answers out of him and saying a cop showed up because his old car is in the driveway.. so she either 1) is so in her own head that she thinks that’s why they showed up or 2) she knows the truth but was trying to get more information.",68,200,0.93

438,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys,


My husband's always been into tattoos. I'm not a fan of them at all, however he did have them since before we got together, and I learned to ignore them. He's casually talked about getting more every so often, though in the 9 years we've been together he hasn't, and any time it comes up and he asks what I think, I do let him know I don't like the idea of him getting more tattoos, but ultimately it's his choice. I won't be mad about it, but I'm not going to share his excitement.


Anyways, so he finally decided he's ready to get more... and he wants to get writing on his arm saying ""CREAM Git dat money $$$"" and his hands to say ""THERE IS"" and ""NO GOD"" with devil horns on one side and an upside cross on the other. I'm not gunna lie, I absolutely thought he was joking. At first I was like haha, very funny, so what do you want to get? And... yeah. That's it, apparently. I was so shocked I couldn't even say anything for a minute. For context, we do live in a more upper class area, but a smaller town, and while yes people have tattoos here, absolutely not something like that. He would stand out like a sore thumb, and honestly so would I, and while it may be shallow I'd rather my boss and coworkers not know me as the lady married to the dude with GIT DAT MONEY$$$ tattooed on him.


I was, and I admit, maybe a little too brutally honest. I told him, ""I know you want tattoos and all but... that's a horrible idea. Honestly it's really stupid and immature and I would be embarrassed to be seen around you if you really got that."" He told me I was crazy, that those are awesome ideas and he loves those sayings, and that he doesn't see what my problem is. I told him my problem is that that's something a wannabe gangster teenage would tattoo on his arm to try and act cool.


He got pretty upset and said he put alot of thought into this and it wasn't cool of me to tear him down like that, and even if I don't like it I should be supportive. I don't see any way I could support it whatsoever. It's a horrible idea and I am completely against it. AITA for being so harsh about it though?

My parents have always been very religious and very controlling. they don't approve right now that I currently live with my partner, even though they like him. He and I live together, have a phone plan together, and split bills together. We've been living together for about a year but dating for another (after a year of casually seeing each other). We don't have any plans to get married right now, but mostly because we don't think marriage is essential for our relationship. It's just how we feel. We're committed to each other and we're happy.


The family is going on a trip in a few weeks. My parents rented a beach house with rooms enough for everyone including three Masters. Right now there's only two married couples in my family (parents and then sister) and then my partner and I. When my mother picked a house with three Masters, I assumed that one was for my partner and I. We aren't married, but they've been over to our house and given us furniture and nesting gifts. Maybe I shouldn't have assumed they came so far.


It turns out they do not want us staying in the same room. I would understand this if we were a teenage couple, but we are both almost 30. Once my mom learned that I was planning on staying with him while we stayed, she began to have an emotional meltdown. We believe she is undiagnosed BPD and she's been taking out her frustration on my still at home little brother.


My partner and I have been talking about the possibility of them not wanting us to share a room for a while. Our plan together was that if they weren't okay with it we would let them know that we are partners and we come together. That we would not be able to afford a hotel room in the area they were staying and would be unable to come.


I'm still perfectly all right with that decision. I don't think it's right to control another person's behavior or relationship like that. 


But I know that if I stand on this hill, it's going to cause a lot of emotional pain for a lot of other people. I'm not responsible for her choices, but I know they're coming.

446,META,"I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Writing on mobile

Honestly, I didn't think I was being the TA here but many of my friends think otherwise. 

Yesterday, I was bringing groceries into my appartment's elevator. I had six bags in total so I brought three over into the elevator, then went to grab an adjacent door for a couple bringing in a couch. They obviously weren't getting the door themselves and me being me I wanted to help. 

The elevator doors closed before I got to door sensor, and when I got back to the elevator, the groceries were stolen. I contacted management and we took a look at video footage. Got the guys contact info and got in contact with him today. 

Here's the part where my friends think I'm TA: I told the guy he will have to pay me $200 if he doesn't want me to escalate this further. (Groceries were ~$100 total, he took $60-$80). When I him told he breached his lease contract by stealing property on-site and could be kicked out he coughed up the $200 and we settled it. 

Honestly, I was really frustrated that he didn't take my food to the front desk to return what wasn't his, and I think that played a role in strong arming him like I did. I don't think that qualifies me for being TA.


So Reddit, AITA here?

Edit: some people think I am a woman.. I am not. 

Thanks for all the input guys, really appreciate it all. I have learned a lesson or two thanks to you Redditors.",82,77,0.87

454,Not the A-hole,"Live in a two bed house with a friend from work. She has a phone/facetime (unsure which) interview for a job and says if I'm in the house, the thought of me being able to hear would be off-putting, and so I need to stay out for an hour.
She could easily do this from her bedroom and she wouldn't be able to tell I'm home/I wouldn't be able to hear anything. She chooses to use the kitchen.

I oblige and go for a walk. Worth noting we on't live in a city, so not can't do anything other than wander aimlessly round the woods, as I have a broken arm and so can't drive.

An hour passes and I return, thinking that unless its obvious she's done, I'll just head straight for my room quietly. I was unaware she was in the kitchen at this point.

She's locked me out! She did mention this last night but I didn't take it seriously.

I decide to sit in the garden and another 20 minutes pass before I'm allowed in.

Next bit I know my response was a bit arsehole-y - I said next time you can do it somewhere else. I then actually heard her swear (very rare) and call me selfish.

I've told both my kids I would help them with college but that I expect them to make a significant contribution by striving for scholarships and working and saving money.

I told my daughter (18f) last year that I wanted her to spend 20 hours on SAT prep, for which I would contribute $5000 a year towards college (in-state tuition)  which she did not do and missed a scholarship by 50 points.  She also made over $3000 working this summer and spent it all and saved absolutely nothing.

My daughter just started college and financial aid is run with my ex's information, I am not involved with it.  I think my ex didn't do something which caused a delay in financial aid.  First the ex asked me to pay the tuition until the loan came through which I refused to do.  Then she asked me to pay $400 for books until the loan came which I also refused.  I am trying to teach my daughter to be financially responsible.  She wants to go away to another school next semester and I told her I would give her double whatever she saves before then.  About two weeks into the semester my daughter came home complaining about not having books and I lost my temper being tired from shift work and yelled at her about wasting all the money over the summer.  She was living with me until that point but has not been home since for about two weeks, but she is still talking to me.

459,Not the A-hole,"Friend, Sara, and I have been friends for the last 13 years. She hasn’t had the easiest life and because of this I’ve always felt our group has given her a pass on a lot of things. The past few years have been especially hard on her. Married/divorced, health issues, etc. Earlier last year she had a rough few days, and a few friends and I took off work to come help her

Friend 2, Amy, has always been especially close to Sara. Amy was getting married last fall and had a conversation with Sara about her drinking at the bachelorette. There were a few instances at different weddings that concerned her but Sara assured her there is nothing to worry about.

I’m sharing a room with Sara and mutual friend, Liz. Liz and I head back to the room, Sara stays at the bar. Hours go by and we can’t get ahold of her. Amy texts us that Sara is running up and down their hallway screaming and asks us to come get her. By the time we find her she’s with hotel security

In the room and she’s bawling, so we spend the next 30ish minutes trying to calm her down. Liz passes out in one bed and I’m sharing with Sara. I turn away from her to go to sleep and Sara starts trying to kiss my neck/shoulders, rubbing my stomach/leg/side. I tell her multiple times to stop and push her away. She keeps trying and eventually gets more forceful and tries to put her hands down my pants. I sleep in a chair.

Amy send Sara a long email, recounting the night and how upset she is with her. Sara remembers most of it. Sara apologizes to Amy and they discuss the best way to apologize to me.

Fast forward 11 days, my dad dies. To say it was sudden is an understatement. I hear nothing from Sara and I know she was told about the next day. A month later she sent a card. I get it, she was probably embarrassed but she knew him.

This was last August. We saw each other at Amy’s wedding and Rachels’s birthday but didn’t speak besides the  hi/hello.  In February she invited me to her birthday dinner and I told her we haven’t discussed what happened at the bachelorette and I was uncomfortable with it. She said she felt awful about it and should have reached out, and that she would call me in a few weeks to apologize. (Spoiler: she doesn’t).

From what I understand from Amy, a few weeks ago Sara and her got in a fight over some of Sara’s recent actions. During the fight Amy brought up everything from last year (not just stuff with me) and how disappointed in her she was and that she needed some time away from her.

Now, Sara is trying to reach out to me to apologize. She’s called me, texted, and even reached out to my husband. It all feels very disingenuous. From my point of view, she’s had over a year, but is only reaching out now that her best friend is mad at her. I deleted her months ago off of social media, haven’t responded to anything, and have no plans to. The more she reaches out, the worse I feel about it though. Im also aware I could have reached out as well, but never did.",15,58,0.94
460,Not the A-hole,"2 weeks ago I got a job in NYC, me and my family live in Upstate NY. I’ve been staying with my grandma so I can make it to work on time and go to school too. Before I got the job I would stay home and only go down to the city when I needed to go to college, so on my free days I would stay and clean. 

Me and my stepbrother (he’s 16)  share a bathroom together and a hallway, I usually clean our area because I hate having a mess. Problem is, the 2 weeks that I wasn’t home, I arrived last night to an awful mess. There was blood in the shower (my stepbrother gets nose bleeds a lot ) stains on the toilet, a toilet that hasn’t been flushed, hair on the walls and in the tub, gum on the sink edge, hair products out of their cabinets and soap box carton next to the trash bin instead of inside of it. Hallway has candy wrappers on the floor and it’s dusty enough to cause me to sneeze. 

Angered, I called my stepmom upstairs to see the state that her son has left the bathroom. I told her since I won’t be here as much anymore that her son is going to have to pick up part of his slack (the only chores that he does is clean his room and take the garbage out)  and that he needs to clean the bathroom because I am not picking up after him. The mess wasn’t mine after all so she was understanding last night about it and told me she was going to have a talk with him. So I let it go, didn’t use the bathroom because it was nasty and went straight to sleep.

It was until this morning, that I received a message from her, in a group chat with me her and her son, to “address the situation” by leaving a long text of how we are both responsible for cleaning the bathroom and that I as the adult, he must follow along my steps blah blah blah. Point was, she was shifting the blame of how disgusting the bathroom was, on both of us. 

I didn’t leave the bathroom in that state when I left home 2 weeks ago so I feel like I shouldn’t be responsible for cleaning it. He doesn’t do much of the house chores, and barely cleans himself. He does the bare minimum in school too since he’s always skipping classes. He doesn’t have much responsibility and there for I feel like he should be the one cleaning his mess.

It upsets me that she wants to blame me as well, acting like I make as much as a mess like him, which I don’t because I never raised that way. 

My stepbrother doesn’t respect his mom and makes her do most of his chores (even after witnessing that mess, instead of making him clean it, she’s decided to do it herself). He will never take her seriously because she doesn’t punish him by grounding him and taking away privileges, he doesn’t know the consequences of his actions. 

I’m considering telling her off, because she always complains to me how she’s worried for his future and how much of a slob he is. But I feel like she’s hugely to blame because he wouldn’t be like this if it weren’t for her irresponsibility.

So am I the asshole if I tell her about this?",21,35,0.93
461,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not returning my former pastor’s calls?

So about 3 weeks ago I went to church with my parents because my dad asked me to come as he was getting installed as an elder of the church. For those not familiar with what that means, think of it as sitting on the board of a company. It’s a WELS Lutheran church which is about as traditional and conservative as it gets. I was technically a member there as I went there growing up (like from age 12 and up) but since college I really haven’t gone much due to some serious moral differences. The place is just overrun with politics and drama and BS I just couldn’t do it. I stayed a member out of respect for my parents because they want me to attend on holidays and special occasions (ie becoming an elder).

About a year ago I (26F) moved in with my boyfriend of 3.5 years (30M). We’ll call him A. Might not seem relevant, but...

During the service, it became time for communion. My dad, the newly installed elder of 15 minutes prior, dismissed my row to go up to the front and receive communion. The pastor leans over, whispers in my ear, “Are you still living with A?” I was lost, like I didn’t even know he knew that. The guy has only been a pastor there maybe a year. I don’t know this guy, we’ve never even had a conversation. I of course said yes, and he said “Okay, we’ll talk after the service.” Yikes. He then deliberately skipped over me when passing out the wafers. I was shocked. I RAN out of there in tears.

Later on I came to find out he used the bible study following the service to talk about me and my boyfriend without our knowledge or consent. He said the topic of discussion was “the importance of closed communion” which basically means (to the WELS church) that you can’t take communion if you’re “living in unrepented sin” because you’re damning yourself. He literally mentioned us by name and talked about our personal lives to the whole church, without ever speaking to either of us about anything ever.

Needless to say, all of us, including my parents and brother, sent letters asking for our release from the church. Insane we even have to ask for that, but that’s the way it goes there. Multiple members have approached him and told him how wrong he was. I’m completely humiliated about the whole thing, like I don’t even feel like I can show my face there again. But now the pastor keeps calling me because he wants to apologize in person and “finalize my request.” He’s not trying to meet with anyone else in my family. I kind of feel like I don’t owe him anything and think he’s just doing this to clear his own conscience. But I don’t know if I should let him apologize.

AITA? I know the pastor is most likely TA in the situation described, but I’m asking if I’m TA for not letting him apologize knowing the background.

TLDR; I went to church and the pastor humiliated me by talking about my personal life without my knowledge or consent. Now he wants to apologize in person after I’ve left the church and I’m not sure if I should let him apologize.",130,404,0.95

466,Not the A-hole,"I work for an agency that provides services/benefits to our customers. I know that's super vague but I'm trying to minimize my identity here (have coworkers that use Reddit).

There was a manager at my office (""Joe"") in a division that works with mine, but he did not have any direct supervision over me. This individual made it his personal crusade to save our organization money in any way possible when it came to the services we provided to our customers. This was *not* part of his job. He just took it upon himself to butt in places to try and cut corners. Literally ""Don't tell them they can [feature that's clearly stated on our documentation, but in an area customers might not read] that costs us money!"" At the same time, he had no problem in advocating for expensive renovations to the parts of the office he used most.

Joe and I were at odds for years. We had dozens of tense conversations where you're not actually raising your voice but are on the verge of it. Our word choices could be just shy of workplace inappropriate. Our mutual animosity was very well known. 

Recently, he died. His funeral was last Friday, which I'd already taken off in advance. I did not attend, because of the reasons outlined above - he was a jerk, we disliked each other, and I didn't care. (note: I'd have attended the funeral of literally anyone else in the office, just not Joe's)

This past Monday, I was confronted by my own manager stating that he'd noticed I wasn't at Joe's funeral.

Me: ""Yeah, I didn't go.""

Mgr: ""Why not?""

Me: ""I had other matters to attend to."" (9/13 was the release of Borderlands 3, which I why I'd taken the day off)

Mgr: ""What other matters? It was your coworker's funeral, you worked with him for ten years!""

Me: ""Personal matters. And we hated each other for nearly all of those ten years. I wasn't going to pretend to have empathy or respect for a man who showed a complete lack of both qualities the entire time I knew him. I'm sorry if his death affected you, but it didn't impact me. I know if I'd died first, he sure as hell wouldn't have come to my funeral. I wouldn't have wanted him there."" (and plus, Borderlands 3 was more important)

Mgr, after a long pause: ""That's still no reason to skip out. It's disrespectful.""

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" and I turned back to my work. 

I'm aware that my ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" line may have been a bit a-holeish but I didn't really feel like the conversation went anywhere.

I've never been comfortable with the ""don't speak ill of the dead"" thing. Just because someone died doesn't elevate them to being some saintly paragon of virtue, nor does it erase the bad acts they committed in life. I didn't want to waste time and effort pretending to mourn a man I was vehemently opposed to nearly the entire time we worked together.

468,Not the A-hole,"The title basically explains it. I'm a thin fit woman and I'm all for different body types as long as they're healthy. My husband, on the other hand, has a problem with fat people. At some point he even told a friend PETA was gonna rescue him taking him for a whale, when he said he was going to the beach for vacations.

However, a few months ago he discovered videogames and stays up late playing, so he doesn't work out with me anymore, he's also enlarged his portions. All this has resulted on him gaining a few pounds. He's aware of that and keeps saying he will start working out again and try a new diet.

I wouldn't care about this if this was not affecting him or others, but that's not the case. He's been projecting his concerns onto one of our dogs. My dog is not fat, at all, he's a chow-chow golden retriever mix so looks fat (in reality he's just fluffy), but is not, he's on his ideal weight according to the vet. Yet my husband insists he's fat, berates him when he asks for treats and has reduce the size of his meal (dog's fine, I give him the rest of his portion later).

Now to what happened. Wednesday night I bought 2lbs of cheese and used 1/2lb as an ingredient for our Thursday to Saturday lunches (6 meals). Today, I'm about to have breakfast and all the cheese is gone, and there's only one meal left, which means he ate 4 lunches and 1 1/2lbs of cheese by himself in 24hours. My dog is with me at the kitchen when this happens, as he knows I give him bits of the FRUIT bowl I make for breakfast (FRUIT, not sausages, not fries, FRUIT. My dog was having effing bits of apples and mangoes).

Of course he starts nagging about how the dog is fat and I'm helping him become obese. Boy was I mad... I reply back asking how is it possible for a human being to eat all that in a day, that that's not healthy, I can't imagine how much sodium, fat, etc there is in 2lb of cheese, that I can't comprehend how can someone eat 4 lunches in a day. I finally say he needs to stop projecting his weight gain onto our dog and start doing something about it. I also add we can't afford to start buying food as if we were a family of 5.

He apologizes about eating all that and I tell him he doesn't need to apologize to me, but to think how much he's eating for his own health. Then he says it's a pretty asshole move to insist on the health thing instead of just accepting his apologies. I say he misunderstood what I meant, I wasn't being dismissive but letting him know the one gaining weight, having health issues, etc is him not me, so he doesn't have to apologize to me, as this thing doesn't affect me directly.

He insists I'm an asshole for fat shaming him. And then say I have double standards as I call him out on his eating habits, but keep giving food to our ""obese"" dog.

So, AITA?

Edit: my phone changed project to protect, so changed that.

Also wanted to add the whale incident friend and my husband roast each other all the time, so although he's sensitive about his weight and the whale comment was not ok, it wasn't also as horrible taking the context (and their type of friendship) into account.

Edit2: Thank you very much for your comments and your concerns regarding my husband's mental health, you guys helped me to have a serious and open conversation about the issue. The good news is that he's no near depressed, or anything. And honestly, I've never imagined what the real situation was in a million years and wanted to share with you guys. His explanation basically started with ""please don't be mad, but...""

There's one of his colleagues I absolutely despise and he's banned from our apartment (this married man basically wanted to use our apartment to bang students, which I find disgusting, that's why he's banned. And to be clear, my husband has also banned people I know from our place, so it's something we both have done with 2-3 people one sided or mutually).

Turns out I have been feeding a family of 5, but to be fair, the rest of the ""family"" has been feeding him as well. Apparently my husband spread the Sims virus among other professors, and now he, the other painting professor, the watercolor professor and the banned dipshit are using our place as a man cave to play the Sims. Yes, as weird as it sounds adult men aged 30-40 are getting together to build and decorate houses, they're not even playing with Sims, just looking for designing ideas on Instagram and then decorating houses. He showed me and they have like 30 already built. That's why the casserole and the cheese were gone, and that's why he's been gaining weight. The other professors bring pretty unhealthy snacks (specially some bite size fried tacos from a local restaurant) and if you eat that shit 3 times a week and don't workout bc you're building houses, you're gonna be fat.

He didn't want to tell me because he thought I'd be mad at him for letting dipshit guy in. We compromised and he's going to ask them about a monthly ""fee"" with which I'll buy healthy snacks specially for them, so that he stops gaining weight. Also, dipshit can be around our house as long as I don't have to see him and can't bring anyone with him.

About our dog, he kept insisting he's fat, so I set my food down and told him that if he doesn't believe his vet, he's free to pay for a nutritionist but until then, doggo will eat as much as always. He refuses to acknowledge he's projecting onto our dog but hopefully one very expensive nutritionist appointment later, he'll finally realize that. We didn't discuss the workout issue, as I believe at this point it was better to leave it at that and maybe bring it up in the future.

Finally, thank you very much for your advice!",237,1277,0.95

Background: I (19F) go out shopping with my mum now and again but whenever i go into a changing room she'll either 1) come in with me without asking or 2) she'll open the curtain of the changing room I'm in without asking if I'm decent which has lead to people seeing me in my underwear before. 

Anyway, the other week I was out with my mum shopping and my mum was talking to the sales assistant about this dress I had tried on and my mum says  ""her weight fluctuates a lot"" about me which really upset me because I didn't want a stranger knowing this about me.

Now he wants me to include him more in my life and I understand that. What bothers me is the huge age gap. I've just finished college and got my first real job and he's already in his 30s, of course we have some different interests and different friend groups. 
For example, I often go out with my friends (all max 2 years older or younger than me) to a pub, club or something. His idea of hanging out with friends is inviting them over to his place or hanging out at theirs. Most of his friends are already married and have kids. 

Last weekend I invited him to join me at my friend's birthday party. All was going great, alcohol was involved and we got into a conversation with the birthday girl. She directly asked me if I'm bothered by the age gap. And I replied with ""Of course I am a bit. But we fit together really well."" 

He overheard this and got upset. Now he keeps mentioning that I shouldn't have a problem with him being almost 10 years older and that if this really is an issue for me, we should just stop this now, before it becomes a serious thing. He also thinks it's rude that I ""embarrassed him like that"" in front of my friends. 
I don't want to end things with him, but this just seems like unnecessary drama from his side, tbh. 

AITA for admitting the age gap bothers me in front of my friends? Or is he overreacting?

Edit: The age gap is not a deal-breaker for me and I am most definitely NOT embarrassed of him. It bothers me mostly because everyone keeps bringing it up and judging me for dating an older guy.

471,Asshole,"I go to a private Catholic all-boys school, but I also hang out with a lot of kids from other schools. One of the people I hang out with is this girl Emmy, who I have an 'on-again-off-again' thing with. We've dated on and off for the past year, and although we aren't at the current time, I don't really like anyone else, so I asked her to our 'Fall Formal' dance (basically homecoming lol). 

&#x200B;

She accepted, and everything was fine for a while. However, a problem emerged recently with her dress. Basically, my school is really big on dress codes at school dances, and there have multiple times in the past where people have been kicked out or just plain refused entry due to 'dressing badly'. Emmy's dress falls into that category: really low-cut v-neck, tight, and ends way above the knees. I had mentioned to her previously about the dress code rules before she bought the dress, but she shrugged it off/ignored me. After some back and forth, she refused to return the dress and get a new one, so I told her I was 'un-inviting' her as my date. I just think it's not worth all the trouble to be refused entry or get kicked out. It would make a scene and be generally embarrassing. Besides, I'm seen as basically a 'good, clean kid': good grades in AP classes, lacrosse and soccer teams, student government, speech and debate. And I'd hate teachers to see me as some sort of troublemaker, especially since they'll be the ones writing my recs for college.

&#x200B;

Anyways, she got pissed and went off about how it's 'her right' to wear whatever dress she wanted and called me a 'dick' and told me I had to go with her, because now she had bought a dress and it was too close to homecoming to find another date. I think she's entitled to wear whatever, but I'm also entitled to invite or not invite her.

Before the event:
I've offered to lend him an extra deodorant I hadn't used.

I also asked him privately to out deodorant on, he said he had forgot to that day (which wasn't true, we can smell him daily) and that he wouldn't forget tomorrow.

Yesterday, after being able to smell him from a couple feet a way, I confronted him and said ""Dude, you meet to put deodorant on. A lot of people are annoyed by your BO."" He replied that it wasn't a problem and I told him that it is and it's a problem to anyone around him.

I told my friend what happened and he told me that I was a dick and that I shouldn't have said anything because it wasn't my problem.

476,Not the A-hole,"My husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole “I don’t have money for gas” victim part. This money is not part of our savings or anything. Anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. During those two weeks I bought groceries for us, I paid for our take out food, I offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall I was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

Yesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn’t have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card. He started to act strange. I asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. I asked him if he was hiding money from me? And he denied it and said I was paranoid and crazy.

He checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, “wow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!” And he played the whole I didn’t know part.

He continued to argue and I told him that I don’t care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

It took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

Today I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don’t want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

By the way I’m 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We’ve know each other for 3 years.

Am I the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
I’m just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I’m questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don’t know anything anymore.

477,Asshole,"I come from a family of one Jewish and one catholic parent. I was raised to respect all religious beliefs and how I feel is how I feel. I did have a bris when I was born. For info, that is when a Jewish guy comes and circumcises you and gives you a Hebrew name. It’s not an entrance into Judaism or anything like that so it wasn’t a ceremony, mostly a tradition. 

Fast forward to us having our child, and fiancé was okay with the bris as she understood that it wasn’t an entrance into the religion. We had also talked and up until now, (9 months old), she was okay with not having him baptized because she understands that I am not a catholic and we will not be raising him catholic. 

Now we are getting married and we have classes to take to get married in the church she wants. We have to meet with the Pastor for some type of marriage prep/questionnaire. It’s in about a week, and now fiancé comes up to me saying she wants our son baptized and I should understand since she let us have a bris. But my concern is that a baptism is actually the first step on the path to Catholicism. She is telling me that it’s actually not, I’m overreacting but al the research I’m doing is proving that it is the first step. 

I feel as if she is using the bris against me to get our son baptized, when we’ve already agreed well before our son was even born that we wouldn’t be doing that. AITA for not wanting to give in?


Edit: her parents are extremely religious and this would be used in the future to push their agenda. Partly the reason I’m not a fan. Her parents are pushy on her and that’s where this is coming from. It’s already an issue that I’m not converting for them. 

The circumcision was going to happen anyway, and when she agreed to the bris, we already talked about the baptism.

481,Not the A-hole,"My family and I recently moved about 5 hours away from any of our family. I have a 5 year old son in Kindergarten, and he misses his Paw Paw a lot. His school held a Grandparent's Day lunch, where grandparents could come and bring their grandchild a special lunch and eat with their grandchildren.  I've taught elementary school before where they've done this same event. When I taught, if a grandparent couldn't come, they'd allow pretty much anyone else attend in their place.  My son was very distraught his Paw Paw couldn't make the 5 hour trip, and asked if his baby brother and I could attend in his place?  I said of course I would, and sent back the sign up sheet marking that myself and my infant would be attending. The principal then told me that I wouldn't be allowed to attend, it was an event for grandparents only. Since we are new to town, I did a little investigating and found that many parents intended to accompany the grandparents and also attend. I then asked the principal, would she turn these parents away at the door, since parents were not allowed?  She didn't know how to respond and just kept claiming no other parents had ever asked to attend (which I later found out from his teacher was a lie, that many parents asked to attend).  I tried reasoning with her again, providing research based evidence that shows children who feel isolated have increased stress that can lead to adulthood. She still would not let me attend. I decided to call the school board about it, and almost every person I talked to as I worked my way up the chain of command said that they left matters like these up to the principal's discretion. That was when I called the Superintendent. He actually agreed with me, that having a special guest rather than no one would be preferable, and even brought to my attention that her allowing some parents to accompany grandparents and not allow parents in general to attend was discriminatory.  So, I attended Grandparent's Day (there were many other parents there too) and the principal was mean mugging me ever chance she got. I enjoyed the lunch with my son, and didn't let him in on the drama, but still feel a little assholish. She probably got into trouble with her superior.

Today her mom was over with some kid. Not sure how he's related to her and don't really care. I was in my room avoiding them because they were being loud for most of the afternoon but eventually I kinda wanted to have some of my ice cream.

Went out there and this woman was fixing a bowl of my (expensive) ice cream!!!

I said absolutely not, it's mine. She said she didn't know but just to let Jacob have this bowl. I said NO and took it off the kid. Kid started crying and the mom started yelling at me but I cut her off and told her that if I came out there and saw her stealing my food again that I would throw them both out myself.

Same eye colour, hair colour, facial features etc. That said, the only thing she has inherited from me is my skin tone. I am extremely pale and Lily had inherited this. Most people assume she is white until they are told otherwise. 

We live in a predominantly, but not entirely white area, and Lily has gotten to the point of asking questions about why people look different and are different colours etc, though we have made it clear that it doesn't matter. Lily sees her own skin tone and has asked if she is white, and I have said yes, which has annoyed Sandra. 

Sandra has pointed out that while Lily has white skin and is assumed by most people to be white, she still has black/african heritage which she needs to know about. While I absolutely agree that Lily should know of her heritage and where she comes from, from a purely factual perspective she is white, and saying otherwise will be confusing. Would it wrong to refer to her as a ''white person with black heritage'' which is factually correct? 

Sandra is very frustrated with me but I don't understand why.

So little backstory, when I(27M) was younger, birthdays were never something that was at all significant in my family. I really don't know why but my parents never held one for me, I grew up getting invited to birthdays, and always questioned my parents why we never celebrated my own (The most my mom would do was buy a little cupcake or something). Another thing my mom would say was that it's actually the mom that should be getting the gifts and being celebrated since she went through the trouble of ""suffering through labour"".

Anyways, fast forward to current time, its my mom's 65th birthday, she want's to celebrate it because she is now legally a senior, and has retired from her job.

She scheduled an FB event for her birthday at a restaurant, I  didn't RSVP, but she called me the night before to tell me to come. The day of, something came up and I completely forgot about it.

She's super hurt and she's going on social media, our family, and actually reached out to some of my close friends to tell them that I forgot her birthday. I really didn't see the big deal as we've never really celebrated birthdays before, +I didn't even tell her I'd be coming for sure, as for me forgetting her birthday... idk, growing up birthdays were never important to the family, so why should it be now?

AITA for not really placing that much importance on her birthday?

edit- I dont know how I forgot to add this part- 

One time I actually tried to host my own birthday party, I sent out my own invitations and told my mom it would be in a week.

491,Not the A-hole,"Just to be clear, I wasn't a major drug addict. When I was 15-16, I started using drugs, like x and sometimes pills and weed and such. By 17 I was doing cocaine and amphetamines and a plethora of other drugs consistently. I also slept with an absurd amount of guys. There was a point when I was 17-18 when I slept with... a lot of guys. Like sometimes multiple guys a week, often much older men. I was living on my own mostly and was just completely messed up from family issues. I went to rehab soon after my 19th birthday, mostly for cocaine, but I wasn't a full on hardcore drug addict in that sense, I was just a mess overall and the drugs contributed to that. I quit all drugs and mostly alcohol after, and I went to therapy, a lot of it. I would still consider myself a drug addict back then though, in the sense that I did a large amount and craved them a lot. Just not like, super drug addict. I hope that makes sense lol. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, fast forward to today, and I've been dating this guy Marcus for the past 4 months. I've been writing short stories about various points in my life, and one of them is me when I was in rehab, and he read it and right away was freaked out that I never told him I was in rehab, or that I was ever a drug addict. I had told him before that I had a very fucked up childhood, and he was fine with that, I just didn't think he would be so hyperfocused on the rehab/drug addict thing. He was pretty upset about it, he felt it was something I should have told him sooner, but I just... never felt it was THAT big of a deal. Frankly I likely could have quit the drugs without the rehab, I was on the road to getting better either way, I just felt it was a good idea to get some help for the drugs and other problems there. I never thought it was that big of a deal.

Am I the asshole for not telling him this? He doesn't think of me as an 'asshole' but he is definitely upset that I never told him I used to be a drug addict. I mean, I've told him before that I had a messed up childhood and that I used a lot of drugs and all kinds of stuff, but suddenly me going to rehab means I'm damaged goods? Not anything else that I mentioned? Not like I am damaged goods or anything, but he seems to think its like a 'step above' everything else to have a history of addiction. Which isn't entirely false, but again, I wasn't exactly a hardcore addict in that sense.

At first I went with my either my brothers or my friends. But I quickly learned that my workouts were much more enjoyable if I trained by myself.  I could go at my own pace, decide my own routines, go at whatever time I wanted. I have trained by myself nearly every day for the last 3 months.

Yesterday a colleague and close friend asked if he could join me a couple of days a week at the gym. He has been struggling with alcohol and drug addiction and has decided that working out will help him on his path to sobriety.

495,Asshole,"So we're coming up to 4 years in our relationship, and we've been having talks about having children in a relatively distant future. After marriage, she plans on keeping her last name, which I have no issues with whatsoever, it's her name so it's her choice. However, when it comes to what the children's last name would be, she didn't hesitate to say that they should be her surname, no questions asked, because of the following reasons:

1. Her paternal grandfather had 5 girls and 1 boy, and that boy is my girlfriend's father now, so he was the only one that had the surname passed down, while the rest of them had their name changed from marriage. She feels bad that her dad can't pass on his name and that his surname lineage will die out with his kids, and so she wants to do it in honor of her father.
2. She is not looking forward to the whole pregnancy and birthing process, from insemination to post-birth recovery, whether it's vaginal or C-section. She has read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos on all the possible risks that could happen and the damage it could do to her, both physically and mentally. The fact that she has to carry a baby for 9 months and have her body permanently scarred from giving birth, while her spouse remains unscathed and healthy without a care in the world, makes her think that she has the RIGHT to have the final say on the FULL NAME, first middle and last, without my having any say in the matter.

Here are the reasons why I think the above are not valid arguments:

&#x200B;

1. My father never had a father, so he's actually the first in a line of my family's last names to be passed down to another generation.  In my opinion, both my father and my girlfriend's father are practically in the same boat here, so I don't think the first reason is applicable in this situation.
2. I can understand where she's coming from, and I feel bad for any partner I'm with to go through the child birth process, which is why I want to be there for her in every waking moment to provide the best comfort throughout her pregnancy stages and be able to nurture our child after birth for as long as she needs to recover! What she said, however, makes me feel like the effort I'm putting in doesn't even come close to what she has to go through, and makes me feel like I'm not involved with the family, like my opinion doesn't matter and my worth in the family is insignificant compared to what she'll be going through.

So that's the situation....also, she added that if we were to adopt a child, she would CONSIDER allowing the child to have my last name and be open to discussion about it...I would be happy enough to just have our kids have a combination (not hyphenated) of our surnames, but she doesn't like the sound of it. The fact that I have to negotiate this with my partner is something I would have never expected to do, and I don't see how her reasons are fair to me.",268,194,0.9

As the title says, I’m a vegetarian. And although I’m not one of those militant vegetarians, and on the whole very pragmatic about it, vegetarianism is something I do feel very strongly about.

**Current situation:**

My company works on an account for a meat-focused restaurant chain helping them to promote their stores. It’s been a client for a couple of years now and sits within my wider team. Despite there being several occasions in the past where I’ve been asked to become significantly involved in the account, the company has respected my decision when I’ve refused.

I’ve not completely avoided the account, occasionally helping out with mechanical tasks like proofing or offering up other resources for the team to use. I’ve been ok with this level of input because it has never involved much thought from my side. Essentially, it would happen the same with or without my input so I might as well help my team (who I’m on good terms with) and I don’t feel like I’m betraying my beliefs as a result. 

Anyway, due to some changes at work, I’m being asked again to take on more responsibility with the account. Initially I was asked to lead the overall account as day-to-day client contact  – something I was able to push back on and convince them was not a good idea. However, they are still asking me to play a core role behind the scenes, leading the strategy and execution. In contrast to the current situation, I would need to contribute thinking and actively use my skillset to help promote a cause which I believe to be inherently bad.

**WIBTA for refusing to take on this account?** Some more info below to help you see things from both sides:

**Why I might be an asshole:**

* · I have the capacity to take this on at the moment. It would also most likely end up with someone who doesn’t have much extra capacity to support if I refuse.
* · Other than me being a vegetarian, I’m probably the best person in the company to be working on this account, based on my skillset and other experience
* · I’ve worked on the account before, as mentioned above, so it may look like I’m just playing the vegetarian card as it suits me

**Why I don’t think I’m an asshole:**

* · This is a long-held belief of mine that’s well-known in the company. It should be obvious that a vegetarian shouldn’t work on this account, and when I have supported in the past, it’s been clear that it is only in a very basic capacity and has still been a considerable compromise on my part
* · The minute I start trying to think about ideas for the client, I feel this huge contradiction and can’t allow myself to think any further. In all honesty, I’d be happy if this restaurant chains goes out of business so it’s hard to think up strategies that are designed to do the exact opposite
* · Agreeing to contribute to something that goes against my beliefs is the definition of selling out. Even if my job was to be threatened (which it shouldn’t come to, but you never know), I should still stick to my beliefs. Otherwise, what’s the point in having them?",666,669,0.87
497,Everyone Sucks,"Not really sure how to caption this but here goes...Monday morning I heard noise outside the house and saw a cat  getting mauled by 3 feral dogs. As much as I felt sorry for the kitty I was not going to challenge 3 dogs to save it, and nobody was home, so all I could do was to throw a few coke cans from the 2nd storey to scare them off. Didn't work.


I only dared to walk out when the dogs were gone and found the cat already dead. I snapped a few pictures and posted it to the neighborhood group chat. Since nobody seemed to know where the cat came from, I couldn't leave all that to rot at my doorstep. I called up some cleaning services and had them dispose the cat, clean up the rest of the mess and disinfect the area.


Yesterday I got a visit from an angry crying lady claiming that the cat was hers, and she accused me of killing her cat. Well not literally, she understood that the dogs did the job, but she was upset that:

1. I did not save it

2. I threw it away like trash

3. ""Showing off"" its carcass to ""gain attention""


All I could do was to apologise, I couldn't really argue with a grieving person. After letting her blowing up all that steam she finally left. I am now wondering if it is really my fault, even though I apologized to her I don't really think I am to be blamed for the cat's death. Who lets their cat out with feral dogs in the neighborhood? And what was I supposed to do with its carcass? Leaving it to rot till the owner shows up? AITA?


FYI: For those concerned about why I post the pictures, people in the group do that all the time when we find dead or injured animals, not the first time somebody's pet got mauled by the dogs already, and they could carry diseases. I did not post it as a showoff, more like a warning "" feral dogs strike here"" and ""Does anyone know if this cat has an owner?"". Nobody at that time responded, so I assumed it was a stray had it cleaned up.",269,427,0.93

We = Mummy, Daddy and our toddler are invited to SIL’s wedding.

 

When we got the invite I asked my husband if he could go there earlier with his parents for the ceremony and son and I would join the party after church because he is a toddler and will be annoying/loud in church and the ceremony for me will most likely be 15 minutes of “shh” until everyone gets so annoyed they frown and I need to take my toddler outside.

I don’t feel like going to a wedding ceremony when it only ends in me sitting outside watching my son ruin his dress clothes and telling him not to run so he won’t fall or not not to scream at the birds or whatever.

You all know how toddlers can be. I love my son, just to make clear,but I prefer to keep him in environments where he can be himself and not be restricted by literally everything, I feel like he is a toddler and he will learn soon enough what it means to be quiet etc. he’s just not quite there yet. Very active, very wild, hard to tame but we do enforce rules and the like and he is usually well behaved but when he’s excited 99.9% he will go berserk.

 

We have to drive quite a long way to get there and it would be perfect for him to nap during that time in the car and arrive when church ends.

Husband is having none of it and forces us to go to church. He is the brides brother and will be part of the ceremony I don’t know how or when though.

I told him if he wants a 2 year old in church HE should be the one to carry the consequences. So if people want to enjoy the service he better be the one going outside with our child and watching him because it could be easily avoided and everyone would be happy.

He says he will but usually he just agrees to things so he doesn’t have to deal with discussing them and then when the time comes doesn’t do them or asks me to do it right then because he know I will be embarrassed by our sons behaviour.

I've been inviting some of them over for various things, and for some of them my house is one of the only places they have to get away from pretty shitty situations. My issue is that some of them have children, who tend to open all the drawers regardless, and I'm not sure whether it's my responsibility to preemptively childproof my house or if it's their responsibility to keep an eye on their kids/siblings when they're over. It's not like I have unsafe things and dildos strewn all over the house, it's more drawers at toddler-touching height that have like, kitchen knives in them. I'm not sure what the proper etiquette is for this kind of thing, but I'm leaning towards ""just leave things where they are"". Wibta for not making sure things are safe?",70,89,0.9

506,Not the A-hole,"My son, Semi, is 11 and in the 6th grade.  He has a friend/classmate, Frenchie, that lives in the same neighborhood as us.  My SO is friendly with Frenchie's mom.  I pick Semi up from school everyday, take him home, then go back to work.  Of the 20+ days of school so far, I have also picked up Frenchie around 10 times because his mom texted my SO and asked if I could because she wouldn't be able to for various reasons.  I don't mind, its not out of my way, and Frenchie is a good kid who gets along well with Semi.

&#x200B;

Both Semi and Frenchie are into hip-hop...heavy.  I'm a real 90's hip-hop aficionado so I love it.  In fact, its fun for me to introduce them to 90s rappers and give them the history behind the artists/albums/songs etc.  At one point in time Frenchie's mom DID mention to me that she doesn't allow Frenchie to listen to rap at home because its too vulgar.  My response to that was just, ""OK.""  I mean, its your house, its your kid, do what you want I don't care.  They're middle school boys so they're going to listen to what they want, but none of that is my business.

&#x200B;

2 weeks ago I was telling the boys how when I was in elementary school, Snoop Dogg's album ""Doggystyle"" was the biggest album in the country.  Everyone at my school loved that album, regardless of what their musical taste was.  The following week, on the way home from school, Frenchie asked me to pass him the aux cord and he threw on ""[Ain't no fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th0V-fxo9CE)"" from his Spotify.  Classic track.  RIP Nate Dogg.  We all sang along (I don't let them say the curse words, its a very graphic song) on the ride home.  Apparently Frenchie kept singing the song when he got in the house and thought he was alone.  His mom heard him and flipped.  When she asked where he heard the song he said it was playing in my car on the way home.

&#x200B;

Frenchie's mom texts my SO, ""OP let Frenchie listen to a very vulgar song in the car today, and Frenchie was singing it in the house.  Something about giving up pussy and licking balls.  As per our agreement, OP will not allow Frenchie to listen to this kind of music in his car.""

&#x200B;

As soon as I read that, I flipped too.  First off, we had no ""agreement.""  Second, don't tell me what to listen to in my car.  Third, it was playing from YOUR SONS PHONE.  So I texted her back personally, ""Since I paid for my car myself, I'll create the rules on what I listen to.  If thats an issue, feel free to find another ride for Frenchie.""  I was going to tell her it came from Frenchie's phone, but I ain't no snitch.  She then responded, ""Thank you, but your services will no longer be needed.""  Did she just fire me from doing favors for her?  We'll see how long that lasts.

&#x200B;

My SO thinks I'm being too sensitive about the whole thing, and I should have just said OK, but instead YTA because I just HAD to prove a point.  I say no.  AITA for allowing him to listen to the song while in my car?",175,400,0.94

508,No A-holes here,"I've known this girl for 3 days and I basically already know her life story. TMI isn't a thing with her.

She has, without fail, in every single conversation I have ever had with her, slipped her depression into it. We talk about books and ""Oh, I can't read Orwell's stuff. It aggravates my depression and then I have to cry alone in my room for several hours"". We talk about history class and it's ""And I can never do my homework because I'll just sit there staring at the page thinking about how useless I am. Just repeating useless, useless, useless to myself like a mantra."" She walks up after class, sits down next to me, and the first thing out of her mouth is ""I missed the bus because I had a depressive episode in sixth period and my teacher wanted to talk about it. Have I told you that I was in therapy in seventh grade?""

I don't know how to respond half the time rather than the occasional ""Oh, that sucks"". I know what she wants me to say, of course. She wants me to say ""No, you're not useless"" then list stuff I like about her, or ""No, you're not a burden"" then proceed to to lie about why I don't mind wasting my lunch for her, or something along those lines, but I don't because I don't want to feed that kind of dependability. Does that make me an asshole? I obviously don't think she's useless, but I don't want her leaning on me like a crutch. I don't want to become her comfort object, there when she needs me, dropped when she doesn't.

I don't think it's really her fault. I think she just has a really hard time reading social cues. Her laugh, for example, feels incredibly forced and she tends to talk over others. She might also have several mental problems, and might be on the autism spectrum. 

My main problem is that she's essentially made me responsible for her emotional well-being and I don't want to be. I have nothing against people with depression. I have depression. I have a therapist. And maybe that makes me an even bigger hypocrite, but at least I don't go shoving my problems down strangers throats (other than on Reddit, obviously). And it'd be different if she only talked about it every once-in-awhile like my other depressed friends, but she doesn't. It's every single time she opens her mouth like her personality revolves around it or something.

She's miserable and has low self-esteem and I get that but at the same time I don't want her to make me responsible for her mental health. I have enough shit to deal with without her. I don't mind continuing the friendship, I just don't want to be responsible for making her happy.

I'm fairly certain that I'm her only friend. If I tell her she can't vent to me she probably won't have anyone else she can talk to. It might be being selfish and incredibly narcissistic by trying to get her to stop talking about her problems but I hate feeling responsible for her.

512,Not the A-hole,"So I (20,F) have an uncle (55,M) who lives on the other side of a two family house from me, meaning our walls are connected. The other side of the house belonged to my grandma, but she's since passed away. Since then, he's been renting the place out from my dad, the owner, for a little more than half the full price.

Some background. While my grandma was alive she never allowed my uncle to let women spend the night in her house. Everything changed after she died. Now, my bedroom happens to be right next to his (across the walls that is) and shortly after she passed I started noticing that I could hear him talking back and forth to a woman whenever I was doing something quiet in my room (reading, etc). It only started distressing me one night when I was combing my hair and I heard the woman make comment of it. ""She's ripping her hair out!"". I thought I was crazy, but soon after I could hear them fighting outside (my window was open) and I distinctly heard my uncle go ""Listen, I dont want to torture you"" and heard the words ""her father"" (as in maybe ""I rent this place from her father""). I didnt know what to make of it. 

In the time since then, I have on MANY occasions heard him and whatever female he had over at the time speculate intently about what they think I'm doing from across the wall. This includes, but isn't limited to: if the reason I'm being so quiet is so that I can listen to THEM, hearing me creak and then accusing me of farting (dude.), trying to guess whether I'm asleep or not based on my movements, etc. This would happen for sometimes hours at a time. Its fucking unnerving.

In hindsight, these events, which usually happened at night, were more than likely so that they can have sex when they feel like I'm either a. doing some activity that they can count on to reasonably and consistently distract me or b. asleep. I realized that first event probably happened because my loud hair combing (my hair is very coarse) was ruining the mood.

I've told my dad that this has been going on, but he can't just evict him without good reason. He scheduled a sit down for the three of us about this and my uncle denied everything. I was afraid to accuse him of everything I'd noticed because I knew how crazy it sounded.

Recently after a period of peace following the conversation, he's been having what I assume to be a new person over. Late last night, all of these things were confirmed to me when, after a long period of them going back and forth about me, I heard the woman comment that she'd thought I'd fallen asleep, and I hadn't. So I, not wanting to give them the satisfaction, burped loudly. The woman immediately yelled ""FUCK her!"" and a few minutes later I heard his headboard banging loudly against the walls.

This situation is making me extremely uncomfortable. I don't think I'm wrong for asserting my presence in my childhood home. So WIBTA if I were to buy spy equipment to record them and show my dad?",53,74,0.89

514,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit. Throwaway account bc I don’t want this situation on my main account.

I recently moved 1000 miles to be with my husband in his hometown. We have a nice little house with lots of space and a fenced backyard. It‘s like a dream come true... sorta.

We both have always wanted a dog, so my husband and I agreed to split the cost of our dog 50/50. We contacted the breeder before I moved. I originally wanted to wait until I settled in and was actually THERE, but my husband was too excited and didn’t want to pay for the breeder to hold the puppy for us. It was an extra $50 for each week the puppy was held, and we would need her to be held for a full month... so $200 extra. So I sent him 50% of the cost and he got the puppy about a month before I would be moving in. 

My husband took the puppy to stay at his parents’  house because his apartment at the time didn’t allow pets. So our puppy was with my husband, his mom/my MIL, his dad/my FIL, and his little 8-year-old sister for an entire month.

Unsurprisingly, his family got extremely attached to our puppy, especially his little sister. They walked her, fed her, took her to get her vaccinations, and started training her together as a family.  They LOVED our puppy and wanted to be involved, so they would insist for paying for things instead of letting me or my husband pay. I was very grateful and figured they were helping us out. No big deal, right?

Then I moved in with my husband and shit hit the fan when we were about to take our puppy with us.

His little sister started bawling her eyes out and his mom very firmly said that the dog was now theirs since they cared for her for a full month. I expected my husband to say something but he didn’t.

I was pissed! I told them that this was OUR dog and they knew from the get-go that she would be coming with me and my husband when I moved here. All of the things they did for our puppy was a way for them to say they could keep her! 

MIL and I got into a huge argument, his little sister was inconsolable. My husband suggested we just let them keep the puppy (wtf???) and we can visit sometimes. I said fuck no! I told them the dog was MINE and MY HUSBAND’S, end of story. The fight was really bad and hurtful things were said.

We ended up taking our puppy and his parents have cut him off completely so he’s pissed at me for creating conflict in his family. I’m pissed because what the actual fuck? We had to money to pay for everything the puppy needed, we could’ve afforded the holding fees if he hadn’t insisted on getting the puppy early, imo this is all his fault... 

Our mutual friends are almost evenly split about this. Some say I’m a heartless bitch who took a puppy away from a family that loved and cared for her, others say my in-laws are crazy and manipulative. Idk what to believe at this point... and I know this isn’t over.

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks for all the input so far. Here’s a few points I want to address:

1. I was attached to my puppy. I spent almost every night on FaceTime talking to her and watching her play. We picked her specifically for her breed and temperament. In my mind she was my dog from the start and I was already attached to her. She wasn’t replaceable like everyone wants to believe. She has now been with me for 3 1/2 weeks in person and is doing great.

2. In-laws did not offer to buy her, they expected to just keep her, though I don’t think I would’ve sold her regardless.

3. We went with a breeder because we wanted a specific breed that would fit into our lifestyle. Breeder is reputable and AKC registered. I personally don’t see a problem supporting reputable breeders but that’s a controversial topic and not what I’m asking about.

EDIT #2: A few more things I want to address:

1. I have no intention of giving my in-laws my puppy at this point, whether they offer to pay for her or not.

2. I reimbursed them for the money they spent on our puppy. I have no idea if they accepted the money or not, I left it in their mailbox.

3. Again, I’m not asking about adopt vs shop. Controversial topic but not relevant to my post. I went to a breeder for the reasons stated above and do not feel like arguing about it anymore.",749,2407,0.95
515,Not the A-hole,"I recently had a birthday (one of the big ones), my SO has a habit of not getting me anything for my birthday, or, will leave it to me to buy my own gift. 

I've explained many times i dislike this and have asked her to put a little thought into getting me something (everyone deserves to feel a little special once a year), for any event with her (Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc) i always put a lot of thought and effort into getting her a great gift.  

Months ago i explained as this was a significant birthday I'd really like her to arrange a present for me, and provided a few suggestions. I'm not into extravagant things, nothing was crazy expensive, and nothing required a huge lead time to arrange.  My birthday comes and goes, and again, i received nothing.  I asked why and was told simply she wasn't good at it, and thought I'd arrange something.

I was shocked, given the lengths that i had gone to before hand to communicate my (what i thought were) reasonable expectations this year.

So she's upset now that I'm upset, suggesting some present options now, but i don't really want it to be an after thought that's the result of an argument.

So, i come to you Reddit to find out, AITHA? Am i acting like a man child and just need to get over it, or am i being reasonable in this scenario?",52,53,0.89

517,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I are foster parents. Two of the kids we have are 2 and 3 yr old boys. Some friends of ours are also foster parents and they had two boys the same age. They decided not to continue fostering and donated the toys that they had for their boys to our churchs organization that gives free stuff to the needy and focuses on foster families as well. Well the organization asked us if we wanted them and we said of course. Now the other parents have decided to try again and got the same boys back and want the toys returned to them. It's been months and my kids play with them daily. I dont want to give them back. My husband says it's the right thing to do. They were theirs in the first place, but if some family they didn't know had gotten them they wouldn't be asking for them back, right? I do want the other foster babies to be as comfortable as possible in their transition but I also dont want to take away toys my kids have come to love. Am I being selfish? Or should I take this as a ""learning to share"" opportunity with my kids?

Update: Thank you everyone! I am not an asshole, but my kids could learn from this. I told the other mom I'm sorry but I'm not going to give all the toys back, however if there were specific toys that her boys were asking for I would see if my boys would part with them. She gave me a list and I set them out and ELI3 the situation to my kids. My boys were very confused because at first they wanted to get rid of everything and then kind of back tracked and freaked out. But I did get them to peacefully part with some of them and I think other mom is ok with that.

So I pick this woman up around 1:30AM the other day and she wants to go to the city over. She was perhaps intoxicated as she asked I not take highways. So I take backroads where you'll see a house maybe ever five kilometers.

She's on her phone and mentions something like ""yeah I just got in the car with this paki guy, I'll be there in half an hour"". I'm white, though. Greek, but white. I don't even have an olive complexion, you couldn't even tell I was Greek. No accent, nada. I stopped the car on the side of the road and asked what her deal was, and she made a ""caricatured stereotypical Indian accent"", I don't know how else to explain it. I asked her to leave my vehicle and she did. Maybe she thought I was joking but I wasn't, I sped off.

The next morning she did phone to complain so I surmised she got home safe, but my dispatch and some of my coworkers said I went too far and it's not safe for a potentially drunk woman in her 20s to walk along country roads at 2AM.

520,Asshole,"This is not a shitpost and I feel I already know the answer. My girlfriend asked me to drive her to the ER for what we are assuming is pneumonia. When we pulled up the parking lot was packed and I realized we would probably be there awhile so I mentioned I could probably run to the gym to lift while she waited to be seen. She didn’t say anything and just kept walking. 

While they were getting her vitals I heard another patient say she had been waiting for almost 4 hours. I told my gf when she came out that we would most likely be waiting a lot longer and I would just workout late that night. She told me to just go to the gym and that she’d wait alone. I told her I’d make it really quick and be back as soon as possible. I also asked her if she would be mad and she said she didn’t care. I left her there to go to the gym and about an hour later she texted me saying she was leaving because she was feeling really sick and the nurse told her the wait time would be even longer because of 2 traumas that got admitted. She ended up ubering home because I wasn’t there to drive her home. 

She doesn’t seem to be actually mad at me, she just said she wants to go to bed. I feel like shit, but she also told me to go. Am I the Asshole if she gave me the okay to leave?

UPDATE bc I’m getting a lot of questions: 

1) She went to the ER because Urgent Care was closed and was having severe tear inducing back and chest pain when breathing. 

2) My gf has not responded to me since last night. I’m assuming she will be my ex very soon. I spoke to her sister and apparently her parents are annoyed with me as well. She went to Urgent Care this AM and does have bacterial pneumonia",1364,3254,0.92

She is off for three days and doesn’t walk him once. I get up for work and walk him then come home and find out she hasn’t walked him once. It is starting to piss me off. We both wanted a dog and she somehow thinks it is all my responsibility. On the days we both work and he is alone I take home to the dog park. She never does any of that. In fact the one time she “tried” she couldn’t find it(not that it is on the internet anywhere) AITA for being pissed? She acts like it is a new things that dogs need to get out.

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there.

525,Not the A-hole,"I was at the doctor's office today with my husband, son, and daughter. My son was playing with toy cars on the floor and a boy sitting across from us asked if he could play. We started talking to the other parents. We found out their son is 4, which worked out perfectly because my son was 5. I then asked how old their baby was. They said that she was 9 months, which took me by surprise because my 8 month old baby was much bigger. I thought the baby was a few months old. I said, ""Wow. She's so little."" 

The mom's face changed and she explained that the baby had ""cat cry syndrome."" I forget the medical name but it's referred to as cat cry syndrome. Some of the features are developmental delays, a small head, and inability to gain weight. The parents talked a little about her diagnosis that they just received a couple of weeks ago and then we were called in for my daughter's appointment.

My husband said that I should and that it's always a dick move to bring up a baby's size, but it's especially bad when the baby is clearly disabled. I didn't think it was that obvious the baby was disabled. Her head was covered and she was adorable. I genuinely thought she was just a little baby like my niece was. My husband works with special needs children so I think he was able to pick up it before I did.

526,Asshole,"I was born disabled. My parents agreed to a painful treatment when I was little. It caused severe PTSD and the fracturing of my mind. (Diagnosed by a psychiatrist.) The treatment barely had an impact on my physical state. In fact, I have an old note from the doctor who administered the treatment saying that it was just a cosmetic procedure.

When I found the note, I asked my mother about it. She said that she thought it was worth it anyway, because it made me look better. I asked why she ignored my very clear PTSD symptoms (screaming, regressing, going catatonic, always terrified, bed wetting), and she said she thought I was just acting like a kid who didn't like doctors. She thought I would just bounce back.

I can't let this happen to another child. I can't. My brother in law is having a baby girl, and I am so terrified that if she isn't perfect, he'll consent to such treatments. He'll ignore her screaming and begging and let the doctors rip her mind to shreds. I can't let this happen again.

Our friend group used to get together regularly, and we'd decide who's house we'd be at beforehand. One week it was Ally's turn to host. Ally and Bec are housemates. My SO and another friend, Sarah, go over early to help set up and find Ally is sick with the flu. SO and Sarah ask Ally if she's up for hosting or if she'd prefer to rest. Word gets around that Ally is unwell, the rest of the group don't want to force her to host and don't want to get the flu themselves, the decision is made to have our night at someone else's house and SO offers our place because we're the closest. Night goes well, Ally gets better, life moves on.

A few weeks later, Bec messages me to say that Ally is unhappy about how SO treated her, that she felt that he purposefully excluded her and doesn't want him attending these nights anymore. No mention of Sarah. I message back to say, I wasn't there that night so take this up with SO and Sarah. You also weren't there that night so if Ally has a problem she's welcome to discuss it with SO and Sarah. I'm sorry she feels that way, but it's up to the group whether they want SO to keep attending. She responds to say she'll message SO and I leave it at that. A few hours later SO calls me from work and I ask if Bec has gotten in touch, he said no, I said at so and so time she messaged me saying Ally was upset. He says he'll give her a call, tries to call Ally first and when he can't get a hold of her he calls Bec. For the purpose of his work, his calls are recorded. He has a brief chat with Bec asking what's going on, call ends 9 min later.

A few more weeks go by and I find out that Bec has been telling people that SO screamed at her on the phone for hours, that he's an abusive person and that I use Bec's friendship as an escape from my abusive relationship. SO is hurt, I'm angry. Now that abuse allegations have been made we bring up his call log from that night and get legal advice. I hear the conversation, it's short and normal. We decide to cut ties with Bec and Ally. We never asked friends to pick sides and distanced ourselves to avoid drama, but our friend group splits in half and one half supports SO.

Sarah is silent. She is the only person who was there the night this started, she could have easily said 'hey Ally, I'm sorry you feel hurt but I was there too and we decided together that you needed to rest and get better. We love you and didn't exclude you'. In my eyes, her silence when abuse allegations were made show naivety and disrespect. She still comes to our house and chats as if nothing has happened. I personally don't want her in our life anymore. SO thinks I'd be an asshole.

I got kinda pissed about this...the rest of us were spending 10+ hours on this report, why should she get out of it and get a good grade just because she can afford to pay somebody else? I started paying attention to the chat a little more and Sara kept asking for answers to quizzes and saying awful things about the professor and blaming her for how hard the class was. This is my biggest pet peeve, esp bc our prof was *way* nicer than most, it really set me off and I went back and took screenshots of all the times she asked for answers and the time she asked if someone would write her lab report. Note: she negotiated price, they worked out a place to meet up, that was not a passive joke. 

WhatsApp shows your cellphone number and you get to pick a username; she put her full name in. This was last spring semester, I let it go for a while. I have her in a class again this semester, and she's not dumb, just lazy. But I see her doing the same thing, she cheats on half the assignments. Found out she's got a ***3.9 GPA.*** That's unheard of at this school. 

Our school has a zero tolerance for plagiarism; if you're caught with damning evidence, you're expelled. Degree progress revoked. Assuming her MCAT is fine, this girls got her pick of the litter for med school; she's got tons of volunteer and shadow hours, even research. Loads of free time when you're not doing your own work after all. Obviously that goes bye bye if she's expelled.

I still have all the screenshots. More and more I want to report her, mostly because I'm bitter about how much better her app is than mine, which makes me feel like an ass. 

AITA/WIBTA if I reported her for buying her lab report

Edit: most of our classes are curved to some degree. Her doing artificially better for cheating does negatively impact other grades, particularly on one class where only 90th percentile of students get a 4 for the class

Edit 2: this girl and I are applying to different schools (she's going MD and I want to do DO) but when I say I'm bitter about how much better her app is, I don't know if this makes a difference but it's because I think it's unfair that myself and other students should be compared to her when she's got an unfair advantages. Kinda like steroids in athletes. 

Also this was a pattern of cheating, she's done similar in this class as well (though not in a group chat, I've just heard her talk about it bc we're in the same lab section)",388,750,0.94
529,Asshole,"I was at the shops today and a group of boys about 11-15 years old got on the escalator with myself and my toddler. Some got on in front some behind. I went to the side so they could still pass but they didn't. 

One was blearing crappy music from his bag and every other word was swearing. 
I didn't say anything because in 30 seconds we would part ways but one of them behind me was swearing continually and overly loudly. 

I have a toddler with me who's got language delay and at the moment he is having a leap and soaking up language. 

I asked this kid to not swear please. You would have thought I asked him to jump in front of a bullet the way he reacted.  I swear, but there is a time and place ( and yes I know I sound like a old cranky lady but I don't get the need to swear so much so loudly beyond thinking it's cool or something) 

The kid abused me and I told him to ""suck it up princess, 30 seconds without swearing. It doesn't make you cool or look good, in fact it makes you look like an idiot because you can't think of anything better to say"" 

He went off again, I did not raise my voice but walked away from him. One of the guys with him apologized to me.

535,No A-holes here,"My friend, who we’ll call Alan, means a lot to me and I feel shitty for even thinking about this.

Alan is autistic with probably OCD. He needs things to be a certain way. 

For example, at a recent dinner that I had planned for a surprise birthday dinner for another friend, Alan asked for a picture of the seating arrangement. I explained that there was no seating arrangement and anyone could sit wherever. He then, very politely, explained that he was going to be surrounded by other people that he did not know and needed to know exactly where people will be sitting. He also asked to be seated at a specific area, in between specific people, and wanted to know what the menu was. As a result, I had to figure out how the seats would be arranged in order for him to feel comfortable. I also forwarded him a link to the restaurant’s menu.

He is also very picky with what he eats. As a result, he started to nitpick every single thing on the menu. “What is this?” “Why are we eating here?” “I can’t eat here.” “I don’t like the food.” “You sure you can’t go elsewhere?” etc. I chose this specific restaurant because it was our mutual friend’s favorite.

He also asked me if I finished making sure how the seats would be positioned and asked if the two people he wanted to sit in between knew where they were going to sit among other things.

He is my friend and I understand him so I did what I could to accommodate him.

But, now my birthday is coming up and I know inviting him will be the same thing. It’s my birthday and I don’t want to feel like making my birthday be work when I just want things to go smoothly and how I want it to be without thinking of what to do.

I was thinking about maybe doing a separate dinner just me and him instead.

536,Not the A-hole,"My SO (29F) and I (26F) moved into our first house this past year. It’s in a suburban neighborhood and all houses surrounding us have kids aged 2-12 who all play together in the street out front.

Not being miserable wretches, we interact with all the kids to the point where they greet us by names and always come running up to say hello when we get home.

3 siblings live across the street from us, two girls, 2 and 6, & a 10 y/o boy. Both next door neighbors each have a daughter. One is 12 & the other is 7. 

I won a couple things at an amusement park a few weeks ago—a girly hat and a little purse. I figured I’d give them to the 2 sisters that live across the street, since the purse was really something for a toddler. I hadn’t given it to them yet because I didn’t want to give the girls something without having something for the other kids too 

My SO has been asking me when I’m going to give it to them and I’ve said multiple times that I didn’t want to do that in front of the other kids. I was very adamant about waiting til it was just them outside 

My SO was outside just now and came in and said “hurry up and bring that stuff outside! The girls are out here. I told them you have something for them!” So I got the stuff and walked outside. 

And the entire group of kids is standing there. 

I can’t not give the girls their stuff now because my SO already told them I had it, plus it’s literally in my hands and they see it. They both come running up and are super excited and thankful, and start showing it off immediately.

The 12 year old girl and the boy didn’t care much because the things I had were obviously for little girls, and it’s not like I went out & bought it for them, but the other little girl was so. damn. sad. She even said “do you have anything for me?” in this sad little voice. Like I hated myself in that moment. And I was really annoyed with my SO because she put me in the exact situation I said I wanted to avoid. 

What pushed me over the edge though, was that she didn’t react at all about the left out little girl. She just gushed over the sisters and kept saying how we just knew they would be perfect to give these gifts to. 

I just turned on my heels and went into the house and looked for anything I could give this little girl, and SO walks in all happy, still gushing about them, didn’t even notice how she made the other kids feel, and I just snapped. 

I yelled “what is wrong with you? I just crushed that little girl because of you! I specifically told you I didn’t want to do that, and the fact that you not only put me in that exact situation, but that you genuinely don’t give two shits about what we just did....I can’t even look at you right now.”

She got really upset and said I was treating her like she had just killed someone. She said I was overreacting and that the other kids don’t even care as much as I seem to 

I just walked away. Maybe I’m wrong and being childish but I really don’t think I am. Am I overreacting?",52,146,0.95

Parental dispute help here...... 

Caveat, I would NEVER leave my children in an unsafe environment EVER! But my wife insists that this situation is unsafe. I'll let reddit decide if I am an indeed an a**hole. 

On occasion, I will leave my 3 and 5 year old strapped in their car seats while I go inside to pay for gas and get snacks/coffee. I do ask my kids every time if they want to come in with me and they sometimes do, but most of the time they'd rather stay in the van to draw, color, or read. I'm fine with that choice. As most parents would tell you, getting into and out of car seats can be a hassle. 

When at our gas station, I always make sure....
-the kids are warned to stay strapped in their seats (they've never not heeded this warning).
-the van is off, and I have the keys
-the doors get locked 
-I'm at the nearest possible pump under the shaded awning
-I can see the van the whole time from the windows of the station.
-I'm inside 5 min. or less 
-the kids end up with a snack, too :). 

So is this a reasonable parenting practice or, as my wife sarcastically insists, CPS is going to start an investigation into my daddy decisions, and some bystander is going to call me an asshole for leaving my kids in the car. 

Am I an asshole?

Clarification: Several have asked...... I'm in Michigan, and I've never gotten back into the car after my 5 min. inside and the temperature had changed by more than a couple degrees inside the van (hot or cold). Also, if I see a huge line inside, I don't wait. 5 min. is the max I am away from the van.",206,141,0.9

It's very innocuous but she only uses it in situations that cause me extreme anxiety and dread. We'll be messaging and she seems disinterested and gives one word generic replies. I ask her if she's OK and she'll say something like ""Yeah I'm OK, I just have a lot on my mind."" And then a few minutes later she'll blow up at me about something she was bottling up. This often happens at very inappropriate times like when I'm at work. We were once on a date and made a quick stop on a date for a quick snack and bathroom break and she started hardly talking after it. I asked her what's up or of it's something I said then. She said ""I just have a lot on my mind"" and then blew up about 5 minutes later. I had to pull over on a random street and spent an hour talking through her raging and tears. She was upset I hadn't on the date yet talked about things she raged about earlier while I was driving in a thunderstorm. Once after a pleasant weekend she responded weekly to my messages, I asked her on my break what was up, she ""just had a lot on her mind"", gave some vague statements about how she thought about the relationship and wasn't happy and before my 15 minute break was up told me she was breaking up with vague reasons given. This upset me so much I left work early that day.

A few days later she messaged me and talked about it, she tried to make up, and told me what triggered that was a comment she read on a Facebook group about relationships. It reminded her of me and caused her so distress she felt the relationship was doomed. We discussed it and I asked her to not to use that phrase anymore.

About an hour into the film, his roommate [~27F] came home and noticed that apparently we'd left the oven on.  I was the one who got the pizza out of the oven.

548,Not the A-hole,"My husband is the oldest of four siblings, and three of the four are atheists. All are adults. My husband and I are both 32 years old and have our own home and a toddler.

He became an atheist at about age 16, and when we met at age 18, his church attendance was spotty. I wound up dragging him out of bed on Sunday mornings and meeting him at home to drive to church together; not because I was religious (I was sort of ambiguous and still believed in souls and karma and whatnot), but because I wanted one more excuse to spend time with him, as well as trying evangelical church out in case I was simply bored of Catholic church.

Fast forward a couple years later, my husband and I spent a lot of time talking about religion, morality, faith, the paranormal, etc. He convinced me that there's nothing wrong with calling oneself an atheist, but still chose to keep it a secret from his evangelical parents, whom my husband swore would disown him.

I guess word got out that I was an atheist (but not my husband...probably because I was slightly less careful than he'd grown up to be). His mother has spent the last 10 years or so being passive aggressive to me, praising my husband for ""bringing me to church"" - which was actually my idea, telling me the day after we were engaged that I was ""very lucky to have such a godly husband."" 

She's apparently still under the impression that I came into her son's life and turned him into an atheist, when it's actually the reverse that's more true.

So we have a three year old daughter who's very receptive to people's emotions and I don't want her to pick up on the fact that I can't stand being around my very religious, anti-Muslim, xenophobic, homophobic, atheist-hating mother-in-law.

My husband - who is an independent adult - is still not comfortable with his parents knowing that he was an atheist first, although they've been told this but don't believe it.

550,Not the A-hole,"I work for a large international corporation and earn a very good salary. My company does a lot of good work and has a couple of funds they run. A few years back they announced that they have a plan to increase cashflow into these funds: For every employee, they'll round down the salary every month to the exact value. I.e, if you earn 12345.67, they'll make it an even 12345 and donate 0.67 to charity. I.e., the worst cast it'll affect each individual employee is 11.88 per year, if we assume a uniform distribution it's an average of 5.94 per year. For the charity it means about 2 million every year extra.

The policy was introduced as opt-out: By default, they'd round down. Only if you specifically requested it would they cease to keep that extra money. Of course you'd have to talk with HR for this, be seen as a penny pincher and generally a dickwagon. People don't uniformly agree with that policy but are typically afraid to talk to HR for fear or seeming petty.

What pisses me off is the opt-out policy. They can do this as opt-in all they want, but if they're simply taking a bunch of the money until people complain, that just doesn't sit well with me. Similarly, in our company's internal social network, there was backlash and some people complaining about it publicly.

I've recently had a discussion about these threads with a colleague of mine. As soon as I said that I can kind of understand the people who complain, she completely lost it and called me an asshole, telling me I earn a shitton of money and am being so petty. To be clear, I did NOT opt out, I did NOT comment on any of these social media threads -- to be honest, it's not the money at all for me and the cost of being seen as petty by HR is far greater. But I still disagree with the default policy and made the comparison: what if they decided to round down to multiples of 10, 100, 1000? Then it surely would not be okay anymore, obviously -- right?

554,Not the A-hole,"My wife (33F) and I (33m) were at a family dinner at my parents house with my Brother (30m) his wife (29f) and their new baby, the little guy is about 11 weeks old. My mom and her family have always been one to compliment people on their looks and weight, so when my SIL came over with the baby, my mom and Aunt were gushing about how great she looked. She is a fairly active person  and does stay in shape, which is good for her, however, she embarrasses easily and is quite uncomfortable when people talk about her body, she just made a comment on breastfeeding alot and taking walks with the baby.

My wife was sitting next to me, rolls her eyes and starts muttering to me that ""I'm sure throwing up your whole pregnancy didn't help either"" I gave her a look but didn't comment, she made snide remarks about my SIL the whole night.

On the car ride home, my wife is going on and on about my SIL, how smug she must be to be looking like she does so soon after having a baby, and how full of her self to be putting her appearance before being a mother, and then brought up the vomiting again. 

Now I've known my wife since we were in Junior High, and she's always made comments about other girls like this, always. She's a bit on the bigger side and seems to have a resentment towards thinner women. Anyway, I pointed out that my SIL wasn't making herself sick, but had a condition while pregnant that caused her to be like that (can't think of the name of it). My wife laughed and said she was sure that's what she wanted us to think, and that my SIL has always been about her looks, and that she was surprised the baby wasn't scrawny, considering she can't possibly eat enough to be feeding him.

I got really annoyed and said it was my mom and Aunt that always made comments, not my SIL, and told my wife she didn't have to be so snide. 

My wife went off at me for defending my SIL, and starting asking/ accusing me of finding her attractive. I was so blown away by her melt down that I told her I didn't want to talk to her for the rest of the ride home, she took this as me saying I do find my SIL attractive, I told her no, that I just don't want to deal with her insecurities right now. 

Well, my wife started crying, calling me cruel and  that I don't have to point out the fact that's she's insecure. Still annoyed by her accusations, I told her she doesn't have to tear people down to make herself feel better.

When we got home she went straight to bed and I get a lovely explosion of texts from her friends telling me how much of an ass I am.  I know her feelings are hurt but I don't think she has to make comments about others who have done nothing to slight her other then looking the way they do.

Edit: I love my wife very much and my attraction to her has never changed,  but, like I said, she has always been like this ever since we were kids. I have made comments however in the past about the way she talks about other people and if she ever wanted to talk to someone about it. She would either  laugh at me and say she has said what needs to be said, or get annoyed.  Her mother and sister are actually the same way, but whenever I say anything, they get defensive and say it's just what girls do and that there is no harm to it.

Edit: so my wife came home from work and not gonna lie, I thought it would be worse due to the fact that she works with the women who were texting me, and that today would be a bitch fest about me.

We talked and the first thing she asked me was if I find her attractive, I said I always have, however, her attitude is beginning to wear me down and the only thing I want to apologize for is not having a clear conversation about it sooner, that I do stand by what I said, but that I would be there with her to work out why she feels the need to talk about other women so harshly. She got on the defense again, saying that wasn't an apology and that it constantly feels like my SIL is trying to show her up whenever they are together.  I pointed out that she was doing it again, and she said it was hard for her to believe I want to support her when I don't have her back. I told her me agreeing with her about her comments isn't supportive, and she needs to understand that what she says isn't okay, and that I will no longer tolerate toxic comments about my family. She started crying again saying that that's how she copes with  sometimes feeling unhappy with herself, that most of what she says has truth and that people like my SIL are vein. I recommend we talk to someone about this, she refused. I told her  to take the night to think about what she says, and how she would feel if these things were being said about her, to call me if she needed me, and headed to my mom's house. 

Edit: thank you all for the suggestions and support, it sucks to think about how my wife may feel about herself and how many others (myself included ) might have to deal with their insecurities, but I know that her way isn't healthy or going to fix anything, and I wish I had actually addressed it before it came to her bashing my SIL for being sick while pregnant. I'm also very sorry for all of you that went or are going through that sickness while pregnant, I only knew very little from my mom about what was happening with my SIL, and reading about it on here makes me feel even worse that someone I love could make such crude comments about it.",1149,9863,0.94

558,No A-holes here,"So, first, a bit of backstory:
My fiancée and I usually spend christmas with my  family because her family lives far away and we can't always afford the trip. My siblings live all across the world, but we make an effort to all meet for christmas with my grandmother in the countryside. 

We love my family, but things have been difficult since my mom passed 2 years ago. My dad requires a ton of emotional care of which my fiancée and I usually take charge of since we live in the same city. It's not easy but we don't mind doing it. Christmas however has become a depressing event, where everybody is just miserable and just tries to pamper my dad to a fault, since that just makes his mood worse. It's a pitty party where my brother and dad just spiral eachother into a hole and my sister tries to keep everyone happy and my grandma ends up doing all the work to keep busy.

This year, my future wife and I just want to get away from it all and spend christmas just the two of us. The problem is, my family has this irrational fear of the family ""falling apart"" since my mom was the glue holding us all together. I know that if we are honest and just say we want to spend this christmas by ourselves, we'll be labelled as selfish and they might even blame my fiancée (they've done before with my sister in law and my aunt).

The idea is to tell my family short notice that I am sick and can't go because I don't want to get my Grandma (89) sick.

So, WIBTA if I told my family a lie to skip christmas?

TL;DR: I'm thinking of lying to my family to avoid having to spend another depressing christmas with them.

EDIT:
Thank you everyone for your comments. I realize now that lying is the wrong way of doing it. I'm thinking FW and I will book a getaway for after the 25th so that we can spend the most important times still with my family while still bailing early.",48,77,0.93

When I tried to go talk to her she told me to fuck off. I try to be chill and understanding but I felt like she had to be punished in some way. I talked to my husband and we decided her being on Netflix restriction for 2 weeks could be a valid punishment. 

When she came down for dinner, I told her she was on Netflix restriction and we changed the password.

She told me I couldn’t punish her because I wasn’t her mother.

AITA for punishing her



Just some details so there’s no questions in the comments.

They are both in therapy, as am I.

My husband and I have enough room for both of them after converting his game room and my office into bedrooms

We can financially support them with little too no issue. 

I know I am not her mother but I am her guardian and caretaker.

Any other questions I’ll be happy to add answers too. Those are just basics I can think of.",56,68,0.93
561,Asshole,"Hey guys, so I'm going to give both sides because we both usually use this and want to get the full story told so we know who is really in the wrong here.


I just recently found out my grandpa is dying. I haven't seen him in 17 years. I've always wanted to visit, but never could, and now that he's dying I want to see him one last time. When I heard the news, I didn't even think about it, I just bought the plane ticket. He's in Maine, we're in Texas. I'm going for two weeks.


When I told my wife, she was pissed. She said she couldn't believe I didn't at least discuss it with her first, rather than just telling her I'm leaving. But that was because it was a split second decision, plus we have a 5 month old that we can't exactly bring with us and she just started a new job, so she can't really just leave for two weeks.


She suggested we wait and go together later on, and just go for a couple days, but we still would have to find something to do with the baby, and she'd have to find time off work, and we'd have to afford a 2nd plane ticket, and I really wanted to stay at least 2 weeks to spend time with family and have time to myself to recover from the plane trip before I meet up with them. Shes now demanding I cancel it until its discussed further, I think that's totally unreasonable considering I already bought it and I don't exactly know how long he's going to live. It might be too late if we wait. AITA?

Wife's side


So, my husband has been talking about visiting his family for the past 6 years. I've always encouraged him to, way before the baby. He always used the fact that he hates planes as an excuse, as well as not being sure how to face his family after going so long without seeing them. He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let us ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.


Now, years later, when we have a baby and I just started working again after a complicated pregnancy and even more complicated emergency c section recovery, he drops on me, hey, I'm leaving the 25th to go see my family for 2 weeks in Maine. I'm sorry but WTF?? Where was the discussion for this huge decision? I have to find last minute childcare (my only close relatives are my elderly grandparents so they can't help), rides to work (legally blind, can't drive even with glasses), and balance work and baby with no support for two weeks. I did freak out when he told me, and told him he needs to cancel the trip right away until we properly discuss it and figure something out, but that something will most definitely not include leaving for two damn weeks, but rather maybe 3 days with us BOTH. Please be honest reddit, AITA for not wanting him to leave last minute for 2 weeks, or is he for planning this with zero discussion?",83,45,0.82
562,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday I called in a sushi order to a local rotating sushi bar. 15 minutes after placing my order, I went to the register and was given my total, about $11. The cashier was talkative and seemed to be in a good mood. I handed her my card and she ran it through the machine, it’s one of those touch screen registers and she flipped the screen over for me to sign and choose a tip amount. I’d never heard of tipping a called in order before. I thought tips were meant for servers who waited on your table, took your order, refilled drinks and stuff like that. So without giving it too much thought, I tapped “no tip” and confirmed the order. After I turned the screen around to her side, her good mood all but disappeared. It wasn’t subtle, either, her voice (the few times she did decide to speak now) was flat and unamused. A complete 180 from her mood 10 seconds prior. Should I have tipped the to go order?

565,Not the A-hole,"My job requires me to travel to many different office buildings in the Tristate area. Because I tend to travel frequently, I use and rely on, the public men's rooms in these office buildings. There is a specific building that I visit probably 3 to 6 times per month. (In this case, I am doing work for the building itself, and not any particular company, in any of the suites, inside the building.) For whatever reason, the public men's rooms in the hallways/common areas of this building are all locked, on every floor. This forces you to go into one of the suites and request a key from the front desk employees of the particular company leasing that space. The women's rooms are NEVER locked, on any floor, in any area. (And yes, this bothered me enough that I have checked every restroom, muliple times.) I complained to the building manager earlier this year about this situation, to which I received the reply that she, ""didn't realize this was happening, and it would be addressed."" I returned later that week, and found the men's rooms still locked, but not the women's rooms. I then spoke with her on a separate occasion about this, to which she said she, ""forgot, but will address it today."" Since then, I have been back to the building 9 times, all of which I found the doors still locked. (About 3 months have passed since the inital conversation.) I tried calling the building manager on 3 separate occasions, with no response. (I suspect she is avoiding me.) Because of this, I met with an attorney last week, and he sent a formal letter to the building manager that if this situation is not remedied, we have no choice but to pursue legal action on the basis of discrimination. AITA?

UPDATE: I just heard from my attorney this evening. He has recently spoken with the building manager. She claimed that ""it is their policy to lock ALL bathrooms, not found in suites, as a matter of public safety during business hours."" ?????????? When questioned on why it has been consistently found that this is not the case, and ONLY the men's rooms were being locked, she gave ambiguous, nonsensical answers. She asked that I not visit the property any longer, even though I have contracted work to complete onsite. My attorney will be reaching out to the owners of the building, as there are multiple things wrong here. This is an odd situation. I'm going to assume for the time being that she is simply out-of-touch with the daily happenings in the building she manages, or is misinformed about their own policies.",187,226,0.92

567,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I used to go to a fall cookout at her uncle's house every year. Hayrides, pumpkin carving, and stuff like that. He and his wife had some pretty serious health battles and they haven't had it for the last 5 years. They are planning on having it this year.

My daughter has been in a local preschool this fall and has met her cousin (my wife's uncle's grandkid) and they are apparently good friends. My wife and MIL learned about this and hyped her up to go to this cookout thing at her friend's grandparents' house. When I heard about this I put my foot down and said no. Everyone is very upset with me now, including my 4 year old who I can't really give a satisfactory explanation to.

The problem is these people are racists. The actual eating takes place in a machine shed (big metal barnlike garage building for you nonrural people) that has a 10 foot Confederate flag on the wall. They are considerate enough to say ""black fella"" instead of hard r n-words when I'm around, but frankly lynching jokes don't need the n-word to be racist and that's the type of environment I'm talking about here.

I am biracial but look white with a dark tan. My daughter is 4 and looks like a little white girl with a medium tan. I grew up around here and have a thick skin as an adult when it comes to this sort of thing, but I'm not letting my kid be exposed to this until she's old enough for me to explain it to her first. It took me a lot of therapy to get over the internalized racism and self loathing I picked up by growing up here and I want to help her navigate this issue well in her life.

My wife and her family have an obsessive love for tradition and family get-togethers and this is really driving a wedge right now. My wife asked me if I was trying to tell my daughter she couldn't be friends with her cousin, and I told her that if I ever hear that little girl say anything racist I will 100% tell my daughter she can't be friends with her. This flies in the face of my wife's most cherished values, but I have had a lot of close friends in my life that were racists and it was legitimately harmful to my mental well-being.

The consensus right now is that I'm using my daughter as some kind of hostage or pawn, since my daughter really wants to go and doesn't understand why she can't. I don't feel like I'm making this about me, (I went to the damn thing every fall for years when it was just me and my wife.) but I'm hoping for some of that /r/AmItheAsshole perspective.

Edit: A few people are responding or messaging me some pretty harsh stuff about my wife. I have done a really terrible job of preparing her for this. I always try not to let stuff get to me and to not complain about things I can't control about other people and I'm sure to her this has come out of nowhere. She spent a lot of time with her cousins when she was growing up and that was a positive thing for her. (The mom of the little girl my daughter is friends with, and her siblings.) One of the main parts of this is she feels like I'm taking something from our daughter that my wife had and loved, but I feel like I'm keeping something from her that hurt me a lot in my life until she's old enough to defend herself against it. The race issue is something my wife and I will have to communicate about a lot as our daughter grows up, but this post is about whether or not I'm solving this instance of the problem with an asshole solution or not.",89,402,0.94

Upon hearing that I would be going to spend time with my family because of it being a family members birthday my fiance got very upset and said she felt her family is coming in second place. Granted we do not go to her family a lot given the fact that they live about an hour away, but that is mostly because she doesn't have the best relationship with them.

570,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I recently got out of debt. I paid off both of our credit cards that were well over $3k to ensure we could finally start establishing positive credit scores and eventually save enough for a home. I usually do all of the budgeting and resource allocations for home and keeping her in tune with whats realistic can sometimes be a struggle but we work through it.

Recently she found a new job. She doesn't make a whole lot, im the bread winner, but she needed new clothes. One day she came home with 2 bags of new clothes from a store. I asked how she paid for it and to my surprise it was on one of the credit cards I paid off for her. I didn't get upset because she said she would pay them off. Fine. Not a big deal. But I also said I wasn't going to pay for it this time.

3 months have passed and I have tried to stay strong not asking her about it. But...shes often very forgetful. So 2 weeks ago I asked if she has paid it since she just gotten her new paycheck. She said no and checked. Now the payments were twice the amount of the minimum. Well of course they are....you forgot to pay it last month and refuse to account for the missed payment. She got upset when I reminded her about me not paying it but I also can't let it keep slipping past her due to her lack of caring.

571,Asshole,"My girlfriend's new roommate is her friend from college, and they're very close to each other. We're all 24 years old. Sometimes, when I go over to my gf's house, her roommate is dressed in very little clothing, sometimes she's wearing just underwear or she's in a sports bra and shorts. The most she wears is a tank top which is very thin, nothing beyond that. This is not just when the roommate is in her own room, it's also the case when she's in the kitchen, or the living room, or if we're all doing some common activity together.

I told my girlfriend that I found this very inappropriate and that it made things very awkward for me. My gf got very upset with me and told me that it's her house, and that she gets to dress however she wants, as long as she's comfortable. I understand that, but don't people change when they're expecting company or when there are guests in the house? For example, whenever my roommate has friends, family or his girlfriend over, I make sure that I'm dressed appropriately, if I come out of my room to meet them. I would never do that in just my boxers or briefs or while just wearing undergarments like a vest.

My girlfriend didn't agree with any of this and is still pissed off with me. AITA here?

Update/Edit: Wow, this post blew up. I understand that the unanimous judgement here is that I am the asshole. I'm going to apologize to my girlfriend. Seeing how close she is with her roommate, she probably told her about this, so I'm going to apologize to her roommate too.

I realize that I am over at their place all the time, and it's absurd for me to expect her to cover up and not be comfortable all the time. I also realize that the reason she dresses so casually around, is because she's so comfortable around me and considers me a good friend, she apparently doesn't do this in front of most other guests, idk why I had to make things awkward and weird and fuck everything up. 

There are also a lot of misconceptions and incorrect assumptions here. I didn't have a problem with the sports bra or the tank top or the shorts, I mostly had a problem when she was just chilling in her house in just her underwear (read very very revealing bra and panties). I also didn't tell my gf to make her roommate change or put on more clothes, I did not issue any ultimatums, I merely expressed that I was uncomfortable with her roommate's attire. I understand I have to work through my issues and change my mindset regarding such things, I was not raised this way (my mom would not even let my sister wear shorts at home), I'm already in the process of changing.

572,Not the A-hole,"So I had a call from my half sister (we first met around 2 years ago, I'm now 26) after not seeing her for around 6 months because I've been abroad for the majority of the time. She told me our dad has been in hospital due to his alcoholism and wasn't doing great (not eating, swollen legs ect).


 I'm not surprised a few days later (today, 10 mins ago) to get a call from her in tears telling me she's been told by med staff that he's unlikely to pull through (liver and other organs shutting down) and would die in the next few days. I asked her whether there was any hope he could pull through but she told me none whatsoever. 

The thought that he may die soon crossed my mind when I was first notified of his hospilization.

Now to clarify I haven't seen my father since I was 6 weeks old and of course don't remember him. He's never attempted to get in contact via my mother in my life. 

Anyway a few mins into the call with my h-sis she's begging me to see him before he goes and saying things like ""you'll regret not coming to see him""~ and was even more upset about me instantly stating I wouldn't be seeing him and not wanting to go into why. 

I've had a few severe episodes of psychosis the last 4 years and have been struggling with depression and psychotic symptoms since my first episode. It's taken me 12 months since my last episode to return to any kind of normality and that's part of the reason I don't want to jeopardize the progress I've made for the sake of seeing someone I don't even know before they die.

574,Not the A-hole,"Last year I moved into an apartment with 3 other roommates. At first we all got along great, but I made the mistake of briefly dating one of the guys. He turned into a huge jerk after we broke up. He would just leave out gross messes, never clean, kicked my roommates cat once, and we have reason to believe he started messing with our toothbrushes. He also was just rude to us and once called us all losers that wouldn’t go anywhere in life because we didn’t come from money like him. I happen to know from when we were friendly that he did come from a very wealthy family, and they paid for everything: rent, utilities, his food, car, school, etc.

Well obviously this situation sucked with pretty much 3 against 1, so he eventually told us he was moving out. We wanted him out too so agreed to get a rent increase til we found a replacement so he could break lease. Prior to this we also always split the heat/utility bill evenly. It was in his name so we agreed to switch it over to one of our names.

Afterwards, he started leaving all the windows and even the doors open while it was freezing cold. He cranked his space heater, would leave the oven running all day, or put all the lights on while we were sleeping. We caught on pretty quick that he was trying to jack the bill up for us even though he knew we “weren’t from money” like him and usually struggled to pay it in the winter. Well, I assume he failed to realize that the billing cycle wouldn’t change to our name until the following month. So we pretended not to notice and let him continue being petty for 3 weeks straight.

By the time the bill came he had already moved out and utilities were then switched to our name. And it was enormously expensive. We didn’t mention it to him and based on letters that came to the house we think it finally went to collections recently. Which is when he found out and started blowing us up to pay our portion. Thing is, we never actually had a written agreement about splitting it, it was just something we all did. So he’s on the hook and legally, we’re not.

I don’t think this is going to effect him in any major way except that he’ll have to fess up to mommy and daddy who seem to have plenty of wealth to spare based on his own description. So I told him to stop harassing me or I’ll call his parents myself and add in all the other stories about how horrible he is.

One of our mutual friends thinks even though he was petty, we still should pay some towards it as we did continue using the home and utilities. But I feel he effectively stole from us by letting all the heat out on a daily basis, and he’s the one who decided he couldn’t be amicable.",19,74,0.92

576,Not the A-hole,"Background:

I get it, ""loving-but-transphobic"" looks like an oxymoron, but any trans person who has been through this knows what I'm talking about. My parents support me in pretty much every way--they paid my way through college and help me financially in graduate school, they've pushed me to do my best in my field, they always have a place for me at home, they check in on me every week, and help me navigate tough situations. They're pretty damn great...for the most part.

The problem is, the fact that I'm trans is a sticking point. It is the one thing that has *ever* caused a conflict in this family. I've been out to them for over a year and it's been rough. I've spent that year being deadnamed and misgendered with no attempts to correct themselves or even apologize. Mom admitted to wanting to steal and throw out my chest binders. And it all culminated with my father desperately trying to convince me not to start hormone therapy, him even trotting out talking points such as it ""destroying my body"" and ""being the easy way out."" I've tried to reach out to them with books, essays, in-depth and even demeaning discussions of my dysphoria, \*everything--\*but progress is minimal and barely worth the stress it causes.

Situation:

I'm 21, and navigating gender transition on my own is what taught me to be independent--navigating the legal system for my name change, confronting transphobic doctors and professors, building my own support network, etc.--and this is culminating with a road trip (this weekend!!) to a clinic where I will FINALLY get hormones and pay for them out of pocket. I have been planning this trip since August and I have not told my parents about it. I know they will find out eventually, and I will have to deal with the fallout when they do--including being ready to be seen as the asshole. But it all comes down to refusing to let their transphobia lessen a moment I have been waiting years for. Besides, I'm an adult--I can do whatever the fuck I want, right?

However, while discussing my road trip with an acquaintance, she said she would be heartbroken if one of her children suddenly started hormone therapy without telling her. She loves her children, and I know for a fact my parents still love me, even if they don't quote-unquote *support* or *accept* me. After discussing this for a while, I started to wonder if I had made the wrong choice in not telling them. I hadn't even considered their side of the situation, or even if I should consider their side at all. Would I be damaging their trust in me? Is this *wrong* of me? Her comment started to eat at me, and now I can't stop thinking about it.

Basically my friend, who we'll call Roy, has a paper due tomorrow morning. For the last few days he hasn't been able to use his laptop as the power cord got damaged and can't charge it, so he hasn't been able to do the paper yet. I didn't know when the paper was due until today when this whole situation happened, but I had known that he couldn't buy a new power cord yet because he was waiting for his mom to pay him back some money she owed him. All well and good, I assumed he'd go to the library or something to get it done. I was wrong.

This morning Roy texts me and asks me for a favour--get him a new power cord and he'll pay me back. I don't mind doing it. He's the closest thing to a best friend I have, and I know he'd do the same for me if I was in his shoes. So I agree, and say I can get it tomorrow after work. That's when he tells me the paper's due **tomorrow morning** and that he needs the power cord today. Unfortunately I have class right after work today, so it'd be near-impossible for me to do that without either leaving work early or going to class late--both of which I can't do. So I ask if he can do the paper on Google Docs on his phone, but he says it's more complicated than that. I say okay and apologize for not being able to help out. He replies a little while later saying he got through with someone else, then immediately adds ""No shade, but i'd skip class to help out js. But no shade at all."" I don't know what to say so I just send a blank-face emoji (like this .\_.) and he tells me that ""that's so fucked up but I just thought we were closer than that.""

579,Asshole,"Saturday was my daughter’s 9th birthday party. Although I don’t let her wear makeup to school yet she loves watching beauty videos on YouTube. I found a group that do skincare, manicures, hair and makeup for birthday parties and thought that would be a fun thing that my daughter could enjoy with her friends. They would get all done up, learn beauty skills, have dinner and then sleep over and even have beauty supplies to bring home. It was a little expensive but I thought it was worth it. 

12 girls were at the party. They had fun doing the skin care portion but when it came to makeup I realized that the foundation ranges that the team provided weren’t enough. We live in an area that is predominantly white but one of my daughter’s close friend’s “Sara” is from an immigrant family from Nigeria and has very nice dark skin. They did have some range (one of my daughter’s other friends is Indian and they had her skin tone) but they just did not have Sara’s skin tone. The darkest skin tone they had was much lighter than her skin tone. I could tell this bothered Sara. Then when it came to hair obviously Sara’s hair is very different from the other girls and they basically couldn’t do anything with her hair so Sara was also excluded from that. Again I could tell Sara was upset and I was very apologetic but she seemed to make the best of it.  Sara wasn’t allowed to sleep over so her mom picked up her up late that night. I made sure to give her extra nail polish and candy in her gift bag. 

  The very next day Sara’s mom calls and practically yells at me about how upset her daughter was and how it was ridiculous to throw a party that excluded black guests. She went as far as to act like I purposefully or maliciously excluded her daughter when it was just an oversight. I apologized again to her but she didn’t seem to want to accept it. I told her it seemed like she was over reacting a little bit and it was a birthday party to celebrate my daughter at the end of the day and Sara still had her makeup and nails done. This made her angrier and she said her daughter wasn’t permitted to come to our house again. 


I vented about this to my husband but he kinda took Sara’s mom side saying I should have made sure that it was something everybody could do. My mom thinks Sara's mom overreacted though. I know I should have done more vetting but it was honestly just an oversight on my part. I don’t think I deserved to be yelled at or to have implied racism put on me.

588,Not the A-hole,"Let's put things in context first. Me (24F) and my gf (23F) have been together for almost 4 years now. We started dating when I was abroad for my studies and had a long distance relationship for almost three years. Last year, after I completed my master, I went to live with her parents and found a job in her country. 

Now, my mum has had some trouble in the past with me being homosexual. She's gotten over it, but I know she'd still prefer me to get with a guy. Since I met my partner, she complained about her ""not doing anything with her life"". In the beginning of our relationship, she was home-ridden and relying on social aid because of mental health issues. 

The thing is, my mum and mental illness... Well, it does not sit well. I have been overlooked as a depressive and anxious teen/young adult under her care for 10+ years before I got diagnosed here with severe PTSD - which she does not know.

My partner has now made good plans for the future and was able to start studying, which we all found awesome. However, she's currently having a relapse. When my mum asks me about it, I always tell her she's at school and everything's doing fine. I feel really bad for lying to her, but I do not want her to critise my relationship yet again. 

I know I shouldn't lie to my mum. She means good and wants what's best for me, but she caused a lot of tension in my relationship in the past. So Reddit, am I the asshole for lying to her?",19,26,0.81
589,Not the A-hole,"A little bit of backstory- I got into a relationship with an old friend from school, there was always a romantic interest on my side with her occasionally seeming interested but mostly just deflecting any advances.

We’d both just got out of a relationship and ended up giving it a go for a few months before we split, a few weeks later we found out she was expecting and continued with the pregnancy with the view of taking it on as starting a family as friends.

Things turned sour pretty quickly with me having to fight to see my daughter pretty much constantly in the weeks after her birth but after a few months things settled into a routine and I began to have her on my own.

We had discussed taking her swimming together as neither of us wanted to miss her first time. My ex and I had an argument regarding something a mutual friend had said about her parenting skills and we stopped talking for a week...during which I learnt my ex had taken our daughter swimming with her sister instead of together as arranged.

My next scheduled day to have my daughter cane round and my sister had suggested we take my daughter and my niece swimming as she had all the stuff ready to go anyway,
Obviously I jumped at the idea and had a lovely day out with my daughter that she seemed to really enjoy.
I dropped my daughter back that evening and my ex refused to talk to me so I didn’t mention having took her swimming.

A week passed and while I was next dropping my daughter off I had emptied some clothes out of my changing bag to give back to my ex, she noticed swimming nappies and kicked off that I’d taken her swimming without her permission and that it was “a mother job to take her child swimming” and that “it was a safety concern” to have not told her I’d taken her?

590,Asshole,"Yesterday I cooked curry pasta and my girlfriend liked it. There was some pasta remaining after dinner.

Today, she was coming out of work at 2PM, tired and hungry (she's a nurse), while I had a day off. She sent me a message asking me to leave her some pasta for lunch. I didn't say anything.

Since there was not so much remaining, I ate it all and cooked some curry pasta again.

At this point I thought about making a joke. I hid the newly cooked pasta and faked the pan to be dirty (I used some plastic film with some curry and coco milk, and put it in the pan). When she came home she asked for food. I told her I ate all the pasta. Five seconds later she started crying. I immediately told her it was a joke and showed her the dish, but she was still mad as hell.

591,Not the A-hole,"Hi, y’all.

My brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on Sunday. I (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while I was a guest, I wasn’t in the bridal party. 

They got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. The dress code on the invitation was “formal.” For the three weddings I’ve been to with formal dress codes (and the eight I’ve been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. That is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. A few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my SIL could hire locally. 

Well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. When her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn’t used a professional either, nor had she. 

It was kind of awkward in pictures, but I didn’t really see a big deal.

Well, yesterday, I got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to “upstage her” and that sort of thing. Quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (FYI, my brother thought I looked pretty and didn’t see an issue except “when did you become a woman?”)

I’ve tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they’re having none of it. Was I really a bitch?

593,Not the A-hole,"Nearly a year ago my brother (21M, still living at home) asked what I (27M, living on my own) thought about going to a big city about 2 hours away. He wanted to get a book signed by an author that was doing a public appearance there. Apparently his girlfriend, which lives much farther away, loves this author. I told him ""sure"" and we planned to make a day of it. Before or after the book signing we could just eat and hang out in the city.

Well over the past year, our relationship has went down the drain. He's became distant to me and all of his family/friends. Basically he's just become obsessed with his long distance girlfriend and for lack of a better word, ""hates"" everyone else. We've tried doing an intervention to express how his behavior hurts us and how we care about him. His girlfriend hated that several of us tried to come to him with our feelings and told us that he's fine. We invite him to movies, to hangout with us, etc and he always says ""no"". All he basically does is wait for his girlfriend to Skype or he says he's ""working on his future"" so that he can be with her. Obviously everyone thinks this is really unhealthy, but we can't do anything else.

I basically decided that if he doesn't want to treat me like a brother, I won't act like one. So when he randomly brought up the trip, I told him that I deserve a huge apology from him for how he's acted towards me and that I am feeling used by him asking me to still take him after everything that's went down. Our mutual older brother is out of our lives, but he's acting similar to how he did, which means he would only call when he needed something. He told me he'll just find another way to get there and said he only asked me because he thought I ""wanted to go"". The truth is that I didn't mind going to get his girlfriend that present, but the reason I would *want* to go is so I could have a good time with my brother. Now I have no interest in doing something for his girlfriend because she's wrapped my brother around her pinky and doesn't care that he gives the cold shoulder to everyone else. I also have no incentive to take him because it's not going to be a fun day for us. It will be me being his taxi.

594,No A-holes here,"I need some feedback about if I'm being unnecessarily petty and should just move on from this situation.

My apartment complex doesn't allow grills in our patio space, and for the past year of my residence, I have kept a charcoal grill on my patio. I fully accept that I am in violation of the lease by having a grill. Sometimes on the weekends, I grill steaks or burgers, and it's a great life.

Last week, I got a charcoal chimney and the fire was much bigger than usual. I'm guessing that's partially what led to the situation: our ""neighborhood watch lady"" (every neighborhood or apartment complex has this person, the person that doesn't have anything to do all day so he/she walks around and complains about anything out of the ordinary) saw the fire, snapped a picture, and complained about it to our apartment manager. I know it was this person because I'm friends with the apartment manager and spouse, and the spouse told me ahead of time.

Now, I'm fine with being called out for violating the lease because 1) it really was a fairly big fire and in the future I won't be using the charcoal chimney, and 2) I did violate the lease after all. However, I also know that this neighborhood watch lady walks her dog without a leash, and we have leash laws where I live. The thing is, her dog is old and is not a nuisance at all. But, if she is reporting violations of leases, she shouldn't be violating our lease either. He who has not sinned can throw the first stone, yada yada. So, WIBTA if I reported her lease violation even though it's definitely not a ""safety concern"" in comparison to my grill? Am I just being petty and should get over it?

Edit: I added this in a comment below, but I realized as people are commenting that it seems like many are focused on the fact that I have a grill (and I have accepted that I am an asshole for doing so - I have already passed judgment on myself regarding specifically the grill) instead of my question for feedback on if it makes me an asshole to further retaliate and complain to the leasing manager about the lady's leashless dog.

598,Asshole,"I (30F) recently moved into a house with my bf (30F) in a nearby city. We’ve been together a few years, and have talked very seriously about our future, he’s even talked in certain terms about getting married next year, but he was adamant about buying the house prior to anything marriage related. 

He was the one to buy the house (I am not on the deed, I pay him rent) as I don’t want to buy property with someone I’m not married to. We’d already lived together for a year and a half or so before moving into a house. 

I know he’s been gearing up to propose (my mom accidentally spilled the beans when he came to ask her permission... 😬) but I haven’t said anything to him, I know he’s trying to make it a surprise and he wants it to be special. 

Last night I was looking for something and he told me to check his office, specifically a couple sets of drawers. I went up to check and in plain sight in one drawer, was a ring box. I opened it but as soon as I realized what was going on I immediately shut it and felt terrible. 

I went back to him and he asked if I found what I was looking for and I said “hey, you should be careful telling me to look in those drawers, there might be something people aren’t supposed to find in there” and he gave me an odd look and then it clicks into place and he carefully asks “well how did you feel?” And I said “happy and excited of course!” And he starts smiling and is like “well you’re just gonna have to wait!” And laughs. 

I let it go after that, since I then felt bad for even mentioning it but since he’d sent me to that drawer specifically I wasn’t sure what to make of it. He claims he forgot it was in that drawer and I should just “forget about it”... but it’s tough. 

He knows how important this commitment is to me, and he’s continued to talk about our wedding next year as if it’s a given it will happen. I want to talk to my family and friends about it and share my excitement over our life together, but since he hasn’t officially asked I’ve been keeping my mouth shut. 

So here’s the WIBTA part... I’m really tired of waiting around. The convo with my mom happened almost a month ago. A couple months ago when the wedding topic came up, I kind of gently was like “hey, I’m excited too, but just know, I’m not making any plans or arrangements because you haven’t asked yet” and he said he understood and just to hold tight because it would be “soon, very soon”. 

And meanwhile I’ve made the commitment to move with him to this new city. While I’m happy and I don’t regret moving, it makes me anxious that he hasn’t made the move to take our relationship to the next level. 

WIBTA if I tell him I’m tired of waiting? I’m pretty sure I am TA, and I need to take a chill pill, but I’m so sick of waiting. I hate the idea of an ultimatum but I’m worried the end of the year will come and I’ll still be exactly where I am now.

*\*insert 'completed it' by Jay from Inbetweeners\**

Oh you earned £££? well I earned ££££ with commission. Oh you earned more this month? That's not right. SHE LITERALLY REJECTED THE IDEA THAT ONE MONTH I MADE MORE THAN HER AND BLAMED IT ON HER OUTGOING PAYMENTS.

She accused me of lying about my wages for the month because she earnt less. We both have office jobs, different positions/companies.

Also, note, I have Epilepsy and by chance her Father has epilepsy. I was telling her about a seizure I'd had a few weeks ago back and how I was just so tired but still made it to the gym, and somehow she was within seconds discussing the time she ""nearly had a seizure"" and got tested for it years ago despite no proof? and how embarrassing the whole experience was and how she was more prone to seizures than most. **I have E P I L E P S Y?** I've had a seizure during an exam? And she fails to acknowledge that too.

YES, she has mental health issues and I do not, I am distancing myself away from one of my closest friends as it first I didn't notice this behaviour but in a conversation I was telling my mom how much weight I'd lost and lifted at the gym and all of a sudden she piped up with her better weight loss and how she can lift more.

I talked about a shitty day at work on the way to the gym and surprise, she didn't acknowledge but instantly despite asking her earlier when she picked me up, somehow she forgot to mention how her day was far worse.

Am I the asshole for distancing myself and slowly pushing her away?

One of her old friends (23F) did the same thing to her before we started speaking, but I know that girl and she is also an asshole. Am I just an attention seeker? I feel bad because she does really well but when I have done something better than her she gives me the silent treatment or accuses me of lying!

But she does have mental health issues and I'm just being an asshole for not learning more about mental health, maybe it's a cry for help and acceptance for validation?

EDIT : I don't know how to not be her friend, she's not always like this there will be a week where it's fine and then it picks up.

601,Asshole,"Me and Mandy have been best friends since basically kindergarten, and almost since then she's been fascinated with Turkey, Croatia, and the Balkans/Mediterranean region in general. 

I started dating a guy from a Balkan country and was making plans to go visit him and his family, and while doing so I found this AMAZING package deal that lets you travel the Balkans, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Morocco. Seriously, it was like a once in a lifetime deal and though it's pretty expensive, it's WAY cheaper than it would be to find places to stay and travel to those places on your own.

I KNEW Mandy couldn't afford it, and I KNEW it would hurt her deeply that she wasn't getting a chance to go. This trip is literally what she dreams of doing, and with me in particular, but she's been in a lot of financial trouble lately. So I told her I was planning a trip, but not any of the details. I also told another very close friend about the trip, and she looked up the same deal and decided she wanted to go as well. I said I'd love to have the company, so she bought her tickets and she's coming along too. I realized that if Mandy heard about this or found out about this before I got a chance to tell her she'd be super hurt, so I told her about the trip. 

She was SOOOOOOO upset. She asked about why I didn't invite her, and I told her it was because I knew she couldn't afford it and I thought it would just be salt in the wound. (I also privately think she would have made some very questionable decisions in order to fund the trip, or would have gone and then not had enough for money, or her bills, or things like that at home.) That just made it worse, and she cried, and cried about how we always said we'd go and experience those places together, and that I don't even have any interest in the region, which is pretty much true since I want to travel around Asia. I told her we could still go that in the future, and we could even do this trip in the future, but she was too hurt to want to hear that.

My house is on my commute to work, and I have been working every week day this school year, so it not to big of a deal that I need to drive 16F home. Except this week. 

I get 1 hour early dismissal two days a week, one being on a Friday and 16F's mom has off on fridays, so it's not like I'm her only possible ride. There is also a bus that she can take to get home, but my dad will not hear any of it and he argues that I NEED to drive her. 

16F rarely even says thank you, and she gets mad when ever her seat gets a little wet (I drive a naked jeep wrangler, but I at least put the top on and cover the seats (still doorless/windowless) when it rains).

At work we have a ton of stuff to do and we are running out of time (the fest we are preparing for opens saturday). 

My brother gets early dismissal every day of the week so that he can go to work early, that being said he can't drive her. However, last year there were multiple times after he got his licence that he would refuse to drive me so I would have to take the bus, and it wasn't to big of a deal.

603,Asshole,"When my girlfriend and I put out advertisements for a roommate we specified that we keep a strict vegan house - no exceptions. This meant no meat in the house, no dairy, no eggs, not even honey. We were very clear on this and outright said another vegan would be ideal. And that actually worked out pretty smoothly! A girl we'll call Jessica moved in and things went along swimmingly for the past three years. Jessica was also an ethical vegan and there was no fuss over food, no drama, everything was peaceful and we all were pleased with the arrangement.

Enter Jessica's new boyfriend, Charlie. Charlie absolutely does NOT agree with veganism. Ever since an incident where he drunkenly tried to store a bunch of half eaten sausages in our fridge and I told him he wasn't keeping that shit in our house, he's had a big problem with me. Whenever he comes over he'll make snide little comments about our little vegan decontamination zone, and loudly talk about how much he loves meat and all the the meat he recently ate. To sum up how childish he is, he went as far as to ask if he was allowed to take a non-vegan shit in our toilet in front of a bunch my guests my girlfriend and I were hosting which was completely embarrassing for everyone. He's a complete dickhead, but that isn't what the main issue is.

I figured Jessica wouldn't put up with Charlie for long given how he behaves, but not only has that not happened, he's talked her out of veganism entirely. When Jessica let me know that she was no longer vegan, I told her as long as she didn't store it in the house, it was fine. Seeing her bring meat takeout into our house to eat was upsetting, I won't lie, especially given Charlie would often be grinning like a rat during the entire ordeal. Not to mention the smell.

Emboldened by Charlie, she's started to store non-vegan food in our fridge. First it was butter and some liquid egg whites, which my girlfriend begged me not to start something over given how tense things had gotten, but earlier today I came home and found multiple packets of bacon taking up nearly an entire shelf of the fridge. I gathered them up in a trash bag alongside the butter and other stuff that had built up and just tossed it all in the bin outside. When Jessica returned and saw it was all gone a shouting match broke out and now she's claiming I can't force her to keep a vegan fridge, and our agreement meant nothing at all. I told her perhaps it was better she find another house to rent at, and she called me a controlling dick.

I don't think I'm being controlling **GIVEN THIS AGREEMENT WAS CLEARLY SPECIFIED**. It wasn't a hidden clause, it wasn't something I sprung on her. In my opinion Jessica and Charlie are both behaving like absolute fucknuggets, but when I vented to my brother he said that I was actually being a dick in this situation.

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

609,Not the A-hole,"I recently had a second division win on the lottery and after taxes pocketed about $300k - a nice and very handy sum of money, but not the kind of money that will let you set you and your kids up for life. 

We have two kids who are twins in their late twenties and I'll give them the fake names of Lucas and Carolina. Lucas has a wife and two kids under 5 (being a little vague for privacy). Carolina is single and happy with that for now & doesn't want kids. 

My husband and I have decided that in addition to taking a holiday, getting a new car, and putting most of it into savings, we  would gift each of our kids $25k each. We also decided we would pay off Carolina's student loans (about $35k, which is not bad for a BA and a MA. She had a scholarship for her masters and only borrowed what she needed for a compulsory internship in an expensive city & the BA amount is pretty standard for where we are) and will pay for Carolina's ICL surgery for her vision (LASIK is not suitable) as she needs very strong glasses (-12) and it is not covered by any insurance or our country's health care system. The surgery is about $12k. Carolina has been saving for it herself, I told her to use the money and treat herself to a holiday.

Lucas says that I am being unfair and favouring Carolina & and that he should get the extra $47k Carolina is essentially getting, especially because ""I have kids and she doesn't and she has a better job anyway"". 

I don't think I am being unfair.

If Lucas went to University, I'd have settled his debt too or paid the same amount off each of their balances, depending on the amounts. But Lucas chose to drop out of school in 10th grade. Her better job is the result of her putting in more years of education. 

I'd also pay for Lucas to have eye surgery if he needed it. But he doesn't. Carolina has missed out on things because of her vision and that he has benefited in the years - she is not allowed to have a licence because of it and a few years ago when my husband and I bought a new car, we gave Lucas our old one which we could have traded in for about $6k & paid for driving lessons. Carolina didn't complain about it or demand money of her own.

I also think giving him $47k to ""play"" with is different to covering an educational debt and a health expense. It also punishes Carolina - she gets a necessary surgery and educational expenses while her brother gets extra free ""fun"" money. He asks ""what about my kids"". I actually am putting aside some money for their educations (I plan to give both $10k + whatever interest it gets towards educational costs if they go to Uni) but have not told him this, but ultimately, while I love my grandkids, they are his responsibility to provide for. 

Lucas continues to insist I am favouring Carolina and making comments that she is the preferred golden child. I personally think $25k is generous and it is not unreasonable to cover a specific educational and health expenses I would have also covered if he has the need.

610,Not enough info,"I hope you guys can help me because I don’t know what to do. 

*Possibly important info*: This is taking place in drama school, the age group of my class is between 18 and 23. We’re seven people in my class in total, the person in question is the only guy. He’s also the youngest. 

**Anyways**, we’ve been in the same class for about three weeks now, which I’m aware is a short amount of time. 

However, within that time C managed to be disliked by everyone. Nobody wants to work with him or hang out with him during breaks. 

The main reason for this is that C can be very condescending, arrogant and overall unpleasant. 

Here are some examples:

• J offered him some radish and his response was just “Do I LOOK like I want radish?” in an annoyed tone

• J told him that his hat looked nice, he just responded with a cold “I know”

• He never listens to anything or anyone, and expects people to repeat things for him (which is fine if it happens a few times, but it happens every time and is starting to feel deliberate)

• He does weird things for attention, like putting a pen under his hat and staring at people with a smug grin

• He’s never prepared for class and has been told off by professors, but he still feels like he performs the best (which is objectively just not true)

The list goes on and on. It’s getting noticeable that nobody likes him - which I think is a shame. Obviously he’s responsible for his own behavior, but at the same time it feels like he’s painfully oblivious to how he comes across.

614,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of backstory, I play piano at the markets in my town, and make a bit of money off it too, in order to pay for my piano lessons. There's this chick who I met a few years ago (I'll name her M), although never talked to because she was one of those typical kids who were 'too kool for everything' and just an overall dick. anyway, This year, she's randomly been talking to me a whole bunch, and I've been responding with my general enthusiasm to be polite, although I never really liked her. After a while, she started to become a sort of tolerable person, and I'd almost consider her a friend. (Friends in my eyes are much more than most people consider them to be, So naturally I don't have many) Anyway, one day, I was sitting in English, and a mate of mine was asking how much I make from busking piano. I told him, and then M randomly pipes up, and says ""Can you fundraise for me?"". I asked her what for, and she said ""Family members of mine from \*CountryName\* had to sell all of their belongings and are having to sleep on the ground with no food, water or anything and are dying! Can you fundraise one day for me? I can pay you! $100 here is like $100,000 in their country!""From this, My initial thought was: Firstly, I don't think that's how money works. It may be a larger value, but it's still proportionally the same money, secondly, I've never ever heard of the country she stated and thirdly, What do you mean you'll pay me? if you can pay me for it, then why not just send them money yourself? anyway, I tried my best to very politely skirt around it, Making perfectly valid reasons as to why I couldn't, but she kept going at it. I then again, politely dismissed it. She then said ""What's up with you always saying no to things?"" And I felt really bad after saying that, but kept to my point, and told her it's not happening. The next part caught me really off guard... She said -And I quote- ""Fine, Don't think about the dying person then!"" At this point I didn't know what to say... I just sorta sat there, Jaw dropped like those typical movie clichés.. I eventually turned away and dismissed myself from the conversation, as she said ""Wait I was joking""I can't help but feel really bad, but at the same time, I personally don't think she was telling the truth, and -given her history- thought she was just looking for money to use for a specific malicious intention, But thinking that makes me feel even worse! Am I the bad guy here?",50,140,0.92
615,Not the A-hole," This is lighter fare than a lot of what gets posted here, but I'm honestly still thrown for a loop and I'd love some third-party input.

My wife and I had a pretty middle-of-the-road wedding in terms of costs; it was definitely nice, but not a blowout or anything. My parents covered almost everything, as was their plan from the start. During the RSVP/invite window, my mom jokingly gave me shit for not putting up a registry yet-- we had honestly forgotten about it, because we weren't really in need of any gifts and didn't expect anyone to do so. She said people would probably feel awkward if they didn't get us *anything,* especially since she and my dad were covering every cost (including lodging), so my wife and I sat down to discuss it. We agreed we'd make an Amazon wishlist for some household stuff that we didn't have and kind of wanted, but that didn't end up amounting to much-- but what we *did* actually want was a little more wiggle room on our honeymoon. I want to be clear here: the trip was paid for already, from our own money, but it was that we had cut a lot of corners to fit it into our budget that gave us the idea for the fund. It made enough sense to us; instead of giving us things we don't need, if you feel compelled, you can donate a comparable dollar amount to this account that will be spent on padding out our dream trip as a couple.

We went through with it and added the option to our RSVP/general wedding info site. Again, to be clear here: there was *no* expectation of gifts in the first place, monetary or otherwise, which we even said on the site. Simply that if someone did feel the need to give us a gift, and nothing on the wishlist sounded good, this was another thing they could do.

The wedding came and went and it was genuinely beautiful, everyone had a wonderful time and I couldn't have asked for things to go any better. No one had said anything about the fund or the registry at all; a few things had been purchased from the wishlist and a few donations had been made (all of which we were deeply grateful for and were prepared to write the *shit* out of some thank you cards), but it wasn't a topic of conversation.

A few days later, though, we were shooting the shit with some extended family that had stayed on, and one of my aunts kind of blew up over the honeymoon fund. Ranting about how ""incredibly tacky"" it was and how embarrassed we should feel over even having it there, much less expecting anyone to donate. We were kind of blindsided already, and then a few cousins agreed that it was weird and kind of snobby of us, and that we should have just been ""normal"" and stuck to a physical registry even if we didn't need or want that stuff.

This isn't tearing our family apart and it's not that big a deal, but I'm really struggling to wrap my brain around it. Was I really the asshole for giving an option to pay into a fund to pad out our honeymoon, despite being fully clear that no one was required or even expected to donate?",92,142,0.94
616,Not the A-hole,I found out my cousin 19m was having an affair with my aunt 27 f last year. I walked in on her giving him a blowjob. It was mortifying and I decided not to say anything because I was just so scared of my aunts and cousins wrath but also I didn’t know what to do. Every time I say then together I could just feel and notice the flirting and sexual tension they had. Eventually I decided I needed to do something because cousin got a girlfriend and I saw them making out when they thought nobody else was watching. I’ll admit I did stalk them a bit when I saw them leave a party together. I took a couple pics and made a group chat with all the family on Facebook and i added his gf too. I showed them what’s been going on and how this is fucking disgusting immoral degenerate behavior. My family has disowned all of them and his gf broke up with him too. He had to leave his uni and job cuz of all the drama and shame he’s gotten. I did not spread it to anyone outside the family other than his gf so it’s probably his gf spreading it.,449,1492,0.86

We're similar in a lot of ways, but she is much more confident then I am, wears low cut and skimpy clothing a lot, and is very open about her love life. I've never had a problem with this, in fact I love her for her confidence. My parents really like her.


It's my birthday in a couple of weeks, and my family have invited several of my friends to a dinner. Most of my family would have no issue, but my grandparents are very religious people. One of the things that offends them is when too much skin is shown. I have been told off by them for the neckline of dresses I've worn, and they have been nowhere near as low cut as my friends dresses.


My parents spoke to me the other day and asked if I could ask my friend to wear something a little more conservative, to avoid any issues. I dislike having to do this, because I feel like my friend should be able to wear whatever she wants. I also don't want to make my grandparents uncomfortable or unhappy.

621,Asshole,"background: i go to a selective school (a school you have to pass a test to get into) and i used to go to the same public school as this friend

We were talking about exam results and I was pretty proud of mine. My friend is a bit up herself and she thinks she’s top shit - always has - and she attends the public school i used to go to. 

She was talking about how she did really well (she mostly did okay not too great but good by her standards) and I was kind of tired of hearing it even though i was happy for her. I said i did okay but since my tests are harder (because of the school i go to) i should be scaled up pretty well. I didn’t mean for it to come off as rude but she got this huge attitude about it. 

She started saying something along the lines of “yeah we know you go to that smart school” and then started saying how it was bullshit because she did really well without needing to attend one and called it a joke. 

This kind of pissed me off because i worked really hard to even get in and it’s highly stressful trying to compete with the top level students. So i said “honestly you didn’t even do that well. you wouldn’t last a day at my school. that’s not even an A”

She got super mad and called me a bitch and a nerd or whatever and i just replied “my point still stands” and we kind of just stopped talking and left.

624,Not the A-hole,"The other day, my dad's fiancé asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and wait with her at a nearby Starbucks until she came to take her home herself since I would be in the area right around the time her school was let out. I agreed to do so, and when we got to Starbucks, I bought her a snack and a hot chocolate and got myself some water. 

My dad's fiancé ended up stuck in traffic, so she was even later than she expected. Soon, it was ten minutes until closing time (6 PM) and she still hadn't arrived. At this point, one of the employees approached us and informed us that they would be closing in ten minutes. 

""Okay, thanks,"" I told her. ""We'll pack up our stuff in a few minutes."" 

She nodded and left. I only had my laptop out, and I was nearing the end of a sports news article. My stepsister (well, future stepsister) was playing a game on her phone. 

One minute later, the lady comes back and says, ""Nine minutes until closing."" 

Okay, I thought. That's a bit strange considering she was just here, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she just forgot or something. 

I repeated what I said to her earlier and she went on her way. 

However, one minute later, she came back *again* and said, ""Eight minutes until closing time."" 

By now I was getting pretty annoyed, but I kept my cool and replied, ""Thanks, we'll be packing our things up in about two minutes."" 

She left. 

And then she came back yet again and said, ""Seven minutes until closing time.""

629,Not the A-hole,"I have two lovely daughters (14 and 11) who have recently become very environmentally-conscious, which I think is wonderful. They've gotten the family into composting, growing our own chillies, not using up so much energy on A/C during the summers, and avoiding single-use plastics as much as possible. 

They've also began insisting that we buy only organic fruits and vegetables and they've began asking to go more frequently to one of those hipster detox juice places. I'm okay with going to the detox place once every month or every couple of months as a treat (it's better than other splurges at least), but I am not budging on the organic vegetables issue. I'm taking the stance of the scientific community, which is that there is no health benefits of organic foods over their conventionally farmed counterparts. I don't see the need to spend extra money for nothing, and it worries me that the costs will add up as produce is something we purchase every week. I also told them I'm not willing to buy those detox bottled juices at the supermarket because they're ridiculously expensive for the amount that you get. And again, no proven health benefits. 

What I have suggested as an alternative is that we go more frequently to weekend farmers' markets around our area so that when they buy organic foods they can at least pay for the benefit of supporting local farmers. My wife has taken our daughters' side though. She has no stance on the GMO/organic debate as she hasn't researched the issue, but said our daughters' peace of mind is worth the marginal costs. We are a financially stable family so we're not hurting for money, but I just can't bring myself to support my daughters on this issue.

While I was showing the trailer to a potential buyer, my brother in law turns up and can’t really give me a reason why he’s there, but he’s a junkie so I’m assuming it’s to steal something. After a while of just hanging around he tells me he’s getting evicted and wants to buy the trailer, so I tell him he’s family so if he pays the fees, it’s his. Long story short after days of putting off the other buyer I eventually tell him since he can’t come up with the money, I’m forced to sell it to someone else. He acknowledged what I said and then I never heard anything else about it. The bill of sale isn’t done, and the lot rent lease hasn’t been changed to the new buyer yet, but he’s paid the money and has begun some work remodeling. My brother in law broke in through a window and took the refrigerator out and sold it on Facebook marketplace. He admitted to it over text message but refused to make the situation right.

Lately we’ve been doing week on week off.  Needless to say, Child and I have an amazing relationship, I’m super involved in school, and the parent all doctors and dentist have relationships with, I’m the primary parent.  Like most parents, I’ve made countless sacrifices and have put my needs on the back burner for many years while also being financially responsible for everything. 

AITA:  Late last week my work asked me to run our U.K. business unit. They want me to be based in the U.K. for the first six months to get aquatinted with the team, customers, etc.  I conditionally accepted contingent on one thing.  That id only  be in country for 3 weeks then back home for one week. I would do that for six months or until it is no longer required (could be less time). The company accepted.  

Here’s the tricky part, my child’s mom is throwing a fit for having to watch our child for that long. She says I’m running away from my responsibilities as a father and being and I quote “a selfish POS”. I understand that I will be missing out on spending time with my child (and it honestly sucks really bad), but I look at it as a small sacrifice to vastly improve both mine and my child’s life.

638,Not the A-hole,"This was a few months ago but it still bugs me. I (18F) picked up a babysitting job senior year for a family I met on a babysitting website. Interview went fine and the kids were cute so I accepted 2, 4-hour shifts a week. The mom worked from home but I assumed she would be in her home office the whole time while I watch the kids. Nope. She was very type-A and expected a lot more from me than she originally said and was just very picky and got mad over very small things 
Ex 1: I was folding the laundry like I did every time I was there but she came in and yelled at me for “folding it the wrong way” and proceeded to unfold everything and make me re do it the “right way”
Ex 2: she had to run an errand and the kids wanted snacks so I just kinda listed what was in the pantry “chips, pretzels, oatmeal” and the boy said oatmeal. I made him oatmeal and mom comes home and scolds me because “oatmeal is a breakfast food not a snack food” 
Ex 3: the roads were ice so I was already very hesitant about driving over there because it’s very hilly getting there. She asks me to take the kids to ice skating 25 minutes away. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that because I had a hard time getting there and I definitely didn’t want the added responsibility of taking someone else’s kids. Of course she blew up on me reminding me that these are the responsibilities that fulfill my paycheck 
Ex 4: she was going out that night and asked me if I wanted 2 pieces of sushi (not full orders, just 2 little circles of sushi) or if she should give them to the kids. I said I would have them and later in the night my appetite changed or I forgot or whatever and didn’t eat. Got a text the next morning from her “friendly reminder to not waste food, we had to throw out the sushi you didn’t eat” 
I could go on forever about all the crap she expected me to do and got bothered by. I was with her September-March and I would have such horrible panic attacks whenever I had to work or the night before and as soon as I got off one shift I would dread the next just because she was so awful. I don’t hate babysitting I actually really like it, I just don’t want the parent there controlling everything I do because at that point you don’t need a sitter. Also the kids were brats. I finally put in my 2 weeks and gave some BS excuse. They were understanding and said they would miss me. But before I quit she asked me to babysit on her birthday which was in April (I quit March) and I said yes because I was still working for them. a week before she texted me and asked if we were still on. Seeing her name on my phone already gave me anxiety so I said “sorry I’m busy that night, I assumed when I put in my 2 weeks all future jobs would be canceled” and I got 4 VERY lengthy texts about responsibility and how good they were to me and how if they couldn’t find anyone to replace me I NEEDED to go.

So I just went ahead and brought mines.

There really wasn’t any issues, but I do notice he gets kind of irritated when I turn off the tv to play my game.  I mention that I have another tv that I can bring to the room, yet he insists that it doesn’t make sense to have 2 TVs in the same room.  I couldn’t find any sense it that once again, but I didn’t care; it’s my tv so he’s the one who can’t control what he watches at all times.

It’s the third week of school, he tells me that a couple of mutual friends, who’ve been over a couple times already, will be over at 9 pm, not really telling me specifically what for.  So I decide to go to the gym and 7 and come back at 8:30 to a room of 5 people watching a show on my TV.  I wouldn’t have a problem with this any other time; however, a group of friends wanted to play an nba 2k20 with me.  So given the rare occasion I literally came to the room expecting to play my game.

So yeah, I walk in and ask for the remote. I got many confused faces and groans.  It’s my damn tv so I get to choose what I do with it.  My roommate had the roommate and I had to ask him 6 times to give it to me.  When he finally gave it to me the room was dead silent.

One of the girls said that they could watch it in her room.  I then realized that I could just plug my ps4 into my monitor and they could still watch tv in my room.  When I gave them this proposition they cussed me out.  They had left and my roommate slammed the door on the way out.  

He hasn’t said anything to me for the past 3 days, and it’s as if I got cut off from a group I barely hung out with.  I think this whole situation is stupid and they should be understanding that it’s my tv and that he declined the offer of me giving him one of my extra TVs.

643,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a little trouble at work because I've been sort of hiding my personal life. I've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

We hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. Compartmentalization aside, I've made some great friendships at work. There are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. They are a big part of my life but I'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.

Last week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.

But the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.

AITA?

ETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

ETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, ""Ali Smith"". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything.",3793,19077,0.9

He tells these girls that he broke up with his gf, but he hasn’t.


I’m tired of his behaviour towards me and everyone, and having been cheated on myself, I hate seeing someone who is seemingly innocent get cheated on. I’d like to tell her anonymously.

648,Not the A-hole,"This is going to get a bit complex. It also shows how small the world is.  I’ll call my friend Katie. We’re childhood friends who aren’t as close as we were, but that bond from surviving childhood together is strong. Her almost husband is Ryan. My coworker is Chelsea. I’m a bridesmaid in Katie and Ryan’s wedding. 

Katie and Chelsea don’t know each other— they’ve heard of each other and all but have never met to my knowledge. Katie and I live about 1.5 hours from each other- I live in a big city, she doesn’t. I’ve never been a huge fan of Ryan, but he’s not my partner so... eh. He works in sales and is often out of town, including some weekends. Chelsea doesn’t have facebook and is only occasionally on instagram. 

Chelsea came into the office last Monday declaring she had the GREATEST WEEKEND EVER and met a new guy. She was gushing. She basically told a group of us how she spent the weekend with him. She told me his name was Ryan and he was from a town about three hours away, but I didn’t think much of it — it’s a common name, after all! Plus, Katie’s Ryan lives only 1.5 hours away, and I have no idea of his work schedule. 

Finally, someone said they needed to see a picture of “Hunky Ryan.” She pulls up a string of 5-10 selfies — SO NOT CHELSEA LIKE — and to my surprise, the guy was The. Ryan. I asked Chelsea to go out for post-work drinks and spilled that Ryan is my childhood friend Katie’s fiancé, and they’re set to get married next month. Chelsea was understandably upset, but encouraged me to tell Katie. Unbeknownst to me, Chelsea’s high school/college sweetheart cheated on her as soon as they graduated from college half a decade ago. She was Team Fuck Ryan. Chelsea offered to speak to Katie, if Kate wanted. Chelsea told me that in their time together, Ryan talked about prior recent hookups, though she has no information of if those are true accounts or not. 

I told Katie and it was... hard. To say the least. For Katie more so of course. I gave Katie Chelsea’s number. Katie never reached out, which is fine.

Fast forward to this week. I got a long email yesterday morning from Katie saying that she knows Ryan has always struggled with commitment (?) and she believes he had cold feet, which led to an “unfortunate mistake” that they “wish to put behind them as they prepare for marriage.”

I feel uncomfortable standing up in a wedding where the groom was recently so cruel to his fiancé. I believe this is very likely only the first time Ryan has gotten caught, not the first time he’s been unfaithful. At the same time, Katie is a lifelong friend. 

Is it an asshole move to drop out of the wedding? Should I suck it up? Help me reddit!

652,Asshole,"I've been divorced from my ex-wife for going on 4 years now. We have two beautiful daughters together. One is still a toddler and the other is in highschool. My oldest daughter is very smart. Smarter than me by a longshot. She has consistently gotten straight A's in school. Because of this she been placed in college prep and AP classes this year. This means she has a lot more in class work, homework, individual projects, and group projects. And she's killing it. It makes me so incredibly proud of her because since the day both my daughters were born the thing I've always wanted was for them to be strong, independent, self made, and successful women. 

Now for my ex-wife. She used to be a strong independent person but since we divorced she has gotten with someone new that makes really good money. They don't have the healthiest relationship. As a matter of fact in my opinion it's very toxic. They have broken up and gotten back together more times than I can count. Recently she quit her job at a company she has been with for 10 plus years. Besides the child support I pay she relies 100 percent on this guy's income and sits around all day long and does the whole real housewives of whatever type of thing. I definitely don't like the example this is setting for my daughters but have bitten my tongue because ultimately it's her life and I'm not part of it anymore and I can't and shouldn't tell her what to do.

Just today she mentioned she wanted to take my daughters out of town for a trip and my oldest will miss a day of school. I told her I was ok with it as long as she doesn't have any tests, quizzes, or has to turn in any projects that day because the the goals I wanted for her I mentioned above. To this I felt like I should tell her my reasons for that and my goals I had for them. I did say I don't want them to be stay at home housewives and depend on some guy for financial support and for their lives to come crashing down one day cause it didn't work out with the guy in this example. That's when shit hit the fan. She said she knew I was talking shit about her and kept trying to defend her current situation with paragraph long texts and even resorting to personal attacks toward me and bringing up situations we had during our marriage. Not once did I mention her by name in my examples or straight out said ""I don't want them to be like you"" or ""you're setting a bad example."" Though I do feel that way this isn't something I came up with once I saw her quit her job, it's something I've felt towards my daughters since they were born. She claims I'm being an asshole and making the conversation about her but I believe she's the one doing that. What do you guys think?

tldr: told my ex-wife I don't want our daughters to end up being stay at home housewives which she is doing at the moment

Edit: In our conversation I did not once mention her (ex-wife) by name in the one example that I didn't want them to turnout to be. Or her situation. Like I said above this is something I've felt since the day they were born and have said so to friends, family, and even my ex-wife when we were still married which she agreed to. You can call it coincidence or subtle jabs toward her but I didn't come up with this idea when she decided to quit her job and live off her boyfriend's dime, though it does bother me I won't deny that.

653,Not the A-hole,"So I work at a clothing store and we used to have a public washroom but after cleaning up pee, poop & period waste we talked to the owner about it and he told us we can close the washroom for everyone but kids... Well that didn’t help because parents let their kids piss all over the floor and some parents would even use their kids as a way to use the washroom for themselves. So after talking with the owner again, he told us we can close the washroom for good. A lot of people weren’t happy about this but whatever.

Well this man comes in with his 3 year old to shop and asks if she can use our washroom. I said sorry, we don’t have a public washroom and he got very upset, I even told him there were stores around us with washrooms. But he was like “wow you won’t even open the washroom for a 3 year old? its for a child, not for me. this is whats wrong with western societies, other countries dont treat people like this. if a stranger knocked on my door to use the washroom, i would let them” 

I just kind of stared at him while he went off on this tangent because i didn’t know wtf to say. It was super awkward. Then he left in a huff. I noticed a lot of customers think i’m TA when i withhold the washroom, esp from a child.

654,Asshole,"My gf works as a waitresses at a restaurant. Last week a family of 4 came in (dad, mom, 2 kids) and she served them. The next day the dad messaged her on Instagram talking about how it was so cool that modern technology allows people to find people so easily, or something of that ilk.

My gf told me about it and said how it's very strange, and that she feels a little bit bad/guilty for the wife's sake.

Cut to today. My gf is waiting for her bus and it's quite late. She's been waiting for around 40 minutes in the cold and wants to get home because she is going out tonight. The dad who she served rocks up in his van with his friend from work and offers her a lift because he is going that way too.

She accepts the lift. She claims to not be able to see what was wrong with it because she was going that way too. I was obviously quite mad that she'd accepted the lift.

656,Everyone Sucks,"Okay so I probably am TA but I hope it's for at least a good enough reason. 


I live with my boyfriend and his two kids (3 days of the week they are here) they are 9 and 12. Good kids and we all get along really well. 

I'm very into animals and have had all sorts of pets in my life. I know what small mammals and reptiles especially need. I do not currently have any pets of my own as I work  almost 60 hours every week and spend most weekends at my parents 40 miles away (dad is sick but not terminal, thank god).

They got a hamster 4 months ago. I told him it was a bad idea but the kids really wanted one and you all know the story. They lost interest and the care fell to me. It was in a teeny tiny cage and I upgraded it, I fed her, I cleaned her cage and played with her. She's actually a really sweet little girl. 

This was fine up until like 6 weeks ago when I had to start spending most weekends away. I would come home and the poor thing would have no food or water! God forbid I had to stay longer than the weekend I'd come home and her cage would be filthy and she'd be gnawing at the bars, again with no food or water. 


Finally I told him that the hamster needs to be rehomed because they are not treating it right. This went over for another 3 weeks to the point I was scared of leaving for the weekend. 

I found a coworker who will take the hamster and give it s great life. I gave it to her today and told them she (hamster) died. They cried and I feel bad.

657,No A-holes here,"My best friend and I rent a townhome together. She got a boyfriend 7 months ago and moved into his place (brought her cat there and clothing) and has not been home but for 2 hours in 5 months. Her room is essentially her large item storage and fall back if they break up (verbatim what she said). 

We pay month to month and since she’s basically move out I’ve debated whether to move into my parents since I’m not keen on living alone and not what I signed up for. She offered up her room for me to move into since hers is larger. I slept in it a couple nights due to back problems (her bed is insane) and prior to doing so asked permission. She said “oh I’m not home , it’s not like I wouldn’t even know I don’t care what you do”. 

So being 5+ months she has not been home but 2-5 hours, I needed a separate place to put my rat cage because I have a group of coworkers coming over after work. I decided to place their cage on the ground in her room for the day because I didn’t want to hear the “omg you have rats” comments at work the next few weeks and people poking at them. 

People would be in and out of my room, bathroom, and common area so felt it was a good closed off area people would not enter. 

Turns out she randomly came home midday from work today and saw the cage on her floor. She was mad and said she’d prefer them to not be in her room. Keep in mind she’s told me I can do whatever in her room and she’s been gone for 5 months. AITA for putting the cage in her room for the day?

FYI the cage was right next to the door away from any items. The cage is clean and the rats sleep all day.",43,61,0.87

666,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. This pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, I wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. During the newborn phase, I was SO exhausted. I was breastfeeding, baby had colic, I was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. I do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and I was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

My husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. He would silently be ticked if I asked him to not go to the gym. I truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). But sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. Sometimes, I NEEDED another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. Example: one Saturday I got up to pump. They were both awake (8:00am). He said he was going to head to the gym since I was awake, and I started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and I got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" I told him that it must be nice to even have the ENERGY to go to the gym. The ONLY thing I wanted to be able to do was sleep. I got the response ""I'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

Now that I'm pregnant again, I mentioned to him ""if I thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am I supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" I told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. Well, he did not receive this kindly. He texted me the next day ""Just to be clear, I feel like I do a lot. I will not be able to help out with daycare, as I drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. I will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and I need to go to relieve stress. The reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while I think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored.

That's literally all I did, I wasn't vocal about my disbelief, I didn't try to get them to see my way, I just had my name removed from the church records and they decided not to talk to me besides to send me talks from their prophet about how I'm not going to be in heaven with them. I still love my family very deeply and would be lying if I said I didn't miss them every day and would probably have just pretended I still believed and stayed in the church if I knew I would be disowned by them. 

I got a text, a freaking *text*, this morning from my sister saying that my dad died last saturday and was doing me a courtesy by telling me ""in person"" so I wouldn't find out through Facebook. I asked when the funeral was and got a call from my uncle that went like this 

""You aren't invited to the funeral, don't show up and embarrass you're family and cause your mother any more grief."" 

""That's not fair, he was--"" 

End of call 

And now I'm being texts from my other siblings saying that I can always see dad again one day, if I come back to church and I just don't know what to do.

I'm just kind of...heart broken. I know I wasn't his favorite person when he had died, but goodness sakes I'm still his daughter. He was my dad, he taught me to ride a bike, and to cook, and how to shoot a gun. He was their through my first break up and when I graduated and when I moved into my first apartment. I still love him. I had hopes of reconciliation and had dreamed of him walking me down the aisle one day. But now I can't even say goodbye to them because I decided I don't believe in their God?

The funeral is Friday and I really want to be there. I'm grieving too. WIBTA if I went?

Edit: First, I want to thank you all for the advice and kind words. It really did help. I called my brother before his flight yesterday and he encouraged me to go to my grandparents house and talk to them. There's a lot of stuff surrounding my dad's death that I didn't know about and it plays a big role in why my mom and family hate me even more now and don't want me at the funeral. 

My dad had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June. He talked to my grandma and grandpa about me and what had happened. I guess he had been against cutting me off but did it because my mom ultimately said it was her or me. He talked to them about wanting to reconnect with me because he didn't want to die on bad terms. 

This caused a fight with my parents and they argued about it up until last week. My dad decided he didn't care if my mom left him and started staying at my grandparents house. He was on his way to my place when he was hit by a drunk driver and killed. So my mom and family ultimately blame me for his death.

Last night was a hard night for me and I'll admit that I partly blame myself too. My dad's sister is letting me stay with her and ride with her and my grandparents to the funeral. My dad's family has been very kind to me this past 24 hours and I'm glad I'll have them to lean on during the funeral.

I don't think my mom will make a scene at the funeral if I'm with my aunt, she is scared of her, but my brothers and sisters might. 

My big brother's flight comes in soon and he and I already talked about going together to the wake my dad's side is hosting. I'm hoping since its at a bar none of my Mormon family will be there and I can be surrounded by people who I love and remember my dad.

Honestly I was still torn about going because I do feel a little guilty about his death, but he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me in it. So I'll definitely be at his funeral.",561,5602,0.99

Think a .8karat heart of the ocean from Titanic. I love that he spent time picking something for me. However, he mentioned either picking something else or letting me give him some guidance if it's not my taste (his idea not mine). It kind of isn't my taste because of the shape, and I have something basically the same this am oval shape (that I wear a lot). However, I never would have said that if he hadn't said something first. I think he wants to know I would like it because it was $1,000 plus.

So here is the question. I am a 30 year old trial attorney. I haven't worn heart shaped jewelry in at least 15 years. It feels to me like a nice version of what my HS boyfriend bought me.

670,Not the A-hole,"I (27F) moved in with my partner (36M) into his house two years ago.  After a year of living together, we mutually decided that we'd like to move closer to town.   He'd gotten the first house with his ex wife, and when I moved in he obviously had it fully set up how he wanted.  We changed some minor things around when I moved in, but I felt like we didn't really have the opportunity to set things up \*together\*.  The commute was also really wearing on both of us, friends weren't willing to make the drive to hang out, etc.

We started house-hunting together with the mutual understanding that my partner would be the one handling it all financially.  He makes more than double what I do, he's been working in his field a lot longer, he had the profits from the sale of his old house, he's from a much higher income background than I am -- lots of reasons that we were both on the same page about.

I found our current house through a coworker who knew the sellers and introduced me.  Partner and I toured it, loved it, decided to get it, and have set it up and worked on it together.  To me, this is OUR house.  We picked it out together, we've made it ours together.   I absolutely do not think of it as (or act like it's) just some place that I'm renting, it's something that through a lot of mutual decisions became our home.

My partner explicitly and only refers to it as ""his"" house, and it's caused a lot of upset between us.  Legally and financially, the house is his. 100% uncontested.  I pay a portion of the mortgage as rent (which he could not afford on his own), but if we were to split or sell the house or anything, I wouldn't expect anything out of it.  But it really, really upsets me that he only refers to it as his house, and no matter how many conversations we have about it, he still will only call it his.

AITA for being upset about this?  I don't feel like the financial/legal ""truth"" really matters in day to day life (with friends OR strangers), but obviously insisting on him not being ""factual"" seems like it could be a pretty asshole-y argument to stand by.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  A lot of people are making the distinction of house vs home, and I think part of the issue is that in my area, people don't really say things like ""my home.""  House is used interchangeably to mean home and building of residence, and to clarify, I don't mind my partner saying ""my house"" in the context of the building (""just paid taxes on my house"" ""my house needs a new roof""), but I do mind him using it in the context of our home (""I have that poster hanging up in my house!"" ""let's go back to my house for cheesecake""). When we meet new people, they very frequently will turn to me at some point and ask what neighborhood \*I\* live in, because my partner's language is so exclusive that they don't think we live together.  

u/sassrocks hit the nail on the head for me - I don't say ""my dog and our dog"" or ""my dog, and my other dog if we broke up"" -- I say ""our dogs,"" because day to day linguistically stating what exactly is whose would be weird and pedantic.",346,407,0.92
671,Not the A-hole,"I (16f) have a brother (18m). He's always been a bit peculiar but overall a good guy. I made a new friend at school this year who talked about dealing with autism in her daily life, it sounded a lot like my brother so I did some research at home. (I'm not a psychiatrist, I'm not trying to diagnose him, I was just curious). 

Some reasons why I think he might be mildly autistic:
 He hates having his routine change, it upsets him a lot. He's not very good at 'reading a room'/social cues/detecting sarcasm. He cant really deal with loud noises (my mom wouldn't allow me to learn the saxophone) . He doesn't like eye contact. Just to name a few. 

So I asked my mom, if she ever considered that my brother might be on the spectrum. She got upset and told me ""It's rude to assume something is wrong with him because he's different."" I asked if she got him tested and she was offended I asked. I asked 

She told my brother I asked and now they're both mad at me. Was I in the wrong here? It doesn't matter to me if he is or not.

672,Not the A-hole,"I’m in my 40’s now and as it usually goes, don’t go out often due to schedules and frankly, I like home. When I do, there is a particular woman that is being phased out because her anxiety is ruining the fun for everyone else.

She is asked out, is told exactly what is planned and then she freaks because it will be a scary movie or something like paintball with spouses and “she can’t deal”. It ruins everyone’s good time because now we have to convince her to go along or just change plans. I have become vocal about my distaste in her accepting and then repeating this pattern. The last time we went to the lake and a number of us wanted to rent canoes and she flipped out that the lake is scary, etc. Now I get the fear of water because I’m not a fan but I’m also able to compartmentalize in order to move forward. I said, “Look, whomever wants to go now I would like to go. I don’t want to wait another hour while we do this again.” Rude I know but I was just over it. Two people joined me right away and we left.

She is fully aware her anxiety holds her hostage but doesn’t seem to understand that it holds us back too. As a result, she is being invited out less often and it seems to have fallen to me to tell her why.

I suppose the reason she asked a couple of others and not me is because she knows I’ll tell her the truth but didn’t want to hear it.

She called and wanted to know if what she was thinking is true, that we are purposely not inviting her anymore.

“We’re generally not inviting you to the things that we know you’re going to be upset by. I get that you can’t help what your anxiety is doing to you but as I said, losing an hour or more at times trying to convince you to go ahead with the plan isn’t fun for us. You aren’t the only one that is frustrated.”

I said it as kindly but honestly as I could. She was very upset obviously because I absolutely confirmed her fears but really, what else could be done? She asked and I answered.

The opinions are all over the map. Those that don’t like confrontation think I shouldn’t have said anything. Those that are tired of it, appreciated me being the one to finally say something to her.

EDIT: I’ve only been hanging out with this group for a couple of years but they’ve been together for around 7. She has always been and will be invited to things such as quiet nights in a house or coffee dates but the general feeling for everything else is “What’s the point?”",319,2716,0.98
673,No A-holes here,"Let me start by saying I shouldn't even know about this baby shower - it was supposed to be a surprise but a coworker spilled the beans. We have office gatherings once a month, and this month it is at a brewery. I had no interest in going because I can't drink (obviously) until said coworker said the event was for me. While I appreciate the sentiment, I can't help but think that the 'shower' was added as an afterthought. In my mind, everyone will be enjoying drinks - except me - and I LOVE a good IPA. It's going to kill me!   
The brewery doesn't serve food, so the planner of the event ordered pizza to be sent to the place. I can't help but wonder why we couldn't have the event in our office - which we have done several times in the past.

I said that I respect the people but not the job, sort of like how you can respect a sweatshop worker but not the job of being a sweatshop worker.

She sent a few snapchats and I could tell she was slightly chubbier than her pictures but she didn’t look too far off. After a few days of talking we met up for drinks at a restaurant. As soon as I saw her I immediately felt disappointed as she looked NOTHING like her pictures which i later found out were from 3 years ago. I did my best to have fun at the date regardless of the fact that I wasn’t physically attracted to her whatsoever. The date went pretty well but the next day I sent her a text saying it wasn’t going to work out and that her pictures were misleading. I apologized and wished her good luck. 

My friends think I’m an asshole for the “misleading” part since she likely already knows she’s much bigger than she was in her pictures. I felt sort of catfished and while I wouldn’t call her an asshole, I think what she’s doing is wrong.

EDIT: For those asking or commenting on the weight gain and difference between pictures/reality: If i had to guess id say she was 130-140 in her pictures and in person about 200-220. That’s only a guess and I could be way off but regardless, she looked like a completely different person and did not even remotely resemble who i thought i was talking to.

683,Asshole,"For a little context: my group of friends is pretty tight knit and have known each other forever. All of us share a common love of cooking, grow food in our gardens, brew our own beer/kombucha, and like to experiment with ingredients. 

One of my friends recently hosted an end of summer potluck and all of the usual suspects were there. Everyone made something and most people’s dishes included something they had grown themselves or was a new dish they were experimenting with. My partner and I made some granola bars that used berries from our garden, whole nuts, homemade granola, etc... they looked like normal granola bars. But one of the ingredients that was “invisible” was cricket flower that we used for additional protein and binder for all the other ingredients. It’s important to note that cricket flower is literally just dehydrated crickets that have been ground into a fine powder, so it would be impossible to know what it was just by looking at it. 

We put them out on the table with everyone else’s stuff, and later in the day someone asked who brought the bars bc they liked them. We got talking about how we made them, which is pretty common conversation with this group, and I mentioned that one of the ingredients was cricket flower and he made a huge deal about it, saying how gross it is and that is was messed up that I would feed people bugs without telling them what it was. A lot of the other people at the party were pretty grossed out by it too, even tho many of them had already eaten and enjoyed them. I know everyone that was there fairly well and I know their dietary restrictions seeing as we cook for each other all the time. 

I feel bad bc yeah, it is an unusual ingredient and some people might find it gross, but I wouldn’t have mentioned anything ahead of time if I had used some other unusual seed or spice (and neither would anyone else in this group). I guess bc this was an insect a lot of people are telling me that it’s different and I should have told everyone ahead of time what was in the bars. Am I the asshole here?",147,154,0.85

685,Not the A-hole,"I’m a medical malpractice solicitor. My best friend has been overweight her whole life and in the past 2 years lost a substantial amount. She saved up enough to have a abdominoplasty (a tummy tuck) to get rid of loose skin. 

I advised her on the best clinics she could go to and advised her on surgeons to avoid since it’s literally my business to know. She decided to fly abroad for her surgery as it was cheaper. I also flew out to her after a few days to help bring her home. 

After a couple of weeks she showed me her scar. It’s horrid. They’ve left pockets of fat and skin along her incision that’s causing a ‘bubbling’ appearance- not enough to look awful at first glance but enough that I know it’s not meant to look that way. The scar itself is jagged and crude- to be fair, they almost always look that way but hers is particularly bad. 

She asked me what I thought- I told her honestly. She didn’t get what what was advertised. She thanked me and I thought nothing of it. We are usually very honest and frank with each other so I felt I could speak honestly. 

A few hours later when I got home and checked Facebook all I could see were passive aggressive messages saying her friends are snakes and that no one can be happy for her. She also left a very obvious message about ‘people in law think they know it all’ So I’m not overthinking that it’s about me. I’m pretty fucking floored by this.

689,Not the A-hole,"Using a friends throwaway. I (31F) and my husband (35m) have been married for a little under 2 years, been together for 5. We discussed kids in the beginning of our relationship, everything from names, parenting styles, roles, etc. It was always agreed that I would take care of the day to day things, but he would be active and involved. We aligned on everything we ever talked about. 2 issues have now cropped up, that led to a major blowout. I am 7 mo pregnant, we do not know the sex of the baby. Since day one, names have been agreed upon. Also, I do not plan on breastfeeding. Here is what happened:

My husband is a self identified ""know it all"" and he has apparently been joining facebook groups and reading parenting/pregnancy books. Overall, I have no problem with this! He's nervous and hasn't never spent much time around kids. I however, am a newborn care specialist. I have been working with FTP and their newborns for over 10 years. Nothing about this pregnancy has been ""off"" or ""different"" it's everything I expected it to be, you don't spend time around pregnant/laboring mom's for 10 years and not know what to expect. He seems to be very nervous about things, I do what I can to quell his fears, and I think I've done a really really good job at keeping hormones in check. Until.

He came to me yesterday and said he is concerned about me not breastfeeding. He has brought this up before, we've talked about this numerous times. I have calmly explained my reasons, and he said he understood and he'd try to get on board with it. But apparently he can't. He brought up for what feels like the 10th time, that I should be breastfeeding our child, (each time, I have heard his side \*that he got from FB\* and I told him I agree with him on the merits of breastfeeding, so I'm not shutting him down completely) This time however when he brought it up, I told him ""I'm not breastfeeding, if you want to breastfeed go ahead, and stop bringing it up!"" Well, that unleashed a wave of insecurity from him I had not seen. Questioning everything I've done up until now because his facebook friends all had different opinions. Even to the point that he ""no longer agrees on our baby names"". I let him rant and rave, when he finished I asked ""are you done throwing your temper tantrum"" and he stormed off. I was speechless, I get it he wants to discuss things, but yelling at your pregnant wife that everything she planned to do is wrong is NOT helpful. Especially considering the wife's profession! Husband is now sulking, saying he doesn't care since I won't let him ""parent"" anyways. He's NEVER acted like this before and this is going against EVERYTHING we ever agreed on, and it's pissing me off this late into my pregnancy when I've done everything I can to avoid this kind of thing! AITA for in his words “not letting him parent”?

Edit: I would like to clear up some stuff I've been seeing in the comments (I've read them all btw, and genuinely thank everyone for taking the time to respond) 1. I went to a birthing class with him, it was a full day thing on a Saturday. I did NOT want to go, but he expressed a strong desire so I went, it was long and almost the exact thing I used to teach in my own class but that was fine as it did make him feel better. 2. My husband is an attorney, who works long hours. I added the ""active role"" thing to explain that while I'll be a SAHM for the next few years, it's not something I'm doing on my own, I was trying to highlight how he will be present and in the home with us, not just working , or doing hobbies etc. that since my professional, has uniquely qualified me for my new ""title"" as Mom, this kind of thing just comes natural to me. 3. I DO consult him, we've talked about everything baby related from the MOMENT I found out I was pregnant (some even while we were dating) We have constantly communicated anything he's been worried about, or things he's read about that he wants to do (even if I don't, like baby wearing) The issue I posted about, stems from his internet use on FB to now badger me into breastfeeding, when it's been known since before we were married I wouldn't. I did NOT shut him down originally, we've talked about this several times over. Last night, was easily the 10th time, so THAT is why I snapped back, I'm tired of arguing it. Again, thank you all for your input.

695,Not the A-hole,"So I (f44) go to my local gym (UK) every morning at 7am. There are two carparks, a smaller one directly in front of the gym, and a huge ""overflow"" one about 200m away, around the corner from the door. If I happen to go to the gym at any other time other than my early morning slot, I generally head for the overflow carpark as the nearer carpark is always full, and the overflow is almost always practically empty. However at my regular early time, the gym is quiet and I can just park near the gym. 

When I have finished in the gym, I sit in the car and have a coffee and some porridge I take with me, before I go to work. By this time, the car park is full. This morning, a couple in a big wagon pulled up opposite where I was sat eating, and basically just stared at me, waiting for me to move. I didn't want to make eye contact so I carried on eating. After a couple of minutes, there is a tap on my window, which I wind down, and the woman asks me if I'm nearly finished. I tell her that I'm having my breakfast and then I will leaving, but if they go around the corner there is a large car park with plenty of space. She says no, they ""like to park here"" and continues to state at me for a response. So I just return to my porridge and after a minute or so, she turns round and leaves, making huffing noises and the wagon drives off aggressively round the corner. 

I might add, these are not handicap spaces or child spaces (there are some of  those, and they were empty). It's my opinion that if you are coming to the gym, surely you are capable of walking an extra 200m? I can't eat my breakfast in the gym - there is a cafe but purchasing their food everyday is not practical.

697,Not the A-hole,"In my home town, there's one dedicated group for Dungeons and Dragons for teenagers. I, (16 M), joined a running campaign. The campaign was extremely serious and grim dark. I created a human bard who's a big nerd for music theory who's overly friendly, but also quick to anger. I have a nasty habit of getting caught in the moment and saying stupid shit. That cultivated to a head when we were fighting the BBEG and I called it a 'big dumb shit face' using Vicious Mockery (A spell where you insult a foe and it hurts) and it kills. Me and one other guy out of a group of eight are the only ones laughing. 

We'll call the guy who laughed 'Chris'. He becomes important later. Both Chris and I and friends with the DM. Throughout the campaign I did a few, kind of minor jokey things. The DM pulls me aside and is like, 'you fucker, this was my big moment and you made a stupid joke.' Keep in mind, we are all awkward and hormonal teenagers.

Despite what I felt, at the time, triumphant, I now felt like shit. I apologized, I took my stuff and left. I actually in retrospect feel bad. Later the DM sends me a strawpoll over Discord showing the majority of the group decided to kick me. One voted not to kick me. Obviously I'm angry, but it's not like I didn't expect it. I send a good bye message to the group. I kinda get ghosted by the group, which made me feel worse. I was a mess for a bit because I felt like an idiot and was confused, but then I decided to stop pitying myself and resolved to make my own campaign with my own players, one that wasn't as grim dark, one that was serious but also had a lot of room for comedy and jokes. I create a world and invite five people who were not involved with the previous campaign and to my surprise, everyone joins. This is where it gets bad.

I run session zero and hey, these new players are pretty good, they roleplay and interact. On the cusp of starting the actual first session, Chris wants to join my campaign. I asked him like 'Hey, aren't you still apart of DM's campaign?"" He was like, ""Yeah""... in something I probably shouldn't of done in retrospect. I said yes. New group mates love Chris and his char. This is when things went from bad to worse. 

I receive a message from old DM and he is *furious*. He said that I was so shit at Dungeons and Dragons that I needed to steal his players to have any chance. Apparently Chris jokingly shit-talked old DM's campaign and gave old DM the heads up that he was leaving to join mine. 

Now, supposedly, over Discord messages between Chris and old DM, they argued over me and now hate each other and I'm being used as the arguing point. By connection to Chris, old DM hates me too. One of the members of the old group sends me a message saying if I hadn't made a new campaign, no one would be arguing and that we'd all still be friends and that this is my fault... which still doesn't add up because they ghosted me after I was kicked so I'm not sure most of those guys were even my friends.

698,Asshole,"So I am an ardent chicken lover and always down to try the newest and best food that's out there.
This happened when me and a friend of mine were at mall's food court. There was a new Shawarma outlet that had opened and of course i wanted to try it out. I went to the stall, gave my order and paid the salesperson the money and waited in front of the stall till my order was ready. I expected the lady to slice off chunks off the rotisserie and wrap it. Instead, she went inside her pantry and brought out some chunks of chicken and heated them in the microwave. I was obviously pissed. I went to stall and asked her Wtf she is doing and said that I wanted fresh Shawarma off the rotisserie and not whatever she brought from the pantry!

Following were her reasons for not giving me freshly cut pieces:

It's not economical for them for turn the rotisserie on and off every time they get an order so they do it just twice a day

That's how they usually do it

Nobody has ever complained about this (it's a relatively new shop)

All of the above was rubbish and I wanted my money's worth so I kicked up a fuss and asked to either return my money or give me a fresh fucking piece of chicken.

This is where my friend stepped dragged me away, ""apologized"" on my behalf and just asked her to give us the food. Later on I was berated about how I was being a difficult customer, they're a new establishment and I'm the last thing they need and that I should learn to ""adjust"" a bit sometimes.

Then she wanted me to take old jobs off, then she wanted me to change the address to her sisters, thennn when she changed jobs she wanted me to edit it so that it says she was formerly employed. Basically, she was difficult for no reason. 

I didn’t mind doing a resume at first because my mom hasn’t  worked in over ten years. Tbh it took me a simple google search to find out how to do one when I first started working like five years ago, but nonetheless I didn’t mind. I enjoyed formatting a resume from scratch.

700,Not the A-hole,"To start, my girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, and so far things are going really awesome. She has a 5 year old large breed dog who I like, but I'm really, really not a dog person. I'm not really an animal person in general, but definitely if I had to have a pet I'd want one that was way less maintenance. Still, she loves her dog, I love her, we're all cool. I'm not mean to the dog, I don't ignore the dog, I play with him sometimes, and I go with her to dog parks and that sort of thing occasionally as well. 

A few months ago, my girlfriend started talking about moving in together. I told her I would normally think now is a good time in our relationship for that, but that I wasn't really comfortable living with a dog at this time. She argued and said that she would take 100% responsibility and care of him. I thought it wasn't possible, but she assured me I wouldn't have to do a single thing I didn't want to. 

I thought it was a pretty bad idea, but I suggested a trial period where she stays with me, and if it works out by the time my lease is up, then we move into a bigger place together. She agreed wholeheartedly, and moved in.

At first things were fine. But one week, she got pretty sick, so I took care of her dog that week. Then, she had to go out of town, and I took care of the dog then too though I mentioned to her in the future, she'd need to make other arrangements. Things like this kept cropping up. She needed to go to work early, her friend was in town and she wanted to go out. Sometimes I refused, but each time I did, she kicked up a fuss. I tried reminding her of our deal, but she said it was only sometimes and only for ""extenuating circumstances"" and it was ridiculous to expect her to pay money to watch her dog when I was at home.  

So I told her when my lease was up, I'll be renewing it on my own here, and that I didn't feel like the trial had gone well. She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. 

Some of her friends have pulled the ""wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?"" but obviously my kids would be  a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that. Others think I'm some dog hating monster, which isn't true either.

701,Not the A-hole,"So where to start. 

The other day I had my younger sister visit me during the week at my apartment. I work from home so I couldn’t entertain her the whole day, but she didn’t care as she like most of us, can entertain herself on her phone. 

She asked if she could use my AirPods while going around the shopping mall, I didn’t have a problem with this as I only use them when going gym and when I don’t want to carry a big pair of headphones around. Anyway, my dad comes to pick her up and she leaves. I get a text 20 minutes later saying she forgot to give them back to me and said she will next time she sees me. 

No big deal I think to myself.

Fast forward a week later, I visit my old home and ask for my AirPods back. She looks at me and freezes and looks at my mum. I turned around and look at her, and I could tell it was a look of “it’s about to kick off”. I look at my sister and ask where are they. She begins to say that she was out with friends and think she’s lost them while out, because she can’t find them anywhere. This is where I don’t know if I’m the asshole. You see my little sister is 1 of four and the youngest. My parents are amazing parents but she is really spoilt, no idea why. Maybe my parents give in because they are older and don’t have the energy to fight back at a sassy teenager. So, I say ok, mistakes happen but you have to replace them or give me the money back. My mum turns around and said this is not fair at all, they are £160 and she doesn’t have that kind of money at her age and I earn a lot compared to everyone else.

But that’s not the point. I come from an average middle class family, we wasn’t rich, but we wasn’t poor either. Growing up I had a lot of entitled friends that would be given anything they wanted and throw away belongings like there was no tomorrow. That never did them any favours, because they grew up into entitled adults and didn’t have a lot of life skills when dealing with consequences of their mistakes. So I wanted to show my little sister while I am not mad that she lost them, I want her to understand the consequence of borrowing someone else belongings and not looking after them. I get it, she’s 15, but I went through these exact same things and I felt it taught me some valuable lessons. 

So, AITA??

Update: a few are asking about find my iPhone. I’ve said before, it doesn’t work because they use your iPhone location. Since I had my phone and she had the airpods (with her find my iPhone being off) the last known location was when she was last at mine before she took them.

Update 2: I’ve received a lot of great advice, so I’m going to meet in the middle. I live alone and am pretty tidy, so don’t have a lot of chores for her. So I’ve agreed with my parents that she will forfeit half of her allowance and only pay half of the airpods. But she will be doing an increase amount of chores around the apartment. A lot have said it’s not my responsibility to discipline her and you’re right. So this compromise also relies on my parents also making sure they keep their word.",400,2370,0.96
702,Asshole,"EDIT: I removed the word ""sullen"" from my description of my wife's demeanor, I didn't realize it has negative connotations. I was not trying to say that my wife was acting moody or childish or to be dismissive of or insulting to her.

Restoring classic cars has been my hobby for the last 15 years. My wife has always been fine with this, but she's never been interested in cars herself, which she told me pretty early on when we started dating. This was the same conversation where she told me about her deceased brother, who had died about 2 years before we met. Here's basically how the conversation went:

Me: I'm into cars, are you?

Her: Not really. My brother was really into cars when I was growing up, though.

Me: You'll have to introduce us sometime.

Her: He died a couple of years ago. But he was an army mechanic, that's how much he was into cars.

She clearly didn't want to talk about her dead brother, so I didn't ask her any more about him. This whole time (8 years now) I've assumed that he died in the army and my wife has never volunteered any details about his death.

So fast forward to this weekend, I picked up a car at an auction that I've been trying to get my hands on for a long time. I don't want to give myself away, but it's the equivalent of a ""rare collectible"" and I have the potential to make a LOT of money restoring and selling this car.

My wife didn't see the car until I had brought it home and it was sitting in our driveway. We have an established budget for my hobby so I don't run purchases by her beyond that, which she's fine with. But when she got home and saw this car, she broke down crying and told me for the first time that her brother died in a car accident in the exact same make/model of car.

She hasn't asked me to give up the car, but I can tell she would like me to. Usually I work in our driveway but I've been hiding this car in the garage the last couple of days so she doesn't have to see it as much, but she's still ~~kind of sullen and~~ obviously upset when I come in from working.

My plan is to just finish restoring the car and then sell it asap. But my buddy told me that I'm being an asshole and I should just scrap the project, is he right?",66,161,0.93

704,Not the A-hole,"So this is not necessarily recent and we are no longer together but it recently got brought up again by a friend who said ""you didn't have to be such an asshole about it"", which reminded me of this sub so here goes.
 
My recent girlfriend (pushing a month) and I were both at a new years party, we came seperately. At some point throughout the night a group of us were sitting around a fire and my girlfriend was talking to a mutual friend of ours. She was definitely better friends with him than I was but I was still decently good friends with him. I was talking to someone else when I just happened to hear her say something along the lines of ""I don't really know if I have big tits or not"" and our friend replied with ""can I touch them to find out"". (which typing that out sounds really creepy) My girlfriend appears to look at me, says ""ok"" and you can assume what happened next. I jumped up and said ""oi what're you doing mate"" and threw my drink at our friend. My girlfriend looked at me for a second before running over and apologising. Saying that she ""forgot"". 


The friend, just like the majority of the people at the party did not know that we were officially dating and I wasn't mad at him and he apologised profusely for the time after it.

We were all a decent amount of drinks in.

We did continue to date after this, we broke up for different reasons but we are still friends.

Edit (extra detail): People at the party knew that the girl and I were on the go, I don't know if that's a term used outside of my area but the friend knew that we were pre-dating I guess.",43,49,0.9
705,Not the A-hole,"I'm pretty pissed off right now. I live in the UK and have a long term friend from Portugal who I've known for 7 years. He is coming to the UK in November and I have been planning some stuff for the 2 of us to do, just things like escape rooms, countryside, York, restaurants, clubs and bars etc. 

After my boss said I could have the week off in November, my friend booked the flights and a few days later he said ""oh by the way Sam, one of my friends is coming"". At first I was pretty pissed off because I thought it was the 2 of us, and he knows I'm a bit anxious when it comes to people I don't know - especially foreigners. My friend showed me the guy's FB profile and his pictures are all cars, cross bikes, army pictures and he poses with the 'im hard' look. Not like I have anything against those people, but I know for sure we won't click and it will be awkward. I told my friend it's fine and that I'll plan something for the 3 of us - gave him some hotel suggestions and then he booked the hotel.

After he booked the hotel, he says ""oh by the way, 2 more guys are coming now"". At this point I just sort of give up. I haven't said anything to him, I just said 'lol'. I really don't want to spend 4 days with 3 random guys from the army that I barely know and barely speak English.

I'm thinking of just telling him that I don't want to spend time and money on something that I know I will hate. I will meet him for a day or so but other than that, he can enjoy the holiday with his friends.",68,278,0.97

708,Not the A-hole,"So, am I a bad parent for allowing my children (9f & 12f) to ride an Uber home from school instead of picking them up myself? I am a self employed working mother.  I spend approximately 2 hours of my day driving my kids to and from school. The school is only 10 minutes from home. But because of lack of parking and the general chaos at school at pick up time, I spend an hour at each time I pickup or drop off. 

In the past I have always been able to find other parents to carpool with. My children attend a small private school and finding other parents in our neighborhood to carpool with can be difficult. This year I was not able to find another family to carpool with. So, I’ve been looking into other options. 

The best solution I could come up with to arrange for an Uber to pick my children up from school. In the country where we live, children are permitted to ride alone in an Uber. I made arrangements with the teachers aide in my daughter’s class to help them find the Uber once it arrived. After the first 2 days, my daughter’s were able to find the Uber themselves and ride home. I ordered the Uber and could watch the route as they drove home. I work from home and am there to greet them when they arrived. 

Everything was going well until yesterday when one the teachers at the school found out that my children were ubering home everyday. Today I got a call from the principal, basically shaming me for my choice to allow my children to ride home unaccompanied. He stated, “I can’t believe I have to make a policy for this. Don’t you realize it’s unsafe for your kids to ride in an Uber alone? Because of you’re actions, I’m going to send out an email to all parents prohibiting them from allowing children to ride in taxis or uber to and from school alone”.

I don’t agree with his suggestion that Uber is unsafe compared with other transportation options. Children at age 9 are allowed to walk home from school (this is what most parents at our school do. But we live on the other side of a busy highway and it’s not possible to walk). The school offers busing. But at $2,500/yr/child, it’s not affordable for us. Plus with the amount of bullying that goes on in the buses, I don’t see how that is a better option.  Another option is to hire someone to pickup my girls from school. I’ve done this in the past and will likely do it again now. But it is always a hassle when they are late or call off sick. One of the reasons I like Uber is because I know the drivers are insured and have a clean criminal record.",223,234,0.9

I live in an apartment building that’s filled wit mostly Chinese people and one British couple. They’ve been here 3 years longer than I have and can’t say anything other than NIHAO and XIEXIE. They constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which I told them to stop and start learning chinese. I taught myself to be half fluent in Chinese before I got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months I’ve been here. They managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic English but they left. I told them that they’ve been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. Yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese.

711,Asshole,"I'm 47F, husband is 49M. We have three children: Jack, 26M; Jane, 23F; and Jill 19F.

When Jack went to university, he applied for grants and we paid the remainder. He graduated with no debt. Likewise when Jane went, the same situation applied. Jack went for chemistry, Jane went for kinesiology. Jill finished highschool and took a gap year and is looking to start in January.

We paid for Jack and Jane's school because university here in Ontario is relatively cheap after you account for grants. It's something like $5,000 tuition per year, but they both received anywhere from $3,500 to $4,000 per year in grants and bursaries, with the remainder being loans. Some of these grants were based on academics, but the majority is based on income and other factors. It's very cheap to go to school here because these grants are available to everyone, basically.

But we also paid for them because both my husband and I found their program choices have merit and real world applications. And we were right: Jack went on into pharmacology and makes a pretty penny, Jane got a job right out of school in sports management.

Jill wants to go double majoring in gender studies and asian culture studies. We don't want to pay for it because we think it has little merit and she'll have difficulty finding a job. Why? Some of my friends went for gender studies or sociology or anthropology when I was in school and none of them work in related fields. Some of them don't even work and are SAHMs and didn't work inbetween school and becoming SAHMs. Nothing against SAHMs but Jill claims she is career oriented and thinks this will be her career when both my husband and I don't think it'll work out.

She already got quotes for her government grants/loans and her final cost is going to be only $1,500/yr or so. She lives at home: this is something she can reasonably pay off saving a little here and there in just a couple of months. If she was determined, she could pay off her yearly loans in a single month. Even at a minimum wage job.

We want her to have the experience of having to work for school so she can rethink her major. If she has to work to go to school, she'll realize it's not as simple as she thinks and she'll become more interested in a major that can actually make her some money.

Are we the assholes?",210,81,0.72
712,Everyone Sucks,"I broke up with my ex a year and a half ago. We had been dating for over 4 years and out of the blue, she wanted to break up. I thought things had been going great. We had been talking about getting married and moving in together and all of a sudden, she wanted to end things. The day before, we had been making anniversary plans and when I called her the next day, she said we should cancel them and we should break up. I tried talking to her and even drove out an hour just to talk to her but she refused to give me any other information. 

Not sure if relevant, but she had closed off to me in the past and broken up out of nowhere. During those times, I tried really hard to reach out and try to resolve things but this time, I was just tired. So for about a year, I didn't talk to her and just felt shitty about the whole situation. A few months ago, I was hanging out with some mutual friends and they were telling me about her new BF. It's been like a year at that point. I""m still a little sore about it but she can date whoever she wants. But as we're talking, I realize that their ""anniversary"" overlaps with the time when she and I were still dating for a period of a few months. I was devastated. 

Of course I minded the cheating but I was more upset that she didn't tell me THIS was the reason. I spent months blaming myself for ruining what I had perceived to be a perfect relationship. This made me really upset to the point where I fell into a little bit of a depressive state. I had doubts about ever finding someone and had panic attacks about how I could trust anyone in the future. 

Recently, I got back into dating and I'm reminded of this whole situation again and I feel like shit. So I had a guy's night out and got trashed. At the end of the night, I ended up texting her and telling her she should've just told me about it and that I know I know why she broke up with me. I realize it's been over a year and maybe I should've just moved on. But am AITA for bringing it up when she's happily moved on with someone else?

715,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr I had a life threatening health condition for four years. My sister ignored me during this period saying I was obsessed about it and she didn't have time to help because she has kids. Now I'm cured I don't want her in my life and it's hurting my mum to see her kids estranged. 



I recently went through a life threatening medical condition which lasted 4 years. It's a new one and the doctors didn't know how to treat it. I was alone in choosing my treatment options which had serious risks and was forced to make life or death choices alone. 

My sister is a lot smarter than me and constantly promised to look into it to help me decide what to do but every time I spoke to her she hadn't looked into it and didn't want to talk about it because she felt I was obsessing over it. I spent about 9 months in a burn ward from it, had multiple instances of blood poisoning and ended up with all viral infection of my brain. She visited me once, as she was going to a restaurant near by and popped in.

She has kids and said she didn't have time because of them (she works part time as a primary school teacher) and was upset with me because I didn't engage with her and her life and family during this time because I was obsessing over my health.

Now I'm cured I don't want anything to do with her. She's not a bad person as such, just in my view she's very selfish and won't take time to help anyone (me or my mum who was caring for me) if it was inconvenient. That's not the kind of person I want in my life.

Now I'm hurting my mum by saying I don't want to see her, and hurting my young nephews because I don't come over to play with them anymore as I can't stand seeing my sister or her husband.

Am I being an arseholes for choosing not to have her in my life, given it hurts my mum to see her two children estranged and depriving my nephews of their uncle?

718,Asshole,"I’m not going to be able to make this post with any shred decorum so let’s just get right into it.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 5 months now. Early in our relationship I borrowed a pair of his favorite sweatpants and have been holding on to them over since. They are super cozy and he was alright with me keeping them since I loved them so much and had every intention of giving them back. I have always put in an effort to take care of them and not eat any messy food in them since I know they are not mine. 

However, over the weekend I caught one of those 24 hours stomach bugs. I was feeling a little woozy and decided to spend the night in. Everything was going alright but then the worst case scenario happened and I dashed for the bathroom. I, unfortunately, didn’t make it and ended up messing myself. I don’t want to get into gross detail but about the 1/3 of the sweatpants were damaged. I stripped them off and tossed them outside on my front stoop to deal with later since I wasn’t in the condition to deal with them then and there. The next 20 or so hours I was tied to the bathroom and spent the whole time on the bathroom floor. The next day I went to go deal with the sweatpants and they had attracted flies and were, what I saw, as a lost cause. They were a lighter grey color and I just didn’t know how much could be done so I wrapped them in a plastic bag and threw them away.

My boyfriend knew I was sick at the time but I didn’t tell him about the sweatpants until a few days later when I saw him face to face. He was extremely angry and wanted to know why I didn’t try to save them. I don’t think he realized how horrifying their condition was but he still said I should have tried. It turns out those sweatpants were more sentimental than I realized which is my mistake. They also cost more than I anticipated(~$70) which makes me feel terrible. I offered to buy him a new pair but he said it wont be the same. But, I still think that a diarrhea explosion warrants just throwing something in the trash. AITA here?",164,259,0.89
719,Not the A-hole,"Required background:

My in-laws frequently marginalize or ignore when it comes to my kids. I'll tell FIL something 3-4 times which he'll ignore, Wife tells him once and he listens. I try as little as possible to tell them things re: my kids, going through Wife. They come over at least twice a week to help, so they are a large fixture in the kids lives.

**Part I:** I organized a BBQ for my and Wife's extended families, (~40 people). I was on the grills (homeboy had 3 grills rocking at once) when at the table nearby me, my eldest (4YO) was whingeing about something. My mother and MIL both heard this and turned to see what's up. 4YO is going through a phase where Wife and I explained to her that we don't understand her when she whinges/cries over little things, and when she remembers how to talk, we'll listen. I asked both grandmothers to please step away, and within 20 seconds 4YO calmed down and told me what was wrong.

A few minutes later it happened again. FIL was nearby, so I said the same thing, asking him to step away. He insisted that he wasn't moving, he was going to stand right next to her. My problem with this is 1) That flies into the face of how we're trying to educate MY children, 2) There's no chance he'd have just stood there, as soon as I went back to the braai he'd have asked her what's wrong while she was crying.

I began to speak more forcefully, and after the 3rd/4th time forcefully said ""I know you want to stand here, but as her father, I am asking you to please move away from here until she's done crying"". He refused and told me to ""Watch out"". Wife saw/heard what was happening, told him to move and he did. I want back to grilling and she told me I was too aggressive and that I offended him. 

**Part II:** After things died down with the grilling, I found FIL and took him aside. I apologized for how I spoke, but not for the substance. I am her father and when he ignores me in front of her, he disrespects me and how Wife and I educate our kids. His response ignored everything I said, ""The park is a public place. You can ask me not to talk to her, but you can't tell me where to stand"". He was being combative and I wasn't going to get anywhere with him, so I apologized again for my tone and left.

**Part III:** Few minutes later, even though she was not a direct participant, I went to MIL to apologize to her too for how I spoke to FIL, to remove any unpleasantness so this didn't cloud over the BBQ. Her response included ""We're your right hands when it comes to raising the kids, are you sure you want to jeopardize that?"" and ""It's good you came to apologize, you're supposed to come to apologize, do you want a medal for that?"" (A common phrase in our language, showing scorn and refusing to acknowledge wrongdoing by FIL).

**Part IV:** Wife asked what happened. I told her and she spoke with MIL, who doubled down. Rest of the BBQ sucked for all of us.

721,No A-holes here,"My father recently passed away very unexpectedly. My childhood was very tumultuous, but I'll do my best to explain it. 

&#x200B;

My father was an American who met my mother, a Korean, and got married. My mother had a 7-year-old son from a previous relationship who she had left in Korea with her parents since birth. When my parents got married, my mother brought my half-brother to America. My parents were only married for about 1 year and my mother left shortly after I was born. I have 0 memories of my mother. She left my father with a newborn baby (me) and an 8-year-old boy who wasn't even his own. 

&#x200B;

My brother became a hard drug addict by age 13. I don't blame him for it at all and I understand how being abandoned by his mother TWICE had a psychological impact. My father did everything he could to help him: rehab, therapy, etc. I have lots of memories of picking my brother up late at night from jail, my brother and father yelling at each other endlessly, my father getting mad bc my brother stole money/jewelry, etc. you get the idea. Eventually my brother left our lives completely. My father did not let me speak to my brother as I was still young and he saw him as a bad influence, but I believe he left for very strict rehab program. 

&#x200B;

My brother returned after 6 years of no contact and let us know he was clean from drugs and was moving to a  far away state to live with his mother. My father and I never saw him again after that. This really impacted my (our?) father in that he had basically raised my brother, who wasn't even his own blood, he saved him from addiction, bailed him out of jail countless times, paid for rehab, let him steal jewelry, cash etc. And for my father to see him leave to live with his mother when clean was really heartbreaking to my father.

When my father became sick (at this point has not seen my brother for 10 yrs+), he said he did not want anyone to know expect myself and his sister. Am I the asshole if I do not notify my brother of our father's death?

724,Not the A-hole,"I(26F) am single and currently living in an apartment with my cat. Next door lives what looks like a single mother(40+-) and her son(8). I work early shifts, so I am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.

The mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. I am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations I just suck it up. It’s not like I have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that’s all. The son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but I could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. 

It was another one of the days when I let the son in and left him be. For a while everything seemed to be fine, until I realized that my cat was missing. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. I then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. Some time later, I found my terrified cat in the FREEZER.

I confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? He swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. I then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.

Not surprisingly the mother was furious about how I treated her son. I told her that I did it for the safety of my cat because I found her precious kid trying to kill her. She argued that I could have locked up my cat instead, in which I replied that I had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. She threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son.

725,Not the A-hole,"Seems pretty obvious to me but I am getting a lot of shit from people at my work right now. Work at a hospital as a resident doctor. One of the nursing assistants left a half eaten plate of food in the nursing pod. I get in in the morning and it’s sitting out, was covered by another plate but still disgusting since it’s out where patients walk by and I threw it away. My coresidents gave me a hard time about it saying I shouldn’t throw things away without asking and even one of the medical students said something like wth? There is a staff lounge where people eat and it is literally right around the corner and is a designated area for people to eat. If you don’t want your half eaten food thrown away don’t leave it out in the middle of a patient floor at the hospital. AITA?

Edit: No judgements toward nursing assistants but to everyone saying I’m the asshole for throwing away a nurses food, this was not a nurse. They have downtime throughout their shift, especially overnight, they have scheduled breaks in which the other nursing assistants cover if someone needs vitals taken right away. The nurses at our hospital will set up at a computer , typically can tell and I’m not going around with a JAHCO checklist policing the hospital; honestly don’t care.

It completely broke the family and they grieved for six months. They recently found out that the hospital missed the problem in a routine scan and this led to the death of the child. Very common and easily avoidable. She said she feels like she lost her child again. I work at the hospital and I know for a fact that the only way to hurt that hospital and force them to change is to go to the local paper and share your story. Thing is would I be an asshole for saying go to the paper. I’m talking from a lot of experience and emails only employees were allowed to read saying how much damage it has done in the past.

729,Asshole,"So I (F,21) am planning to get a tattoo for my nieces. (I have 4 all together). I did have another niece but she died 4 years ago of S.I.D.S

One of my still-living baby niece (P) is biologically not related to me, however I have always treated her as my biological niece anyway. (This is important for later)


Anyway so I told my family that I wanted 4 tiny crows to symbolise each niece and for a while, there was no argument. Until I went through who they were for. My brother (the father of the niece who died) flipped out and demanded to know why his daughter wasn't included but P was when she wasn't even related (his words, not mine). 

I informed him that the only memories of his daughter I have are bad ones. I was ill when she was born so I couldn't visit them in the hospital. I held her once for about 5 minutes. She died a few days later and every other memory is visiting her body, our family becoming distraught and argumentative with each other, the funeral etc. I told him I didn't want such a terrible reminder every time I looked at my arm. 

He told me I am deliberately leaving out his daughter and replacing her with P (she was born 5 months after his child). I told him that was nonsense because P was my niece. Cue my family then flipping out bcos she technically isn't and they don't see her as their niece. 

My brother stormed off and my family asked that I get an extra crow for her. I said no. That was a dark time for our family and it still has such a terrible effect on us. I told them its my tattoo and if I didn't want it on there, then it was my choice, my body. Every time I think of this girl, I just remember seeing her body (we were all in the hospital when she died) and it was the most horrific thing I've ever had to do. I don't want a permanent reminder of that on my arm. 

But now with my brother not speaking to me, my family are pissed and demanding that I either get an extra crow or just don't get the tattoo at all. So Am I the Asshole here?? 

tl:dr: Leaving deceased niece out of crow tattoo (which is for my renaming nieces) as she is a bad memory. Family are at war and demanding I get an extra crow or no tattoo at all.",561,751,0.9

when she asked me if it was ""weird"" i said that in my opinion it is, i said i was fine to have a Halloween party but once you classify it as a birthday party you're really just asking for presents.

735,Everyone Sucks,"I had to take a long bus ride today (~5 hours). 

Not the most comfortable thing but I’m doing some work and waiting it out. 

About halfway into the bus ride, some woman starts playing music aloud on a speaker. 

I figured it was an accident at first and she’d turn it off, but she doesn’t. 

She gets lots of irritated eye rolls and death glares from passengers. Someone even went up to the bus driver, but what could he do, he had to drive the bus.  She also had two kids with her so I think that kept away people who otherwise would’ve confronted her. 

I was hoping to take a nap before arriving at my destination and couldn’t drown out this sound. 

I went over and asked politely if she could turn that off and she said pretty evenly “no I can’t.” There was about five minutes of back and forth that can be best summarized as 
Me: You are bothering everybody and this is wildly inconsiderate 

Her: you don’t speak for everybody and my kids like the music. I paid for this bus seat and I can do what I want. 

So then I did something I’m not proud of. I took the speaker, put it in my briefcase, and set the combination lock. 

As a show of good faith, I gave her my briefcase to hang onto for the remainder of the trip, to be clear I was not trying to steal her speaker. I just said, very ticked off at this point “I’ll open it when we get there since you clearly aren’t responsible enough to handle a speaker.” 

They tried to get the bus driver involved but he basically said “stop bothering me while I’m driving or I’ll have to remove you.”

736,Not the A-hole,"I am a 15-year-old girl in her sophomore year of high school. I currently attend a top private high school in the US. Think, like...preppy, cheerleader, dress-code breaking girl type. And mostly jock/player/Supreme and Gucci-loving boy type.

My school has two separate campuses. One for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade. One for 10th, 11th, and 12th. Since I'm in 10th, I'm new to the Upper Campus and am surrounded by upperclassmen. I prefer this, it's quite fun.

However, my school recently polled and it's come to my attention that I am the ONLY ONE on campus without a cell phone (private school in CA, not surprised myself).

My parents say that I must ""earn it"" and what this means to them is a 4.0+ GPA, a varsity sport, and other responsibilities including piano, community service, room spotless 24/7, and taking care of two dogs. Since I go to what people call ""the hardest elite school on this coast,"" it's been hard to do that. Not even my hardest-working friends had to earn their cells, and they have had them since the ages of 11 or 12.

One of my friends who left our grade last year used to have a Blackberry. Not sure which model, but it's the one that comes to mind when you think of a Blackberry. He used to constantly get slammed up against walls, called ""poor,"" etc. He was shaken from it and resented the ""more popular"" boys.

I'm not asking for the newest model; my mom gets a free phone with her work and one from a few years ago (iphone 6?) would be just fine.

My dad got home the other day with a flip phone ([https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html](https://www.att.com/buy/phones/att-cingular-flip-2-4gb-dark-gray.html)) and said that he was going to activate it to keep in touch with me.

Keep in mind, he has all four of my best friend's phone numbers (they gave it to him willingly because they're cool with it), and CAN ALSO REACH ME ON MY LAPTOP THROUGH TEXT OR CALL when I have a Wi-Fi connection, which is all hours of the school day minus the 45 minutes I am on a bus, THAT HE DROPS ME OFF FOR AND GETS ME FROM.

I've told my parents I'd get bullied and I'd rather not use a phone at all, to which I get told, ""You'll be fine, stop being sensitive. No one cares, you're just being a wimp. It's a phone, not a bomb. We need to reach you.""

This is getting increasingly frustrating, so I said that he may activate whatever he wants but I refuse to use the flip phone in public or in front of my peers, rendering it absolutely useless. I'm perfectly fine keeping the arrangement as is rather than risking any teasing or looking/feeling like an idiot.

We have not been shy with discussing names with family and friends, and everyone has known our 'short list' for quite awhile. We had a family gathering last weekend and my BIL asks again how the search for a boys names are coming along. I tell him we have narrowed it down to the 2, with the one in a strong lead. He then says he needs to tell me something, that his husband has always loved the name in the lead and wanted to use it if they were to ever have a male child, and basically was asking me not to name my child that. My BIL is in a same sex marriage and although they talk about having children there are no immediate or serious plans to do this that I know of. The general understanding in the family is no one is certain that they will bring kids into their lives, although it is not ruled out by any means.

I mentioned at work that I couldn’t do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn’t care if I slid a couple people in. But I’ve been trying to get more bookings at this place and it’s kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, “please make a point to laugh.”

It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I’m quoting here) “inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke” “making him look like a fool in front of his girl” and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

He basically summarized it as “you’re supposed to be a professional and if you couldn’t handle me texting you shouldn’t be in show business.”

I think, without question, that he’s the asshole. But he doesn’t believe me and the only people I could tell this story to and ask to confirm I’m not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased.

Background: The winter of my senior year of high school had rolled around and I was completely stressed. From my part-time job,  honors classes, and extracurricular activities, I was having a tough time. It did not help that I had just gotten out of an awkward relationship that left me a little empty on the inside.

I have always been a very shy and anxious person since my primary school days, my parents passed on their panic attacks to myself and other siblings. In high school, I was also a very self-conscious individual (as many other teens are), along with some depression. I was always the happy gleeful friend that everyone could rely on, and even with all this stress, I still tried to maintain it. I agreed to senior photos for my parent's sake but told them I really did not want anything other than that. One day in a class my mom started to text me all these different things she was doing, like adding my photo to the newspaper for graduation, renting out two entire pages in the yearbook for pictures of me and family, and a couple of other small things; and how she wanted me to help her pick out the pictures before she sends them in. Over text I told her while I appreciate what she is doing for me, I really do not want any of it. She told me to get over it and why I would even say something like that, and I went on a rant about how for so many years now I have struggled through low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety; and finally this school year I have accepted myself as somebody who actually has any value and how while I was fine with my senior pictures, I did not want two whole pages in the yearbook because that is not me, that was not who I was and I did not want the attention. She said again that I would have to get over it and told our close family how I had been rude and mean to her and how disrespectful I was. Several family members sat me down at gatherings for a talk about how they wish they still had their mothers and how I should never be disrespectful to my mother.

740,Not the A-hole," 

Throw-away account for obvious reasons (privacy of my kids).

A few years ago, a close friend of my husbands, Luke, approached us about help with his two kids (12 and 14  at the time).   

The kids were traumatized by time spent in the house of an abusive relationship, and genuinely didn't know how to behave or relate to people.  The younger one hit and bit, the older one screamed and slammed doors.  Husband and I agreed to co-parent because luke was in a bad spot.  My one caveat at the time was 'no take backsies'.   If I'm gonna be a parent, it's for life.  

First two years everything went great.  Nine months in there were serious improvement, no more yelling or screaming or hitting.   Luke was able to seek treatment because we were supporting his family.   Then he got an offer of an apprenticeship in his field, but would require him to live four hours away for nine months.

First month was great, he came home on the weekends, everyone was doing great.

Then he just… stopped.  Stopped coming home.  Stopped answering his phone or texts.   We were really worried about him but when we could reach him he just said he was 'busy'.   Turns out not only did he take the opportunity to get back on drugs, but also back together with his ex (the one who had been abusing the kids).

The kids were… distraught.   Thought their dad loved drugs more than them, etc.   Made him promise not to do them again or bring their mom around.  He promised both and went back on them immediately.

For those of you keeping score at home, the kids are now  15 and 17, and both consider my husband and I to be their 'real' parents.   Both have expressly and repeatedly over the past 6 months asked for NO contact with either of their bio parents.   Both have asked to be adopted.

Luke at first admitted that he broke the kids trust and was willing to let them have some time, but now he's decided six months is long enough for them to get over it and forgive him so they can work on rebuilding as a family.   He's gone as far to threaten to take the younger one by force because it's his 'right' as the kids dad.  

At the moment my stance is that the kids are currently old enough to tell me how they feel and what they want.  So long as they're going to therapy regularly to work on things (both are diagnosed with CPTSD) I don't believe I should force them to spend time with their abuser until they're ready.   Luke says they'll never get over it if I don't let them come over, and thinks that I'm encouraging them to hate him (not true).  I think that long term they will want to have SOME connection with their dad, but they're just not there yet.  It's been almost a year since they've seen him.  

Tl;dr:  A friend asked me to co-parent their kids, I agreed, he disappeared for months and now wants to take the kids away from me, I don't want to give them up and the kids don't want to go.",69,612,0.96

~ I was raised Catholic, but also had a lot of superstitions and folk magic as I have a very old school mexican family. 

During my childhood, we moved to a new church that was closer, there we were shunned and socially judged because of these beliefs. The judgement from this congregation tore deep rifts in my family which still has effects lasting today. All in all, we were all hurt badly, and avoid religious things because of the bad memories. (I think we have PTSD..... not joking, it was seriously bad but in not going to go into it)

~ Me and my MIL have a tenuous relationship, and she knows the whole story about my family past since she and my mother were once very close friends.

Story:

My husband had his birthday recently, and his family came over to treat us to dinner. With them they brought a card and a big box (duh it's a birthday right?), well inside wasn't a normal gift but a huge crucifix. 

His mom is religious and only recently started going back to church, so now shes all about it.

The crucifix is okay, but I think it came from a bad space as she knows the whole story about my family and the hurt but decided to give it to us anyways. So I believe it has some passive aggressive I'll intent. 

Also it's just inappropriate as her son isn't religious at all. He literally doesnt care.

I am in a LDR with my SO. He lives in the US, I live in a non English speaking European country. Specific, I know, but it’s important.
We have been together for more than 5 years, and I just know he’s the one. 

Sadly. where he lives he’s unable to afford university and find a job that he has a vocation for (sciences). Instead he’s forced to do a very labor intensive job that doesn’t pay well and leaves him exhausted and frustrated.For this reason, and many other (among which me absolutely refusing to move to the US) he plans on moving here with a student visa next year. No problems, my family is more than happy to help him, and I’m teaching him the language. I 100% plan on marrying this guy and being with him till I kick the bucket.
Since we are very open and, not to brag, have great communication, we’ve already discussed things such as family and possible children.

Now, here’s the problem. He insists on giving his own name to a possible future son. He argues that it’s a family tradition (his father has the same name as well) and is very vocal about it. So far I have only stated that it’ll be a discussion for later as we’re both still young and I don’t plan on having kids for a few years still. 
But the truth is, I HATE the idea. Not because I don’t like his name, but because

1: it would feel so incredibly awkward to call my child the same name I cry out during intimate moments. I felt the exact same way when I found out he has the same name as his dad, but it’s not like I can complain about that. 

2: this name is English, and not only that, it’s a weird one at that. I live in a non English speaking country, and children with foreign names here are known to be ridiculed and bullied. Having been bullied most of my school life for many reasons, I know what it feels like and want to avoid it at all costs for my future kids. 

3: lastly, this name would curse him to a life of “huh?”, “what’s your name again?” And several butchering. I know because I have a fairly weird name myself, it’s in my language but it’s very rare and I’ve gone through my life constantly being asked about it or bullied about it (see point 2) and it’s very annoying.

It’s not a problem yet but I already feel like TA for being so viscerally against this.

As an adult, I got on medication that only brought it down to 8 times a day. I had to get off those meds to try for a baby with my husband. I coped by not allowing my husband's dog on any furniture or in our bedroom. 

We proceeded to have six miscarriages in a row, some late, some early. We've been through all the testing. He's fine, I'm fine. We had no answers until we went to a Reproductive Immunologist who was floored that my dog allergy had never been brought up to me in this context before. Apparently, women with allergies who are frequently and heavily exposed to their allergen have a sky-high risk of miscarriage. In other words, my losses are overwhelmingly likely to have happened because I am allergic to dogs and I live with one. He told me that it's an underdiagnosed issue and causes more losses than people might think. 

We were shocked. We had an unplanned pregnancy while dealing with this news. I've been wearing a surgical mask at home. I want this dog gone or I'm moving out. As far as I'm concerned the dog has killed half a dozen of my children and I finally have a chance at a live birth. My husband still isn't convinced and is of course attached to his dog. Science doesn't lie though, and I'm tired of being a graveyard when I now have an answer.

I stormed out and have been sleeping in my other condo where I keep my clothes and home office stuff so they can be dog free. 

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: the funeral home episode was during an extremely emotional argument. It's not how we usually communicate.

**Edit/Update:**
Many people suggested therapy. We have been in therapy for a while and had a session today. We do have a temporary game plan.

The therapist brought up that while it can't be proven that my allergy to dogs is the Cause of our losses, it really doesn't matter at this point. I have too strong of a negative association to the dog, and the house is becoming a toxic environment for everyone. For that reason, the idea to freeze embryos doesn't work because it only intensifies my feelings that the dog is the only thing standing in the way of/The Reason I can't have children. I don't need to elaborate on the mental health spiral this could lead to.

We've decided to do a test run. I will stay in my condo. Personally, I think this is a little unfair because I've already been exposed, but we can't help that. If we have another loss, we're going to separate as there isn't any proof that the issue is the dog, we can't keep trying at this rate, and I can't live with a dog for my own mental health.

If this baby CAN come to term, then my husband says that he is willing to accept that the dog may have been the cause of the losses, and will rehome the dog so that we can live together again. It would just be too suspect that the only pregnancy (mostly) sans dog exposure made it. It's also very likely that a child from me would also have an allergy to dogs, and we wouldn't risk a vulnerable child that way.

TL;DR We're separating, and the future of our family depends on whether or not this pregnancy makes it.",2254,2092,0.85
750,Not the A-hole,"I am in the fourth semester in university, and I take a discipline with this one guy that has high functioning autism. Soon after classes started, I noticed that he tries to approach and make small talk with some women classmates, myself included. He doesn’t talk to any of the men.
The problem is that he is always very rude when talking to people, and tbh it really pisses me off. The most recent thing that happened (and it was this occasion that I was rude) was that he wanted to show me a video in his cellphone, and I was busy at the time. I told him that I couldn’t watch it right now, and asked if he could show it to me another time. He answered me in a very rough voice, telling me that it had to be now, because that class was the only one that both of us did together. It made me very angry, and even more so when he pressed play for the video to start running and literally shoved his earphones into my hands (this wasn’t the first time he did that). And well, I was rude as well and told him that I didn’t have time for this, basically.
There were multiple occasion when he tried to talk to me, usually demanding that I watched a video or lent school materials, and I’ve always tried to be nice, but I don’t really have the patience anymore. So, AITA for this?",29,35,0.9

752,Asshole,"My Uncle (blood) and Aunt (married-in) divorced in kind of an ugly way when the kids were all younger (5-10). Before the divorce, she had developed a number of male friends who she always seemed to have a somewhat inappropriate relationship with. For instance, she once dropped off my cousins at a relative's house without notice and disappeared for the entire day to hang out with some guy.

She and one male friend became ""Best Friends.""  They would hang out while Uncle was at work, but she didn't try to hide that they spent all this time alone together. My cousins even knew him and he would sometimes babysit us (until my mom found out and said we couldn't go over there if he would be watching us alone). Everyone in the family thought it was suspect and tried to get Uncle to confront her, but if he did we never heard about it. I have memories of Best Friend and thought it was weird even then.

Eventually she tells Uncle she wants a divorce.  Aunt also confides in my mom that she is confident that Best Friend will support her financially bc Best Friend periodically buys her gifts. Uncle moved on and married a New Woman, but Aunt's ""Best Friend"" disappears shortly after said divorce. Aunt first tried to get Uncle to leave New Woman. When that failed, she raised her kids to view New Woman as the source of their family breaking up and her financial issues (even though New Woman/Uncle pay well beyond required child support). My cousins behaved accordingly. Our side of the family basically cut her out of all our family events (but never speak ill of her openly). Everyone is polite when Uncle/Aunt host things jointly for my cousins.

Fast forward 15+ years and everyone has moved on. My cousins had kind of a fucked up relationship with Uncle and New Woman, but they've since rebuilt the relationship and learned to love/forgive. I thought they would piece together what actually happened eventually given it was obvious to me even then.  NOT so. My cousin recently said that she never really knew what went down, but was hurt that our side of the family excommunicated her mom just because she ""got left."" I responded that IDK what happened (lied) but that she should ask her parents. She said that her mom kind of revealed what had happened when they were younger, but her dad never wanted to talk about it. Everyone thinks IWBTA by letting it all out bc (1) not our place, (2) BOTH parents made this big effort to ensure they can have a good relationship with their mom, and (3) they've already worked out their issues with their dad. Basically they think telling my cousins would create all kinds of mental issues and it's not worth it at this point. I think it's fucked up that everyone EXCEPT my cousins knows what happened. Also I'm not sure how over it they really are.",16,34,0.92

755,Asshole,"To set the scene, my girlfriend of about a year and a half and I have just been through a breakup. She broke up with me because she felt I was not fully emotionally available and honest with her. I am trying to bridge the gap and get back together. In the past few weeks, we have had very promising conversations and I have done a lot to open myself up emotionally toward her. 

Last weekend, we had a dinner together for one of the first times since our break and it was fantastic. Everything went extremely well and I really felt great about our relationship with each other moving forward. I spent the night and the next morning is when the trouble began. 

We were having a conversation about what makes successful couples and both agreed that the husband having an extreme amount of respect for his wife's intellect and achievements (and vice versa) is paramount to a good relationship. I pondered our specific relationship and told her that I think I have slightly more raw intelligence than her, but she is more capable overall. She suddenly became extremely upset and left the room crying.

Over the next half hour, I could not get her to talk about it aside from saying that her feelings were very hurt, and when I tried to explain she told me I was only telling her what she wanted to hear. I tried to tell her that I consider us almost neck and neck and that I am only slightly smarter than she is. I eventually left and she texted me later that day saying I was arrogant and that she had thought we both considered each other equals.

To provide some context, we are both tech consultants at the same firm and are at the same career level. She is getting her master's degree in data science. I consider myself more technically intelligent as I do more software-related work day to  day, while I think her strength is in getting things done and more ""business smarts"". Essentially, she is furious and upset because she now thinks I underestimate her ""tech smarts"" to gas myself up.

759,Not the A-hole,"First time poster, throw away account. 

I rarely wear makeup. When I do, I do it for myself, not to please someone else. 

My MIL is a very beautiful woman who clearly puts a lot of effort into her appearance. I think that's great. More power to her. 

For some time, every time I would see my husband's mother, she would greet me and say, ""Wow, you look so beautiful when you wear makeup!"" and similar comments. Then she would go on at length about how pretty I looked. She'd always say that phrase (or something very similar) multiple times while greeting me. 

In some cases, she'd turn and ask her husband, ""Doesn't u/AITAthrowawaybzz look so pretty when she wears makeup?"" And he would chime in and agree with his own comments, which I disliked even more.

Once she said it from across a long dinner table. Several times. I was mortified. 

The first few times it happened, I tried to just brush it off. I did mention it to my husband later in private though. I told him I thought the comment is kind of rude and it hurt my feelings. He was irritated with me, because he believes what his mom said was supposed to be a compliment and that I am just looking for reasons to be upset. He says she was only saying things like, ""Wow, you look so beautiful today! I love your makeup!"" While she probably did also say things similar to that, she did always say ""you look so pretty when you wear makeup"" multiple times. 

Over time, it kept happening and I could see the makeup comments weren't going to stop. I already have social anxiety and this resulted in me dreading seeing my MIL. I got more and more convinced that she knew what she was saying wasn't a nice thing to say. I believe if I told her the same thing, she would (rightfully) feel insulted.  

To make matters worse, bringing the subject up with my husband resulted in more and worse arguments. He now thinks I ""hate"" his family because when things like this upset me, I tell him about it afterward. 

When I would try to tell my husband that these comments were really getting to me, I was hoping he would just show some concern and maybe show me some extra affection. I wanted him to acknowledge (to me only) that my feelings were valid. Ultimately, I had a total meltdown over it during an argument and confessed the reason the comments upset me so much was because my parents would tell me the same sorts of things all the time in an effort to remind me my looks are all that matters since I was a girl. After that, I believe he told his mom to stop with the makeup comments because she suddenly stopped. 

However, he still refuses to admit that my feelings of hurt over the comments were valid or accept it when I tell him I do not hate his family. We still argue over it sometimes.

Meanwhile, my best friend thinks I am making too big a deal about the whole thing. She says this is the kind of shit moms say- judgmental and back-handed compliments.  

So, am I the asshole for insisting that the makeup comments were hurtful and that my MIL shouldn't have said them?",48,62,0.82

Second, my mom is on an immunosuppressant that makes here more susceptible to getting contagious illnesses like the flu. My girlfriend spends a significant amount of time with my family, especially my mom.

My GF is opposed to getting one because the two times in the past she’s gotten a flu shot (I have trouble believing she’s only had a flu shot twice) she’s wound up getting the flu later that flu season. She’s convinced the flu shot caused her to get the flu both of those times.

I have explained to her that flu shots use a dead version of the virus, and that the dead virus can’t cause the flu.

I have also explained flu shots are not always perfect. There are different strands and pharmaceutical companies are giving it their best guess as to which strain will be prevalent in a given year. So if you got the flu after getting the vaccine, it’s because they wound up getting the prediction wrong.

She doesn’t believe me and is rather insistent that the vaccine caused the flu, and therefore she not get the vaccine. I’ve told her to ask a doctor friend of hers and she refuses. So we’re at an impasse. AITA for not budging.

I'm a 18\[F\] so its not like I was super threatening but I told them that it was a dick move and that I was going to stay until they left (which was 5 min later).  When I looped back on my way home I saw them hovering around the tree but they scattered when I walked by.

772,Not the A-hole,"So, as a preface this happened last month. Also, my first post:I went camping with a few friends that were in town. We were camping for one night and hiking the next day. There were 5 of us total, me and two couples. We all decided that we would let one person buy all the food and split the food costs evenly. This was one dinner meal, one breakfast meal, some snacks, and beer. When we arrived (I should also note, I drove 3 hours each way in my car in the Rocky Mountains) I asked the friend who purchased the food, lets call him James, how much I owed them in the split, and they said evenly it would be $50.

Now, I'm no scrooge and I'm always happy to pay my fair share, but I felt that this was a little steep considering we were eating burgers, pancakes, and drinking coors lite for only one night. I asked to see a receipt. Turns out, the bill for everything was $150, and we just had a lot of nicer products. Jame's wife is a vegetarian and had her own separate food included in the bill, and I'm happy to help with her food as well, but it definitely added to the cost.Here is where I take issue. The bill was split 3 ways, 1/3 James and his wife, 1/3 the other couple, 1/3 me by myself. My wife was not with us because she had to work, and I felt that it was unfair that I was expected to cover 1/3 the bill while the other two paid ""as a couple"" instead of individually.

I was bothered by this and brought it up, explaining that it wasn't exactly even, but I was told by both couples that it made sense to them. Their logic was because James was paying, and the other male was paying, the women shouldn't have to. Normally, I'd be chivalrous and agree, but my wife wasn't there, so I don't think that it makes sense. I offered to pay $30, which would have been 1/5 the costs instead of 1/3, but they all said I was being ridiculous.

I just took it down as morning grouchiness and ignored it, because I am also grumpy at 7AM. Eventually though the sighs turned into comments under her breath, and comments under her breath turned into comments directed at him. She snapped and something along the lines of, “Can we have another barista please? I have somewhere to be and I’m not trying to be late.” It was obvious the guy heard it, and so did everyone in line, but everyone kinda shifted awkwardly. 

I turned around to take a peak at whoever could be so rude, but I think she took this glance as agreement, because she then said, “I really can’t believe they’d let someone like that work customer service.”

Finally, having enough, I told her I really can’t believe she’d be such an asshole in public like that, and that he was just trying to do his job and earn a living. I reminded her everyone in the place had somewhere to be but still seem to keep their comments to themselves. Her face immediately turned five shades of red but she shut up. 

Instead of agreement or an everybody clapped moment, I noticed a couple other people giving me glares. When it was my turn to order the barista was quiet and couldn’t really look at me.

785,Not the A-hole,"My gf (20F) and I (20M) have been together for almost 2 years. In that time I have spent thousands on plane tickets to see her since we did not live in the same state for an entire year. I have paid for her tickets to me, and my tickets to her. Which I am perfectly okay with because I love her and want to be around her.

I have also paid for her mistakes. She ruined a $400 couch once after a drunk night out, I covered that cost since I had the money and she didn’t, this was during the year we were apart and I was working a steady job and she was in university, with no job. I never asked for the money back.

During our visits throughout that year I also financially provided for almost all of her meals while I was in town because she couldn’t afford to eat out. I was fine with all of this.

This year we are at the same university, and see each other on a regular basis. She received a full scholarship and grant this year, so she is extremely financially stable, she actually gets paid to go to university. She has spent thousands on a new macbook, a huge tv, a surround sound system, etc. All things she wanted for herself. She had a laptop, tv and speakers, these new purchases were “upgrades.”

Last week we went out to grab burgers and I was short $3, so she paid for me and immediately ask for her money when we got home. I also broke my leg recently, and spent some time at her place overnight, in that time I finished a container of her ibuprofen, and she expected me to replace the $2 container.

I never spent money on her expecting to be given anything but appreciation in return. Now the roles are flipped. I cannot work because of my broken leg, and she has plenty of extra money because of her scholarship. I dont expect her to shower me with gifts, but it would be nice for her to maybe cover my $3 dollar burger, or instead of spending thousands on luxuries for herself, help me when I’m hurting, like I helped her when she couldn’t fly to me.

790,Not the A-hole,"I write a few days ago asking if I would be the asshole if I told a friend I no longer wanted to work together on a story. 

Long story short: I was working on an HP fanfic, and my friend told me I was changing enough to make it an original story. I was hesitant but agreed. I started bouncing ideas off of her. I kept copies of my original notes, as well as our changes. We disagreed on everything. (The story I want involves a lot of dynamics regarding magical power. I even created the idea of several magical schools divided based on power level. The twist is that the second most prestigious school would be the school for the least powerful as they would specialise in skills such as potions and wand-making which require greater patience and skill rather than raw power. My friend insisted that it would be better if each school had a focus, so they were all equal. She wanted a very egalitarian society, but taking away the power dynamics removes most of my plot.) Eventually, I just lost my inspiration. I couldn’t write anything because this was so far from the story I wanted to write. I went five months without a word. 

A few weeks ago, I stumbled across the old notes while searching for something else. I read the notes - *my* notes, not *ours* and got inspired. I ended up writing five chapters in a month, whereas I’d never managed to write a full scene before on the notes I worked on with her. 


I came on here asking if I would be the asshole. Someone said yes because we were collaborators. Someone said no, but they suggested I tell her instead of simply writing in secret. I took the advice, and we fought. 


My friend was upset but mostly understanding when I said I preferred to work on the story by myself. She asked why, and I said, “We’re writing two different stories. Trying to make them one made me not want to write either.” She took it as me saying *she* made me not want to write. We fought. And I said, “Look, no matter what I came up with, you wanted to change it, no matter what it was. You wouldn’t listen to me, and it got to where I was dreading talking about writing, let alone trying it.” She hasn’t responded to any messages of mine since.

791,No A-holes here,"Recently my husband & I found out that my husband’s brother is getting married next year on Halloween. Word is that the wedding will be in the evening and will probably be child free (which I totally get). Well, this is an issue because we have 2 children (8 and 2), one of which has a birthday on Halloween. My BIL and SIL know this, my husband really feels some kind of way and is saying that we won’t be going, but I’m worried that this will cause a lot of drama.

 
It’s our son’s birthday, and we would not feel right leaving him with a babysitter on his birthday. Yes he’s young and probably won’t remember, but it just doesn’t sit well with us. Plus we want to take our kids out trick-or-treating, even if it was a child friendly wedding, we’d feel bad making them miss out (you can only trick-or-treat some many times in your childhood). Furthermore, the people we would typically have babysit our kids will all be at this wedding.

 
So even though our reasons are not out of spite, I still feel like their feelings will be hurt if we’re not there. My husband is kinda of taking it more personally that his brother made his wedding date our son’s birthday, but I’m aware that Halloween is a popular wedding date and they probably either forgot, or just didn’t care (and it’s their day, I don’t blame them nor do I expect them to change the date). Which is their prerogative, but then they must understand that we’d end up putting our kids first? I love weddings and I love Halloween, and I’d love to go, but I just don’t feel right not being there for my kids on Halloween/their birthday, or causing them to miss out…

 
My husband seems pretty adamant that we won’t be going, and I’m not going to fight with him to change his mind. I love his family and they love me, but at the end of the day I feel like this is his call to make. I just hate the idea of upsetting our family but I don’t feel like anyone is going to be truly happy in this situation. So… would we be the assholes?",66,65,0.89

793,Asshole,"So right now I think my husband is over reacting to what I did but I might as well look for a second opinion.

So, right now i'm in somewhat of a war with my 15 year old son, lets call him Matt. Matt wont eat anything. His diet consists of frozen chicken, frozen pizza, corn dogs, and instant noodles. That's it. I have tried to get him to eat anything, but he refuses. He will occasionally add some kale or spinach to what he's eating but other than that he avoids most foods like the plague.

I try to cook a variety of food for the rest of the family and my two younger kids will eat it up. But Matt will just refuse to and go and usually just cooks for himself and eat in his room. When I try to get him to eat what I cook he will still just sit and wait till we're done and go make himself something.

I'm honestly getting so tired of this. It's like he's a picky toddler again and just ignores me what I tell him he needs to eat more than 4 things. So last night I decided I was done. I put a lock on the freezer and when he asked what was going on Told him that he was eating what i made tonight and that he didn't have an option.

When we all sat down I stood over him and forced him to eat what was on his plate. He got through half of it before he ran to the bathroom and forced himself to throw up to be dramatic.

After he got done he went to his room and hasn't talked to me since. When my husband got home he was furious and told me that I am being im being overbearing and that he is old enough to cook for himself if he wants. He took the key and unlocked the freezer too.

My son won't even look at me and my husband says i'm an ass but I don't think so. I tried to be nice for years and it hasn't worked. If he wants to cook for himself fine, but his diet is awful and I just tried to get him to eat something new for once to show he would like it if he tried. AITA?

Update:

Ok, I will admit what I did was an over reaction. I am an asshole for that. I should have talked to my husband as well. My son still won't talk to me but I think he deserves that for now at least. My husband has talked to him about this issue and I do believe that him throwing up my food was genuine now. From what my son talked about with my husband we will be seeking medical help for a possible eating disorder like many of you have recommended.",677,2056,0.92
794,Not the A-hole,"At work today I had a woman and her adult son come in. I had my hair up in a clip but one errant piece of hair eluded my bobby pins. The son seemed to have a very severe form of retardation. While his mom shopped he walked around making a variety of noises ranging from humming and grunting to cursing and shrieking wordlessly. I have a cousin who was born like this man so none of that bothered me.

However, when I was talking to his mom he kept touching that one piece of hair that was out of my clip. I stepped back a few times but on the third time I asked his mom to get him to stop. The woman apologized and explained he doesnt understand personal space or social cues but she took his hands and held them.

A few minutes later the son broke free and grabbed my hair. This time it all fell out and he just kind of held my hair in his hand while humming. I dont like being touched, especially my hair, but even more so by strangers. It took myself and his mom to detach him. He never hurt me, there was no hair pulling or yanking, I think he just wanted to touch my hair.

That said, i dont get paid enough for this bullshit, empathy and my familiarity none withstanding, and so I asked her to take her son and leave. The woman started crying and defending him, explaining that he doesnt understand, he doesnt mean any harm. I walked her to the door and made sure they left.

My shifted ended and I went home. When I told my roommates about it they said I had been way out of line for kicking them out and that apparently that's discrimination. They got me worried enough that i called my boss. My boss is a very tough, voracious man who does not like people and is always looking for a reason to kick people out of his store.

I’ve been a groomsman a couple times and kept thinking about how great my turn is going to be. Telling your wife that you love her and will care for her forever in front of all of your friends and family is really meaningful to me and a memory I want. My fiancee is aware of this.

My fiancee has anxiety. She’s pretty good at recognizing it and being rational about it even though anxiety definitely bothers her and very obviously affects her behavior. Once we had to go to two of my coworkers’ parties in a row and she spent the second one pretty much hiding until we could leave. She quit therapy after a year because it was expensive and she didn’t think it was helping. She has a take-as-needed medication that helps some.

Even though I wanted a big wedding I was prepared for a medium wedding with just people she knows well. However, she clearly doesn’t want a wedding at all and is just going through the motions for me. She was really quiet when we were visiting venues and I ended up just picking one myself. She hasn’t been involved in anything else about the wedding, which is frustrating because I wanted to share that experience with her but our families and I are handling it. I’ve been telling people that she’s too busy at work to get involved. I asked her if she really wants to get married and she said she does but wants to elope.

She’s clearly going to hate this wedding and she gets sad and distant and a little passive aggressive when I talk to her about stuff like my bachelor party (the bridesmaids are relatives she isn't close to).

A guy decided to sit next to me and poked me (my eyes were closed) and asked, “you tired?” I rolled my eyes at him and told him to please not bother me. 

As my eyes were closed, I could feel him staring at me. I opened my eyes, and sure enough he was looking at me with no shame. I decided to ignore it and pulled my phone out since taking a nap seemed unlikely now. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see him continue to stare. I had enough and told him to stop looking at me because it was making me extremely uncomfortable. He just grinned at me and said he wasn’t doing anything wrong. 

I was so taken aback. Normally, I would have just changed seats but it was morning rush hour and I had no where else to move. He stared at me for the remainder of the ride, even turning his body towards me to get a direct view or something. 

I had enough at this point, so I kind of blew up on him and said that he was a creep and his disability doesn’t excuse his disgusting behaviour. Just because he has special needs doesn’t give him a free pass to creep on unwilling girls on the bus. 

A few people on the bus said I was making a big deal out of nothing and that he was probably just thought I was pretty. I’m sorry, but I don’t give a shit. It’s not cool to subject unwilling strangers to your creepiness. 

I want to add that I was not trying to diagnose this guy. I concluded he had special needs based on the way he was behaving. I don’t think a fully-functioning adult would behave quite this way.

I am 27 male, single dad, very straight, progressive, mostly liberal. Everyone in my friendship and family circle is straight, to my knowledge. I've only dated straight women. 

My unofficial GF is 31 female, no kids, and has a ""fluid sexuality"" (which I thought meant ""bisexual""). She has been in 2 LTRs. I was under impression that they were both with men for over 2 months, but she corrected me last week, and told me they were with women. She always used gender neutral expressions, but I always referred to her exes using male pronouns, and she never corrected me. This inspired some of my current insecurities, but I think I understand her PoV, which was that she wanted us to be more serious before she told me and wanted me to like her for she is and not be affected by the gender of her previous partners. 

&#x200B;

I've known she has a fluid sexuality for almost 2 months now, and it never bothered me. But since she disclosed her ex's gender last week, I've been feeling somewhat bothered/insecure, and I've asked her a lot of weird questions related to her sexuality to ease my mind.

&#x200B;

Some of these questions are:

""When did you start crushing on men"" -- she said ""I've always crushed on men""

""would you date someone you're not physically attracted to?"" --  she said ""no""

""Did you enjoy sex with your male partner (she told me she lost her virginity to a male when she was 19, and he was only 1 of 3 sexual partners)"" -- she said ""yes""   -- Weird question, but I think you guys probably knew my intent. 

&#x200B;

I could never date a woman who is not physically attracted to me, but she's always made comments that indicate that she is sexually (we haven't had sex yet) and physically attracted to me. She tells me that she fantasizes about us fucking in various positions. She also told me that she physically and mentally masturbates to these thoughts (she told me she can orgasm without ever touching herself o.O). But at the same time she said she's a prude.

My parents, however, are very angry at me because I uninvited my cousin Holly(who is 18) because she upset Lucy a few days back.  

Holly is known in the family as the ''miracle baby''. Her parents struggled to conceive for years, and became pregnant very late in life. Unfortunately this also meant that she could do absolutely no wrong in the eyes of her parents (who are in their late sixties). 

Our goldfish died last week and Lucy was absolutely devastated. We had a little funeral for him and buried him in the garden and she has been crying every day. Holly and her parents popped by this weekend, and I warned her that Lucy was very sensitive at the moment and to be gentle with her. What did Holly do? She got her phone out and proceeded to film Lucy, asking her how the fish died, and asking whether we threw him in the bin or flushed him down the toilet. 

Lucy ran into my room screaming and crying, begging me to make Holly go away. I had a go at both her and her parents but Holly was unrepentant. She insisted it was just a joke and that she didn't mean anything by it. At lunch time she looked directly at Lucy and asked if we were having fish and chips for lunch which set her off again. 

This time I told her off for much longer, and told her she was being banned from the wedding for being so cruel. This made Holly cry and she started saying she's got an expensive dress made especially for this wedding and that it wasn't fair to disinvite her for a joke.

My fiancee and I both leave the house for work around 6:30 in the morning.  The dogs have a dog door that they use to go in and out to the backyard.  Neither of us get back until around 6:00 in the evening.  I have no interest in restricting their access to the backyard while they spend most nearly the entire day alone.

We are training them to not bark and not jump on people, and all the other general courtesies dogs should know, but they're puppies and they have a ton of energy.  I have no doubt that they're barking at the other dogs (there's a park right behind our house), but I'm also not interested in doing anything else to keep them quiet, especially since I've been woken up by home improvement projects, mowing, or kids playing outside multiple times.  Am I justified, or am I the asshole and I need to do more to control my dogs?",63,22,0.73
818,Asshole,"Background story: So maybe 15 years ago, my older cousins(14yo at the time) gave me(8yo at the time) a N64 as a christmas gift. I had a lot of fun with it until my parents bought a new console. I kept it because I'd sometimes get nostalic with friends and replay some Pokemon Stadium, Mario Kart or Mario party.

So when I was around 16, I decided to do the same and gave my other cousin (10yo at the time, same grandparents as the first ones but different parents) my GameCube for his birthday so he could have fun with it like I did.

So last Christmas, my older cousins asked me if they could borrow it until next christmas because they wanted to play old games and I said no problem!

I then asked my younger cousin the same for my game cube and he told me he sold it! I didn't really know how to respond to that because in my mind I'd never sell the N64 or the Gamecube if I had kept it. I was arguing with him and his father (my oncle) because I was wondering why he did that. 

I know I can just buy another one but it just felt wrong to me to sell it.

819,Not the A-hole,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",2118,19601,0.93
820,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account for reasons.

Anyways, like the title says. In one of my major specific courses, we're currently doing a semester long group project that is pretty much the entirety of the grade for that class outside of a few quizzes and one or two in class activities. All in all, this project is a make or break if you wanna pass the class. Its so annoying, but what can I do?

Come to find out, we're doing the presentations with some field professionals there to watch and professors from other courses there as well. So, it's shaping up to be a pretty big deal. My professor is doing these presentations on a Friday evening, which wouldn't be too much of a problem except that my older sister's wedding is that same Friday afternoon. Cue freak out. 

I email my professor asking if there's some way I can present it early or later, but she doesn't budge. You must present on the designated date or you will not get points for the presentation. Okay... I ask if there's some way I can make up points outside of that project to help bolster my grade, she once again says no. 

I want to go support my sister so badly, but I live about a 6 hour drive from home and there's pretty much no logistically way I can now be in both places on time. I have a full ride scholarship to this college, which is a pretty big name school, but its on the stipulation that I keep my GPA above a certain mark. If I fail this class, it'll either drop me below that GPA or leave me absolutely no wiggle room for the remaining years of university.    

I'm her maid of honor and I feel so scummy, but I don't think I have the willpower to sacrifice everything I worked for in high school (getting my full ride) just for her wedding. AITA if I don't go to her wedding so I can pass my class?",547,2158,0.97

I don't think we should because we already have a lot of good beer, we don't like IPAs, (so whatever doesn't get drank we won't drink), I don't want to spend the money, and, last but not least, if you complain about free beer you're kind of a jerk.

828,Asshole,"My parents were profoundly musical people. My mother worked in an orchestra and my father was a music highschool teacher. I never remember my dad watching TV or fiddling with knick-knacks, every waking moment of his not at work was playing guitar or playing with me.

They wanted the same of their children and grandchildren: I was forced to take classes as a kid. I relented so much, I guess they just gave up. I'd rather just play videogames or watch movies. They were never happy with this but relented.

The thing is that I regret immensely giving it all up. I tried to pick up nylon guitar 10 years ago and I just couldn't get anywhere with it: I think everyone would agree your formative youth years are the best time to learn an instrument. Playing videogames or watching movies didn't translate well into my adulthood: I have no talent for anything because I just didn't care as a kid.

They left me a trust to be used specifically for music classes for any of my children. When they passed, I had none, but now I have a 7 year old daughter. As per my parents wishes, I got her into classes. The trust is not handled by me, it's by a lawyer paid directly to a school/instructor, and the size of the trust is literally like 20 years worth of classes. It's impressively large but has a narrow application. Any instrument, however. This is a ""use it or lose it"" type scenario, I can't access the funds at all other than for the purpose of music classes.

But my daughter hates it. She chose violin when she was 4, stuck with it until she was 6, then switched to piano, then guitar, then saxophone, now back to violin because of her own admission, she liked it the most. But she still doesn't like it. She sometimes cries when I drop her off and will be crying when I pick her up.

I don't want to be that parent who ""knows whats best for their kid and by God she'll take violin classes"" if you know what I mean, but I don't want this opportunity squandered. If I knew my own thoughts now as a little kid, I would kill for this opportunity. But I gave it up, my ship has sailed. I don't want my daughter to make the same mistake.

For what it's worth, my husband is for either outcome. He doesn't want the money to go to waste but feels for our daughter. We're trying to make compromises, bribing her to go to class (how unreal that sounds to type out) but she still hates it. But she's also only 7: she might learn to like it and genuinely want to go once she's acclimated to it more.

830,Not the A-hole,"Kind of a weird one but I feel extremely guilty about this but still indignant. TLDR at the bottom.

Background: I'm the eldest of 4, the only adult sibling and I dont live with my family. My siblings are 5, 9 and 13, I'm 21. All male, except myself. I suffer from anxiety about cleanliness and struggle being around children because of how unclean they are. 

I recently stayed with my family for the weekend and one of my brothers was very ill. I recieved a call today from my family basically telling me that one of my brothers has an awful illness and now we all need to take medicine for it and if we have it, need to take time off work (I work with food).

I didnt take this very well. I was extremely angry and aggressive over the phone and ended up hanging up. Every time I visit, there is always a catastrophe - heavy flus, huge flea infestations in their house (my cat is terribly allergic to flea bites so I cant take them home), skin infections etc. Their hygiene is terrible. They never disinfect anything and their response to me being upset about the lack of handwashing is always a variation of 'boys will be boys'.

I guess for me it was a final straw - I know its nobody's fault and that I shouldnt of flipped out so much, but the amount of money they've cost me via medicine for my cat that they apparently cant afford to cover for me (yet they buy and drink ridiculous quantities of alcohol every day) due to flea infestations is beyond insane, not to mention me now possibly having to take unpaid leave from work. This could all of been avoided if they taught their kids basic hygiene and bothered cleaning their house.

I called after to apologise for the upset but I really still feel indignant about it.

TLDR: I stayed with family, got a call saying my brother was very and now may potentially get sick and pay lots of money for medicine I cant afford. I got angry on the phone and upset my family as a result. AITA?

EDIT: Thanks for all your thoughts and opinions. I spoke to my mother again and we had a chat about the state of things. My family were upset because they felt like I had been over the top and on reflection I agree that I was. Some hurtful things were said about my feelings towards cleanliness and on further discussion we've all agreed to be more understanding of each other's situation - them with the fact they have children and they're going to be sick, and myself with the fact that I find it difficult to cope with the anxiety of being ill/unclean :)",23,56,0.85

832,Not the A-hole,"I was best friends with this girl since basically forever. She has always been promiscuous and has a questionable past when it’s come to relationships. To make a long story short, I caught her at a party in the bathroom with her ex, who she is still obsessed with. Like despite dating her new boyfriend (for almost a year) she still talks and hangs out with her ex regularly. Anyway, in the bathroom she had her shirt hiked up and the ex had her against the wall, and they were really close. I asked what was going on and they just kind of lamely deflected the question. Later in the party I saw her all in her ex’s lap and he was rubbing her thigh. 

A few days later I finally told her current boyfriend, who is also my really close friend. She later texted me claiming that “everything was my fault” and that “i’m jealous” and i let her ex “take advantaged of her” (despite the fact that they kissed sober once while she was dating her current boyfriend).

&#x200B;

We get off the plane, he starts complaining how it was too far away and his foot was bothering him. He points out another restaurant, I asked if he wanted to go there instead. He says no. As we are walking more, I told him I wasnt married to that other restaurant and if he sees something else he likes along the way to pick that one. He says no, he wants to go where I want to eat. He complains more, I offer to take bags from him as he was carrying most of it, he says no. 

&#x200B;

We get separated in the crowd, I thought he was right behind me, but I turn around and hes not there. I start to wait, but then I see the restaurant is about 30 steps further so I go ahead and wait outside there next to the menu. He comes up and starts to bitch about me ditching him. I apologize and explained the restaurant was so close I thought it was ok to wait here. He told me I did it on purpose and I was really insensitive to his foot pain.

&#x200B;

 We are looking at the menu, usually we brainstorm toddler dishes, I mention they don’t have anything for toddler and he gets angry and storms off saying we walked all this way for nothing  and how Im insensitive to his pain, I told him I felt like I was giving him options to accommodate his pain but he refused them. 

&#x200B;

I say we need to get toddler food. He says ‘fine go get her food then!’ I point out the bistro nearby and start to head over. I look back and he’s still at the other spot. I was picking stuff out when I realized I didn’t have my phone or wallet. I start searching for him, toddler in tow, circling around for over 30 min. Finally decide to head back to our gate.  We see each other about half way to the gate, Before I can say anything, he starts laying into me about how I abandoned him and did this all on purpose. I ask why would I abandon him when he has all my stuff and I felt like he had done that to me since he was so pissed at me. He doesnt understand why I stayed over in that area looking for him for so long. I felt like he must not have even looked for us long because I was right where I said I’d be and was only there for under 10 min.

&#x200B;

I say I’m sorry that this happened I understand I fucked up, but we both messed up in this. He refuses to believe that saying I was disgusting for not being able to take all the blame since this was all my fault. I told him I felt we shared equal blame. He stops talking to me. We get on the plane and I get two texts from him saying he really hated me right now and that he could not find one good reason to love me, this is the worst day of our marriage. We get home, he sleeps on the couch.

&#x200B;

In the words of Inigo Montoya ...Let me explain, no there is too much...let me sum up:

&#x200B;

My sister and I have never been really close. We recently got into a fight but I'm unsure of exactly what I did wrong. I’ve made moves towards making amends. She has not spoken to me in almost a month despite my repeated bids for communication (via text, snail mail, calling). We’ve had fights over the years, she is one to hold a grudge, I am not.

&#x200B;

Background is that she and my mom threw my shower and bachelorette party without involving me when I asked. It just wasn’t my style (I’m more laid back). It was a MESS for various reasons. It was supposed to be a couple’s shower, invite only had my name. It was poorly executed. The invite wasn’t clear, none of my fiance’s friends showed up. I felt as though I acted appropriately at the shower, I had a breakdown at the bachelorette party.

I have a seizure disorder I can’t really drink as a result. My sister told everyone to bring my favorite wine. I now have 15 bottles of it. We had to pack up my car and someone asked me what to do with all the wine so I sarcastically said “Put it in my basement since it will take me 12 years to drink” and it was insinuated I was ungrateful “because a lot of people have worked to do something nice for me”. Just because I don’t like the details of something doesn’t mean I’m not grateful for the effort extended. I take and have taken full responsibility for what actions I did that made me the asshole in this situation even if I feel 99% of it could have been avoided in the first place had I been part of the planning. I feel there were things I could have handled better & I have since apologized for those things. 

I have sent my sis and her husband a thank you card for everything they got us at the shower. I sent her a separate letter of thanks detailing all the things I liked and appreciated about the shower/bachelorette party and her efforts. I have sent multiple text pictures of the things they gave us set up in our house or with me using them.

She has said nothing. RADIO SILENCE. We have never been the best of buds and I have expressed fears in the past that she would ruin my wedding day. She might show up and be fine but if she's not deep down I'm going to pick up on that and her passive aggressive silent treatment will fuck up my day/possibly ruin it. My mom is all ""the only person who gives her the power to do that is you"" but like I can't help it. I carry people's emotions.

I left a voicemail saying ""hey its me, I really don't like that we're not talking right now so I'd like to get together and talk this out, please call me back."" 

It's been a week since the VM. Fiance said to call again and if no call back, revoke her invite bc she made her bed.

Bit of context, I am 28 [M] studied away from home at University, met my now wife at University and moved to a different part of the country after University to start a life together.
She comes from a place about 350 miles from my hometown.
During the final year of my studies my dad was diagnosed with and lost the battle to cancer, leaving just my mum and 1 older brother.

I have lived away for 5 years now and in that time I have got my first house and got married, in those 5 years my brother has visited me twice with my mum and my mum came a 3rd time alone. I travel down to see them roughly 4-5 times a year.

My brother has a big house and invites his family over for Christmas each year, I am the only one who lives a long way away and myself and my mum are the only members from our side of the family. Sister in law has a bit family.

A few years ago my brother text me and said I know you have to travel a long way and I know you don't have much time here but we are struggling for cash so need some help with the food and drink. My partner and I work right up to Christmas Eve and travel down Christmas Eve night. We bought a few crates of beer and some bottle of spirits and sent them some money for the food as a gesture of goodwill. That's what family's do. My brother's house although big is near derelict and the room we stayed in had no curtains or blinds, no heating, and holes in the floorboards. But hey ho it's family right?

Last year the money and alcohol was not asked for but was expected, it's fine, we take gifts wherever we go to visit.

Fast forward to this year, again invited for Christmas. This time there is a private crowdfund page that has been set up for all family participants to donate too for the Christmas festivities. We have strict instructions that we are not to buy presents for each other and only buy presents for the kids (we don't have children and neither do any of the members going, only my brother has kids).
I have said I'm not going this year as I was planning on spending Christmas with my in laws and now I'm being questioned as to why I don't want to spend Christmas with my brother's family.

I’m not going to do anything to the baby, but I will voice my disapproval to this whole situation. A lot. Anyways, into both sides. 

Sisters Side: 
. She is admittedly taking better care of herself now that she is pregnant. She actually eats food, she stoped drinking, and she is a lot more careful. 
. My mother has said multiple times that when women are pregnant, they change, and become better people (usually) [anyone who can give me some feedback on this situation would be greatly appreciated] 
. She also has gone on record as to say this kid was not planned. 
. She has said that no matter what, she is going to stick by this kid, come hell or high water. 

My side: 
. She can barely take care of her animals. Her two cats barely get fed by her (we almost always do it) and she never cleans their litter box. (Just cleaned it yesterday. It hadn’t been cleaned in about a month+ I’m guessing). 
. She also is currently with a man who just screams “I’m going to dodge child support WHEN, not IF I leave you”. 
. She can’t support herself, let alone a child, and is making us support her. I have repeatedly brought this up to her, admittedly sometimes in harsh ways (nothing physical, only verbal). 
. I also have autism, and the various noises the kid will make is going to make my life a living hell. She says she will not be at our house often, but she has nowhere else to go besides the aforementioned BF. 

This is going to sound shallow, I’ll admit, but I hate children. Too many reasons that are unrelated to this post. But I know I’m going to have to help out with this kid. My parents have assured me that I won’t have to help out as “it’s not my business” but they said the exact same things word for word when we got chickens and again when we got the previously mentioned cats.

850,Asshole,"My fiancé is in love with the idea of a large, lavish wedding. 

We debated back and forth about just how large or lavish considering we’re both still in student debt and living in a crappy rented studio apartment. 

I know the wedding is really more her day than mine because she’s been focused on the ceremony of it all for a lot longer, so after back and forth we agreed she could set the budget for the wedding but we couldn’t go into debt for it (yes, she was really considering this. The wedding has really pulled the wool over her usually very fiscally responsible eyes.) 

We ended up deciding on a budget that was larger than what I was comfortable with, but with the caveat that she would allocate half and I would allocate the other half. 

After going to a bunch of cake tasting and looking at many venues, I decided to put 20% of my portion of the budget towards her dream dress about 80% of my half towards buying us a house. 

She is insisting I spend it on the wedding. 

I am resolute that this is, in the long run, what will actually make us both happiest. 

Her parents are relieved I’m doing this. They hate the neighborhood we live in. 

But tonight my mom said “you’re being an asshole” and it made me realize I should post specifically to here. She thinks it’s low of me to use budgeting we technically agreed to spend on the wedding and use it for something else, even if I’m sure in the long run it’ll make my soon to be wife happier.

851,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I'm 19M living with my younger sister (14) and my mom (45).

My parents got divorced 3 years ago. That was kind of shocking for me, even though I wasn't technically a child anymore. They never even argued and I didn't see it coming.

Well my dad came out as bisexual last year, when he also got a boyfriend. I don't know if that was the reason for their divorce. My mom says it's complicated and they always beat around the bush when they try to discuss the why's with us.

I'm still trying to accept my dad's dating someone new. It's weird enough seeing him with someone else, without the fact that it's another male. Not only that, but practically a boy.

See, my dad's 47 years old and his boyfriend's only 3 years older than me: 22.

The one time I accidentally ran into my dad's boyfriend, when they came over to drop off something for mom, we had a really awkward conversation. We realized we attended the same course at the local uni. Different groups, so we never met then, but that was still weird af for me.

Normally when my dad asks me to come hang out when his boyfriend's around, I find some excuse. However he recently confronted me about avoiding the two of them and I told him the truth.

I feel uncomfortable because a) I feel like a bunch of difficult things happened all of a sudden without me having time to process it and b) his boyfriend being that close to me in age makes everything so much weirder.

My dad wasn't really happy. He always starts talking about everything he does for us, the money he pays for tuition etc. when personal problems come up or when we argue.

852,Not the A-hole,"So, my girlfriend runs a retail store with a global footprint. They have been known to use sweatshops, and I recently discovered they never hire anybody full-time because then they would have to provide benefits.

I brought up to her that no, I won't buy from your store, because I dont support what they stand for, and she called me an asshole for not supporting her store. She missed her budget by $500 and wanted me to buy $500 worth of merchandise to return at a later date, just so she would hit budget.

Now, the company has been downhill for a while, so I also have a financial investment against them. Granted, one store wouldnt impact that, but she thinks I didn't do it based on my ""bet against them"", and believes I personally did her wrong ""out of spite"".

853,Not the A-hole,"Ok so this happened several years ago and a story on another sub remind me of it and now I keep thinking about it so figured I would share.

Little backstory I used to be a rather devout Christian but I was also getting an engineering degree and love to read scientific articles. I know a lot of random facts and hate it when people misappropriate facts. My cousin posted an article about how science was proving the existence of God. As I said I was a Christian so keep that in mind.

The article was a mess. It kept quoting articles that I've read inappropriately and just all around picking out partial sentences and using it all to build their complete bs case.

So I gave my cousin links to all the articles they where quoting and gave a little summery of each. She thanked me for showing her the truth about science so I was rather proud of myself. Then her dad gets on and starts saying how I'm worshipping satan and how he is going to pray for my salvation since I ""don't believe in our savior"" getting my very religious birth mom in involved. It's a mess.

I never forgot and so when about a year later he posted some very offensive homophobic crap I used quotes from the bible and just ripped him apart. Idk how but it even got political and I destroyed him with facts there too. It was a glorious destruction.

At the end I even told him that I would pray for his salvation.

Several of my family thought that I went too far. I told them that I refused to be a part of a group that purposefully ignored their own doctrine in favor of twisting it into a pack of lies and calling it the truth just because it came out of their book. I told them that if they where ok with that then they didn't worship God they worshiped a book.

After that I haven't set a foot in a church, nor spoken to several members of my family.

Did I go too far?",105,461,0.89
854,Not the A-hole,"A little over a month ago I moved into a new place with a few of my friends as roommates, however we went in blind with one of the roommates.

Biggest mistake we could have made.

The guy was everything you don’t want in a roommate. Messy, loud, obnoxious, had no concept of personal space. Not to mention he literally smelled worse than any person I have smelled in my life, and would never shower. Our couch in the living room literally reeks from him spending time on it. 

He also gave off a really intrusive/untrustworthy vibe. He would walk into my room without asking, and look at/pick up my stuff, fiddle with it, and ask suspicious questions. 

Well, last week was when things went down. Kyle, we’ll call him, left like he often does, to go visit his girlfriend. Shortly after he leaves, my roommate notices his debit and credit cards missing from his wallet. Kyle had stolen things from us before (albeit small things), so he was an immediate suspect. 

Well, long story short, after my roommate canceled the card, we got video evidence of Kyle using my roommates card to buy an absurd amount of tobacco products from the store. 

We contact the police and file a report, and they tell us to contact them immediately if he shows back up. 

A week went by, and we began to think he wasn’t planning on coming back. We didn’t think he’d be that dumb, but then again, he left all of his valuables behind. 

Fast forward to about 4 hours ago, our wonderful roommate Kyle walks back inside the house more cheerful than ever, acting as if everything is great. We play it cool and call the cops without him knowing. They show up, and charge him with credit fraud and theft, but because he cooperates so well, they don’t arrest him or take him into custody. 

Now we had started the process to evict him a week earlier, but the management had still not finished it.

We were hopeful that he wouldn’t want to stay here, since... you know... we called the cops on him and got him in trouble with the law, and were in the process of evicting him. 

Nope.

He waltz’s back inside the apartment like nothing had happened, greeting each one of us, walking into our rooms, etc. I lost it here, and told him to get out.

So now we have a roommate who has been charged with theft of our belongings, obviously isn’t trustworthy and knows we are pissed at him, living in our house with us. 

About an hour ago he announced to us that he was going to the apartment complexes pool to go swimming (thank goodness, maybe some of the stink will wash off). When he left I locked the door with a new code, and I have no intention of letting him back in.

I don’t want him back inside our place for obvious reasons, including my personal safety. 

Sorry if this story isn’t coherent. I’ve had to delete a couple parts to keep it under 3000 characters.

What do you guys think?


TLDR: My roommate stole from us and came back like nothing happened. I locked him out. AITA?

Edit: I should mention that it was the apartment complex management that changed the code on our door after we complained. I’m going to bed so if nobody is awake to open the door for him, I’m not actually physically locking him out.

Edit 2: Well, I let him ring the doorbell and bang on the door for about 10 min, and then he just broke in, so I guess either way he was getting inside. Oh well.",30,69,0.93

856,Asshole,"Bit of background: My son (16) plays a lot of games, and through a lot of thought we decided to let him have the office space downstairs for gaming (he talks to his friends on microphone and wanted a place to be able to talk loudly). His bedtime is 12:00pm on weekend, in bed at 10 and lights outa 10:30 on weekdays. Today I went upstairs to sleep early and stayed awake until I heard him come upstairs into his room. At 10:00 I started to text and call him to no response so I started to think he was still downstairs. Eventually at 10:45 he came up and I was by this time pretty mad. I told him that he had broken my trust as well has 
telling him that I won’t be able to trust him with other things if he can’t keep to the commitment of bedtimes. He responded saying that “it was one time” and “I don’t know why you are making such a big deal about it”.

857,Not the A-hole,"Bought a $300 4k TV. We got home and I noticed a small dent/cut in the middle back of the box. I thought it's probably nothing and I could always return it if there were any problems. You couldn't tell until it was turned on, but when we did it was completely shattered. Especially in the middle where the box dent was. I loaded it into my own car, and there was nothing to cause the dent anywhere, kept it vertical - although it was a snug fit.

I called the next morning, they said no problem, bring it back for an exchange. 

Brought it back and the cust service woman is nice enough, takes it out and plugs it in. She had  a coworker come look, then they got the manager. The manager looked and left for a minute. Then came back with the news I knew was coming seeing as how long it was taking: ""We can't do anything for you because our employee checked the box before it left the store - so the dent must have happened after that. We can give you a discount on a new TV"". I told her to check the cameras from last night and show me there is no dent in the box I received. If no dent I'll gladly leave with the broken TV. Of course she declined, saying they don't do that with customers. At this point I was losing it. The other employees stared at the ground. I got into an argument tone, but not yelling. A couple lines I dropped were ""So you're calling me a liar? Your employee doesn't make mistakes?"" And ""why would I not shop at Amazon and have it delivered to my door for the same price? There would be no questions if it arrived damaged."" She said I could call corporate or see another manager, which one would I like? I said both, get me the other manager. They prob knew I was staying at that counter until the police take me out.

A couple mins later she comes back, says they have a new policy and they will exchange it for a new TV, because they can't prove it wasn't damaged before leaving the store. I accepted, but was still pissed that I had to get pissed for them to do what they should have done from the start. I made them open the new TV and turn it on right in front of me (should have been done the first time). I don't like getting nasty, but if I remained a gentlemen I'd be out $300. If it was $1000 tv I may have jumped over the counter.",65,206,0.95
858,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I seriously need advice on who’s the asshole in this situation.

I’m currently in college and I live in an apartment-style suite. The suite has 3 double rooms and a common living room area. The roommate I got assigned to has been rather rude with me from the get-go; when i introduced myself she never told me her name until i asked her what it was 2 days later, I say hello to her whenever I walk in the room and she never says hello back, she generally never speaks or responds to me in any way whatsoever. She for some reason is also very passive aggressive; whenever my morning alarm goes off (around 9am), she shoots out of bed, stares at me and grunts.

The first week of school, she told me she wanted to set some ground rules for rooming together. She told me she doesn’t want me to have my boyfriend overnight (understandable, and when he came to visit I booked a hotel because I know that someone can be uncomfortable with that), and that if I have female friends over to sleep, she has to know 2 days in advance. She also mentioned that she is a very light sleeper, so I shouldn’t take calls in the room after 8pm because she easily wakes up. 

Now, these rules seemed kind of harsh to me, especially since my friend, who I roomed with last semester was the complete opposite of that and didn’t care. However, I respected the fact that she’s a quiet person and followed these rules; I’m rarely in the room anyways, besides when I’m sleeping. 

For the past few weeks, my best friend comes over to the suite around 6pm after class, and we usually order food and watch netflix or do work with some of the other girls who also live in the suite. Around 8pm, I’ll get a text from my roommate, who - everyday - tells me she’s probably gonna go to bed early. The door to our room is completely shut, and her bed is on the far corner of our room which is rather large, so the living room and her side of the room are pretty far away from each other. We’ve even done a sound check to see if the sound from the laptop is loud from where her bed is, and we’ve made sure it’s not. 

Despite all this, after the text message, around 9:30-10:30pm, she always comes out the room pissed, telling us to “please keep it down or turn it off because she’s a light sleeper”. Our whole suite is awake at that time, and we’re all doing work or talking or watching a show, but not at an unreasonably loud volume. 

These past days, she’s been doing it more and more, and now she even told my friend who was talking on the phone in the living room to “go outside” because she was apparently being too loud, at 9pm.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for being mad at my roommate for continuously telling me and my friends to be quiet?

EDIT: So, I’m seeing a lot of comments about a lot of different factors coming into play here, so I just wanted to clear stuff up:

1. For everyone saying that I need to have a civil, good relationship with my roommate, i tried; I was the one to introduce myself, I asked her what she’s studying etc. etc., I told her that even though she has a problem with my friends staying over I don’t have any problem with her bringing her friends over (which she does). On the other hand, she never says hi to me or my friends, she barely ever looks at me and she never bothered to ask anything about me, ever. In fact, when my boyfriend was in the room briefly one afternoon so i could pick up some stuff, he introduced himself and attempted to shake her hand, and she just stared at him.

2. The option of going to a common room somewhere else on campus or staying at a friends room is also much more difficult; The only friend I have who doesn’t live in our suite lives across campus in a triple room without a common room. In addition, any common areas/spaces outside of my building are 10 mins walking distance at the least, and a lot of them are quiet spaces/study spaces. 

3. At my college, it’s very easy to receive medical housing for any type of fatigue issue/health issue that might be affecting her; She has never mentioned any health issue or problem and a lot of the times, she has friends come over to our room, so I don’t think her problem is a lack of friends or a big medical problem that requires her to have complete silence in the whole suite from 9pm.

All in all, I apologize if it seems like I’m not open to your opinions and am just forcing it to seem like I need validation that i’m NOT the asshole. It’s just really frustrating to me but I am conflicted about whether or not I am in the wrong, so I know if I should ask her to get earplugs or deal with it in some other way.",129,289,0.96

860,Not the A-hole,"So my mom and dad got a messy divorce when i was 11. I'm 20 now. The divorce was bad. The living situation ended up being myself and my two brothers (now 18M and 16M) do alternating weeks at moms and dads. First few years were totally fine.

At some point, my dad started getting bad. He would manipulate my therapists. He took myaelf and my brothers to family therapy in an attempt to manipulate us. His mother would berate me about everything. It started getting worse. Dad started to threaten to kick me out. Found excuses to ground me and take away my coping mechanisms. He wouldn't feed me and told me I didn't deserve the priviledge that is food. Food in his house wasn't a right and I was lucky to get it. I called my mom every single his week crying.

Summer after high school graduation came along and I got a job near my mom so I could live with her all summer. It worked and I got happier. Once I moved to college I only came home to see him if I needed to. Summer after that worked the same job near mom. Summer after that (the past few months) I worked a job near school. I've finally been happy.

 Her mother follows her and waits outside the door until she’s done. No stalls have been emptied during this. Once she’s done, her mother took her turn, holding up the line about a minute more.

881,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been married for nearly a decade. I wouldn’t say it has been an “easy” marriage but then I’m sceptical that there are any and before now I had never felt our commitment to one another has wavered. 

We did take a temporary break about 3 years ago due to a difficult situation in his family and the accompanying stress. It was over MIL being invasive to the point that she’d call my husband when he and I were in bed together and ask “is OP there? Because I need to talk” and they’d go and have secret chats. I felt quite betrayed which caused us to fight and eventually husband asked me to leave our home.

I did so but it was clear neither of us had our heart in a separation and we’ve reconciled. 

During our separation I was told by a mutual friend that his estranged brother had separated from his wife. I told husband this during a weekend we spent together during our separation. I swore him to secrecy because I didn’t want it to come back that it was me who had informed him (very tricky family dynamic on his side of the family) but I felt he should know because it’s his brother. 

Today we were talking about this and husband informed me that he won’t guarantee to keep things secret. He did tell MIL about his brother because “they’re family”. My argument is that he and I are family too. Im not really bothered about him sharing that particular matter (his brother’s separation) but I feel it’s an important principle that I am able to talk to him freely.

He says he won’t keep things I say confidential if he doesn’t want to and I should trust his judgment on who he tells. This isn’t how I understand confidentiality, for example if close friends confide in me I would never tell anyone else (including husband). Isn’t that being trustworthy?

Personally I believe that, as spouses, we should be able to tell each other things and expect confidentiality. I don’t sit and chat with my family about our sex life for example and I feel he has no business sharing the state of my mind/health/secrets with his.

He said he won’t keep secrets from his family and I told him I can’t trust him if he will share anything i say when he wants to. I don’t understand how we can have open and honest communication if I never know who is going to know who’ll know what’s been said.

882,Asshole,"I had a one night stand 2 months ago with a guy I met at a bar when I was out with my friends. We hit it off but during our chit chat we both mentioned that we’re not looking for relationships which is great.
We agreed to head back to his place for some NSA fun and that was that. Left the next morning exchanged numbers but I never contacted him and he never contacted me.

Present day I find out I’m pregnant. It’s for sure his because he was my only sexual encounter in the last 4 months. I am ecstatic because I was told by countless doctors that I may never be able to conceive because of my aggressive endometriosis.
THIS WAS NOT PLANNED. I didn’t try to trap the guy or get someone to knock me up. I honestly didn’t think I could get pregnant because my ex and I didn’t use any method for 4 years and nothing.
I’m happy to be having this baby because I always wanted kids and I was pretty sure I was going to end up adopting. I am not looking for child support and I’m financially in a great place, great job, I own my own home and work is taken care of even during maternity leave.
I told a couple of my closest friends and even though they’re happy with me one friend is really pissed off because I have no plans of telling my ONS about the pregnancy. I don’t want or need child support and I’m pretty sure he’s happy living his bachelor life since he made it clear he’s not looking for any commitments and a child is like the biggest commitment there is. 
I can definitely tell this wasn’t his first ONS rodeo and he likes what he does.
I’m also not really looking to co-parent with someone that I don’t know anything about or want a relationship with.
I know this sounds harsh but I’m kind of looking at it like a sperm donor situation. I made it clear to her that I would never do anything malicious or try to pin child support on him at a later date.",644,594,0.89

My younger sister (25f) and her husband had three kids very young. I love them like family but my partner (35m) and I (29f) are currently child free by choice.  We both have good jobs and work a lot and really appreciate our rare time off together.  Neither of us particularly like children or the stress and mess that comes with them. But family is family and recently my sister and I agreed to spend more days together with the kids so I could get to know them more as they grow up. I've enjoyed days as a group where I can enjoy the kids company but my sister and BIL can parent. I treat them to things, play games and make them laugh, it's fun but it's exhausting and it reinforces my decision to be child free. I appreciate getting to spend time with my niece and nephews though. 

She's asked me to baby sit for her a few times overnight while she and BIL have a night out with her parent friends who usually babysit but everytime I've refused. I honestly just don't want to and I think that's my right. She's hinted that I don't deserve to spend time with them at all if I can't look after them alone and has threatened to stop me seeing them at all if I won't baby sit. If it were to help them out in a pinch I would happily do it but she's a full time Mum and I don't want to spend a day stressed and scared looking after three kids on my weekend.  AITA

They (aunt, uncle, son (14M), daughter (11F)) are very Christian and superstitious. They believe in casting out demons, and they anoint us with oil and don’t allow any video games or modern tv. They think it will let evil into the house. They drag me to church two times a week, and it’s like a weird one where they speak in tongues. I don’t want to disrespect their beliefs, but it’s really not my kind of thing. 

I really enjoy reading fantasy books, and I liked watching those kind of movies too before I moved here. Yesterday, my aunt found out I had a copy of City of Bones and a few other books like that, and she lost her shit. She burned them in this fire pit thing they have, and now she want to do regular inspections of my room. 

I was obviously pissed, so after she went to bed, I took ketchup from the fridge and drew a pentagram on the bathroom mirror (supposed to look like blood lmao). I also wrote names of random demons I knew around it, along with the phrase “we will eat your soul.” 

Needless to say, they lost their minds. And they called my other aunt to come get me. My aunt hadn’t said a word to me, and she’s anointing every doorway in their place. My uncle made me wipe it off and he called me some not very Christian words. 

AITA for doing the prank?

Edit: for the people saying that my mom is an asshole for leaving me...she didn’t really have a choice. My mom is in rehab right now unfortunately. If she didn’t go she would have to serve time.

Edit again: thanks to everyone who commented or messaged me — there are lots of nice people in this sub. My other aunt picked me up, and she’s gonna find out if my mom will let me stay at her place.

Last edit: to update you all, I’m hopefully staying with my other aunt until my mom gets back. Thanks to all the people who offered to replace my books— I appreciate you all. I only had five in total burned though, and my aunt is working on getting my religious aunt to give me money to replace them.

885,Asshole,"I was at a grocery store over the weekend that had massive sales. It’s a moderate size grocery store that I believe is a regional chain. There were no spaces in the parking lot and carts were very far and few between. 

As I was walking into the store, there was a lone cart that someone just left. I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe. When I turn around, a man in his 50s sniped my cart. As a note, I am a man in my 30s. 

I saw it happen and said excuse me sir that was my cart. He said “there was no one here when I got here so it’s mine actually” and shrugged and walked away. I was extremely annoyed because there was no carts. I also anticipated a large order so I needed a cart and a basket would not be sufficient 

I decided to follow the man around the store. He began to put items in the cart. When he got to an aisle, he turned his back, walked about 20 feet away to look at something. I saw this as an opportunity.. he had maybe 5 items in the cart, all small food items. I took the cart and began to walk backwards. He turned around and began screaming at me. I stared at him and continued walking backwards. Then, I gently took his items out and put them on the shelf. He began to yell and said it was his cart. I responded, just as he had to me, that “there was no one here when I got here actually, it is actually mine now”. 

He lost it. I ignored him and began shopping. I calmly got my meats and he was berating me. A few customers noticed and the manager came out. He took both our statements and ended up getting a cart that he found in the parking lot and brought it to the man.

My brother and his wife have a beautiful 4 year old son and I love him to death. He's a great kid. My brother and SIL are pretty alright parents for the most part, but they are slobs and there house is very dirty. I'm not talking just cluttered and messy. It's filthy. Dirty dishes piled up and left everywhere for months, garbage everywhere, rotting food, clothes on the floor, diapers left laying about, dog pee left on the floor until it dries there, etc. They don't sweep, vacuum or mop. They don't wipe counters or clean up spills. The bathroom is so nasty, they don't clean the toilet or nephews training potty. It is so unsanitary and gross that I can't even stand being in their house. Several times I have come over to clean their house and cleaned it completely. I'm a former maid for very rich people, so when I say cleaned I mean freaking spotless. Spent 18+ hours each time cleaning it. And the next time I come over it's a freaking mess again. I've talked to them several times about how unacceptable this is, I've written out basic cleaning schedules, lectured them on how they need to do better for their son. I've told them that they a negligent and that if they don't get their shit together they could lose their son. But I can't seem to get it through their thick skulls. They show no signs of changing. My nephew deserves a better life than this. I've given them so many chances, I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm seriously debating calling CFS on them. They'd probably get a warning and have someone come regularly check in on them to make sure they are taking care of nephew properly. Worst case, and probably equally likely, they'll take nephew away. He's likely be taken in by his grandma on SILs side, or his other grandma my mom. Either would provide a better life for him. But there's a chance he'd be taken away completely. I'd feel like an asshole ratting my brother and SIL out. He's not being abused, he's fed and healthy. But the unsanitary conditions he has to live in are not ok. WIBTA?",66,108,0.95

892,Not the A-hole,"So, yeah, the title isn’t great, but... hear me out.

Let me begin by saying that I’m in a friend group where almost all of us (including myself) are LGBT+, and a handful of us (not including myself) are also somewhere on the gender spectrum. Trans, non-binary, gender-fluid, etc.

I’m not any of those things, but I have made it my goal to completely educate myself and become aware of what it means to have different gender pronouns, so I can understand it at least close to as much as I understand the sexuality spectrum.

My point is, I’m trying hard to be an accepting and loyal friend.

So, here’s where the potential asshole part comes in.

I have a transgender friend who goes by she/her pronouns now, which obviously is completely fine. I’m female as well, and we’ve always been pretty close. Recently, though, she’s started to give me a very hard time about addressing one of my other friends as “she/her.” 

This friend identifies as gender-fluid, and from the very beginning she’s said that she doesn’t care what pronouns we call her by, since on any given day she could feel any of them. She was born a female, and until she told us this that’s how we’d known her, so she’s perfectly happy with us calling her “she/her,” and sometimes “they/them,” at our leisure.

Recently, my transgender friend has been correcting EVERYONE in my friend group when we use “she/her,” opting instead to demand harshly that we use “they/them.” She’s done this to all of us, including the gender-fluid girl’s PARTNER, and she’s always incredibly rude and insistent about it.

Since we’re all in the same friend group, this happens pretty often. It even happens in front of the gender-fluid friend, who has already assured everyone that “she/her” is fine.

Some of my friends have given up, and have switched to “they/them” pronouns. Maybe out of spite or maybe out of confusion, I’ve stuck with “she/her,” because... why shouldn’t I? The friend doesn’t care, it’s just this random other friend who apparently does. None of us misgender my transgender friend (even though we previously knew them for basically our whole lives as a male), so I don’t understand where this aggression even comes from.

Reddit, help me out here... should I convert to different pronouns to satisfy my trans friend? Or am I being an asshole for ignoring her?",33,74,0.83

I have been doing a lot of reflection on my actions over the past months since my post, including taking into account all of the advice I was getting from my last post.

I have decided to get therapy (which I probably should have done a long time ago I acknowledge) and work on my issues so I can start to be the father to Jack that he deserves but never had.

I reached out to him a few days ago to express this to him and he said that while he appreciates that I’m trying, it’s going to take him a long time to get over all the bullshit I put him through but that he is willing to try. 

He is honestly such an amazing kid and even though his mom and I don’t get along at all, I will say she did good in raising him. 

We have a plan to talk every other day on the phone along with some in person visits and if he feels up to it, I would like to invite him and his boyfriend out for dinner sometime.

895,Not enough info,"My mother is remarried to a guy that my brother, sister and I don't like. She's known how we feel about him pretty much their entire relationship. My brother has a 2 year old, a 6 month old, my sister has 1.5 year old twins, and I have a 1 year old. We refer to this guy by his name only, and make sure to correct ANYONE who thinks he's our father. 

Recently he asked if it bothers us that he calls all our children his grandchildren and we all said yes. Yet he claims that since he's been around for 20 years we should just get over it. Hell post on social media saying it, he'll send text messages saying it, and when I had my baby he was so quick to tell the nurse that he is such a proud grandfather. Even in front of my father in law who is a legit grand father. 

Are we the asshole?

Edit: a lot of people asked for more details so here's goes. Btw I very much appreciate everyone's feedback here

1) it's not just my brother, sister and I who hate him. Everyone dislikes this guy. My uncle(mom's brother), my father hated him, cousins and other family members. Even people.who barely interact with him grew to dislike him only after a few interactions. 

2) there's a very long history here (20 years worth) of reasons why we don't like him. He makes up stories, telling multiple people the same story with the details never matching. Never holds a job for longer than 6 months to a year. Even my wife who tries to see the good in everyone said recently that it hit her how many jobs he's held since her and I met (10 years). 

3) my mother and father were very civil and friend when they separated. They coparented as best they could. Then this guy got involved and began to put his two cents into their parenting and this caused a lot of friction. 

4) my father sadly passed away 2 years ago. He was only 56. My brother had his daughter roughly 6 months before my father passed. And with my father being sick and unable to be around his granddaughter, my step father would post on social media at every opportunity referring to himself as a grandfather. My brother asked him to stop because he felt it was disrespectful to our actual father. So he stopped until that December (3 months after my dad passed) when my sister had her babies and started immediately posting about how he's a proud grandfather to 3 beautiful grandchildren. So we had to tell him again. Then almost 9 months later I had my baby and AGAIN he started posting about himself as a proud grandfather to 4 perfect grandbabies. 

5) he has a daughter who has a baby of her own. No relationship there. He hasn't tried to have a relationship with her since maybe 2 years after I met him. He acts like she doesn't even exist. 

6) us not liking him isn't a new thing. Before my mother and him got married my mother asked my brother, sister and I how we felt about him separately. We all said we didn't like him and didn't trust him. That was over 15 years ago. And there have been many convos and arguments over the years where we've made it clear. 

I can go into much more detail but I think that covers a lot of what is being asked. Please feel free to ask me for any other details.

EDIT #2 - it seems like I need to explain further what our problem is. Our request is that he ease up on constantly posting to social media with captions saying ""my grandchildren"" or ""proud grandparent"". We've all explained that our father, their real grandfather is not with us and cannot post any pictures with them. We all feel like it's very disrespectful to him to do that. We'd prefer he never called them his grandkids, but in person we can't stop him from doing whatever he wants. There are reasons we don't want him to be around our kids that much. 

1) he had to be told numerous times not to pull his paper towel out of his pocket and wipe out kids faces with it. 
2) he had to be told multiple times not to put his fingers in our kids mouths. 
3) we've all asked him not to bring our kids into other rooms and out of our site. 
4) he has an addiction to pain meds and we never know when he's high from them
5) he falls asleep in the middle of the day on the couch and would absolutely fall asleep with them in his lap or just fall asleep and let them roam unattended
6) he's not a hygenic person and we just don't feel comfortable with them around him
7) there was an incident recently where he was watching my sister's kids with my mother and my sister has a camera so she can check in here and there. She got a notification of movement and the video shows him very creepily staring at the camera, he pretends to move the board games stacked next to the camera around, here's my mother coming back from putting the babies to bed and sits down, when she steps out of the room again he quickly gets up and turns the camera. The camera stayed that way until about 15 minutes before my sister and her husband were getting back home.",89,149,0.93

My mom is 46 years old and seven years ago she got divorced from my dad and came out as lesbian. She had already begun a relationship with a female friend that lasted for another four years. She was even supposed to adopt that woman's daughter and become her parent, but she unexpectedly left my mom.

Throughout this whole mess, my mom and I maintained a good, healthy relationship and I even loved the woman she dated and her daughter who was a really good kid.

Even my dad got more positive when it was just me, him and my brother, he remained in good relations with my mom.

After a horrible break up, my mom had a really rough time. I could tell it really took a toll on her. She wanted to be alone, so I couldn't be there for her all the time.

Some time later, she told me she met a girl at work. They started dating and my mom drastically changed. She became positive again, she was much happier. I noticed though that she avoided introducing me or my brother or anyone to this girl for a few months. One day I decided to drop by her place when I was heading home. When she let me in, the girl that she's dating was also there. It was her coworker's daughter, who is 19, only two years younger than me. I was so shocked and disgusted that I lost it and started yelling at my mom. I called her out before storming out.

900,Not the A-hole,"This happened yesterday and I still feel weird about it.

Yesterday was my birthday and my husband and I went to a popular seafood chain with a seasonal all-you-can-eat special. 

Seeing how busy it was due to the promotion, we sat at the bar and each ordered one beverage to consume while waiting. We paid for these drinks and tipped at the bar prior to moving to our dining tables. 

At the table we ordered our specials, and a second drink each while eating (though not at the same time; my drink order was first). At one point I realized that the waitress was attentive to our additional courses, but had forgotten my drink - she happily brought it when reminded, and felt bad. However, when nearly finished, my husband (who ordered his drink after me, with a new course) remembered his now forgotten beer and decided that so close to being finished that he need not ask about it. Knowing a birthday cake awaited me at home, we would not need dessert, either. 

The waitress came, asked if we wanted further orders, and we said that we thought we were finished. We did not inquire about the beer. However, instead of bringing the cheque as anticipated, she brought the beer and said, ""Here is the beer anyway, but I will be taking it off your order"". Shortly afterwards, the manager came.
She started off with, ""I know you won't be drinking the beer but we cannot credit off the alcohol. Instead I can credit off $10 from the bill."" We were a bit confused with the wording but nodded in agreement. After going through with the transaction, the manager made a move to the drink and said, ""Can I take this away now?"". Confused, my husband explained that it was implied he was being given the drink. He didn't argue, only stated a fact. The manager replied that it was against policy to provide free alcohol, but left the drink on the table and walked away.

We both sat there, confused, not knowing what to do. I asked if we should leave it. We mulled it over. On one hand, he had planned on leaving it be prior to all this. On the other, we knew it would be dumped out, as we had seen this happen (rightfully) at the bar with a returned order earlier. We also didn't want the waitress to get into trouble. (Please note at this point a tip had been left for the waitress when squaring our bill with the manager - we had seen no reason to be withholding despite two drink mix ups). I reasoned that technically the $10 was removed from the entire order, not specifically the drink and so the beer itself was not free, even if intended.

In the end, my husband drank his beer at an appropriate pace (he did not just pound it down) while we carried on our conversation in the busy restaurant until he was finished.

903,No A-holes here,"For a bit of background, my (M22) GF (F25) hasn’t always been a fan of playing video games. However, with me being a gamer myself and wanting her to understand why it can be fun and even therapeutic to play video games, so I introduced her to Stardew Valley on Xbox, which she enjoyed and plays occasionally. Soon after, a friend of hers introduced her to Breath of the Wild which she had said looked like something she would like, having played Ocarina of Time when she was younger. So, for my GF’s birthday this year I decided to get her a Nintendo Switch bundle that came with Breath of the Wild. She was confused at first, but after convincing her to try it out and get used to the controls, she started really enjoying it. 

Fast forward to a month later, and she has been playing nearly every night when she gets off work. So after a month of her playing, I figured it had been an appropriate amount of time for her to get started in the game, so I texted her asking her at work if it would be okay if I started Breath of the Wild. I wait for an hour for a response, but figured it would be alright, so I went ahead and started the game. About a half hour into playing, she texts me back saying that she knew I had bought the present for myself, and after a bit of arguing and pleading that I got it for her and that I won’t go ahead of her in the game, she says that she doesn’t want to play it anymore. When she comes home from work, I apologize and tell her that I’ll delete my save if she’ll just keep playing. In response, she says that she isn’t sure and I decide not to mention it again.

Now my husband isn’t very fond of tattoos, but he doesn’t really have a problem with the smaller ones. We talked about it and he told me to do whatever makes me happy because it’s my body, but he was very clearly not happy with my idea.

906,Not the A-hole,"We recently had an old friend come to live with us for awhile and help out on the farm. He arrived with 3 “assault rifles” which we were not told about before he came. I tried to not make a big deal about it and basically try and ignore the fact that they were here. To make a long story short and without giving too many details, our friend has not been in the happiest of head spaces and after a conversation about his dog that escalated to him yelling, I no longer feel safe in my own home. He was going to leave, but after my partner going and talking to him we tried to talk things out and come to some sort of compromise. He has agreed to take the guns off of the property when he returns home for a short period at the end of the month before returning to the farm. 

This was yesterday, and after me leaving for the day to talk with friends and to process the whole situation I decided I was comfortable with him staying as long as the guns left. Last night I could hardly sleep though, and when I was able to drift off I would have bad dreams that would wake me up. This morning I tried to talk to my partner. 

I told him I was extremely uncomfortable and that I don’t feel safe while the guns are still in the house. I asked my partner to either have him take the guns back today, or for me to go and stay in a hotel/Airbnb until they are removed from the house. He thinks I am being extremely unreasonable, and I feel like he is being way too relaxed in allowing the guns to stay on the property until the end of the month. 

He said that it makes no sense for me to be okay with him having a handgun or rifle (which is part of the compromise we came to), but not the assault rifles. The truth of the matter is I’m not comfortable with him having those either, but as we live on a farm with active predators guns are a necessary evil here.

907,Not the A-hole,"The players: me, late twenties; my dad, late fifties; my stepmom, similar age. They've been married since I was eight. If it matters, my mom is still alive and everyone gets on well. We do holidays together.

I'm in my late twenties now, and as a teenager I struggled a lot with mental health, specifically an eating disorder and related problems. Things were difficult, and came to a head when I was about 19, had dorm security called on me and my dad flew out to see me. Ultimately it came down to both of us being upset - him that I wasn't being open with him about my issues, me that I couldn't talk to him without him telling my stepmom.

She's not a bad human, she's not abusive or anything. We just aren't on the same page. She's religious, I'm not; she's consistently running late whereas I'm always early; things like that. One example from my adolescence:

* I'm fifteen and weigh a little over a hundred pounds. I'm wearing a new tank top, and I mention it was from the kids' section at Target, but I wanted it so I bought an XL. She says ""let the record show \[name\] is wearing an Extra Large!""

So.  She's not really someone I want to talk to about my issues.

When I was eighteen, I was at my sister's graduation and was having a depressive episode that I didn't know the cause of, which was frequent in those days. My dad came to find me, and knowing he wouldn't stop probing until I gave him something, I said I was having struggles dealing with my stepmom and asked him not to tell her. Cut to the next day, I am alone in a car with her on an eight hour drive and she turns to me and says ""so, your dad says you're having some issues with me.""

I don't like the way she addresses me with information she has on me; I wouldn't choose to talk to her about the tough stuff, and she seems incapable of not bringing up what she knows, directly or indirectly. And there's things I just don't want her to know. When I told my dad I didn't want to tell him things if he would tell my stepmom, he said that they're married, and part of that is not keeping things from one another.

That finally brought it into the open, and knowing that, I have since not told my dad things I otherwise would, knowing my stepmom would then know that information.

909,Not the A-hole,"Every now and then, I use a dating app to meet someone for short term dating. As of late, I used a bunch of pictures from a trip I took with a buddy of mine upstate. Naturally, he was in a few of them, but my main profile and a few others were of me alone.

A girl I saw no more than a passing interest in asked about him in my photos, and I told her this wasnt his profile, but mine. She persisted, so I unmatched her, moved on, and thought nothing of it.

In as little as a day later, my buddy calls and asks about that girl. I asked how he even knew she existed, and he told me that she confessed to having looked up my name on social media (I have a very unique name, according to How Many of Me, there are less than 100 people in the state of New York that have my first name, and in some circles, I'm known as an asshole neighbor), found my profile, and found him tagged in the same vacation photos. 

My first reaction tell him that if she went that far to find him, she was more trouble then she was worth, and to remind him of the 6th rule of manhood, ""never stick your d*ck in crazy"". He did a complete 180 on me and accused me of being a bad friend for not telling him that some girl thought he was attractive (he has confidence issues, I've been trying to help him break out of his shell for almost 5 years now). He then wanted to know how many other girls did I shoo away that thought he was attractive. 

I asked him if he was really interested in being with a woman that straight up stalked his existence to find him after seeing only his photo. For a bit more context, I enjoy slasher movies, he likes Disney. Not saying anything is wrong with it, just saying that fairy tales arent real. 

I convinced him not to talk to her and block her altogether, but he hasn't spoken to me in a week, and finds an excuse to quickly hang up. 

We're very tight, and I'm sure this will blow over in another week or so, but I need to know, AITA for not hooking my friend up with a girl that matched with me to get to him on online dating?",81,42,0.89

912,Not the A-hole,"I live in a condo with 40 floors. Due to this, elevators are a hot commodity because everyone has somewhere to be. 

This particular morning I was running late and was in a bit of a rush. A mother and her child got on after I did. 

We were all headed towards the ground floor, or so I thought. Her child was extremely rowdy; running around the elevator and making noise. The mother was doing little to stop it, she only verbally asked him to stop instead of holding his hand to keep him from being a menace to everyone else in the elevator. 

Due to the lack of response from his mother, he proceeded to press at least 5 buttons on the elevator; causing us to stop unnecessarily on 5 different floors instead of going straight down. 

I know this probably only added about 1-2 minutes to my lateness, but considering I was already in a foul mood, I kind of snapped at the child and his mother. 

I scoffed and said “was that really necessary? Now everyone in this elevator has to deal with this elevator stopping unnecessarily on 5 different floors because you couldn’t control your child”. Then I turned to the kid and said “do not press another button”. 

The mother was obviously pissed and remarked that my comment was out of line and that I had no right to speak to her or her child that way. 

I went on to explain that she was being extremely inconsiderate and by allowing her child to behave this way instead of correcting his actions, he’ll never learn any better. She proceeded to tell me that I shouldn’t be teaching her how to raise her child and to mind my own damn business like everyone else in the elevator.

By this point we had reached the lobby, so I kind of just rolled my eyes at her and rushed out as I had an Uber to catch. 

AITA here?

It just so happens that the company I work for donates yearly to their big fundraiser and I am the one who handles the donations and works with the fundraising staff on their end. I receive a thank you letter each year from them.

I recently mentioned to my contact there that my GF was applying and if there was a specific person she should address the cover letter to. I always think it's better to be able to address to a person directly vs. ""to whom it may concern"". Not only did my contact give me the name of the person, but offered to pass along Gf's application directly, which I thought was very kind.

GF thinks this isn't cool and that I am abusing the system. She feels that they may only hire her to make sure they don't lose the yearly donation (not true, it would have no impact on future donations either way). I think this is more of how business works. Referrals are still the number one way people get hired according to HR studies. She would still have to pass the interview and have the right skills for the job.

917,Not the A-hole,"My husband’s brother recently moved to town with his wife and they have become our go-to hangout buddies for EVERYTHING. My husband even set up his at home office at their house (they now live 5 minutes down the street). Over the last few years my husband and I have racked up 50k in CC debt between our wedding, our businesses, and buying a fixer upper home. This was discussed, and I’ve been working lots of long hours to get back in the black. The payoff is I just landed a series of big (time sensitive) projects that my husband and I plan to do together, that will go a long way toward getting us back on track financially.

Last week we were at a pool party and I overheard him and his brother talking about how cheap their tickets are for their trip to Europe. I swim over and ask, “What trip?”. His brother mumbles something like ‘oh sh\*t’. My husband paused, then jovially says they planned a trip to Europe in October. Right in the middle of our job. Not wanting to make a scene I quietly left the pool and went inside. My husband followed me and a heated discussion ensued. He said his brother was going to pay the plane fare since we were having trouble financially. I explained that not only was he bailing on me for our upcoming project, but things like 9 day trips to Europe shouldn’t be kept a secret from your wife. He agreed to cancel the trip and apologized. That night he’s on the phone with his brother and tells him to cancel the tickets… but 10 min later he strolls in and says they still want to go and I’m being controlling. Now this is a gentleman who just went with his brother to Las Vegas in the middle of the work week while I was stuck in town working last month. As it stands he can do WHATEVER he wants, as long as he TELLS me first.

After a second long discussion he again agrees to cancel the trip. Then his brother starts texting me with excuses. First it’s that want to see their mom who lives there who they haven’t seen in years. I suggested flying her here and having her stay with us so I can also meet her. Bonus: half the price. Nope.  Next was that my husband is ‘depressed’. Well, the four of us just got back from 9 days in Iceland that we couldn’t afford. Not sure why THIS trip would make it better if that didn’t help. I suggested therapy, not plane tickets, but that goes nowhere. 

It’s now been a week since I’ve seen his brother and wife. The usual fun group text between all of us is dead. I hear his friends are telling him I’m overbearing and that his brother is ‘saving him from me’. I’ve made an appointment with a couples therapist for us, but in the meantime I feel like I’m going nuts and the tension is getting worse. Is it controlling and unreasonable to ask that something like this is run by me and made as a family decision? And AITA for asking that they cancel or reschedule the trip?",68,77,0.9
918,Asshole,"I was in a relationship for 5 years and we broke up four months ago. He brought a dog into the relationship who was already 8 years old, but we decided to get another dog about a year ago.

When we split, we had to sit down and talk about the dogs. We decided he'd get the senior dog because it was before our relationship and I would keep the new dog. For what it's worth, we both paid into the new dog equally in terms of vet, food, as well as the dog itself.

I'm not a dog person but I tried to make it work. I loved both dogs. But due to my schedule for work and etc, I decided having a dog is not for me. So I gave the dog to a family member who was looking for a dog themselves. To note is the dog now lives some distance, not quite plane distance but definitely ""all day driving"" distance.

Why I might be the asshole is I didn't tell my ex until last week. By this point the dog has been gone a few weeks. He cried on the phone saying that it wasn't my place to give the dog away and he would have gladly *paid me* for the dog if it meant he'd get her back.

We relocated for my job and we don't have a support structure here except the two of us and the kids (""the Seattle Freeze"" is real). As a result, I have ZERO personal time; I'm either working, just come home and must focus on kids to give my wife a break, or it is after kids bedtime and my wife wants to talk since she has had little or no adult interaction that day. I am a very independent person, but find myself saying, ""Stop! One at a time!"" several times a day. I can not do anything at home independently because I get constant interruptions and ""help"" that is entirely counterproductive and makes everything take longer.

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He’s really goofy with me, and treats me like I’m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he’s family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I’ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I’m in the right place in life and I’m so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore.

927,Not the A-hole,"We live on a street with public parking. For a long time it was just my SO and I parking on the street in front of our house. We ended up getting neighbors on both sides of us that can't parallel park. We helped accommodate this problem by having one of us park in front of an abandoned house at the end of the street instead of in front of our house. Now each neighbor had plenty of room to park and one of us was still in front of our house. 

Recently our right side neighbor has started to park further up so that there is enough room for me and my SO, we just have to parallel park (which neither of us have a problem with).

One night I was already at home and my SO was lined up to start parallel parking behind me. Our left side neighbor arrived home just seconds after him, pulled up next to him and said ""you can't park there"". My SO pulled up and parked down the street and the neighbor circled the block and parked in front of their house. My SO got out and asked them why he couldn't park there and she responded ""well it's in front of our house"". My SO responded that it is a public street, he can park where ever, and he would have been in front of our house but the left side neighbor would have had to parallel park. They admitted that they can't parallel park but that we should park further up so that they have enough room in front of their house to park. 

My SO told me all of this and I got very upset because we had been trying to help them and now they are telling us where we can and can't park. I decided to start parking right on the fence line between our yards. This meant that I parked inches away from her a couple times but she still had half a car length behind her so she could get out. 

She started parking more and more past the fence line in front of our house and I continued to park right on top of her. One day she got pissed and after I went back to work after lunch I saw her on our security camera come out, complain to our other neighbor about how close I was, get in her car and move it even further in front of our house despite having a full car length behind her. When we got home my SO parked in front of her and I parked behind her pinning her in for the weekend.

It looks like she called her parents to get her out and parked down the street. My SO and I had the opportunity to keep her spot blocked but decided to open it up and give her the chance to start parking in front of her house again. 

I watched her on our camera move her car to her spot and park on her side of the fence. She got out of the car,  saw that we would have room to park in front of her, got back in her car and moved in front of our house again. 

AITA for pinning her in? WIBTA if I went to her house and told her that she made the rules of not parking in front of each other's houses. She needs to follow them.


Update: After having her pinned in for the weekend we decided to wave the white flag and opened the spots back up. Monday she parked in front of her house, and even though there was plenty of room for both my SO and I to park in front of our house my SO parked down the street and I parked in front of our house so the neighbor would have plenty of room to get out.
We assumed everything was back to normal.
Today she parked in front of her house and her boyfriend, who usually parks in their parking spot behind their house, is parked in front of our house. There is just enough space between their cars and surrounding cars that you can't quite park in between them. 
So now my SO gets to park down the street in front of the abandoned house and I get to find a spot around the block.",58,192,0.95

933,Not the A-hole,"During a drunken night, my boyfriend (26) told myself (25), my mom and my sister about a student loan that he will have to start paying on in October. He said his mom just told him about it a few days ago. It’s a parent plus loan. The amount he’d have to pay a month was ridiculous. The next morning we got breakfast and he told me the loan is upwards of 150k. Apparently it’s a consolidated loan between him and his two siblings. He went to a state college for 5 semesters and he said his debt is about 35k. His mother wants him and his siblings to split the loan into thirds which is how she calculated the amount per month they would pay. However, according to her calculations he would be paying 20k extra in loans that aren’t even his. I implored him to speak with her as this could really cripple us financially. Yesterday he talked to her and she pretty much said that it is what it is. She claims there is no way to see how much he owes because the loan is consolidated— which I know is untrue. I told him he needs to figure it out. I also told him that she is essentially stealing from him. He got really upset. I continued to tell him that, “if that bitch ruins our chances of a stable financial future I will tell her how I feel myself”. He told me I cannot talk about his mother that way and that I was being selfish. We have been distant since the conversation, something that is not normal for us.

I’m quite close with my little cousin who’s 15. Although there’s a 9 year age gap between us, we’re both the youngest on this side of the family and she refers to me as her ‘cool aunt’ rather than cousin.


Once every two weeks, I pick her up after one of her sport clubs and we go for dinner or to an arcade or something while her mum finishes work. The last time we hung out, while we were at dinner she asked if I ever drank underage. When I asked her what brought this on she said they had an assembly about the dangers of it in school. I didn’t want to lie, so I told her the truth. Once when my friends and I were 16, we stole a bottle of vodka from my friends house, drank most of it and ended up stranded in the middle of town at 2am. One of my friends got so drunk she pissed herself and the police caught us and took us to the hospital where my friend needed her stomach pumped. I got grounded for months and my friends parents made her spend the summer holidays with extended family in another country. My cousin asked if it was worth it and I told her no, it was probably one of the worst nights of my life and I was very lucky that nothing worse happened.

I didn’t think anything about it until my aunt picked her up this week. She pulled me aside and said she’s very disappointed that I told her daughter about underage drinking. She said I’ve given her the idea to sneak booze out of the house and bc she looks up to me so much, my aunt is worried her daughter will try drinking. I argued that I didn’t glamorise it, I point blank told her it’s a dumb thing to do and very dangerous.

We've been together for a while now, about 8 years or so, and have been living together for 2 years.  We share pretty much everything equally, but I've been very particular about my custom built $1500+ computer in the past because people aren't always careful with your stuff.

Despite the fact that my GF has her own laptop, tablet, phone, etc. she still likes to use my computer from time to time to browse for things, study, or whatever she's doing if I'm not using it. Initially I'd make her use a guest account, but eventually I just gave her a user profile so she doesn't have to ask for my permission to log on and use my computer.

Recently, I bought her some software for a hobby that's she's always been interested in, but its a modular software that comes with a lot of optional plugins and you have to download and install these plugins for them to work. She recently got upset with me for ""treating her like a child"" because every time she wants to install something, it requires an admin password and I refused to give her my password because I like to be able to monitor what's going on to my computer.

She said I'm being a bit of an asshole for not trusting her, and I countered by saying that if something goes wrong she's going to look to me to fix it and it's also not like this is a ""family"" computer in my eyes. I custom built my rig for gaming and creating video content and I'd rather not spend time troubleshooting something if I can just personally vet things upfront.

So Reddit, AITA for not giving her my admin password and letting her download & install whatever she wants on my computer?

EDIT: I added more info in a comment about the actual incident if that helps anyone in their judgements. Pasted below for ease of access:

For more context, if it helps anyone, the incident that led to all this went like this: She was using my computer in the other room and I was out in the living room working on a project and responding to some emails from clients. She popped her head out and asked me for my password because she wanted to install another plugin for the software I'd bought her and I asked her to give me a second because I was in the middle of writing and didn't want to lose my train of thought.

She got a little annoyed and said that I should just give her my password so she can use it whenever and I said No, just gimme a second I'll be right there and I closed out the email and walked over and checked out what she was installing and put in my password after taking a look at it.

Little backstory, I was stationed in Turkey in 2010 when I met my gf (now wife) on base.  We went out more than a few times but this one situation STILL GIVES ME FLASHBACKS!

At one of our dates, we go to this open air cafe.  Instead of normal sitting chairs and tables, this cafe has large couches (the kind you can really lean back) plus large and long tables that are only about knee high.  

This cafe we went to served coffee, drinks, desserts, hookahs,  and meals.  They also had large TVs where you could watch the Turkish League soccer matches...which is still odd for me but whatever.  Its a total switch from the boring routine of chow hall food I get everyday.

We place an order for drinks.  When the server returns with our drinks, my gf is leaning back on the couch with a cigarette in hand. She says something to the server...then he moves the salt and pepper shakers from the middle of the table so they are directly in front of her!  Thats when this conversation starts...

Me:  Did you just ask the server to move the salt and pepper shakers to be in front of you?

Her:  yes why?

Me: seriously!? 

Her:  whats the big deal?

Me:  why couldn’t you get up and get them?

Her:  I didn’t want to, besides thats his job.

Me:  No, his job is to bring them IF they are NOT at the table.  Not to move them closer...that would totally not be acceptable in the States.  I think if you asked that over there, the server would’ve walked away.

Her: I see nothing wrong with that.  I wanted them closer.

Me:  are you that lazy to not get up and get your own salt and pepper shakers from your own table?

The Teletubbies were very popular at my high school (yes seriously), especially amongst kids that did drugs (for obvious reasons.) I remember once my teacher said we could just watch TV for the rest of class because she didn't have anything else to talk about that class and guess what show was playing that everyone asked to watch? Teletubbies.

My sister meanwhile who was 7 about this time hated it when I was watching Teletubbies at home because it was the ""cool"" show. She thought they were creepy and scary.

Anyone one summer day she was kind of annoying me while I was watching TV before her bedtime so during a commercial I went to her room and came back quick. I told her I heard the Teletubbies giggling so I looked under her bed and they were hiding there.

She freaked out and told my parents. They kept telling her that the Teletubbies don't exist in real life so they can't be under her bed but she refused to listen. So she ended up sleeping in their bed that night and the next few days. Needless to say they weren't happy with me.

Plus they'll do it for free (minus dog food and what not), so he'll be saving about $300 from not having to pay the day care. After some back and forth, my brother gives in and agrees to letting Ridley spend the week with Sam and her family.

Long story short, they get back from vacation, and of course, Ridley has done some damage to their house, tore out some siding, chewed up one of their cages they tried to get her to sleep in, and some other things. Sam's dad is pretty upset and is wanting my brother to pay for the damages. My brother is pretty firm that he isn't paying anything. Sam's parents agreed to watch over Ridley and he even voiced his concern that something like this would happen, and they still knowingly wanted to dog sit Ridley. My sister and parents both think that my brother should foot the bill for the damages, or at least pay for some of the damages, but I'm kind of on my brother's side and that he shouldn't be responsible for anything.

Granted, he probably could have handled everything better, like meeting with Sam's parents and discussing his concerns with them directly instead of having having everything go between my sister and Sam as his point of contact, since they aren't the ones who own the house, but Sam had originally said she talked it over with her parents, and they were fine with it as well. I'm pretty sure my brother will have to chock this up as a learning experience, and just pay them (which will probably amount to what he would have ended up paying the doggy day care) but just wanted to ask all you all here to see if we are the assholes for not wanting to pay for the damages done to the family friend's house?",130,260,0.91
945,Not the A-hole,"I work for a natural history museum that holds a series of scientific lecturers for the public. There is a fee to attend. These lectures feature high-profile researchers and authors. Our auditorium holds about 300 people.
With a crowd that size, one expects the usual coughing, sneezing, and other unavoidable human noises. And the occasional a-hole who doesn't know how to silence their cell phone notification sounds.
One of the regular attendees of these lectures brings a dude ( looks to be in his mid-twenties) who is severely disabled, both physically and mentally, solidly strapped into his wheelchair. When they first started coming, he would grunt and hoot and make all kinds of distracting noises through the whole lecture. People sitting near them looked visibly annoyed, but also sympathetic toward a disabled person.
Recently, this same family started bringing an iPad and playing a movie for the guy in the wheelchair. With the sound on. Without earbuds. People sitting near them now get to hear all the sound from the movie along with the lecturer. When a co-worker finally asked them to turn it off, the family responded, ""Oh, he'll stay much more quiet if he can watch a movie while we're here.""
WTF? If this human is so disconnected from reality that they cannot hear or understand the lecture, why are you bringing them? I feel like this is the same if a family brought a crying baby. I would politely ask them to take their crying baby out of the lecture hall until they could get it quiet. 
AITA for being annoyed with this family? I am not taking away from the heartbreak of having a severely disabled loved one.  I am judging them for imposing that disabled person's inability to stay quiet on others.",38,131,0.91

I’m a daily smoker, and my wife is pregnant so I’ve been going outside to smoke since we found out. The other day my next door neighbour came outside and asked me to do it indoors as the smell was coming in her open window. I explained my wife is expecting and she replied that if that’s the case maybe I shouldn’t be smoking anyways. I’m a fairly non-confrontational guy, so I just kinda mumbled an apology, put it out and went back inside.

949,Not the A-hole,"Little back story - I work as a delivery driver for a pizza place. I am honestly not paid enough for some of the shit I have to deal with, and how people speak to me. Most of the time, I bite my tongue. The whole 'smile and wave boys, smile and wave' thing is something I try to live by. Remember folks, the customer is always right *insert eye-roll*

However tonight I had a Karen.
We get several deliveries to houses that are down long drives, with multiple addresses. It's honestly confusing as shit at times, especially when they don't put numbers up on fences or whatever. This is what happened tonight.
I got pretty lost. Called the customer. She sounded pretty annoyed that I was calling even though the delivery note said 'call if you get lost'.

I arrive with a smile on my face. She's at the door waiting. Ask her how her night is. The usual.
I get a ""is this your first week on the job?""
""No maam, I've been here for about two years now""

""Well don't you delivery drivers know how to use Google maps? I'm not impressed that you had to call me. Can't you do your job? ""

""Excuse me?""

""You heard me. Don't you know how to use Google Maps. It's not hard""

Well for a start, Google Maps wouldn't have helped me in this situation. It doesn't show the exact location, especially if it's multiple houses down a drive.

I snapped.
""Maybe if you'd put some fucking directions on your delivery note, then I wouldn't have this problem. It's pitch black, there's no numbers on the fence. What am I supposed to do?"" 

She looked pretty shocked, then the inner Karen came right out.
"" I don't appreciate your tone at all. There is no need to speak to me so rudely. Maybe you should re-learn some customer services skills and some  manners. I'll be making a complaint to your boss. What's your name?""

Me feeling pretty petty and over it by this point told her that I didn't have to give her my name if I didn't want to, which I don't.
She huffed in my face, took the pizza out of my hands, and slammed the door in my face.

Here's the thing. Don't have a note saying 'call if you get lost' if your just going to belittle someone. I'm more than happy to give the pizza to the wrong person if that's what you'd like.

So, AITA for snapping?

TL;DR: Karen got pissy because I asked for proper directions to drop her damn food off to her so I got pissy back.

Edit - to those saying 'I'm in the wrong job' and 'resentful of my customers'. I love my job. I like meeting the people I meet. I've made some great friends out of regular customers. But every single person is allowed to have those days where they get frustrated at the way they get spoken to or treated. I'm a pretty chill person, it takes a lot to get me pissed off to the point of snapping back. 
Was I unprofessional. Yes.
Am I proud of how I acted. No. 
Did I regret it after. Yes. 

My boss is very understanding and even if she did complain, there would be no repercussions on my end other than 'don't do it again'. As my boss knows how some customers treat all the drivers there. So no, I don't resent my customers.",45,137,0.94

Local haunted house (it’s relatively famous) is hiring. One of my professors sent me the link and I ended up getting hired yesterday. The hours are in my schedule (4-12) and my only issue is transport (which I worked out with some of my new coworkers).  The management is friendly and can work with my schedule as a college student. My coworkers are kind and helpful. 

I told my parents last night that I got the job and they spent about an hour breaking down why I couldn’t do that job and why it would be detrimental to me (homework, clubs, etc) and how I should quit immediately. This morning I got five paragraphs worth of texts from both of them saying to quit the job immediately and that it wasn’t worth it. 

I want to keep this job because I want something to do on the weekends and also so I can avoid being financially dependent on my parents. I know that it’s the third week of the semester and my course-load will be a bit heavier in the next couple weeks. I know I have plenty of time throughout the day to balance work and study. 

Trying to get work in my college town is a pain in the ass and this seems like the best option for me. So am I an asshole for defying their rules and taking a job like this?

UPDATE: Thank you all for the positive responses! It's so insane to see all these comments pouring in throughout the day. I feel like I should add a wee bit more information to this to help with the decision (mainly because I didn't expect to see so many comments lol)
- The job IS seasonal. September 27th-November 2nd.
- I'm not too far from the attraction, which is fine because I can use Uber IF NEED BE but I can carpool with others. 
- Typically the place opens AT 7 pm but they recommend you go in earlier for makeup and costuming. This is also so you know where you're placed (the attraction is primarily in the dark and has minimal lighting and it is crucial to know where to hide water and cough drops) and what you're working with. 
- I'm a residential student, meaning I live in a dorm. Dorm life is okay. 
- I am dependent on my family for a part of my education (I have a scholarship, but not a full ride.)
- This isn't an isolated incident of helicopter parenting. 
- This isn't my first job. I am a writer and a former theme park worker.

954,Not the A-hole,"Hello Good People of Reddit,

I have a rare opportunity to do a degree apprenticeship (it's basically working while doing a bachelor's degree paid for by your employer and getting paid for the work). It requires me to move 4 hours away from my parents into my own place.

I currently live at home with my parents and pay for about 50% of the rent and other household expenses. My parents both work minimum wage jobs and dont make enough to pay for the household without my contributions.

I started to apply for multiple apprenticeships about 6 months ago and told my parents in no uncertain terms that I will be moving out if I get accepted for a role which was far from home and that they will have to manage the costs on their own. At the time they are both very happy and agreed saying that they will manage. 2 weeks ago I got accepted for a role in a town 4 hours away from my house when I told them I am accepting the role they both came out a told me that I am not allowed to take it is too far from home and it would be too far for me to travel daily, for some reason they were thinking that I would travel from home to my new place of work daily even though I told them that I would be moving out.

When I moveout I will not be able to pay for my parent's expenses as I will have increased expenses of my own. Am I wrong for leaving my parents on their own even though I gave them 6 months notice that this might happen? I start my new role in 3 months so they still have plenty of time to find a smaller place they can afford on their own but they seem intent on trying to stop me from taking the role instead of finding getting an affordable place. I would be the first person in my family to have a degree and long term stability as the role is for a minimum of 4 years and comes with many benefits.

For the past few days, it has been eating me from the inside, I don't want to hurt my parents but this type of opportunity doesn't come around every day. How can I make this easier for my parents and am I being too selfish with this?

I [17M] was traveling with my friend and my brother, my brother booked a one way ticket as he was traveling to another country from our destination after two days.

 So we are at the airport and the lady at the boarding counter tells my brother because he is ""of a certain nationality"" he cannot have a one way ticket even though he had a ticket to his other destination. She says it has to be a return ticket through their airlines only.

 So we asked to speak to her supervisor because this was wierd as it never happened before and in some way I found it offensive. The supervisor wasnt really cooperative and kept telling us he was busy. So my brother went to quickly book a ticket while I called my dad to tell him what happened.

My dad told me this shouldnt be a thing and wanted to talk to the supervisor, but he refused and said I'm not allowed to speak on phone eventhough he literally hung up on someone's phone moments before I gave him mine.

My dad wanted to know who he is since he was being rude and possibly making us book an unnecessary ticket. so I asked him for his name tag as I wanted to take a picture of it. He refused to even show me it. So I took a picture of him and he started shouting at me infront of everyone things like ""who are you to take my picture"".

By that time my brother booked a ticket so I ignored him and headed towards the counter. He told the lady to not give us our boardings because he was gonna call the cops on us.

A few months ago one of my best friends confessed to a guy she liked. She'd had a crush on him for months and finally did it at the end of her Freshman year. He rejected her with the classic ""it's not you it's me"" bull and left her devastated for next month.

Fast forward to now, a long time after that all happened, and he starts flirting with her. She lost interest in him a long time ago, but he kept messaging her and bothering her so much until he eventually gave in. A bad call, but she ended up giving in and got into a relationship with him.

I lost alot of my respect for this guy in the past year. He barely gave two shits when he rejected her and a little while after he did he tried hooking up with another one of my friends.

Last night she received a message from him that left a really bad taste in my mouth. He told her that ""he wanted to keep talking to her"" and to ""tell him whenever her parents aren't home so he can come"". I lost all respect for him after this.

I worked on training her so she doesn't bark. She doesn't bark at the mail man, she doesn't bark when people are walking on the street. She doesn't bark when the neighbors dogs are barking too. I'm really proud of her.

Lots of people here have dogs, if I were to estimate about 90% if not more (burglary is quite common).

Her : REALLY NOW?! 
Me : What? 
Her : You know people are sleeping, damn! 
Me : Well, I work the rest of the time.
Her : It's the weekend for God's sake! Other people work during the week too! [Yelling while throwing hands]

Basically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

Turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?

Context: I'm a 38 year old and I work in the banking industry and I'm a Partner at a fairly prestigious firm in my country and I earn well over a million on most years (this is important later down).

&#x200B;

Recently I got a yacht and invited some of my friends and their SO's over to stay the weekend and have a nice weekend boat trip.  All was fine until Saturday evening after dinner, we sat around the table and were talking about life and our careers especially how far we've come since college.  Jordan (one of my friends) decided to bring up careers, which is something I don't like discussing about myself because it often incites jealousy and arguments but anyways.  We effectively did like a ""go 'round the circle"" thing, and when it was about to be my turn I excused myself to ""go to the toilet"" but everyone else caught on and they said something along the lines of ""we know what you're trying to pull, just tell us"".  I said that I work in the financial industry and I make 100k (we were also discussing salary for some reason).  From the look my wife gave me, Jordan caught on and said ""Stop bullshitting and tell us what you actually make"".  I said ""Ok fine, I lied, 100k is my bonus, I make 500k"" which isn't true either.  At this point it was easy to tell that I was lying because I was going slightly red and my palms were sweating a lot.  Jordan once again caught on and said very loudly ""Just goddamn tell us what you make, and I'll leave you alone"".

&#x200B;

Then I finally told the truth.  ""I make 3 million in a bad year, and 8 million on a good year, ya happy now"".  Jordan's face essentially contorted into a vicious sneer and proceeded to start calling me a ""Corporate sleezbag"" and that I ""leech of people's hard work and defraud the government"" etc, none of which I do,  as I literally sacrified my social life and health at one point to get where I am now.  He continued unleashing his vitriol at me for 15 minutes, and I was calm until he started attacking me personally, saying that I was a shitty greedy person and that I should go drown myself because I embezzled from hardworking people like him, which again neither of which I do because I don't even work in consumer banking I work in corporate finance.  I finally snapped (something which I do very rarely because I get really terrifying) and screamed at him to get his ass out of my boat, and called him every swear word under the sun, including ""pansy ass cunt"" among other things and didn't stop for a solid 10 minutes. I effectively just dragged him out of my boat and told his girlfriend to ""fuck off and find a new dick to suck, because his won't stand anymore"".  After which I just sat in the cabin and stared out the window.  Now here I am at home and my wife won't speak to me because she calls me an asshole for doing all that.

Here's the basic situation. My girlfriend can't eat meat with the exception of fish otherwise she gets sick. While I on the other hand am deathly allergic to most shellfish (crab, shrimp, lobster).

So last night I was at her place and she decided to have something shrimp flavored for dinner. I asked her not to come to bed until after she had brushed her teeth and washed her hands. She agreed and that was all fine but then I told her I would rather she didn't eat anything that might have shellfish in it when I was over because my allergy is so serious.

She started insisting that it wasn't even real shellfish and was just the flavoring. I reminded her that the flavor still might have been made with real shellfish. She agreed but after was annoyed I even asked. I understand that she also has a limited diet but I also don't think it's unreasonable for her to not eat something that could contaminate my food when I have an allergy that is literally life-threatening. Now I feel like maybe I'm asking too much of her though since there is so little meat she can eat to begin with and this limits her even more.

978,Asshole,"For a few years now I've been living with three friends of mine, one whom we'll call Mary. Mary used to have problems with her eating years ago which have since resolved, but apparently have made a comeback this year. She's always been on the slim side but since the start of this year she's been putting away a ridiculous amount of food - and I mean ridiculous. Buying and eating whole cakes, tubs of ice cream, bars of chocolate, the list goes on. At first Mary was buying her own stuff, but eventually she stopped. THEN communal food starts to go missing. Cookies, chips, syrup, ice cream, cereal. It would be replaced quickly but then quickly disappear all over again, and after a while of that Mary sat us all down for a house meeting and told us she had a serious problem right now and asked us all to please keep food like that in our room as she was really struggling to control herself right now.

My other two room-mates were okay with this, but I put my foot down. I didn't think it was fair for me to pay rent to have to hide food in my room, which is already pretty packed, rather than the kitchen I was paying for. My friends thought I was being a bit of a TA for that but understood where I was coming from.

Things have gotten worse since and the food pretty much will instantly vanish. I can put cookies in the pantry and guarantee that in 12 hours they will be gone. She replaces the food but then eats it herself pretty much instantly, so basically it's just her eating my things and buying more things for herself to eat which has really started to get on my nerves. The straw that broke the camels back and is when I came home with a slice of my sisters wedding cake. I would think she would have the decency to stay away from that, but nope. She lasted all of two days and then it was gone. After this I confronted her with a bunch of receipts I'd been saving and demanded she pay me in full for everything, given it was basically her eating this stuff over and over again while everyone else missed out.

She became extremely emotional over this but in the end agreed she'd pay for everything and that she was in the wrong. Since then she's informed the house that she's planning to move back to her parents later this week. To be honest I'm kind of glad not to have to deal with the stress of living with her any more, but the rest of my flatmates are upset and think I drove her off.",702,1193,0.94
979,Not the A-hole,"Ok I swear it’s not as bad as it seems. But here’s the story:

Friday I asked a girl out, I had had feelings for her for awhile (over a year) and I mustered up the courage to tell her how I feel. Of course she rejected me and I thought that was that. This was Friday night. 

Edit: I get like this post needs some more backstory so basically I met this girl about two years ago at first we didn’t talk much but then we started talking a lot. We had actually become really close friends. About 10 or so months after we started talking I started to develop feeling for her this was all about a year ago. Anyway her friendship meant a lot to me because I don’t have a lot of friends. 

Saturday I don’t talk to her and she doesn’t talk to me. Today (Sunday) hits and one of my friends tells me that she thinks I’m ignoring her. I’m ngl I was ignoring everyone cause I was deep in my feelings, but anyway I called her and here is how the conversation went:

Me-“Hey (friend) told me that you think I’m ignoring you. I wanted to say that I’m not but I’m sorry it came off that way.”

Her-“Its fine, but why haven’t we talked at all?”

M-“I just didn’t think we had anything to talk about”

H-“Oh so u were just being nice to me this whole time to get in my pants?”

At this point what she said just got under my skin and I started talking more harshly. 

M-“Is that seriously what you think of me? I’m not like that and even if I was I can constitute that sort of reaction if we stopped talking for like a week, but no it’s been a day and a half so I think you need to chill out.”

H-“Dude like I said I don’t like you in that way so don’t get mad at me for it.”

M-“Ya I know that but I don’t remember you texting me either so don’t act like your above it all.” 

(She’s had history of acting like no one is perfect except her it’s rare that she acts this way but sometimes I wonder if deep down she believes it)

It kind of puttered out from there for a couple minutes then we stopped talking and haven’t talked since. This happened about 8 hours ago.

Edit 2: I have got some remarks on the “I just didn’t think we had anything to talk about” line. I want to make it clear that I was not trying to stick it to her that I’m not talking to her nor was I trying to be an entitled nice guy. What I probably should’ve said is “I don’t really feel like talking rn” and that’s what I meant. But in the moment I just said the wrong thing.

Edit 3: Tomorrow I will talk to her about everything things that I need to make clear and some issues on her end that u guys have brought up so thank u. I will try my best to post an update so be on the lookout for that.",74,106,0.9
980,Not the A-hole,"It's just as the title says. For a little context: they've been dating for about two years, and her boyfriend -- let's call him Cheese -- is madly in love with her. Like, sickeningly sweet. He's loved her since day one and he's shown it in cheesy ways. He showers her with love and flowers and chocolate and whatnot. As the third wheel, I'm over it lol

Cheese has always treated her with great deals of respect and my friend -- let's call her Mac -- has done the same. Whenever Mac wanted some space and vise versa, they've always gave each other space and helped each other emotionally.

A while ago, Mac told me that she felt awful taking advantage of how loving he is and has started ""goofing"" around with other boys and eventually landed a second relationship with the ""f#ckboy"" type guy.

It really upset me because Cheese would message me whenever he needed help getting through with Mac. He message me on our friendiversarry and ask if I could give Mac a gift from our behalf.

I've known Mac for about a third of my life and I knew that she was the toying type of gal, but I never actually expected her to START ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WHILE WITH CHEESE.

Eventually, I had to break the news for him because he was still madly in love with her. I didn't want it to be harsh, but I knew it would still hurt him no matter how much cushion I placed. So I just told him straight up. Mac is cheating on you, Cheese.

It took him a while to respond and he answered me very simply. ""I'll talk to her."" I immidiently thought I f#cked up. Some 4 hours pass and I get a text from Mac and she's upset with me because I told Cheese. I just told her what I felt and she stopped talking to me for a while before calling me, crying.

I don't know what to do. I feel like the asshole for breaking a once wonderful relationship.

TL;DR: Told my bestie's man that she was cheating on him and they might potentially break up.

!!UPDATE!! It's been a couple of hours and they've talked about it. They're going to be taking a break to sort things out. Cheese says he doesn't want to break up but he feels like he should after all of this, while Mac says they shouldn't and she'll fix herself.",269,759,0.95

982,Not the A-hole,"Resubmitting because of the character limit.

My wife (37F) and I (35M) were always very clear about our intentions in starting a family: we both were adamant about having two kids. For monetary reasons and familial ones, we were satisfied with two kids. We agreed that after the second child was born, I'd get a vasectomy.

After the birth of our second child, I began to schedule an appointment to go get the damn thing, and as I'm consulting with her, she says that she doesn't want me to get it because she wants a third kid. At first, I kind of laughed it off, but then I realized she was serious. I asked her what her reasons were. To the best of my recollection (and I'm trying to be faithful to her logic and reasoning here), her reasons were:

\- We have enough money to support three kids comfortably (this is more or less true, but we'd be spread thinner and we'd be able to save less)  
\- She had two siblings, and she feels it's a beneficial environment to grow up in. (I wouldn't know, I only had 1 sibling).

\- I'm not the one who has to ""go"" through pregnancy (she's right... but I'm not sure if that's enough reason to deviate from the plan)

After hearing her plead her case, I decided to drop it for the time being. As silly as it was, I assumed that maybe it was some lingering pregnancy hormones influencing her desire to want another kid... I'm not a doctor, so be gentle.

Anyway, I left it alone and came back to the idea later. I asked her if this is really what she wanted; saying I still *really* wanted to get a vasectomy. She said that we made the plan hastily and that we didn't have to stick to it. She also said that by getting the vasectomy, I would be essentially ""taking"" a third child away from her.

I thought about it for a while but came to the same conclusions. About a week later, I told her that I'd be going to get the procedure soon. I set it up so that my parents would take care of the kids, and I'd take time off of work so I wasn't placing an undue burden on her. She was expectedly upset and told me that if I went through with it, I'd be less of a man. I went and got the surgery, and my wife is still mad at me.

At the end of it all, I'm just sitting here wondering if I'm in the wrong. I still don't want to have kids, but if somehow I cave in the near future, I can get it reversed, we can adopt, etc. I'm starting to see what my wife is talking about, but I'm not sure if I'm just falling for some logical fallacy and I'd like some detached strangers to set me straight. If there are any parts that need clarification, ask away: I don't want this to be one of those one-sided story type of deals (although, I can't *literally* tell you what my wife was thinking, only what she told me).

P.S: I'm using a throwaway account. I let my wife use my main account to browse [r/Parenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/) and [r/AskParents](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/). That account isn't subbed to this account, so I should be in the clear. (I hope!)",654,1499,0.96

985,Asshole,"So some backstory, my friend lets call her Kate always has incredible nails.  I'm not sure whether she gets them done or does them herself, but they usually stand out in a good way until about 3-4 years ago.  Her and her boyfriend(now fiancé) have always had this pose for couple photos together.  I don't think there is a name for it but basically she puts her hand on his midriff slightly below his chest.    


With that out of the way, I being a lonely gay was perusing Grindr and stumbled across a profile.  Profile wasn't too out of the ordinary for Grindr ""Looking to experiment, bi-curious, not out"" something along those lines and obviously there was not face in the profile.  So at first glance it would seem pretty inconspicuous except the ""guy"" in the photo had a girl next to him, who had, incredibly. nice. nails. They obviously caught my eye and as I started examining more and more it became apparent to me that they looked incredibly familiar.  They were kate's nails.  I panicked, screenshotted it, and check to see if I could find the exact photo that was cropped for Grindr.  I can't remember if I did or not but I do remember being 100% certain that was them in the photo.  I didn't say anything to anyone at the time because I myself have been outed before and I certainly wasn't sure how to bring this up and even who to bring this up too.    


Now years have gone by and phones as well so to my knowledge I no loner have it in my possession and I completely forgot about it until I saw that they just recently got engaged.  I cringed when I saw the photo but otherwise just kept on minding my own business.  I wasn't planning on doing anything about it until my mother confronted me about it and asked me if I thought he was gay.  I more or less said I thought he was but my gaydar has been wrong before albeit not often but I didn't tell her about what I found.  She then started to tell my that through the grapevine ""everyone"" thinks he's gay, that he spends ""a lot of time with his friend Dylan(not real name)"", and ""Kate and him don't even have sex"".  Once again I just sort of danced around it.  I now started to dwell on it more and more and I asked some friends who don't/will never know Kate what they thought and they more or less said I would be an asshole for not saying something because he could be sleeping around and passing STDs to her without her knowing and also cheating.    


I'm pretty split between telling her or doing nothing and hoping that she knows about it and they're open. I'd prefer not to say anything because it isn't my business technically.  I think I'm the asshole either way for waiting this long to do something about it.  Do what y'all do best and I shall accept whatever verdict y'all decide on.",27,47,0.92
986,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a few nights ago.

My friend (who I don't personally consider a close friend, but they're a good friend nonetheless) confessed that they fell in love with me, which really took me by surprise. They had already told me 2-3 months ago that they had a little crush on me but that it had faded away, and since then they've also had crushes on several different people.

I'm the type of person that is rarely ever affectionate be it in actions/words/feelings, even to my closer circle of friends with the exception of 1 or 2 people. And most types of affection from people, that isn't my girlfriend, make me uncomfortable. My friends know this and respect it.

So the sudden confession made me feel really weird and out of place, like I froze up and didn't know what to do or say. I just went , ""Oh."" And there was a kind of pause before I proceeded to say ""Of course I don't feel the same"" in a joking way (this friend knows I was already dating someone). I tried assuring them we could still be friends if they wanted and that this doesn't have to affect our relationship in any way.

They started tearing up and I *tried* to comfort them by, well, patting them on the shoulder. They asked me if I could hug them for a while, and I froze up again. I turned them down politely, but I feel I made them even more upset. They shortly just left after that, and I haven't talked to or seen them since. 

I described the encounter to my girlfriend/friends and they called me cold. I know the friend who confessed in this situation wasn't the A-hole at all, I'm just wondering if I was? Should I have been more warm (is that the right word lol) to them?",27,140,0.96

My sex drive has gone down and I’m having terrible, irregular periods! (TMI, sorry!) I feel I am also moodier than usual.

991,Not the A-hole,"In Aug, Sister got engaged to her bf of 2 yrs. We're happy for them. I am expected to be a bridesmaid. I asked if it was alright that I'm not maid of honor bc I'm in my last year of college and dont have the extra time to do ""maid of honor"" tasks like bridal events, food tastings, etc. Sister said yes, that she'd prefer her best friend being MoH more. I'm a Graphic Design student. I offered to design invites and save the dates for her as my gift. She was happy to have someone tailor to what she wants for her invites and StDs. Took 2 days to finish and decide on lace sleeves and envelopes, but I was happy to do the work. 

2 weeks ago, parents; sister; and I drove to print shops to compare prices. One print shop we had to wait to get an estimate. While waiting, I told a story about a woman asking how I blow my nose (I have 3 nose piercings including a septum). Sister laughed with my mom, but said ""you're gonna push your septum in and cover your others for my wedding"". I was shocked and denied it. She continued to state ""and you're going to dye your hair"" (my hair is orange). I said to her that my hair is important and that it's an expression of myself as well as my piercings. Natural colors feel unnatural to me. My hair has been colored since I was 16, and recently I feel like I found who I'm supposed to be and how I want to exist physically. I'm comfortable with who I am and I love who I am. She also has tattoo sleeves and a nose piercing.

I've done damage to my hair by dyeing it in high school and paid a lot of money at salons to get it to a healthy point. Though it's orange, it's healthy/strong. To dye it to a ""natural"" color would damage my hair again. To color remove the natural tone to redye it to orange would hurt it a lot. I thought that was excessive damage to my hair for her one day, even if it's meant to be special.

Sister doesn't listen, and says that when she looks at photos that she doesnt want me to be the first thing she sees. I told my sister that I am hurt that she expects me to change my appearance just so she doesnt have to see me in photos. Also, she thinks I will catch attention at the wedding and not enough attention will be on her. ""It's my day, I want the attention on me. Why do you want to stand out in my wedding?"" She said. I said that I wouldn't stand out because our family knows what I look like and no matter what, the attention will be on her. She also is having her gay best friend be a bridesmaid. I asked her if she minded that he would catch attention, but she said that was different. 

AITA for not changing my appearance? I feel guilty bc I know she is more insecure than I am, but i partly feel hurt that she is put off by me and has never said anything before.

993,,"Throwaway because my mom uses reddit. 

Last night, my (20f) parents both went to a party to watch football. It is important to note that my mom has multiple chronic illnesses, migraines so bad that she loses her color vision, things that would make a loud party rather uninviting. So, she rarely goes to parties. My dad, on the other hand, is an extremely sociable man, loves to party and loves to be with friends. As a result, he gets mad when my mother doesn’t want to go out. Up until recently, I’ve been mum on this issue because i felt it wasn’t my place to insert myself in their marriage. 

Anyways, last night, my mom came home after halftime because she wasn’t feeling well. Nothing out of the normal. She went to bed about five minutes after getting home and taking her meds. My dad got home hours later- absolutely hammered. He comes into my room (I was playing video games) and tells me he was embarrassed by my mom. I didn’t really say anything in response, more like an “oh haha”. He continues on saying that its shitty that my mom doesn’t want to go with him places, that it’s embarrassing that he has to take me or my siblings to parties where his friends will be with their wives or husbands. I am sympathetic to this issue only because my dad and I share the fatal flaw of vanity, so I tell him its probably good that he doesn’t have the same marriages as his friends because all of his friends are unfaithful to their partners even after spending time at parties together. He then says that he will probably divorce my mom in a few years, after I’m in law school and my sister is through college. 

This is where I kind of think I messed up. In response, i said “if you do that, I’m going to cut you out”. He looked extremely surprised and said he didn’t expect that response. I am far closer to my mom than my dad, and far more sympathetic for her multiple illnesses than my dads bruised ego. I did not say any of that, but I did say “I think that’s asinine reasoning, and I’m not saying I would hate you, but I would be extremely upset if you broke up with mom because her illnesses make it hard for her to be social. Being as social as you is really hard, and she tries as it is to go places for you and with you.” After that he storms out, still mumbling about how he thought I’d be more sympathetic and be on his side. He doesn’t remember anything, but I still feel bad.

Now, I rent my house and the land next to it. My landlord gave them permission to do so. So permission is not the issue, I feel I should have had some input on it because I do rent the house and land, but I wasn’t given that. They gave him free internet for letting them do it and yes I get $15 off but they’re also using my power. I have calculated out the usage of power for one of the dishes used, they are varying sizes and styles, and it comes out to about $1.50 a month with the power rates here. There are 9 total and a couple fans to cool, what I am assuming is, the brains of the operation they have set up here. My power bill has definitely been a bit higher since they put it in. 

My biggest gripe is the quality of work they did. I’m very picky about my house and how things look around it. They trenched from my back deck, along a fence line that has a steep hill on the side they trenched. Instead of using the dirt they dug to fill it back in, they just sloughed the dirt from the top into the trench, which has made my fence unstable. At first it was just one dish, slowly it started to grow. I have a nice view of the town and a couple lakes and now I have this wood pole sticking up with dishes all over it impeding some of it.

In the last few months, I discovered r/showerorange . To save you a click, the subreddit revolves around the daily routine of eating an orange in the shower in a primal way.

I never thought this was an issue until my sister ""kindly"" informed me that it was barbaric and I ""shouldn't leave leave food to rot in the bathroom "". Since I replace the peel everyday, I thought there would be no harm in my actions but some of my family agrees that it is a little weird. So reddit, AITA?

Now, my sister is currently out of a job and divorced and needed a place to stay, so i let her stay at my house for as long as she once. But occasionally she and her kids will leave a window open while the ac is running. Whenever i confront them, the kids play dumb and my sister says that she forgot. And i know it isnt my kids because ive drilled it into my kids since childhood to not do that.


Edit: thank you all for replying. To those of you putting nta, i appreciate you for putting my thoughts into words. For those saying yta, you really have given me a lot to think about 


So this week, i came home at found yet another window open with the ac running. So i called out everyone and asked who did this. No one spoke up. And now, at this point, ive had enough. Despite the fact that i had a feeling it was my sisters kids, i pretty much said ""Everyone needs to stop leaving the fucking window open. From now on, no more ac at all"" in order to teach those shits a lesson.


That was 5 days ago. Ever since then, the ac has been off. My kids havent said anything about it to me, but i can see them grumbling around and my wife said that theyve been complaining about it to her. AITA?",115,276,0.93

1004,Not the A-hole,"I grew up in an upper middle-class family and my parents helped me out with education and a stipend to study. In return, my parents had input in my major and how I spent my time. I went along with it because of their generous contributions to my education and every-day expenses. They were very nosy and felt they had to approve my relationships as well. When I started dating the son of one of their closest friends, they were elated. I went along with it and we got married.

We had kids and I decided to stay home with them. When our kids were 4 and 2, I decided to go back to work. My husband was self-employed and had crazy hours. He wanted me to continue staying home with the kids. My parents always sided with my husband and in fact, my parents and parent-in-law would get together and weigh in on our decisions. I expressed my concerns about  not being able to re-enter the workforce if I continue to stay home. They (parents) vowed to take care of me and not to worry. 

So, my husband turned out to be doing some shady things with our family money and the business that he ran. He was abusing our money on side girlfriends. When I found out that our life savings had eroded to almost nothing and the infidelity, I filed for divorce. There was no income  so my child support was a ridiculous amount. I found some evidence that he was hiding money in shell accounts. I told my parents that I wanted to get a lawyer and try to recoup some funds. They dissuaded me (because it would have ruined their relationship with their close friend) and again said they're take care of me.

I went back to work and my degree was useless by then without relevant work experience and making minimum wage. They bought me a condo but otherwise I was scraping by for years. Then a year ago, my mom suddenly died from a blood clot. My dad almost immediately re-married to a woman decades his junior. He announced last week that he'd be changing his will to his new wife and cutting me out because he needs to make sure she will be supported. That was supposed to have been my nest egg. I was furious because I had directed my life to appease him and now he is cutting me out for a floozy who clearly does not care for him. Am I the asshole?",65,278,0.94

We divorced, and ever since I've been trying hard to both find friends and someone to date, but I am failing on both accounts, miserably. The closest people I have here besides my kids are my exes parents. I don't have any social support.

1006,Everyone Sucks,"My wife and I are both very musical people. I work in a studio for recording musicians and my wife is a music teacher. I play violin and nylon string guitar, she plays electric guitar.

We have separate finances and assets. It's a conscientious choice because our incomes are similar enough and we have about the same worth of valuables, we'd rather keeps things in our own names rather than joint ownership of it all. In case of separation, it's clear cut basically and avoids the headache. At least this is how we mutually justify it.

In our culture, it's appropriate to surprise your spouse with an expensive gift on the wedding day. We decided among ourselves to have a $1000 limit. I think we both had the same idea of something musical related.

My gift to her? A year in advance I ordered a ""Fender Custom Shop"" guitar made to her favorite specifications. I went overboard, way overboard, and spent around $4000. Maybe many of you are out of the loop but this is artisan built one-off quality, made by people at literally the ceiling of their occupation.

Her gift to me? Some new rosin. Bought off the shelf at my local music store with the pricetag still on the box. $12.99. I thought it was a joke but four years later I'm still waiting for the ha-ha payoff. It's something I think about every day, always in the background noise of my brain, just the disparity in our gifts.

We talk about this a lot. It's my ""go to"" petty line when we're fighting, something I say in the moment that really digs in. I argue that we should lift our separate assets ""clause"" for her wedding gift. What I got her is an investment, something you pass down to your kids, something that might be worth something some day. It's the most expensive single item either of us owns to give an idea. She insists it's hers and hers alone.

I'd be lying if I said this doesn't put a strain on our marriage but am I in the wrong? Whenever I ask why she spent $13 on my gift, she said she wanted to break the tradition of a sentimental gift on wedding nights because it's a turbulent topic in our culture. But she was all fine with it up until it happened, even asking me for ideas and dropping hints on what she wanted.

1008,No A-holes here,"This just happened earlier today. We went to see the movie ""It"" today at noon, there were 8 of us so we had it planned out and bought the tickets a week ago since it was hard to coordinate a time that worked for all of us. There were 7 or 8 other people there as well. About 10 minutes in a severely mentally handicapped person came in with who I assume was their caretaker. 

This person was EXTREMELY loud.. groaning noises, laughing fits, yelling out random words and phrases, and the occasional flat out scream. Nothing was done in reaction to the movie, he just clearly couldn't control the noises that were coming out. It was so loud I actually thought it was part of the movie at first, blasting out of the speakers louder than any of the dialogue in the movie. 

After 10 minutes everybody in our group was clearly upset, and I'm sure the other people in the theatre were as well. You couldn't focus on the movie at all it was so loud and so frequent, but nobody knew what to do. On top of that we still had 2 1/2 hours of movie ahead of us. 

I told my girlfriend we could all just ask for a refund and leave and try to come back another time, but it's unlikely we'd all find a time to get together to see it again. It would be a couple weeks before I had the time myself and the movie might not even be out anymorr. Plus we had all been looking forward to it all week. 

I just didn't think it was right to have somebody that disruptive in a movie theater when people are paying to see the movie and can't even focus or hear half the dialogue. I get it was a noon showing on a Sunday so they did attempt to go when it was likely to be pretty empty. But it still ruins it for those of us that were there. Honestly I'm not sure if the handicapped person was even able to understand the movie because of the severity of their disability or if it was just the caretaker that wanted to go. 

After a few screams that were so loud it made me wince, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to do something. So I got up and told an employee there was somebody who was being very loud and disrupting the movie, that they were mentally handicapped so they couldn't control it which is a very difficult situation but it was ruining the movie for everybody I was with and likely everybody in the theater.

They didn't know what to do at first and talked to a few other employees who immediately knew who I was talking about. Within the next 5 minutes they made him and his caretaker leave. 

When we talked about it later everybody was relieved when they left, but maybe it wasn't right for me to complain about that because the person had no control over it. I still think it was right, it's not like I complained because he was handicapped, I complained cause he was disruptive and ruining the experience we had paid for and planned out for a week.

I (25f) work on an office with all older guys (30s - 50s) and I feel like they've put some expectations on me because I'm the only girl. Like doing more of the ""people skills"" work like training new hires, or working with vendors, when my coworkers do more technical work. We all have the same job description and similar education.

I'm trying to find a new job but I don't know when something will come through and I want to keep my current job until I find something new.

Anyway, my manager asked me if I'd help organize an outing to celebrate winning a contract with a new client. And I said that I wasn't really good at that kind of thing. He said I should be able to manage something; it seemed like something ""I'd be a natural at"" which struck me as odd because I'm not too good at social planning and have never given any indication I am. He said ""It doesn't have to be a big thing, just do something nice and easy"" 

The most social planning I do is texting my friends last minute ""yo wanna party"" or showing up more or less on time to parties or concerts my friends invite me to. Or dropping by my friends apartments to hang out.

I kinda want to make the point that just because I'm a girl doesn't mean I should be asked to do the social organizing. And that I'm not naturally good at it because of who I am.

So I was thinking that I'd organize it like I organize most social things; asking without much notice if anyone wants to hang at a local divey bar. The sort of bar with lots of college students, young people in their 20s, and bottom dollar food and drinks. Keeping the time loose, letting people show up when they show up, hanging out with friends who come and go as they please instead of seeing a strict time.

And if anyone isn't happy with the plans (I figure they want something more upscale, less crowded, probably a private room) I'll just say that that's how I always plan things and that I'm sure it'd be chill. And that my boss said to just do something ""nice and easy"" and this sort of plan is the way I always plan my easy chill nights.

This shit has not happened to me before and I had all the girls who were there over before multiple times, minus Karen.

Now, when I notice my shit is gone I'm understandably pretty angry and wanting to get to the bottom of this.

There really wasn’t anything till I noticed for the first time that her shoulders rest at different heights, so I guessed that she had scoliosis. 

She can be a bit eccentric, and I realize now that I probably shouldn’t have guessed that but sometimes she’s pretty excited to show new injuries or things about herself you wouldn’t expect someone to be excited about. 

Anyway, she said no and that she grew 0.21 inches. We’re all in our 20s, so I guess it is a bit surprising she’s still growing but that could be a measuring error and even if it isn’t, how am I supposed to notice less than a fourth of an inch height difference.

1030,Not the A-hole,"A couple of months ago, I met a woman ""Anne"" while visiting an acquaintance at his office.  There seemed to be a spark and mutual interest; so I asked her for coffee.  It went quite well and she enthusiastically asked me to coffee again a few days later.  After that, we went on a few dates, talked about how we liked each other, and kissed a little bit. Because both of our jobs involve travel, there was about a month thereafter where one of us was on a work trip and we did not see each other in that time, though we did talk by email.

When we both were back in town, I SMS'd her for a date (we had discussed cooking together before parting ways).  She did not answer for a few days then finally did respond with an excuse related to being bogged down with work.  She suggested meeting for coffee but then never followed up or responded to set a time.  I assumed I was being blown off for whatever reason.  Finally she wrote back to admit that right after I had gone out of town, she'd met some guy and she wants to see where that goes.  Of course, that was disappointing, but what can you do in such a situation?  Edit: I'm not mad because it was so new and we weren't really together beyond having had a few dates.

The problem is, she SMS'd the next day asking if I would still be her friend because she enjoyed spending time together.  I was very frank with her and said I was not interested in a friendship.  My logic, which I explained, was that I had been spending time with her because I was romantically attracted to her, and since she has said she is not interested, I see no reason to spend time as friends. I have plenty of friends, and I am at an age where I am interested in meeting someone for a serious relationship.  I'm not interested in gaining a new friend.

She then told our mutual acquaintance about all of this but made it sound like I was trying to force her to continue the relationship.  He has asserted I am being immature and should accept her offer of friendship.  From my point-of-view, it's just as wrong to force a friendship as it would be if I tried to force a romantic relationship.

1038,Not the A-hole,"So, a little background.

My father is extremly controling and even though i'm 18 i still have to ask permission for nearly everything, including if i can go to the store or literally just across the yard to my neighbor's. His controling behavior didn't really bother me that much when i was younger because i was extremly introverted and didn't have friends at all, but in the last 2-3 years i met some incredible people who i'm lucky to call my friends and i changed as a person i became more talkative and more confident, however i started wishing i'd spent more time with them especially because some of them don't even go to the same school as me and i dont get to see them at all.

And thats how te problem was created I would ask my father if i can go hang out with my friends and he wouldn't let me, mind you these were reasonable requests i would ask to go hang out with them at 3pm and i would promise to be back by 6pm but he still wouldn't let me, my friends arent a bad company either none of them do drugs, they don't smoke and they don't even consume alcohol frequently, etc. So in order to spend more time with them i started lying i would say im going to the library but wouldn't tell im also meeting with a friend, or i would say im going on a ride with my motorcycle and i would park at my boyfriend's house and hang out with him, just stuff like that. I would do this maybe once or twice on a good week.

As you may already guessed it my father found out, there was a lot of screaming in the house, i got banned from going anywhere except to school and back home, i got called names, etc.

I know i shouldn't lie to him but i kinda just wanted a bit of social life and i really used this as my last plan. I tried talking to him multiple times throughout the course of 3 years but it never worked. My mind is a mess right now because i know i'm an asshole for lying to him but then again i just wanted some social life like any other teenager and talking to him never worked.

1042,Not the A-hole,"Forgive any formatting issues, on mobile.

I (22F) recently received a promotion at work, and an accompanying pay raise. Without disclosing how much I make, I’ll say that I make about 50% more now than I did in April, so it’s fairly significant. I currently live at home, as it’s the most convenient and my parents have long recommended I stay as long as possible, though I am actively looking at moving out within the next year. On to the situation at hand.

My mother wants to discuss finances with me. Not just budgeting or tips and the like, but down to the very last dollar. She wants to see my taxes, my current student loan debt, my credit card debt, my savings, my credit reports, my 401k. Anything involving my current financial state she wants to see. My father is going along with it because he doesn’t really care either way, and it’s not worth arguing with my mother.

I’ve told her again and again that I don’t think it’s necessary or proper for me to disclose that information to her, as I’m not entirely comfortable with it to begin with. I don’t think she needs access to personal information such as this, given that I’m an adult and it doesn’t impact her what I do with my money. I understand that in her mind, she is just trying to help, but I feel as though she doesn’t trust my ability to manage my own money even as a fairly independent adult.

So, Reddit, AITA here and I should just give in? Or am I in the right and should stand my ground?

Edit: There are a few things I’ve seen in comments that I want to respond to.

1) I do not pay rent at this time. I have offered but they have declined on several occasions. Their reasoning is that my father lived at home until he married my mother at age 32, and during that time he was able to focus on school, working, and saving for the future.

2) My mother brought this up when I first got promoted in July. I told her I needed some time, because with the pay increase, I wasn’t entirely sure what my biweekly pay would look like (although I am full time, I am paid hourly). About two weeks after my promotion, my company went through a pay restructure, which resulted in another pay increase and the addition of weekly bonuses. With all of these changes in mind, I told her I especially was not ready to sit down with her at that time.",24,29,0.86
1043,Asshole,"This is for a friend.

My friend Debbie got pregnant around the same time as Martha. They were both so excited to have children. They were bonding as new mothers and did everything together. Baby names, baby clothes, due dates, baby showers, all of it. They did it together. I am not close to Martha, but Debbie and I have been close friends for years.

Around 10 or 12 weeks in, Debbie lost her baby. She didn't know the gender, but she did share that if it were a boy, his name would be Ethan. If a girl, her name would be Emily. She was devastated. I tried to support her and be there for her as much as I could, but distance made it hard. 

Martha stuck by Debbie, trying to help her and support her through this ordeal. However, Martha didn't lose her baby. She gave birth to a little boy. 

She named him Ethan, much to the distress of Debbie. Martha has not explained herself other than she said she loves the name and it's her baby, so she can name him whatever she wants. She was also actually shocked, because she felt like she was making a tribute to Debbie's deceased baby and she thought Debbie would be okay with it. Martha's family was even offended when Debbie wasn't happy with the baby being born and his name being Ethan. 

Is Martha the asshole? What do I do now for Debbie?

1045,Not the A-hole,"One of my best friends is getting married this fall, and though none of her bridesmaids really knew one another before this, we’ve really bonded (for the most part) despite all being relatively different people.

I say “for the most part” because one bridesmaid - let’s call her Shelly - does not seem to understand this wedding is about the bride (we’ll call her Allison.)

Allison is the sweetest, mildest, most non-confrontational person imaginable, so she hasn’t complained when Shelly has done things like demand to try on bridal dresses alongside her, insisted on opening gifts with her at her bridal shower, and complained incessantly on group email threads about not being MOH. (For the record, Shelly had her own $100k wedding two years ago, so it’s not like she hasn’t been through this process before.)

Finally, at Allison’s bachelorette party yesterday, Shelly complained all through a three-hour wine tasting about her flight, the hotel, our brunch, and how she wanted to go to the beach, not Napa. Allison has repeatedly expressed to me privately how upset she is that Shelly has been so difficult through this whole process, but that she feels she has to include her since she’s known her since preschool.

I could see Allison nearly in tears at our tasting, so I finally got fed up and told Shelly to either “grow the f**k up and quit whining, or go home,” and that I’d personally pay for her ticket if she chose the latter.

1046,Not the A-hole,"My ex husband and I were married for 5 years. 3 years into the marriage I found out he was cheating on me through text messages. He begged me to take him back and that he would never do it again. I took him back more for the sake of our very young son (he was 2 at the the time) We even did marriage counselling. A year later I found out he was still cheating on me with the same girl. I ended it. 

I have custody the majority of the time. My ex gets 2 weekends a month. I hate him but I try to keep it civil for the sake of our son and try not to talk badly about him in front of our son. It’s been 8 months since our divorce was finalized and he is getting married to his mistress. Apparently she is pregnant so they are rushing it. Last week he calls me up about the date of the wedding (a date in October) saying he wants our son to be there. The date of the wedding is 1. A weekend I have custody 2. The day of his cousins (my sister’s son) 7th birthday party. My son is very close his cousin and my sister has a fun party she is planning I told my ex there is now way is my son going to the wedding. He said that I was being a bitter bitch. I tell him that if he really wanted his son to be there he would have scheduled the wedding on a weekend he had custody or actually checked with me before booking the date. I’m not changing up my schedule to accommodate a wedding to his mistress. He starts complaining about how that was the only date they could get in short notice and how he can’t change the date because of the venue and how his fiancés parents have already booked their flights to come in and it’s a small wedding and it would be weird for his son not to be there and I’m causing drama for no reason. His mom (who I’ve remained cordial with) then calls me up and begs me to allow my son at the wedding. I say no.

So it was raining very bad out and I didnt want to take my kid on the public transit for how rainy it was and how young he was so we decided to drive to the stadium and park at the stadium. The second we got into the vehicle and started driving my mom started complaining saying we should have just taken the light rail and she doesnt want to pay for parking because she knows right now I'm not doing great financially and am living paycheck to paycheck with everything going on in my life. As we get closer she starts getting louder in the car and basically yelling at me for making her pay for parking. As we are on the highway about to get on to the main highway to get us to the stadium I have the choice of going north or south, north takes us to the game south takes us home and I looked at her and said,"" fine we don't need to go to the game so you dont need to pay for parking I can just turn around and we can go home"" she sits in silence for a second then continues to complain about how much she will spend on parking so at the last second I went south to go home which resulted in silence for the 25 min drive back to her house.

My daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we’ve all been sharing mine. 

My 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and I know why. She’s masturbating. It’s uncomfortable but I want her to know her body.

But she’s been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. I’ve told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don’t need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this I’m going to get rid of it.

This morning it was once again left on my counter, so I threw it away in the outside trash. 

She stormed into my bedroom while I was getting ready yelling at me about how dare I throw away something she paid for with her own money, and I’m just trying to shame her blah blah blah. 

It was a relatively expensive vibrator, and I do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but I feel like I had to because she wasnt listening.


AITA for throwing away my daughters vibrator?

ETA: I’m her mom. I’d be fucking mortified if I was her father and I knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. My husband and I are divorced.

ETA #2: I thought about hiding it, but I know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. Doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. While yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. She goes to school (which I’m SO PROUD of) and she works part time. Other than that, I care for all her needs. This is my house and my young children and she didn’t respect my boundaries I tried to gently but firmly set the first time. Maybe that makes me the asshole and I will full heartedly accept that.


Last edit but I’m fixing the bathroom. I’m not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. This has only been over the course of a week.

1050,Asshole,"I'm (36) and in my last year of law school.  Throughout the process, my wife (33) has been super supportive, and a fantastic mother to our 2 year old.  Now that I'm poised to graduate, she rightfully wants to pursue her career.  She's determined to be a dermatologist.  However, I voiced some concerns.  Namely, the HUGE time commitment that med school will be.  She seems to brush it off, much to my frustration.  She has yet to start undergraduate school, so that's 4 years.  From what I understand, med school will be an *additional* 4 years, and *another* 3-7 years of residency.   Even under the most liberal estimation, that's another 11 years before she's an MD.   Not to mention that during that time she will basically be MIA due to the demand of med school.  Meanwhile, I will be taking the bar and starting an extremely demanding career where I will be the sole money maker and caretaker of our 2 year old.

I've never said she should NOT go, only that the time commitment is very real, and that she should consider alternatives such as Nurse Practitioner, OT school, etc.  Yet, every time the conversation has come up she gets SUPER defensive.  She's even said, ""maybe we should just get a divorce and I can do what I want.""

I want to be supportive, and honestly, if she already had undergrad under he belt  (as I did before starting law school) I'd be more behind the idea.

So, AITA for telling my wife that she probably shouldn't go to med school?

EDIT: lots of YTA, and that's fine.  I just want to clarify a few points:  First, my law school was paid for through GI Bill.  Second, the decision for me to go to school occurred prior to marriage and was discussed at length before the baby came along.  Third, the desire to go to med school came out of the blue, it was roughly a month ago when she brought it up.  She had worked in a hospital after high school as a PT assistant and always said that she *didn't* desire to get back into the medical field.  I think the idea for med school came about after her friend got in (he's single, 10 years younger, and has scholarships).  Finally, I NEVER suggested that she NOT go, only that I had concerns, but every time we start to talk about it she gets upset to the point that we can't have a calm discussion about the pros and cons.",937,2165,0.94

Last week it was broken to me that my birth parents are actually my adoptive parent's distant cousins. They gave me away for adoption and are now married and has a son, my biological brother who had no idea that I existed. I have actually met the family twice during big family gatherings at my grandfather's house and had no idea who they were. I guess it was kept a secret too because nobody among the relatives talked about it.


Just out of curiosity I looked up their contact details and messaged my birth mother. I love my adoptive parents, but I want to get to know my biological family a little more, especially my brother, he is 11 years old now, not that far from me.


She asked me to not message or try to contact her family before blocking me. I tried messaging my birth father, and he took very long to reply me. He was more patient and explained to me that he wants me to put my focus on my adoptive parents and we are all better off without each others. When I asked to talk with him face to face, he blocked me too.


This just makes me so angry. They are not divorced or child free but they just gave me up for adoption? Is it because of my birth defects? I looked up into social media and saw that those 2 had quite some reputation as public servants.

 We were having a farewell dinner with my aunt and uncle because I'll be flying to the UK to start University. Because I don't have much time left in the country I brought up the issue of me getting a replacement phone. I'm not the type of guy who needs to have a new phone every year. I'm only asking to change my phone now because for the past 3 months I going from fully charged to 50% in 5 minutes. I brought this to my parent's attention 2.5 months ago so I wasn't exactly springing a trap on them. We discussed it a bit with my uncle and aunt but eventually they agreed to get it for me as an early birthday present and everything was good.

Then my Dad started to bring up issues like how I need to study hard in school and not waste my life away. I'd be completely fine if it wasn't the 32nd time in the past week. To give you an idea of the kind of people they've been acting like recently: they reminded me that I had to go out shopping to buy winter clothes for the UK as I won't be used to the cold weather. Fair enough. This was 4 months ago btw. There was a discount going on at a local clothing store this month so naturally I didn't stock up right away. For 3 months straight at least once every 2 days they would come in and ""remind"" me to go stock up on winter clothes. It's more like a lecture on how i need to be responsible when I tell them that I'm waiting for a sale every time.

As you can probably guess, this dinner wasn't the first time they brought up the issue of me studying hard overseas. I'll admit, after hearing the same shit come out of my Dad's mouth for the 10000th time over the course of the last year I got a bit pissed off and told him to drop. Nothing vulgar and rude. Just a simple: ""That's enough. We've had this conversation before I'm sick of listening to the same thing over and over again when I can't do anything about it"". Cue him flying off the handle talking about how I don't appreciate the good life I'm living now etc.

But this isn't even the worse part. The worst part is that after he got mad in the restaurant he said ""you know what, you can forget about your new phone"". This is when I blew up. The reason i got so mad is because like everything else, this isn't the first time he's pulled some similar shit. It's always the classic ""I promised you something but now i'm going to create a situation where you're rude to me so I can now use this as an excuse to back out of my promise"". When I was 5 it was a deck of Pokemon cards that I really wanted. When I was 8 it was a Moleskin calendar notebook, at 13 it was a football jersey, at 14 it was a wallet and then later a pair of headphones, at 16 an eggbeater so that I could cook for whoever came to the house for dinner. There are probably many more that I can't remember. Well this time he got out of the chair to leave the dinner half way and tried to create a scene in front of my family. So I kind of lost my shit and called him a ""15 year old in an adult's body man child"". AITA?",75,107,0.9

I am the youngest out of three. I am more of an introvert, but I have dated around a fair bit since my teen years, but have been with my my current partner now almost 5 years.

My sister is older than me by about 7 years. She is an extrovert and social butterfly. Very obviously our parents' favorite and got spoiled a lot. She's not a brat, but has always had really high standards for everything in her life. This includes guys, so basically she's only ever dated one guy for like, 4 years, but they broke up 3 years ago. She's still friends with her ex though.

My brother is older than me by about 10 years and has very functional autism. He's capable of understanding and picking up on other's thoughts/emotions through their words and actions, but he struggles some and he worries about it. It gives him a lot of anxiety and he has no idea what to do when he thinks people are upset. He struggles also to express how he is feeling. He seemed perfectly content on being alone, but just under two weeks ago introduced his first ever girlfriend to the family. I haven't met her face-to-face yet, but if she makes my brother happy, I am sure she's awesome.

Since my brother told everyone about his new girlfriend, my sister's been posting a lot on social media about being single, having been dumped in the past, etc. It is so much to the point where my partner is asking if my sister is okay.

I get that my sister is probably going through something right now. She's now the single one out of the three of us. I wouldn't be surprised if people were now asking her when she was going to find someone. It was always presumed that my sister would be the first of us to get married/have kids. Hell, our mom always used to ""joke"" that my sister was her only hope to have grandkids (though that was mostly directed at me and my brother and I don't know if our mom actually ever said that to my sister).

It is very obvious to me that my sister is bothered by our brother having a girlfriend now. I don't know if it is because she's feeling alone/hurt, if she's jealous, or if people are saying things to her and she's not taking it well. I don't know if our brother has picked up on it or not but it wouldn't surprise me if he had, and was stressing about it internally. This should be a time where our brother is happy, not stressed or worried.

His dad is an exec for Walmart and while I don’t think he was spoiled, he grew up a little clueless about how most people live. They could afford to have my MIL stay home and do everything for her kids. They have and still do go on multiple cruises a year and pay for most of their adult kids living expenses, when my husband and I married I put a stop to that because I’m very independent. All of his siblings are grown up and the two others that are married still have their parents pay for everything. My bringing up wasn’t the worst by any means but there was different forms of abuse from some people and my parents had to work more, we didn’t go without food but we did have to cook for ourselves since parents were working, hubby had hot breakfast made for him every morning growing up. MIL came to visit recently and we went out to eat. She got weird and apologized for the one time she yelled at him while he was growing up and that led to us talking about his upbringing. I was trying to be sensitive about my words and suggested that the fact she was able to stay home full time meant they were better off than most. She seems to think they were poor for some reason, and said “We were able to afford me staying home because we made the proper sacrifices, other families where the mother worked didn’t prioritize because they felt the need to buy the things they WANT and not NEED.” I lost it there and without yelling told her off. Hubby gave me a dirty look and when we got home asked me to treat his mother with respect. I normally would oblige but she has repeatedly insulted me or my family and my husband never confronts her.

I should say that this kid is SMART. Super articulate for a four YO, and I've been to family gatherings and seen her hold her own in a room full of adults and speak just like them, but I've also been to her birthday parties with her friends, and with them she can act and talk like any other 4 year old girl. I work with kids in a nursery and have never seen anything like this. Bro says she's top of her class and calls her a child prodigy and I can definitely believe it. I'm saying this because she must also be smart enough to understand by now that certain things are wrong. 

At the end of the day I noticed that one of my prized possessions, a tiny snowglobe my OH bought me years ago, was gone. SIL found it in Nieces pocket, and I told her off for it, saying that it was very bad to take things that aren't yours and that she did something very mean. I told her to apologise. None of this is out of the ordinary to how we treat the kids at the nursery but her parents went mad and told me that it's their job to tell her off not mine. All this time Niece was sobbing and hugging her daddy's leg, and bro was cheeky enough to try and negotiate with us if there was any way niece could keep the snowglobe. I was very annoyed at this, but SIL said it was inappropriate for me to give their child a lesson on stealing or to ask for an apology. 

Bro and SIL left after Niece had calmed down, but she was still trying to ask me if she could please take the snowglobe. I kept saying no and she was in tears when they left. 

As I said, I didn't speak to niece any differently to how I'd tell off a child at the nursery, and we've never had a parent make a fuss, so I don't see why they got so upset at me telling her off for stealing.

Last night Steve, Abby, Tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. I continued being friendly to Abby, while not really having a response to that. I went to the bathroom and when I came out of the stall Abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200B;

I'll cut a giant argument short, but Abby accused me of breaking up with Tom to get with Steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that I was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that I'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that I should have left the group when Tom and I broke up. My response to this was to tell Abby to 'know' her place and that I had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and Steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200B;

Abby went out and told Steve I attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. Since then, I've gotten messages from Abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, I am and that Steve and I were fucking the whole time. One girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' I am. My own brother says he feels that I've caused this drama myself by

Extra info as required:

Holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. And I did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I did mean 27 in the post - I failed to mention that Abby is actually 22; but I do highly accept that I could have handled the situation much better; I am NOT a confrontational person. I grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which I hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. I think being ambushed is why I lost my cool. 

&#x200B;

I read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". I don't know how to not make it do so. I'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. I'm shy, awkward, I stumble over my words; and because I \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. I do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200B;

Boundaries - I'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if I'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. Again - childhood abuse. Once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200B;

Somebody mentioned that I'm obviously into my friends if I got with Tom. Tom and I kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. We all thought it was going to be forever - but Tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. He doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200B;

The long version of the argument began with Abby asking why I was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); I stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200B;

As a last note - the previous girlfriend of Steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, I stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. It was about 2 weeks before Tom of all people got it out of me and he went to Steve and told him. I offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words I said were, and they all said ""No, she's in the wrong"" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand I was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. This was repeated to me this morning when I showed the messages I was getting from Abby and her friends. I was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - I know) and was told by Steve ""well she obviously wasn't wife material then"". being friends with these guys for so long and that I should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. He also feels that I'm leading on any man I'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if I have or am sleeping with. So - AITA?",1712,13441,0.87
1066,Not the A-hole,"
I'm (17F) the eldest child, and so basically have been a live in nanny/ babysitter / parent no. 3 for my siblings (15F and 12M) since I was 12/13. 

My Dad was (and is) really strict on me, especially in comparison to my little brother. When I was my brother's age, I was in bed at 9 pm EXACTLY every night. He technically has a 9 - 9.30 pm bedtime, and my mum really tries to enforce it, but my dad either completely forgets about it or tells my mum to shut up when she asks him to get my bro to bed, usually because he's busy watching TV or youtube with him.

I hate the way my dad treats my mum, and I hate how he is allowing my little brother to become a spoilt brat, with absolutely no responsibilities or rules that he has to follow. 

This anger has been building up for a while, and it was why I did what I did tonight. So, heres what happened.

My mum asked me to go tell my brother to get ready for bed at around 9, so I went downstairs to the office/guest bedroom/ tv room/ whatever to relay that message. Brother and dad are watching what looks like some horribly violent war thingy, loads of bomb sounds and gun noises etc, and I shout over the tv to tell them that bro should get to bed soon. Dad says ok, they'll stop at the end of the scene, so I left them to it. I came back at 9.30, neither of them had moved, so I repeated the instructions, and got screamed at to leave the room because ""it was the most important bit!!!"". I was honestly just so sick of their crap so i just reached in and switched it off and walked away, because my brother has to get to bed on time on a school night, and I had already given them half an hour's warning to pause the bloody thing. 

They both went ballistic, started swearing at me, calling me a stupid cow, a bitch, and the likes, which is the kind of behaviour I can somewhat justify from a 12 year old, but not my 55 year old father. My dad followed me back upstairs, fully screaming at me, calling me abusive, obsessed with being in control, a psychopathic bitch, etc etc. I screamed back, calling him a child, and saying that I wouldnt have to do this kind of shit if he bothered to actually parent his child! He then accuses me of assault, supposedly for turning the tv off, which was interesting.

My dad starts yelling at my mum next, saying that it was her fault for making me relay her messages instead of coming down herself, which isn't fair bc my mum was busy cooking dinner for tomorrow. By this time i'm like fully sobbing, screaming at him to shut up and leave us alone, but he just keeps on yelling so I just ran to my room in tears. 

I feel kinda bad about turning the tv off, i'd probably be mad if it happened to me, but I feel like my dad's reaction was completely unreasonable.

So, AITA for switching the tv off ? did my dad have a right to be that angry? ",274,1288,0.94
1067,Not the A-hole,"Basically what the title says. 

My dog Cerberus is a bit of a mutt. He was a rescue and was found as a stray so we're not entirely sure *what* he is, but judging by his size and the shape of his head, there's some Doberman in him somewhere. He's a big, big guy and I get that he looks a bit intimidating and hell-houndish (hence why I named him Cerberus) but he's honestly the chillest dog I've ever met. He only really gets excitable at playtime; other than that he's a lazy sod and is incredibly content to just lie down in his favourite spot for literal *hours* and only get up for food. 

The issue at hand happened yesterday. I had a small gathering at my house. Not so much a party, but just a handful of friends over to play board games, eat food and drink wine. One of the people in attendance was my friend's new girlfriend of ~2months. She hadn't been to my place yet and hadn't met Cerberus. According to my friend, she'd given no indication prior that she was nervous of dogs but as soon as she arrived at mine she became visibly on edge. I asked what was up and she (quite rudely) said ""Nobody mentioned there was gonna be a *massive* dog here."" I kinda laughed and said ""Oh yeah but don't worry he probably won't move all evening."" She asked if he could be put outside or something because she'd been ""almost bitten"" (her words) by a Doberman as a child and was frightened of him. I said no to putting him outside because it was chilly and that's not fair, but did concede to put him in the kitchen while we played games. I thought that was the end of it, but the GF later got up to go to the toilet, which meant she had to cross through the kitchen. While in the kitchen she began screaming and freaking out. We naturally rushed through and she said that Cerberus had gotten up and came over and ""made to attack her"". I argued this wasn't the case, he'd simply gotten up and come over because he was curious who was in the room. She insisted it was terrifying and I kept arguing that I *know* my dog, he's never bitten anyone in the four years I've had him and he's not vicious. She kept saying ""any dog can turn"", which I agreed to, but maintain that he hadn't and wouldn't. She and my friend eventually left. She's maintaining that he tried to bite her and made her ""afraid for her life"" and that he should've been put outside. I'm maintaining that if he'd acted as viciously as she's saying we'd have heard barking or growling or something, and we didn't, alongside the fact that he is categorically not an aggressive dog. My friend says we're both being dicks;he thinks she's overexaggerating but I'm being an arse by writing her off completely. AITA?",211,338,0.91
1068,Not the A-hole,"A couple days ago I had come home from school and was tired. (Long day, separate story). I knew I had to get the lawn done at some point but I procrastinated and started doing it later, around 8. The way my lawn is set up is that there is a front and backyard, the front being broken up into five pieces by walkways, and the back one big piece of lawn. Doing it all probably takes 30 minutes. I was halfway done with one of the pieces of the front lawn when my next door neighbor showed up.

This lady (who I'm going to call Barbara) has lived in this neighborhood for about 4 or 5 years. We had never spoken before, I don't know her real name, and I only knew she existed because I had seen her walk her daughter to the elementary school nearby.

Barbara walked up to me, pulled the headphones I was wearing off my head, and just said ""STOP!"" in a rude tone. I turned off the lawnmower and faced her. Barbara said that her daughter was sick and trying to sleep, and the lawnmower was too loud for her to sleep. I didn't believe this because my lawnmower is a push mower, not a big riding mower and that it isn't excessively loud. My dad occasionally mows the lawn and while I can hear it running inside the house, it is easily ignorable.

I decided to give this lady the benefit of the doubt and said that I will finish this one section of yard and do the rest later. Finishing this one section would be only a couple minutes. Barbara said no, and that i needed to stop immediately. I explained how short she would have to wait for me to finish, but she wasn't having any of it. This continued for another minute before I put my headphones back on and started mowing again. She should there for a second, yelling at me,but realizing I wasn't going to talk to her, walked away. I mowed the entire yard, taking 15 or so minutes. I feel bad that a kid may of been robbed of sleep because of me, but I don't understand why it would be an issue because it shouldn't have been that loud. Did I make a good decision or did I do something rude and mean to a kid?",31,62,0.93
1069,No A-holes here,"I'm 35 years old. Whenever I go somewhere on vacation, my mom, dad and sister all want the name, address (and sometimes phone number) of where I'll be staying. I understand that this is a ""good thing"" and ""yay safety"" and all that. But for whatever reason, it just gets under my skin that every time I plan a vacation, it means that I 'owe' a certain amount of information to several people. When I have tried to tell them that I prefer not to give out those specifics (they know the general area of where I'll be) and that they can contact me by phone as usual, they tend to get pretty upset and say that I'm being weird and difficult. AITA?

Edit: Now I have another question. This issue seems to have really divided people, with lots of people falling in both camps. When social situations that are very divided crop up, does it even matter if one is technically not TA? Because if about half of people are going to think you're a major a-hole, and if half of those people's friends are going to tell them you're being an a-hole when they talk to them to bitch about you, the narrative for many many people will basically be that you're an a-hole. It won't really matter if you're technically in the right or whatever. So when there are issues that are are super evenly divided like this, is the best course of action to just try to please the people you want to keep a relationship with, even if they technically may be the more unreasonable one in the scenario?

1071,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: yesterday me and my friends, 12 people in total, we tailgating. For non-Americans this is where you set up tents, tables, chairs, food, beer, etc. before a sporting event and just have a great time before you go into the game. 
Well, where we tailgate charges $100 a game to set up. I paid this. I ALSO supply everything. The tents are mine, most of the chairs are mine, the FOOD was mine, I brought 6lbs of BBQ. Me and my wife got there at about 8:00 am to set up. Everyone else kinda rolls in throughout the day. Now, people bring their own alcohol, I don’t supply that. And some people brought sides and desserts. Now, I don’t want to sound like this is a complaint. I LOVE doing this. This is my favorite event we do every year. I don’t mind doing all the food because I love to cook and if I do everything, it makes everyone else’s time more enjoyable and we don’t have to worry about everyone bringing/doing random things, I just do it all. 

So, at the end of the day I asked everyone to pitch in $10 for the tailgating spot. With 12 people, this came out to be $120 to me. One of my buddies made a stink about it saying that I was trying to take more money from my friends than I actually paid. Which honestly, is correct. It was $20 more than what I paid. But my point is, I’m the only one going through actual trouble to do this. I’m the one who owns everything, stores everything all year, schedules everything, buys and cooks all the food, etc. I think I *actually* tallied everything up and split the cost it would be a lot more than $10. 

So, am AITA for asking for a little bit more money than what was actually due because of the effort I put into it?

Edit: I forgot to mention. This is the first year we have had to pay for tailgating. Every year our school has just been free. Well, we moved up in conference and we got new light and shit and that cost money, I get it. So we’ve been tailgating for nearly a decade and this is the first year money was involved.",26,50,0.94

1073,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend has gained a bit of weight recently which I absolutely do not mind, but she is very insecure about. She doesn't want to have sex unless it's completely dark and sometimes goes as far to insist she wears a shirt during, won't go out shopping and has taken to just ordering her clothing online, and won't sit down and eat a meal with me half the time. I've tried little things to try to make her feel better like telling her her bum looks amazing right now, that she's looking radiant, and that I love her no matter what sort of size she is and that won't change. It seems to help somewhat but she's still quite down, so I thought I should make more of an effort to try to make her feel wanted.

I decided I should set up a cheesy night for us both to see if it helped and set out some candles, got a nice bouquet of flowers, got busy in the kitchen and prepared her a surprise dinner of her favorite foods. She actually really liked it, was a lot more smiley than usual, and even sat down and ate with me for once. It was all going well but after dessert she started to comment about how she shouldn't be eating this stuff or she'll get even bigger and I won't want to do things like this any more. I started to assure her that this wasn't the case and told her I dated her because I love her for her personality, and that I wasn't dating her for looks and that wasn't what attracted me to her.

Apparently this was the worst thing to say because she immediately started crying, asked me why the fuck I'd say that and actually just up and left. I was completely baffled and when I tried to call her she refused to pick up and didn't speak to me for a full day. Now she's back home but she's being extremely short and emotional towards me and honestly it's a little unfair. I told a female mate of mine what happened and she said I was a complete asshole to say that and got annoyed at me, but none of my male friends think I did anything wrong so I'm wondering if its just her being biased towards another female. I didn't say she was ugly or anything of the sort. To be honest I'm kind of shocked at the strength of her reaction and a little upset myself to have all my effort pushed back in my face like this.

She still is avoiding me and I don't know what I'm meant to do here. It's like walking on eggshells right now and all I did was try to make her feel better. Am I really the asshole here?",736,4435,0.96

1077,Asshole,"I'm a pretty private person and as a rule don't kiss and tell, but recently I made an exception to this rule and pretty much every queer friend I have in my life is split on if I did right or wrong.

There is this guy (lets call him John) who I met a while back during a party a mutual friend of us were holding. We hit it off but actually didn't immediately hook up and instead developed a friendship which soon turned into a FWB situation. I was pretty surprised when he came onto me given he seemed so straight laced, but I was pretty open to it and let him keep it on the down low out of respect for where he was on his journey. Eventually John ended up moving when he graduated and our relationship ended there, but thing were still amenable and we talk from time to time.

Recently I found John deep in the comment section of a relatives of his comment section, debating against the normalization of gay relationships and gay adoption. I was pretty shocked by this and pretty much immediately sent him a private message asking why he was arguing against queer rights when he himself was queer. Rather than respond normally he just responded with ""?"". Literally just that. Then continued on with his hateful point of view right after.

I admit I got a little wound up over that and after I saw him post more hate right after sending me that, I publicly asked him why he was against queer people and queer relationships when he himself engaged in them and linked something about self hating homosexuals. Pretty much immediately things blew up, I got a ton of furious messages from him and a bunch of people took notice and it's apparently gotten really big. He blocked me then unblocked me to send a tirade at me asking me what the fuck I thought I was doing making up these lies (another thing that just blew my mind) and telling me I was fucked in the head. I also got a ton of messages from mutual friends of ours asking if this was true and asking me to spill the beans.

I thought I was in the right and was pretty resolute in that but the mixed reaction I've got from my friends has me wondering if I was too harsh.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open.

1085,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory ""throwaway acct"" and mobile formatting warning.

Starting off with background: bf and I live together, share bills but use separate bank accounts, and have a baby due in January.

So my bf works for a super shitty company. They have promised many things, only to NOT deliver on them at all. To make a long story short, they pile hours on him to where he's working 40 hours in 3 days, shorting his holiday pay, not giving him his promised raise, etc etc. He needs a new place to work because we have a baby coming soon and we need more stability than that.

That being said, he complains constantly that he can't find another job that pays as well, and that he can't ever seem to get hired. He also complains that there are never jobs hiring that he's qualified for or interested in. At the same time, he doesn't let me help him apply for jobs or send him job links. He finally caved a few weeks ago after having no luck on his own.

On the 7th of September I sent him 3 government jobs online that he was qualified for to apply for. I asked him every day or two until last night (the 14th) whether he's applied to them. He told me today that he did. The last time I asked was the morning of the 12th, and last night he told me he applied the night of the 12th for all 3 jobs.

Only problem is that if the 3 jobs, 1 of them had a deadline of September 9th. So I know he didn't apply for all 3.

I'm upset because he's lying to me for absolutely no reason. After I realize this I ask him if he just wants me to stop bothering him about jobs and leave it up to him, because I think that he's lying to get me to shut up basically. He gets defensive and upset over it, saying he didn't lie, he's telling the truth. I ask him to prove it. The website shows you what jobs you've applied for and saved, so it should be right on the homepage of he's being honest. He then switches to ""Well I'm not going to reward your behavior with proof that I'm right""

Now, I've been cheated on, lied to, and abused a good amount. So I know a liar's rhetoric when I see it. I know that that's some shit my exes have said when they're hiding something or lying. I don't think he'd cheat on me, but my trust is not something to be trifled with, and one lie makes me wonder what else he lies about.

So now we're at an impasse. I don't like being lied to for no reason. It breaks the trust I have with people. Trust for me (because of aforementioned exes) is very difficult to make, keep, and damn near impossible to regain. So I'm demanding he show me proof that he's lying/telling the truth, and he is demanding an apology for me calling him a liar.

1086,Not the A-hole,"When I was an undergraduate in school \~1999, I needed private loans in addition to federal loans to pay for school.  My dad offered to loan me the money with **terms of 8.75% interest starting at disbursement (while I was in college)**. I was 20 at the time and certainly was not at all financially with it, and I felt it was either take the loan or not attend college.

After college, I basically refinanced my federal student loans around 2004 likely everyone else to 3.5%. While I was in medical school and graduate school these loans and interest were deferred while I finished my training. During this 15 year period after college, my dad had not mentioned a single thing about the loan to me. I presumed he had decided to forgive them, but I didn't ask directly.

I came back home for residency training in 2015 and my Dad surprised me and wanted me to start paying the loan off. With \~15 years of interest the amount came to a staggering \~45k. I was shocked. Not only because this was the first time he had brought it up, but because I now understood the terrible loan terms.  Had I gone to a bank the loan would be far less due to refi.

He did not accept that excuse and held me to my contract.  My mother intervened a bit and he laid off.  I still gave him 11K in 2016 which was what my wife and I felt like we could do (we were paying for IVF at the time).  Then the situation was dropped. Didn't hear back again.

So now we are at present in 2019. I have a first job finally in my hometown (partly to be close to grandparents). My wife and I have a 3 year old toddler that spends time with my mom and dad and she loves it and they love her. The galaxy was at peace.

I get another text message from my dad asking to pay off the loan.  I meet him in person and remind him that I don’t feel like the loan terms were good and offer to pay about half, **basically to 20K** like I would have paid a bank.

Now my wife and I make decent money. We are in the 90th percentile for household salary. But paying over 30K to my dad was not in the cards. At this point I'm feeling pretty angry now since I thought we had settled a lot of this. My parents are not hard up for money. They both have good pensions, own a Hawaiian condo where they winter for a couple of months. Complicating the matter was that my older brother essentially had the same loan from him and paid it off with those bonkers terms.

Later this evening I get a text from Dad basically threatening to disown me and never talk to me if I don’t pay him back over the 45k.  I expect him serious.  Part of me, like him is stubborn, and I'm willing to burn this relationship down. He's 70 now and I think he'll need me more than I'll need him.  My mother knows nothing of this so far.

AITA for not agreeing to his loan terms?

**Edit:** posters had suggested that I put in where the money originally came from. My father took a home equity loan two years prior to issuing the loan to me (probably to help my brother finish college). He took 75K out from what I know, about 16K was used to pay for my schooling. From what I know the loan was closed in 2013",98,143,0.94

Usually I just nod my head and ignore it and complete my works the way I want to. 

Recently she has been feeling extremely insecure. At the beginning of this year I started social media accounts for my art works and amassed a lot of followers in a short amount of time. It's 5x what my girlfriend has despite the fact that she has been on social media for a longer time. I do both digital and traditional art while my girlfriend only does digital art. 

Because of this she feels that she's inferior as an artist and that i reinforce her feelings when I don't follow her advice. I've never said anything negative about her art works. But I prefer to work on my art alone. 

These past few weeks I was doing a charcoal portrait of my late Aunt for my grandparents. This is a very personal piece as my aunt had passed away suddenly and it left a huge hole in my family. It was requested by my grandmother. I already had a solid idea of what I wanted to do. My girlfriend told me to redraw certain parts of the sketch but I thought it was fine and went ahead with the sketch. The finished portrait was lovely and my grandmother loved it. When my gf saw the piece she was really upset. She blew up at me saying how I never appreciate her as an artist. We haven't spoken in 5 days. She wants me to apologise but I really don't think I did anything wrong. I don't agree with her advice and besides she has no experience in charcoal drawing so why would I take her advice?

1090,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I were standing on a lightrail platform with two unopened bottles of wine waiting for the train when a lady came up to my husband telling him he shouldn't have wine. We told her it was unopened and therefore fine, and we brushed her weirdness off and went about our business.

A little bit later, she came back and asked where we were going, and after vaguely telling her where we were headed, she told us we were going the wrong way. We told her we had it under control and knew our way, and we politely ignored her weird insertion for the second time. (I ride this train regularly and know the routes without a map. Also, weird - don't tell people directions unless they ask.)

Maybe a minute later, she walked down the platform again and saw that I also had a bottle of wine (also, unopened). For the third time within minutes she talked to us and asked us if we were sure we wanted to bring wine on the train. I sassily repeated the same line about how it was fine because they were unopened and got visibly annoyed at her. 

She AGAIN tried to tell us we were going the wrong way, even after my husband took his phone out and showed her the route. She admitted she didn't know the way we were going, and at this, I got even more annoyed. It's one thing to know your shit and try to help, but a completely different with thing to assume you know best for strangers. 
 
Here is the AITA part. I told this stranger that ""she can go ahead and walk away"" because she didn't know what she was talking about. My husband told me I was a bitch and didn't need to be rude to a good samaritan.

1091,Not the A-hole,"This is kind of a doozey. 
I(20f) met this guy, Eric, and his friend, Daniel, a few weeks ago and they were cool. I hung out with Eric a few times outside of that first time, and every once in a while I brought up the fact that I was seeing someone. He never seemed bothered. My roommates told me post-incident that they all knew Eric liked me for a while.

So I invited Daniel and Eric to drink with me and some friends, and at one point my friends brought up the guy I was seeing. Eric seemed bewildered by this. We all drank a little, and fast forward about an hour where the three of us are in my room.

Eric stops and asks me how I met the guy I'm seeing. I say *insert dating site* and because I'm always busy and find it easier to use. Then we move on and about 10 minutes later Eric interjects with a bombshell: He had had *same dating website* last semester, and apparently we had matched. He told me in front of his friend that he'd messaged me and that I'd never replied. He stared at me like he was expecting me to say something. I felt cornered. I didnt remember this guy from the app at all, and I apologized saying I got lots of messages, and sometimes they got buried on top of each other. He talked about how he was using the app more as a social experiment more than anything.

10ish minutes later Eric asks me if me and my guy were official, and I was truthful and I said yes. After that he left and apparently swigged a bunch of fireball and came back. Daniel left for a time and I jokingly said to Eric that because he was kind of new to drinking, it was possible that he was a sad drunk, and let him know I was a sleepy drunk. He replied ""it's because I have nothing"". I asked what he meant by that and he said ""I've never been in a relationship before"", and I noped out of there right quick.

I found it extremely inappropriate that after knowing I'm in a relationship with another man he would act this way and tell me these things as if I owe him anything for his troubles. Apparently when Daniel and Eric left, Eric ran off to a hallway and sat in a corner for a long time.

Today I went to meet him at his request, thinking I was going to get some kind of explanation, or even an acknowledgement that he did what he did. We made it clear to each other that we were both lucid enough to remember everything. He skated around the whole thing and implied he wanted to move on as if nothing had happened.

I made it clear I was angry that he offered no kind of explanation, and he doesn't follow at all. In fact, he seems angry at me for even wanting to resolve this. AITA?",77,284,0.91
1092,Not the A-hole,"Earlier in the day I had mentioned in a relevant thread that my husband and I had terminated a pregnancy earlier this year, and an hour or two later I got a message from a woman saying something like she hoped I would never forget that I had murdered my baby - I can't remember the exact wording. (*FYI This isn't an abortion debate, so let's not go there, please. Thank you!*) This has happened to me and many other women in r/abortion before, and I don't treat these people very kindly. I don't regret our decision, so when people send me messages like this, it's not like I go in the corner and cry. Oh no. So I promptly went off on this woman, and I let myself be as mean and bitchy and condescending as I wanted to be. I'm hesitant to go into exactly what I told her, as it is very politically sensitive and that isn't the point of this post. Let's just say that, after 3 or 4 messages she knew exactly how I felt about the abortion debate, religion, and the value of her having decided to send me a shitty message.

Just as I sent my last message, she sends me one back and says that she is infertile, that she and her wife have been trying to adopt, and that they live in the South and are constantly turned down as unfit parents because they are gay. From the tone of her message and the overall feel of our brief communication, I have no reason to think that she was lying - it seemed genuine to me. Immediately I felt guilty, not only because I suddenly understood what part of her problem was, but also because I have dated women in the past and I currently live in the South myself and know what a shithole it can be.

I messaged her back and offered a sincere apology, saying that I had jumped to conclusions about her based on my interactions with other trolls in the past, and that perhaps I shouldn't have been so harsh. I said I hoped that she could accept my apology, and offered to just start over, before she had sent the first message. She turned that down - which is fine, I totally get it - and fired a parting shot that was just w/e. I wished her luck.

That was a few hours ago and I still feel bad about it. I lit into her, made a lot of shitty assumptions about her, and didn't know all the details. So, AITA for completely tearing this woman down? Because I feel like an asshole right now, and I can't tell what is right or wrong. Judgments will be accepted, again - please let's not debate abortion as much as we can avoid it. Thanks for your time.

I (22f) went to see the Lion King remake with my younger sister (19f) a few weeks after it came out. 

Now, it’s a Disney movie, so obviously some amount of noise from kids is to be expected/acceptable. But this one family was way, way over the line. The kids were running around screaming, running up and down the aisles, jumping down the steps, climbing on the seats and half walls (this was a cinema with electric leather recliner seats, so if they had of been trapped between the walls and seat, they could have been badly injured) 
They were being ridiculously noisy and out of control. 

Now this isn’t just annoying for the adults watching the movie, it’s unfair to the other children in the cinema, the ones who are actually behaving. 
Not only that, but letting a child run unsupervised around a dark room full of strangers is incredibly stupid and dangerous. 

I tried to just ignore them, but it was impossible, so I went out and complained to the workers. They came in and quietly talked to the family and gave them a warning. 
The kids continued to treat the cinema like a playground, and the worker came in and asked them to leave. 


I’ve been told that causing them to get kicked out was wrong because it’s a kid’s movie, and I should just ‘deal with it’ but these kids were way over the limit of normal/expected noise. 
Like I said, it’s not just unfair to my sister and I, but also to the other families who were there. Like, why should the quiet, well behaved children have to suffer because little Timmy in the front row can’t sit quietly for five minutes, let alone a whole movie?",46,234,0.95

Today my mom asked if I could give my brother my old english notes and essays to help him learn, because his teacher has barely changed her novels/curriculum, and I immediately refused.

I said that:

1. I didn't have an older sibling to give me notes when I was in his class, so it wouldn't be fair game
2. The novels the teacher uses are the same, so my brother could just steal ideas and analysis from my essays and notes. I offered to give my brother tips and proofread some of his work, but I said I wouldn't lend my old stuff to him because he'd be cheating.

My mom was angry, and I mean really damn angry. She said I had no compassion for my struggling brother, that I didn't care about family, and that I was being a selfish asshole who only negatively impacted my sibling. She also said that it's just learning things in advance instead of cheating and, by using my notes, my brother could understand what standards the teacher requires.

UPDATE (except it's really late): Thanks for the feedback! I've decided to give the important notes to my brother, but not the essays or essay outlines.

Everything has always been smooth and our arrangement works out fine for the most part, everyone split rent evenly. We have 2 bathrooms so one they use in their room and I took over the other one.
Last night it was my turn to do laundry and I needed to switch everything over but my boy’s gf still had clothes in the dryer. She was at work and forgot so she texted me if I can just dump her clothes on top of the dryer and she will take care of it later.
I had no problem with this but when I started taking her clothes out I saw these button pad things in there. I was kinda weirded out because they looked like diapers so when she got home I asked her what those are for.
She told me they are washable pads. Like for her period. I wasn’t mean or tried to be rude but I asked her if she’s seriously washing used bloody pads in our communal laundry. She said yes. I was honest and told her that’s a little gross and that I thought pads were meant to be disposable for a reason. She got upset and said there’s no reason why she shouldn’t wash them with the rest of her clothes and if I expected her to go to a laundromat. I told her no of course not but maybe to hand wash them next time in her bathroom.
She told her bf about it and he said I crossed a line and to apologize. Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. 
I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood. I would never ask her to pay money or make a trip to go to the laundromat but at least wash private things like that in private. I’ve always been uncomfortable with blood and it makes me uneasy.

1103,Everyone Sucks,"My inlaws and I have an interesting history. On the surface we get along but they have many opinions about our life and our herd (we have 4 kids) of children. I seriously do not know how my husband came from his family. He is nothing like them. 
My mom had cancer 10 years ago. It came back in fall of 2018. She passed in April 2019. I received over 50 cards from friends and family (none from my inlaws).  Over 200 people attended the funeral. When I was leaving the church after the service it occurred to me that none of my inlaws were there. MIL. FIL, 2 SILs, BIL. NONE. I thought about how I hadnt told them when it was. But I asked my DH and he said he had been keeping them updated about the dates and times of everything.  Visitation, memorial, etc. Nothing. My MIL sent a wind chime. Which is ironic. My mom hated windchimes. 
I am having such a difficult time forgiving them. I haven't said anything but how can you not be there for our family? My kids were devastated bc they were very very close to my mom. My husband also was close with my mom. I mean, I wouldn't think twice about attending the funeral of their parents (my DHS siblings spouses). Of course I would be there. 
  And no note, card, flowers from his siblings. Nothing. 
I want to forgive them bc I know it's only hurting me. But they dont even know they did anything wrong. I just cannot get over how selfish they are being. Am I overreacting or is it just common now for people to not attend funerals? I know they are in no way fun, but you're there to support the family. All of my friends agree that my inlaws are totally selfish and out of line.

1107,Not the A-hole," 

So I work at Walmart, in Grocery Home Shopping, which is a whole different dimension compared to the rest of the store. to start off, About a week ago my manager pulled me into his office to bitch about wait times being too high, and that I'm not fast enough despite the fact that sometimes I'm literally the only one who is trying to work fast (or even at all). On some nights co workers just sit there and talk or look at their phone while I'm stuck having to explain to everyone in the parking lot why they had to wait 20 minutes. I later found out He didn't bother talking to the slackers. This pissed me off and kinda killed my motivation to do anything more than the bare minimum.

Fast forward to today we had 4 dispensers for the entire day, but we found out that all of us were going to be leaving before 8:00 (our closing time) my shift ended at 5:00pm Maria's at 4:00pm Alexandra's at 5:30pm and Jim at 3:30. We looked at the schedule to see if anyone was coming after we all left, and there was literally not a single associate scheduled after 6pm. soon, Gabe (the manager) rose from the darkest,of hell (happens once a year) to ask Maria if she wanted to cover the closing shift, to which she declined because she doesn't want to dispense anymore,

he turns to the rest of us, Alexandra had dinner plans already made and Jim had already disappeared at this point. So i was the only one without plans after work. Going back to what i went over in the beginning, i was bitter towards Gabe and not really looking forward for covering his ass considering he brought this on himself.

I knew he still had options, using one of the support managers, or pulling one or two cashiers off a register, but naturally he chose to just clock out on time and let someone else figure it out. So i let the support manager know what was going on and quietly left 15 minutes late. there really weren't that much orders for the night, we finished every pick by 3:00 which is an hour before it is supposed to be finished, and there were only 3 orders to be dispensed between 6-7 and 4 between 7-8, so whoever is covering me while i sit back, drink a beer, write this post is probably just sitting around, waiting for the clock to hit eight

The reason i think i may be TA here is that;

1. Some Support Manager who has like a million things better to do is sitting in the OGP backroom waiting for that one customer to arrive at 7:59
2. Gabe's precious ""Numbers""(wait times for groceries) that he bitched at me about might of taken a hit if there's no one there to dispense
3. i may of indirectly hurt Alexandra because she told me she didn't want to just let Gabe take the fall, and may of stayed past her shift (i don't know if she did or not)

Reasons im NTA:

1. I don't HAVE to work overtime
2. Gabe is a doo doo head
3. There wasn't that many orders, very slow night which is uncharacteristic for a Saturday

I was willing to give him my seat even if he doesn't seem like he needed because I'm aware some disabilities are not easy to see.

Well neither of them went to work this week. My mom does have some health issues, but so do I so I've always felt like it's a weak excuse to not go to work....

Well I let them know that some of the bills are due on Monday and how much they owe. Well both started whining about how small their pay checks were... I decided to leave for a couple hours and talk to my grandma about what I should do and she's the one who gave me the idea for the ultimatum.

Both my mom and sister were home this morning so before I went to work I let them know that if they don't have the full amount for rent/bills by the end of this month they need to find somewhere else to live.

1114,Not the A-hole,"My twin brother and I are, for the most part, fairly mature, reasonable adults, and productive members of society, but something about each other brings out the Cain instinct.

Every time there's a birthday or Christmas we all gather in one place and for a few years my brother and I have had an ongoing competition to buy the ugliest possible shirts for each other. So far the ugliest shirt I've given him is a hawiian shirt decorated with cats in tacos and the ugliest he's given me looks exactly like a bowling alley carpet.

We've never worn the shirts before now, but the last time he gave me a shirt (Nigel Thornberry as Miley Cyrus) I managed to cough while drinking and spilled coffee on the shirt I went out in. My brother told me to go put on the shirt he bought me to replace it. I went to the bathroom and put it on, and wore it until I got home.

A few nights later I went to meet my brother for drinks and he was wearing the taco cat shirt. I saw this as a challenge, and since then we've both started to wear the ugly shirts when we see each other. Our girlfriends are amazing enough that not only have they accepted this, but they join in.

It didn't cause issues until last night. My girlfriend and I are in her home country (Ireland) for a week, and in I'm meeting her parents for the first time.

My brother offered to give me a lift to the airport and because he was involved, I wore a shirt he got me with the main character of Bee Movie on it.

At some point during our flight her parents decided to meet us at the airport instead, which we didn't see as we were on the plane. We got out of the airport and she immediately saw her parents and told me to put my jacket on. My zip got stuck so I was left staring down my girlfriend's parents with barry fucking benson on my chest.

I tried to explain the game with my brother, playing it off as a joke, but they just drove us to the hotel silently and then went away. They're coming back in the morning. My girlfriend said that while I was checking in they told her that just from this interaction they knew we weren't a good match.

My girlfriend is upset with me, but only a little. She said that if she'd known that was the shirt I was wearing on leaving the flat, she'd have told me to leave it at home, but also feels like I should have known not to bring it along. She says I was the one who said that I wanted to make a good impression on her parents, and I should have known that this was not the time or place for the ugly shirt competition. I don't disagree with any of that, but the way I see it I have a week to fix this and I only anticipated her and my brother seeing the shirt. If I'd known her parents would be there I would have changed. She still says that even though she believes me, on the way to the airport to meet her parents is still not the time or place for the ugly shirt game.

His mom is a lovely woman, but very pushy. When I was 19 she told me she needed grandchildren in the next few years. My bf called her out for being hypocritical as she had him when she was 38, and he told her not to put pressure on me. However, this has only changed her approach in pushing grandchildren. She constantly talks about pregnancy, how having children younger is better, and (of course) how people should always stay close to their parents when they have kids. Something that is also hypocritical as she moved to a new country when she had my bf.

We are in no way planning to have children or get married anytime soon. My boyfriend even had another talk with her last week telling her that kids were at least 9 years away and she needed to stop. The next night she brought up pregnancy and kids again.  

This really stresses me out, and it's not only the idea of children, but how she talks about how children should be raised. She is very opinionated, believes any toy with plastic is just ""garbage,"" and doesn't believe in vaccinations. It gives me a headache to just think about having kids with her as a grandmother constantly breathing down my neck and criticizing my every parenting move.

AND I'M ONLY 21!!!! I don't want to be thinking about this! Who knows if in 9 years children will even be the right choice for my partner and I! 

So, the next time I see her and she brings it up I would like to mention that I do not want children. I'm hoping this would stump her a bit and if she protested it could be a good opportunity for me to draw clear boundaries that she has no right to tell me what to do with my future. It wouldn't be a complete lie as I really don't know what I will want in the future, but it feels a little deceptive and it might actually crush her...

So, my bf and I have decided to ask reddit WIBTA if I told her I didn't plan on having kids?",26,87,0.9

1118,Not the A-hole,"Recent weekend get together with my extended family, and we were having a bbq. My sister in law had put up kiddie games etc that the kids were competing in and there were candy prizes. 

She’d set up a race for the small kids- under 5’s, because there’s a lot of those in my family. It was a simple straight line race and there were literal kiddy plastic markers and a start and finish sign. 

My 3 year old boy has a knee that hasn’t developed properly- he’s in physical therapy, miiiight need an operation as he gets older, but mostly the poor kid finds it hard to run or walk and has a little funny limp that slows him down. 

As it was a goddamn kids race and I just wanted my son to be happy, when the kids crowded around to start the race I said ‘Chris should get a head start’ mostly kidding. My brother, other sister in law, and mom and dad all enthusiastically agreed and it was actually my brother who let my son a few feet ahead of the start line and then gave the instruction for all the other kids to follow. 

My son won, but not because the other kids were slow- most of em meandered falling over, some of em were chewing the grass- some of ran straight to mom or dad ignoring the finish line, just doing what kids do. There were no actual 5 year olds, just a few kids my sons age and younger. 

My sister in law who was hosting the party was super pissy about it and purposefully withheld a prize from Chris. I figured that was fair enough because he cheated, but she kept shaking her head at him saying ‘bad! You cheated’ which pissed me off. He’s a kid. Who had a lot of fun in the race. Wtf dude. 

My wife kept the situation calm and smoothed it over because she kept going out of her way to upset the kiddo even though she’d made her point, but I don’t think my giving a goddamn 3 year old at a family bbq a head start should have been so controversial.",640,5838,0.94

1120,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway; Mobile; Apologies in advance on formatting.

Background - I (39f) moved in with my long time partner (29m) earlier this year. I am a divorced mother of 2 kids and share custody. We lived separately for several years before moving in together and so it’s been a lot of adjustments all around. He gets along fine with my kids and we share the space. No plans to marry if that matters.

We split rent and other bills evenly for the most part and have separate finances and both work full time. We split the food budget and share food in the house.

My boyfriend does not really enjoy cooking but I do. He is capable of helping out, but it usually results in me having to direct him a lot which reduces the fun. I plan most of the meals and as a result I end up doing most of the grocery shopping because he sucks at getting good ingredients at fair prices.

He generally eats whatever I make without complaints. If I don’t take the initiative to plan a meal he will typically ask “what are we having?”, and if I say I don’t want to cook and I’m having a sandwich, he will ask me to make him one too. He rarely ever prepares a meal on his own unless it’s to microwave something and even less often will he initiate on his own to make something for me.

Sometimes I do say “I don’t want to be responsible for dinner tonight, can you please do it?” And then he will, but I have to ask him to do this each time and I can expect something simple like a sandwich or chicken nuggets or take out (which he then expects me to split cost with him).

We split groceries evenly (As in I buy it and he pays me back half or vice versa). So all the food in the house is fair game for either of us, unless we buy something special and specifically point out to save it (which I like and have no problem with).

I pay for food I specifically buy for my kids myself. I do not want or expect him to pay for my kids food he is not responsible for any of their bills.

But... This situation is starting to wear me down because while we do split the money to buy groceries, I end up putting in way more time and effort to plan and execute the meals most of the time. If I make a big batch of food he expects “his half” of leftovers to eat when he wants. If my kids eat with us, I’m expected to either feed them only from “their” food, or if we make a big meal, he gets his half and I should feed my kids from “my half”.

Most days I like cooking and enjoy making a yummy meal for someone I love. I mostly just resent that he seems to disregard the effort it takes to plan and prepare the meals.

So AM I THE ASSHOLE if I tell him I no longer want to split food costs or responsibilities AT ALL and just make my own food all the time to avoid the stress?

TLDR; I don’t want to split food anymore because my boyfriend wants “his half” of all the food I make because we split the monetary costs, even though he doesn’t cook, shop, or meal plan with me.",69,47,0.91

AITA- I’ve been really sick lately. I’ve been to hospital after hospital getting scan after scan. I’ve been beyond depressed so my husband decided to take me on an overnight trip to the beach so we could go to my favorite haunted house. To do that, we needed a dog sitter. MIL enters stage right, but I am thankful. 

My husband didn’t tell me that she would be doing laundry while spending the night ( which I have zero problems with). I, not knowing, left my laundry in the dryer to be folded upon return. That is my fault and I totally acknowledge that. 

We get home and she’s been cooking soup on the stove for three hours and had left a mess. The house was hot. We came home early because I got too sick to stay so I started feeling aggravated seeing the kitchen messy and the house at 85 degrees. I go upstairs to set some things down and notice she has folded all of my laundry- including my unmentionables. Sorry male redditors for the next part. Part of my illness causes severe bleeding. So some unmentionable items are too embarrassing to be seen. I get she was “trying to help” but I’m furious at this point. Lasers shooting out of my eyes mad. She’s still here. I hold it in. She did us a favor.

MIL exit stage left. I clean the kitchen. I go to run the disposal because of all the food in the sink from cleaning the pots. It gurgles metal murder. She’s left plastic in the disposal. It’s now broken. 

I go to sooth my anger with chocolate and ice cream goodness. Her husband ate my last snickers ice cream bar. That’s the final straw. 


I explode at my husband and start crying. I do make it clear I know he couldn’t help any of it, it’s not his fault, and reassure him I know she was trying to help. Yet, he still thinks IATA for being so upset about all of this. 

AITA?

Edit- you all have made such great points that were hard to see through  all of the anger. Thank you, Reddit family for your honesty. I could have definitely approached the situation better. MIL never even had an inkling that I was upset and I apologized to my amazing husband, who I am sure is just as tired and frustrated from what I am going through because we’re going through all of it together.

1130,Everyone Sucks,"My (soon to be ex) husband is having an affair. It is with a 19 year old intern at his work. He is in a senior position.


This shouldn't even be a question about who is at fault here. He's forty, she's nineteen. He's a consultant, she's an intern. He's married, she's not. Jesus, I shouldn't even be questioning the morals of this.


But ..... I found out about the affair after she called and told me that my husband "" is going to leave my fat pathetic old ass"" because he deserves better. And she is the better. As a note, I have a career I love and while I support my husband's career, I don't really show up as much for his work related stuff as the other consultant's wives do. She told me I was selfish and unsupportive and that she could tell by the way my husband acted how unhappy he was at home. That really hurt because I wonder how much truth was in that.


My husband tried to get me to not leave. He completely blames her for the affair (yeah he's definitely an asshole). He said she was a social climber who came after him and actually the messages he showed me aren't the greatest... She repeatedly says how he would be happier with her, all the ways she will make his life better along with a lot of inappropriate photos. So it doesn't really seem as if she was coerced into this.


AITA? While both of them had the affair, I feel she started it.

1135,Not enough info,"So I’m a manager at a small business movie theater. We’re a small chain but nowhere near as big as AMC or anything. 

Today a woman bought 5 tickets to see IT Chapter 2. She bought them by herself and said her party would arrive later. When they did arrive, it was her husband, their teenage looking son and 2 smaller children, probably 7 and 5, just by appearance.

I wasn’t there when they came, so my employee was the one who let them in. 

When I found out this woman brought her young children to see IT, I was concerned and asked her if she would be interested in exchanging the tickets for a different movie because I couldn’t allow her to take her small kids into this movie. Even if it wasn’t fucking terrifying, it’s rated R. She became belligerent, calling me a cunt and telling me I can’t tell her how to parent and to mind my own business, and tried to throw her drink (that she brought in herself, mind you) at me. 

So I told her to leave or I would call the cops and when she demanded a refund I told her I wouldn’t refund her after she became violent.

1139,No A-holes here,"This has been bothering me for a while, so I figured I’d post it here and get the clarity I need. I am a support worker for autistic kids, and have been working with my current family for about 7 months. This family is very dysfunctional, mom is not in the picture and the kids are aged 4-8. Most workers drop the family after a month or so due to the screaming and fights, it isn’t the nicest looking place either. 

I’m employed through a nonprofit that in turn gets funding through the state, the child’s father is not my employer. I am there to watch one child, the oldest, yet I do little favors to help out the other kids. I can’t say no to them when things are already so rough at home. Anyways, about a month ago the other support worker freaked out, cursed out the dad, and suddenly used her 2 weeks vacation time to leave. I ended up picking up the slack and went from 3 days to 5-6. 

Then I was also watching the second oldest child for a few weeks. Dad offered me money in exchange for watching her but honestly I wasn’t going to take 10 bucks from a man who clearly needed it more than I did so I refused. Next day dad asks me to go to the store with the oldest and grab milk, he gives me a WIC card (government assistance). We go to the store and I don’t realize you can’t use WIC at self checkout, I’m socially awkward, so I pay the 3 dollars for the milk and we head home. I tell them the situation and that I had to pay with my own money. He says, “Oh. Thank you. I don’t have any money right now.” I just say okay and head out for the night, it was the end of my shift anyways. 

Next day is Saturday and he had plans to take the kids out to the lake. I told him I couldn’t go, and he freaked out about me being a huge part in going and I was needed. I told him that I didn’t have the 40 dollars to fill my car up with gas to go to the lake. My job reimburses me mileage but not immediately. It wasn’t even that I did not have the money, I was just mad that he offered me 10 dollars for watching his kid, then next day he doesn’t have 3 dollars for milk, then day after he has the money for gas and snacks for the kids to go to the lake? After working 2x as many hours and refusing his money for watching the kids multiple times, buying them food, taking them out, the one time I asked for compensation he did not have it. I felt taken advantage of. I found out from his girlfriend later that they never even went to the lake that day due to not being able to afford it. So why did he yell at me for “ruining his kid’s day?” I had been working extra days, and he had the day off so it’s not like they were needing someone to be there. I do feel bad for not being there to entertain the kids though. AITA for bailing on my autistic client and his siblings?

TL;DR: Dad is on hard times, I work extra and beyond my job description to help out. The one time I ask for compensation he refuses, only to yell at me for not showing up/wanting to spend my personal money to take his kids to the lake the next day?",27,164,0.93

1147,No A-holes here,"I've been in the military for 9+ years, and 7 of those years have been spent with my amazing wife. We just got married last month, and she's been through constant TDY's and a 365 overseas tour.

She just commissioned as an Officer, so she makes as much as I do (and will soon make much MUCH more). She's followed me to 2 bases now, since we did the distance while she got her degree. She just was informed that she's getting stationed in Alaska, meanwhile I'm stuck in Texas for 4 years for a special duty assignment.

She COULD do a joint-spouse assignment and give up Alaska, but it's her dream base, and I promised I would never make her chose me over her career, because she knows I would always choose my career over everything. We don't have children, so it's just us.

She says she wants me to go back to school and be a full time student while she acts as my nurse-with-a-purse, but I am already halfway through my 20 years and can retire collecting a paycheck for the rest of my life if I stick it out for another 10 years. That, and my college is already getting paid for with my tuition assistance.

Basically, she doesn't like that I'm choosing my career over her, and feels like she's made sacrifices to follow me around, but I won't do the same for her. I feel like it's different to move from Health Department to Health Department, vs ending my military career (which is a love-hate relationship) to follow hers.

They pretty much do their own thing and I don't see them much, but about once or twice a week we all sit down and watch a tv show or movie together (I live with my GF so I'm not the third wheel lol).

I really thought he knew about her teasing me cause of my weight as a kid.  I hold no grudge over what she said to me as a teen cause I know she regrets it now and were good.

Carol then said how she felt that that was really common and that it had also happened to her twice but that you were really out of luck if you didn't have any proof that it actually happened. She also said that we guys were lucky because we didn't have to worry about something like that. Thomas agreed with her and said it was horrible that some men did things like this. 

I also said it was terrible that this had happened to Susan but I wanted to mention that Carol saying that this didn't happen to us simply wasn't true.

1150,Not the A-hole,"  

At my work it’s not uncommon to bring personal dilemmas to discussion. Unhealthy af, but not the point.

I’m a child free 27F, my coworker is 32M and his girlfriend is 24F, they have been together for 3 years, live together, and seem to have a fine relationship.

Coworker has always wanted to be a dad. He feels like he’s “on the right age” to start having kids, and talked about it with gf. He vents about how she said she’s “not sure” about having kids yet.

He makes reasonable money to support a couple of adults, but not to give a child a nice life and idk what additional debts he might have; they are not homeowners and his gf never went to college, doesn’t intend to, and she makes/sells cake. They are good but this is her only income and it’s pretty variable.

Also, he wants kids, **plural**. 3 or 4 kids. Said he’d be up to adopting eventually but want “some” bio children.

Everyone gave advice I considered shitty and misogynistic, like 

“you should start trying, she’ll start loving being a mother along the way” (but what she doesn’t?)

“just take her to see your nephews more frequently, she’ll see how amazing it is to have kids” (yeah, taking care of a child 24/7 and visiting someone else’s kid is EXACTLY the same)

“she says that because she’s too young, of course she wants kids” (if she’s too young to know how is she old enough to care for another life?)

“the first pregnancy is so good she’ll want more kids in to time” (WTF, your experiences are not universal)

“there’s no love without giving in, you’ll find a way” (thanks captain obvious, I didn’t know you were a couple’s counselor now!)

“you should meet halfway and have only 2 children” (that’s STILL having children, dammit!)

Now, I usually don’t take part in those; my co-worker L (a woman on her 50s who’s really open minded) always gives advice I agree to, but this time, she only said he should wait a little more to see if she’ll change her mind.

As a child-free woman, I know that a lot of times “I’m not sure” is what you say when you’re sure you don’t want children so people won’t talk shit.

It might not be the case, but he still could benefit from a different POV from everyone else, so… I said something along these lines:

“If she gets pregnant because she feels pressed, it will likely make her miserable and affect your relationship. If you two want different things in life, it’s better to break up while you don’t have a child to be affected by it. That, or maybe YOU can consider adapting for her instead”.

Now everyone looks at me like I advised him to punch his grandmother, because they “kids are a blessing”, “really love each other” and “can make it work somehow”. 

I wasn’t even harsh, I was very calm and polite. Even if my advice was shitty (which I don’t think it was!), if he asked everyone, no one should be publically upset with my advice.

1151,Asshole,"Background: My (28F) fiancé’s (29M) dad has been a professor at an Ivy League university in our city for 30+ years. His position comes with benefits, including undergraduate tuition exemption for any kids under 26 and taxable tuition (explained below) for any kids in grad school.


Fiancé’s parents divorced when he was young. Dad refused to pay child support for years which caused a lot of bitterness between him and mom. Mom did not hide her hatred, fiancé grew up being told his dad didn’t care about him – he has depression and a bad relationship with his mom, but when he got older and dad quit drinking, relationship with dad got better despite their past. 


Fiancé dropped out of college in ’09 after his first semester and that’s when we met and started dating. Next few years he went to community college near my college, we lived together (‘11-‘13) and his mom paid his rent, and after I graduated (‘13) and moved back home he moved with me and lived with me at my mom’s house rent-free (my mom is awesome and loves him like a son). We both worked for a few years (‘14-‘17) and in that time he decided he wanted to apply to finish his degree at his dad’s school. He got in and bc he was still 26, paid no tuition for the next 2-3 years and finished his degree this past May. He got into a master’s program (with a small scholarship) at the same school but now has to pay some tuition.


Each year he has taken out a small loan ($8-10K) to help with living expenses, books etc. I am not working anymore (back in school) but with savings from my job and a substantial inheritance from my father, I keep us comfortable, pay rent and most bills, which I am fine with. However, I cannot afford to help my fiancé with tuition (nor would I be allowed to since my inheritance is in a trust and heavily regulated).


Taxable tuition 101: the tuition that would normally be paid is added onto the professor’s income. If dad makes $100K/year and tuition is $20K, his income is considered $120K and he is taxed based on that amount. So if income tax is 30% of annual income, he pays $36K in taxes instead of $30K. This results in a loss of $6K for that year (none of these numbers are exact but also not too far off from the real numbers).


Dad does not want to lose this income and wants fiancé to pay him back. My feeling is that he never paid child support, tuition, or living expenses for his son growing up (despite having the means), and this is a small price to pay for his neglect. Fiancé told dad he can’t afford to pay him back so dad said fine, he’ll pay, and his girlfriend even offered to pay half. Recently they spoke again and dad reneged, he still wants money from fiancé for tuition. This money would come out of the loan money he receives for living expenses which he already has to pay back. We think dad is being selfish and unreasonable. What do you think?

Edit: Thanks for all your responses. In retrospect a more accurate query would have been “AITA for suggesting/feeling like it would be the right thing for my fiancé’s dad to not make my fiancé pay him back for income lost due to taxable tuition?”, mainly because some of the finer points were missed and my actual part in his conversation with his dad was misinterpreted due to my poor phrasing (I was not part of their conversation at all and merely offered my fiancé my opinion), but I accept your judgment regardless and thank all of you for your time and thoughts.",70,112,0.9
1152,Not the A-hole,"Our family recently moved into a (long anticipated) much bigger and nicer house, with a better yard, view, and neighbors. We were all pretty happy about it. I am a middle schooler living with my older sister and parents.

There are two non-master bedrooms rooms upstairs, one which has better sunlight and a much nicer view of the yard, and a much bigger closet. The other room has skylights and the sun looks kind of weird in this room. Also, it is oddly shaped, with two closets that jut out from the wall and take space in the room. The celing is angled since it's on the side of the house under the roof. The angle goes from above 10 ft high on one side, and by the time it gets to the other it's around 4 ft. The one plus side is that this room is big, maybe 700-800 square ft.

My sister really wanted the nicer/smaller room and complained the other one looked uncomfortable, which I had no problem with. I have a hobby which requires space, and I figured it would be good for me, because i could use the room instead of begging my parents for garage or shed space. Now aside from needing work space, I do not have a lot of posessions, mostly just materials for my hobby, which themselves do not require much storage space. Sister on the other hand has quite a bit of furniture and stuff.

My sister started complaining because her room became a bit cramped for her. I was not using much of the side of my room that's 4ft tall because it's hard to move around there, and she asked me if she could store some of her stuff there. I didn't like the idea because I wanted my own space and didn't want her going in my room on a regular basis, but agreed if she stored things there and didn't just knock on my door all the time demanding to come in. She agreed, but the stuff she wanted to store in there was obviously stuff that would require her to break my rule, e.g. clothes/shoes, so I refused and she threw a fit to our parents. My parents are telling me I'm being selfish for refusing to share unused space in my room... my response is she could have had the whole room if she wanted it but now it was my own space!

So, parents tried to pull me aside and ""reason"" with me, and I told them if any of her stuff ends up in my room, i'm throwing it out. They told me I'm being a jerk, and one day when I'm and adult i will regret intentionally doing things to create tension with my sister and ruin our relationship.

So tell me, Reddit, AITA?

Recently I was hanging out with his best friend, we became good friends over last few months. He was showing me some pictures from the road trip they went to and one of them was with his second ex. He said he was a good guy. I asked “was?”. He told me he passed away. I didn’t pay much attention to it and we continued doing whatever we were doing.

Yesterday I just randomly thought about it. I was curious and asked my boyfriend, “hey, how did your ex pass away?”(I said his name). He got so upset and told me that it was really insensitive to ask something like that out of nowhere. I said that I was just wondering and dropped it but he’s still mad and he’s acting distant.",32,59,0.89

1158,Not the A-hole,"A friend of mine is going through a divorce and had nowhere to go. Since she has a 1 year old child, and a dog she claims is her ESA, I offered her a room at my place. It was going to work out PERFECTLY because my fiance went to jail shortly after she moved in (nothing bad, he was just dumb and didn't pay tickets) and I prefer having someone around. I told her not to pay me with the first check she got after moving so her and her kid could get settled but after that, her rent to me would be $300/month (which included utilities and internet) and she agreed. Well, her second check came around and because she decided to go to a used car dealership instead of using my fiance's car (I don't drive), she suddenly didn't have money for ANY portion of her rent. Plus she also just HAD to buy a washer and dryer (which I bought hoses for), so she felt the need to pay that person back.

Fine, I can understand that, I use the washer and dryer too. Then she started leaving lights on, doors unlocked, all that. I would tell her about it and she would always say that it was an accident because she leaves in a hurry (which is true). Then she needed help with a few groceries so she can take lunches to her job and promised to pay me back. Then her dog started eating my cats' food and her response to that was ""***your cats can climb, my dog can't, just move the food***"". I ended up just moving their food to the bathroom  where, I hoped, the dog didn't go.

But what broke the deal for me was that I was always the one taking care of the dog when I got home from work, which wasn't enough out of the day. I get a message from my landlady with a screenshot saying that the dog was up all night while I was gone HOWLING and it kept the neighbors awake. My landlady also knows that I don't have any animals on my lease yet. I had to tell her that the dog would be gone so I wouldn't risk eviction. I told my friend about it, she got FURIOUS, and said that she would just have to ""move the f\*\*\* out"".

Now she posts these super passive aggressive messages on Facebook and I know they're about me. I don't care or anything, just baffled that she thinks I did her wrong after I opened up my home, took care of her dog who was literally skin and bones, and she never paid me ANYTHING",25,30,0.88

1162,Asshole,"Update: I decided to just pay her the money now, and figure out something for the next coming weeks.

So im a sophomore in college, and the first three weeks I was really irresponsible with my money& especially considering I'm off of a meal plan, and I have to cook for myself. Thankfully- I was able to get some money from my parents- $200, and I made a budget. So back when I had little to no money, I asked my roommate, who I'm really good friends with to buy some items amounting to $35 because I had to return some Amazon items and that would be my exact gift card amount. I asked her then- about two weeks ago, if it's okay to give her the gift card, and she agreed. I got paid yesterday, but I have some major expenses- like materials amounting to around 120$ and I had to pay a friend 40$ for a textbook I sold to her that she wound up not needing. With those, and considering I have other small expenses that need to last me till the 27th. I made a tight budget, and then my roommate asked for the $35 dollars in cash- because she had spent too much money and she wanted to spend more without her parents knowing. I really can't afford that right now. Hopefully if the small supplies I need- find out the list of the art supplies I need on tuesday- if I have anything left over I can pay her. But I feel a bit annoyed because I already settled the $35 with her before, but she wants cash now. And I can't even use the card really because Amazon's grocery service is overpriced, and I could get a lot more at my grocery store for $35. I feel bad, so I scrounged around $14 dollars in cash and bought some fresh groceries at a small local market- so I can try to pay her back. I want to hold off till my next payday to give her the money- but she is getting irritated. 

Tldr: Am I the asshole for not paying my roommate $35 after she changes her mind about accepting a gift card I already had for her after I set a tight budget.",23,40,0.81

1165,Not the A-hole,"This could easily get too long, so I'll try and keep this concise.

Before my parents married, my Dad was married to a different woman with whom he had a son. They divorced, he remarried, and they had my siblings and I.

When I was a kid and heard that I had a brother for the first time, I was really curious. I asked about him and was basically told that their relationships turned sour about 30ish years ago and he had cut Dad out. Since then they had all pretended the other didn't exist. I was given zero detail about why this had come about.

About 10 years ago, the brother reached out and asked me/my siblings if we wanted to get to know him. I was delighted, but the rest of the family discussed it and decided they didn't have any interest in the brother.

I was an awkward teen at this point, and asked my parents if it would be ok if I just spoke to my brother. I said I had always been curious. Their reaction was fury and upset - my Mom burst into tears and said that my brother would 'turn me against the family' and they would 'lose me forever'. Being a teen I didn't really know how to react, so I reassured them that I wouldn't get involved. The brother's message went entirely ignored.

Thing is, I still want to know him. I know nothing but a name. I could have nieces and nephews out there, a whole family I've never met.

Now I'm much older, I tried to find him myself. Just to say hi and let him know I'm here and happy to speak if he wants to. I'm pretty sure I found him on social media, and reached out with a simple, polite message. He blocked me.

I'm sad about it, but I understand. Being soundly rejected a decade ago, of course he's moved on and doesn't want to get hurt again. It only intensified my regret at not standing up for myself as a teenager and reaching out.

I suppose I should move on, given the circumstances, but I'm still curious. I don't want to grow old regretting never knowing a single thing about my eldest sibling. I'm scared of this mystery weighing me down for the rest of my life.

I want to ask my parents more about him. Not much, just a little. Just so I have more than a name for the brother I'll never meet. I feel like I have the right to know a little something about my brother.

But it's clearly painful for my parents. I adore my parents and would never want to hurt them, but I worry that dredging up painful memories will do just that. I've asked some friends and opinions seem split between I have a right to know about my sibling, and that my parents have kept us apart for a reason and it's not my place to ask why.

So, WIBTA if I asked them to tell me a couple of stories about my estranged brother?",29,105,0.93
1166,Not the A-hole,"Good Afternoon everyone,

I suppose this is more of an ethical question than a legal inquiry, but wanted to explain my family's situation and see if I can please get everyone's thoughts on the matter.

 My sister was arrested for her third DUI last night in Fairfax, VA.  Her first DUI was in Montgomery County, MD, second was in Philadelphia, PA.  I do not know the exact details of each case as I live in a different area of the country, but she miraculously still held a valid driver's license and served very minimal jail time (one year) for each.  My understanding is that her license has been revoked by the State of Virginia at this time.

Virginia basically takes no shit for DUI's and I imagine she will be serving some serious prison time.  My mother and father depleted their joint bank account on attorney fees, restitution to the city (damage to a city gate and light pole), short-term rehab stints, and therapy for my sister, but this is the last straw.  I DO have the money to pay for attorney fees, but feel that she is beyond help at this point.  She will not get help or listen to reason.  She blames everyone else for her problems.

At the end of the day, my parents have faith in her recovery and have been begging me to pay for my sister's legal fees which will no doubt be out of this world.  They've been calling, texting, and e-mailing me non-stop -- her boyfriend has been calling me and guilt tripping me as well.  Even her co-workers have been trying to contact me to which I finally turned off my phone and .. here I am.

My sister is not a bad person, I promise.  She is addicted to alcohol.  I love her dearly, but am very angry with her for essentially deterring my parents from retiring and putting such a financial strain on them in their golden years.  She also could have seriously injured or KILLED someone not once, twice, but THREE times.  On the flip side, I feel I will be turning my back on her if I don't help her out - they say family is everything.

I'm very sorry to vent, I am just very frustrated and conflicted.",81,159,0.94
1167,Not the A-hole,"  I haven't spoken to any of my family in 8 yrs. 

 I have been in porn for 10 yrs now (off and on). My mother and sister found out about 2 yrs in. They conspired to write a nasty hate filled letter to my husband (which was hand delivered by my asshole sister) telling him he's a terrible husband to me and awful father to our children because he is ""allowing"" me to do this and not being the husband and father ""god intended"" (Also we're damning our children to hell because we're athiest, etc etc.) So if we choose to continue down this path of the devil, we are not welcomed in the family anymore. 

  There were many more awful ""christian"" things said in that letter, but that's the gist of it. I am not one to give in to ultimatums. Ever. So I replied with the the same level of hate and anger unfortunately. But I've never been so mad in my life. I still feel I was justified in that moment. 

  Well, 1 yr after that I took a hiatus from the industry. A month after announcing I was on a break, I got another letter. This one was an apology. Basically saying she realizes now she was in the wrong and shouldn't have said anything because it's my life not hers, and that she never thought I wouldn't choose the family.

  I feel like she only apologized because she thought I was out of the industry for good and was ready to welcome me back into the family now that I was no longer an embarrasing whore. 

  So I told her I felt she absolutely meant what she said and she burned bridges that can never be rebuilt. She made her bed, she can sleep in it. 
Besides I don't want my children around toxic drama filled people and that's what they are. 

  I haven't heard anything since the last email I sent and I have since rejoined the industry for as long as studios and my fans will allow. 

  So tell me, am I the asshole to force her to live her ultimatum, even though she apologized?


EDIT: Its been many yrs, I forgot to mention that my family also threatened to have my kids taken away and called my husband's family to tattle. My mom told them all about us, and tried to get them to go along with the shunning. Luckily my husband's father told my mom it's really none of their business. He did call us up to confirm, but told us what we choose to do with our lives is our business and if we're fine with it all, they're fine with it all, and we never have to speak of this again.",48,303,0.92

* We'll call my dad ""Ralph"", and his father ""Tony""

* The first stillbirth, we'll call her ""Dianne"", happened at 9 months. This was 7 years ago.

* The second stillbirth, we'll call her ""Sarah"", happened at 6 months. This was 4 years ago.

Regardless, she has had 4 successful births, currently aged 1,3,6, and 9. They're a happy family together, and have not forgotten their unborn children. They held memorial services for both, for the immediate family. She has gotten tattoos of their footprints on their own feet, and can't wait to get to heaven to finally meet them.

My brother feels similarly, but that's mostly because of his choice to support and comfort her through both losses. They're his daughters too, and could've moved on, but it hit his wife hard so he went through that journey with her.

As far as my dad goes, I'm positive he was not impacted so harshly. He was definitely there to console them in their loss, and was briefly sad that he wouldn't get to meet new granddaughters. But, he made years of happy memories of his 5 living grandchildren.

My SIL wrote this in the draft of his obituary:

> Ralph is preceded in death by his father Tony and granddaughter’s Dianne and Sarah.

My SIL has been very open about her losses on Facebook, and everyone in her circles knows about them and knows they're truly lost family to her. However, my dad's circles and my SIL's circles do not overlap so neatly. There's people that know my dad that have never met my SIL.

My worry is that the sentence will be a negative conversation starter that pulls the focus away from remembering my father: ""oh my goodness, Ralph had two granddaughters that passed away?!"".

Long story short, she essentially checked out of the marriage about 2 years ago without telling me and then had an emotional affair, so there's not a lot of good feelings between us. We separated in February 2018 and are still in the lengthy divorce process, and I've been dating my current gf (30F) since September 2018.

When I got married in 2013, my ex wife and I double barrelled our names. There were several reasons for this. Her family and surname are Russian but she has an English first name, so she didn't want to give up her Russian surname and lose her connections to her roots by having a fully English name. For my part, my original name is incredibly common. It's not quite John Smith but it's not far off. I've met probably 5 other men with my exact name, first name and surname combined. I also work in an industry where it's a benefit to have a unique name for purposes of recognition, and as my wife and I both wanted to share the same surname as each other, hyphenating them was the ideal solution. 

Since the separation, my ex wife has changed her name back and taken my surname out of it. I haven't and have kept my married name. My gf really doesn't like it. She says that it hurts her to see my ex wife's surname all the time and that my keeping my married name suggests that I'm not over my ex wife. She asked what I'd do if we ever got married, and I said I'd take out my ex wife's name then and put my gf's name. She would rather I went back to my old name. She says it's a constant reminder of my marriage and will prevent me from fully moving on emotionally.

I don't want to do that because I've had the name for 6 years now. I don't think of it as my ex wife's name or as my married name, just as my name. It would also mean I had a very common full name again which I don't like. My gf suggested I could keep my current name for professional purposes so that I was still recognisable in my field, but change it back legally for everything else, bills, Facebook etc. I don't really want to have one name for work and another for home, though. It would cause confusion. I've told her I'll consider  changing it on social media but I'm even reluctant to do that in case it makes it harder for people to find or contact me because my name is so common.

He would make empty promises and never follow through,  he would yell at me for things he was told off for when taking care of us and it was overall not a nice environment.  He has never payed a penny towards us unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.

I told her he would not he permitted back as there is a family only rule. However, this is 100% a lie and she had seen non-family go back. I told my sister to come back in the morning without BF before work. 


So, reddit, my mom feels that I was a bit in the wrong but agrees. My sster isnt talking to me anymore and has not shown back up to the hospital. Do you think theres a better way I shouldve handled this?


Edit: Im reading everyones comment and trying to respond to everyone. Ive gotten a lot of great advice and welcome any advice. I can answer any questioms you have. Its quiet time at the ICU so Im resting until 8pm.

1185,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, here is my first post!

So I (F16) was on a flight from Dubai to new York, so it was quite a long trip. Usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother’s friend couldn’t afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn’t present during this whole situation.

When we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

Then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

I wasn’t paying attention but I took off my headphones when I heard my brother’s friend say no to the lady. She then said: “It is against my religion to touch men in public” and my brother said,

“But we’re not touching you.”

She looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother’s friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,

“Don’t move. Just ignore her.”

She then proceeded to ask me if I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,

“No. I don’t want the middle seat because I’m very claustrophobic (I’m not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)” and she said, 

“that’s not my problem.”

That’s when I got really pissed and I said it,

“Your religion is not our problem. Should’ve chosen better seats then” 

Then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that’s the last we saw of her. I’m guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

When we got back from the trip, my brother’s friend told me he was going to move and I wasn’t right to attack her religion like that.

So Reddit, AITA?

1186,Asshole,"When my friends and I go out, I’m usually the one who purchases the ticket/food and Venmo charge request them. Beginning this year, we’ve been going to the movies almost every other week so I’ve also been the one ordering the tickets online. 

For awhile now, I’ve been using an app to purchase discounted gift cards to use whenever I make purchases online. Sometimes there’s a really good sale where it’s x% amount off certain gift cards so I tend to stock up on places I know I’ll be using. The movie site is no exception and I was able to score gift cards for 15-20% off their market value. 

So my dilemma is whether or not I should Venmo charge my friends the discounted value or face value. I wouldn’t mind doing the discounted value but it can be bit of a hassle since sometimes I’m paying with multiple gift cards which I’ve acquired at varying discounts. 

Edit for additional info; 

For example, I used 3 separate gift cards for our last movie outing. The gift cards varied in value AND discount from 13.3%, 15%, and 10.9%. So just calculating the “true” value of each ticket is more of a hassle than splitting the value evenly. If I knew the discount was an even 20% off, I would have no problem charging them less. 

This is my receipt: 
https://imgur.com/a/nghYPyi

To figure out how much money each ticket costs, I have to go through my gift card order history and calculate each percentage I saved with each gift card. 

EDIT 2: 
I’m going to just refrain from being the one who buys the tickets and use the gift cards to treat out my boyfriend or something.

1187,Not the A-hole,"Okay, this is more like ""*was* I the asshole"", as this was almost two years ago and it's been resolved. Still something I want to hear more opinions about, though.

October 2017, my final year of High School, and exams were coming up. I had a history of not doing the best in School, but that year things had been looking up and I was fairly certain I'd pass. I had enough Level 3 NCEA (NZ high school qualification) credits to not need many from my exams to pass.

My dad and his partner really hated it when I was given resubmission opportunities because they ""didn't have them"" when they were in School, or because ""you won't get any resubs in university!"", so because I got a couple, they really weren't happy with the way I was still passing high school.

I had been working at a grocery store, and was making a decent amount of money. I decided to buy myself a Nintendo Switch. I didn't tell them at first because they don't like gaming, and I knew they would throw a shit fit. The first item to arrive was the carry case, and when my dad's partner asked me what it was, I told her it was a carry case for a new handheld game console I ordered. She wasn't happy about it.

Later, I was called into the lounge where they told me that when my Switch arrived, they'd confiscate it, because they were concerned that it would be a ""distraction"" for me, with my exams coming up. I thought it was ridiculous, because I was *18*, it was my property, and I bought it with my own money. I tried arguing that it would be no more of a distraction than my gaming laptop, which I had full access to without it being a distraction.

The day the Switch arrived, I hid it under some clothes in my bottom drawer because I had to go to work and I didn't trust them enough to leave it sitting on my desk. When I got back, the Switch was GONE. I was pissed and went to talk to them. They were upset that I'd hidden it from them and took it away. I argued, but they wouldn't listen. Later I convinced my dad to give it to me for a short while so I could see if it was functional. I didn't give it back.

At the end of the week, my dad's partner was pissed, packed her things, and left (she stayed during weekdays to work at a local school) because she thought I was ""walking all over"" my dad by refusing to give him my property. He got even more pissed at me, turned off the WiFi, acted passive-aggressive and grumpy, and even put a user account control password on my laptop ""just because (he) can"". At one point he wanted me to live with my grandparents just to get his partner back, but that never happened. After a couple of weeks, he threatened to *smash* it if I didn't give it to him. I caved in and didn't get it back until after school was finished. She returned, and we sort of left it at ""no hard feelings"".

I still think it's a ridiculous ordeal, but both of them seemed really upset with me for not letting my property be taken as an adult. Their relationship was put at risk because of it. Am I the asshole?

**EDIT:** Hey guys, thanks for the replies. I thought I'd explain some things:

* I wasn't paying rent (dad's partner suggested it to him a few times after High School was done but he never followed through).
* My grades were pretty good, while I was getting a couple of resubs, I was passing most things and was actually doing great in English and at least one other class (can't remember which one).
* By ""history of not doing the best"", I meant that I didn't pass NCEA Level 1 in year 11 (10th grade?) and needed a little help to get through Level 2. I wasn't struggling in Level 3.
* I moved out at the start of 2018. I'm all good.
* Tramping is basically hiking. I should have said that. Oops.
* In New Zealand, 18 is the voting and drinking age. Legally an adult.",163,1179,0.95

1190,Not the A-hole,"Background- we both work M-F but his hours are earlier than mine. He's up at 5ish, while I'm up at 7-8 most days. So naturally, on the weekends he tends to be up earlier than me. He usually lays in bed and plays on his phone quietly until I get up or he falls back asleep. Mattress is a Queen Tempurpedic.
This morning, 5:30ish, he's up, tossing and turning, which woke me up. He told me he couldn't sleep. Tossing and turning ensues and I call him a ""wiggle-worm"". He says I'm sorry, I'll go sleep downstairs, I did not object, but he also didn't get up. A few more minutes of wiggling and I sat up, said I'll go sleep in the guest room, everytime I start to dose off you toss and turn and its waking me back up. He pops out the bed and says no, I'll go and storms out. I didn't go after him and went back to sleep. About 20 mins ago, I woke up and he came in my room, and I immediately sensed a ""mood"". I tried to lighten things and ask if he wanted breakfast, nope. He told me he didn't like how things played out earlier and he would come by later but he wasn't staying the night again. I said all I wanted was a few more hours of sleep. He said this is the second time I've called him a ""wiggle worm"" recently (true) and ""it is what it is, there's no need to keep talking about it"". We did say I love you to each other before he left, and he added change to our honeymoon jar, so I am hoping this blows over.

1191,Not the A-hole,"The title sounds terribly insecure. But hear me out a second.

We went to the beach today and it was a big deal for me. I have suffered and continue to suffer from confidence and self-esteem issues; today I made the big decision to wear a bikini for the first time ever. My SO is partly to thank; he stood by me and always encourages me to be happy in my own skin.

 It was daunting at first, but eventually I focused less on the feeling of being judged, and gradually felt more comfortable. After sunbathing we went into the water. We were having fun, joking about, playing together etc.

 I was standing, facing him, who was sitting in the water while he was facing the beach. I noticed him looking at the beach with interest but thought nothing of it until he said “she moved closer to our stuff because the water touched her feet”. My SO is French and although amazing at English, is not fluent- that’s why I was confused as to what he meant at first. I looked over my shoulder and saw that he was looking at a girl who was moving her things because the tide had come in.

 Thinking nothing of it, I nodded and continued enjoying my time in the water but couldn’t help noticing that he continued to look at her. I said nothing until he mentioned the same girl again which then made me look over my shoulder and saw her now standing at the waters edge.

 I appreciate beautiful people, and she was definitely one- with a great body at that. But on the other hand, seeing my SO taken by a stranger was starting to make me feel inadequate and slowly become conscious of my body again.

 I stayed silent, not wanting my insecurity to get a hold of me but at this point he wasn’t even looking- but blatantly staring. I splashed him and said with a laugh to quit staring. He did at first but I noticed him continue to steal glances at her now and then.

 He approached me a while on after we got home, giving me a hug knowing I was upset and asking what was wrong despite knowing why.

 He’s a thoughtful guy, v. considerate, but when I opened up, his response was laughter- almost hysterical, and calling me crazy. Reminder that he is fully aware of the fact that I suffer from confidence issues and insecurity. I know that that is not his burden to carry but mine, but he always reminds me that he will always be mindful of it- yet wasn’t.

He left me alone. The more I thought about it, I became more upset about the fact that his response was laughter and calling me crazy over staring at someone else. He heard me crying and came back and, this time, listened as I explained to him why I had reacted the way that I had.

I do not blame my SO at all, neither am I upset at the girl. She was gorgeous and obviously my SO appreciates beauty just as I do, just as anyone does. But with knowing about my issues and still blatantly staring while I was in front of him- of course that really hurt me.

Am I the a-hole? Or just over sensitive? Or have I just lost the plot? Or maybe all three.",75,140,0.89
1192,Not the A-hole,"On tuesday I left for a school camping trip and I just got home yesterday, let me tell you that I was absolutely exhausted when I got back to school. 
Before I left I had made plans with my grandma for her to pick me up, I even left a note on the coffee table so she wouldn't forget. So after waiting at school for almost an hour, I was tired and super pissed she had forgotten me, I ended up having to take a 2 hour Metro ride and then walk for 20 minutes from the bus stop.

Well once I got into the house, she was on the couch watching Netflix, as soon as I saw that my anger boiled over and I ended up screaming at her that she had forgotten me before going to my room.
After a few hours, my mom gets home and ny grandma tells her everything, my mom then came into my room and lectured me about how I had no right to be angry and how my grandma does everything for me. I tried to explain my side of things but she shut me down and said I need to apologize.

My phone was dead, she has a phone but just doesn't have a plan.

1194,Not the A-hole,"So I (21F) have a friend (21M) and the plan was to get dinner and catch a movie after. Halfway through our meal, I received a call that my younger Brother got into an accident. Thankfully, he got away with only a dislocation, but he’s currently hospitalised. 

I wanted to be there for him so I told my friend that I wouldn’t be able to go for the movie. He got visibly disappointed and said that it was my choice, but also added that it was just a dislocation and that “his family weren’t there either when he dislocated his shoulder”. When I told him that I didn’t want my younger Brother to feel bitter that I wasn’t there for him, he told me that this one incident wouldn’t affect things. 

After probing, he told me that he was disappointed as we hadn’t met for a while and we finally managed to schedule this.

1195,Not the A-hole,"Quick Note: I literally call everyone dude, my friends, my sister, my dad, my grandparents, my girlfriend, my dogs, even my boss. not one person has a problem with it, and this is not the first time ive called mom it either, and shes never expressed any dislike toward it before and calls me dude as well. its basically my way of addressing someone informally, with me if i call you by your name either were in a room with multiple people or were having a conversation on a serious topic.

anyway im on a bit of a nocturnal schedule at the moment, so i made my food around 4am. washed off all my dishes and put them in the sink to eat and watch 1 episode of a tv show before unloading the dishwasher and putting the dirty stuff in, mom came in on the phone and said ""you know you gotta clean this right"" and i said yeah, she picked up some stuff and \*tossed\* it on the counter, making a lot of noise and i just calmly said ""Dude, you dont have to throw stuff"" and she went on for like 2 or 3 minutes with whoever she was on the phone with about how i just called her dude and threw a fit after hanging up. she even said shes gonna take back my car (she bought a new one and is \*\*selling\*\* me her old one for which ive already paid almost half of). walked around alternating between screaming ""DUDE!"" and ""HUMILIATED!"" for like 5 minutes then went to lay on the couch. She wont explain why shes upset, ive called her dude probably thousands of times over the past 4 or 5 years and this is the only time shes gotten upset, in hindsight i kinda see how she might want to put on the whole ""macho parent"" look in front of some friends but i mean even if it were embarrassing for her, wouldnt she have been better off just laughing and saying something like ""Not your dude"" to save face?.

For context im 23, not a kid, and shes 50. She raised me in a way that when we talk unless were fighting or talking about something serious we talk more like friends than family, always have, and because of that it feels more normal for me to say dude than mom if im not trying to get a point across.

1196,Not the A-hole,"Note: I'm older (late 40s) but I guess you're never too old to be an asshole, or at least wonder if you are.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 10 months. I'm divorced and she's a widow if it matters. I work a lot to pay for alimony and to put my kids through college. 

She says that we don't see each other enough and she's probably right so it's not too important to go over that.

About a week ago I wasn't feeling very good and she suggested that I go to the emergency room. While I was there the doctors discovered that I had a pretty bad infection which would require a lot of antibiotics. There was also some question as to whether I had a larger problem such as sepsis or even a massive infection in the bloodstream. Needless to say, I was worried.

While we were making small talk or discussing what might be wrong with me she decides to bring up, once again, that we don't see each other enough and that she doesn't feel all that connected. I told her that I agreed we don't see each other enough but that I couldn't really talk about it.


The next day, she asks if I wanted her to come visit. I know from experience that once she's brought up not seeing each other enough she's going to keep bringing it up every time we are together until we talk about it. So I told her that I would love her to come see me, but that I didn't have the strength to talk about anything too deep. She replied that she would be able to visit but that she couldn't promise that she would be able to avoid the subject of our relationship. I repeated that I would love to see her but that if the conversation turned to anything heavier than work or friends then I would not be able to carry on a decent conversation but that I could talk about it when I was out of the hospital. I did say that if there was anything else on her mind (work, her elderly mom, etc.) I would be glad to talk about that but that my tank was already running pretty low and I wasn't sure what good I'd be. 


She then said ""I guess you don't want me to visit then."" I felt like I was being manipulated a bit so I replied that if that was how she wanted to look at it then OK. She didn't visit for the 3.5 days I was there.

1202,Asshole,"I work away extensively and at the moment am doing Monday through to Thursday week. getting home late Thursday. It's a labour intensive job and I'm usually wrecked the Friday and come good Saturday Sunday. My S.O is doing placement and my excess pay is going towards paying her a wage so she can afford the 6+ weeks she can't work while doing unpaid placement.

Her grandfather's second wife has just recently had a stroke and isn't doing well. they're worried she may pass away soon. her father is planning on going down to see them this weekend but my S.O is worried she may not last till then, so I offered to cover flights up and back with a 2 night stay, that way she doesn't add more time to her placement, which is time based. she is considering it, but really the weekend trip with her father would be ideal for the current situation. no more time added to her placement means less for me out of pocket, not even considering cost of flights and shit.

She's considering doing the weekend trip but has asked me to come with considering I get back the Thursday. I don't really want to. i feel like the 10+ hour drive after a 6+ hour drive home from work will be to much. I also have a mates 21st which I've rsvpd for 4months ago. I don't want to spend a whole weekend traveling again and then come home late Sunday just to spend 6+ hours on the road on the Monday. AMITA?

1203,No A-holes here,"Me (29) and my gf (24) are in a relationship for about 2 1/2 years. We're both students, so money is scarce.

At the moment, I'm living alone in a flat that's about 200 meters away from my uni. She's sharing a flat with her best friend (f) in another part of the city, but that will change at the end of october, when her bff will move into a new place together with her boyfriend.

Me and my gf have been talking about how we would like to move together sometime in the not-too-distant future. So now, with her flatmate moving out, my gf is hellbent on seizing the opportunity and more or less urging me to move in with her.

The problem is: neither my guts nor my brain say this would be the right decision.

On the brain side, the timing is just horrible. Recently some really cost-intensive things had to be replaced at my place, and pairing that with the fact neither one of us has any savings worth mentioning, we're at a critical point financially. Also, we will both finish studying in about 1 1/2 years and I don't see why we can't keep things how they are a little longer and start building a life together when we got the money and security to do so with a good feeling.

Regarding the guts-side, it's a mix of to two things that let me hesitate. One: I really don't like her place too much. It's alright I guess, but I wouldn't voluntarily change it for the one I have at the moment and it's not the one I would really choose when looking for places. Two: I'm afraid I would never really feel at home if I move in. I always imagined a fresh start at a new place with her, where we make every decision together. But if I move into her place now, for me it feels like I'm just some kind of replacement out of convenience and it's not really ""our"" place, but still the place she and her bff built where I just happen to live now. There are no memories of us, just memories of them.

My gf argues that it's stupid for her to look for a new flatmate, when she has a boyfriend she wants to move together with anyways.

I say it doesn't feel right, both in my bank account and my heart, and don't see the big problem with her getting a new flatmate for the remainder of our study time.

She doesn't understand my concerns and thoughts in this matter.

1207,Not the A-hole,"First time posting so please bear with me. Excuse the grammar, spelling and typos, I’m on a mobile.
I work at a massage clinic as a massage therapist. We have had several issues this year with theft by employees. Not only theft of our cash tips but money from the register and items left by clients in the lost and found in the office safe. We do have cameras in the lobby, the office and the break room.  
After I came back to work after my weekend, I noticed that in my cubby spot that hangs on the wall, a few very low value items are missing. Several of us have this item at work. I bring it up to a person at the front desk who said that along with my items the others that were found were turned in to the manager. Everyone but me had their items returned. These items are not prohibited in any way. 
Now, I fully understand that the items in question are very inexpensive but the fact is I feel violated for having my possessions taken from me. So on our office group chat, I asked that my items be returned by Friday or I will report the theft to HR.  Well, Friday came and my items were not returned so I reported the theft to HR.  
So my boss never confronted me about the group chat post and was well aware of the missing items but didn’t seem to concerned about it until I reported it to HR. Now my boss is telling me I’m threatening people and offered to pay for my missing items. I told him no. That theft is theft regardless of the value of the item stolen. He thinks Im blowing this way out of proportion and maybe I am, but considering how poorly he handled previous thefts, I have lack of faith that he can/will handle this appropriately. 
For those of you who might ask why I don’t keep belongings in a locker. I do not bring anything to work that i would need to keep that safe. I keep my ID on me and only deal in cash so I don’t have a debit card. I have no reason to take up a whole locker.

He said we should agree too disagree and He should be able to sleep in the sofa during his morning shifts,that he has made a habbit of it.  
I just feel he does this to get out of his morning shift as he knows I can not sleep when he does this.  
So right now He is sleeping in the bed and I am furious and in need of judgement.  
Am I the asshole for demanding he stay awake and keep our kids safe during his morning shift?",58,153,0.96

1210,Everyone Sucks,"I (32M) left my High School 14 years ago. In the UK, we refer to High School as Secondary School. Same thing basically. I stayed at the same school for my Sixth Form (age 16-18).

I was bullied at this school. I was an anxious kid and unfortunately people were cruel. Teachers were apathetic. It was not a good time. I only began standing up for myself towards the end.

I now run a successful business and it's made more than two million this past year. It's definitely known in the regional papers near that school. Well the school asked me to come back and give a talk + Q&A and I agreed.

School just started back up last week so I came on the Friday. I was mainly speaking to the Year 11 (age 15 to 16) assembly. Had around 150 kids.

So I give my presentation on how I made my money and got my business running, and afterwards do a Q&A. I get some questions, but one question is what role I think school played in my success, I told them:

""Well, not much....I guess it motivated me to get out of this place. The kids were cruel and the teachers here, and I realize this will sound bad, but they're useless. I'm sure those of you getting bullied here will realize that...these teachers are useless, and I don't give a single one of them credit....only I am responsible for my success. My own sheer force of will resulted in my success""

There were only two teachers overseeing this assembly, but they looked embarrassed and awkward...another kid asked me about bullying, so I answered with my own experience and the mindset I believe he needs to cultivate:

""I was bullied by this one kid...noone did anything even after I asked for help. In the end....I had to play fire with fire. I came up with a nasty rumour about the kid...which worked. His mental health tanked and he had to move school...you have to see your enemies as enemies. They're not your friends and people like that don't truly mature. You have to destroy those who seek to destroy you. That's the mindset I took in the business world and look what it's done for me.""

I had some of the quieter and shy kids come to talk to me after my talk, and I saw my younger self in them. I offered them work placements at my business (which would do wonders for their CV/resume) but I also instilled my mentality in them.

Now obviously the headmaster confronted me after this, and he was the same one who was there when I was there, but I told him bluntly ""Your school is shit...you're always at the bottom of the rankings and in 14 years you haven't changed shit"". He flipped me off and told me to get out.

On the one hand I recognise I went too overboard, but when I say this school is shit, I mean it. The teachers here are sellouts. I want these kids to survive so I told them how I succeed. AITA?",253,269,0.79

1213,Asshole,"My fiance went to a baby shower a few months ago. It was just a girl thing so I wasn't invited, but I dropped her off and picked her up from it. When I got her, she had a small party bag with some small gifts inside from the pregnant girl, one of which was a small bottle of champagne. She showed each of the items to me as I drove us home and told me about some gossip, stories, etc. Anyway, we get home and she unpacks the small bag and gives me the tiny champagne bottle and asks me to put it in our alcohol cabinet (she can't reach it because she's too short).

It sat there for a few weeks until one day she went out with some friends for the night and I stayed home to watch a football game. I felt like some wine so I get up to look in our cabinet but it's completely empty except for this small bottle of champagne. The game was starting so I didn't want to leave the house just to buy alcohol and I know my fiance doesn't like drinking champagne so I thought why not. It only had 2 standard drinks in it so it didn't get me hammered or anything, just enough to enjoy the first half of the game.

Fast forward, she gets back, I'm completely sober and everything's normal. I didn't mention I drank it because I didn't think it was a big deal. I just put it in our normal bin as well so I wasn't trying to hide it or cover up the fact I drank it. I simply didn't think it was worth mentioning that I drank it. The actual argument didn't come until a few weeks later when the baby was actually born. My fiance tells me the news her friend finally gave birth and she asks me to get the tiny bottle down so we can have it. I told her I drank it a few weeks ago and she was livid.

Apparently you're only supposed to drink it when the baby comes. I didn't know and told her as such (I've never been to a baby shower so why would I?) but she said there was a little note written on it that said ""Pop me when she pops"" or something like that. I don't remember seeing it and even if I did I had no idea what it meant at the time. So, yeah, she thinks I ruined her ""friend giving birth day"" for her, which I've apologised for but she's not letting it go. Just trying to figure out how much more I should grovel because I'm the AH or at what point I just need to tell her to get over it because I'm not.

Thanks for reading.

EDIT:

Just to give more info in response to a prevailing theme I've seen in the comments:

We don't view things as ""mine"" or ""yours"" - we've been together 8 years now, own a house together, have joint bank accounts, etc. So she isn't upset with me because I drank ""her"" special bottle (she doesn't even like champagne as already stated); she's upset with me because I drank it before I was meant to without knowing. Hope that clarifies things.",66,70,0.85
1214,Not the A-hole,"We bought our first home together in May after years of renting and I want to take care of our investment. She's a bit of a slob, though. After talking to her twice about something, and her failing to stop the behavior, I hang up a small sign, typically a Post-It with tape:

* Next to the toilet: Flush me when done or my bowl will stain
* Next to the blender: Keep me upright or my bearings may seize
* On the trashcan: Close my lid or I attract flies
* On the kitchen sink: Run my disposal when discarding food or I clog
* Next to cleaning supplies: Close us when done or we dry out

I do feel like a bit of a pedant when hanging these signs, as if I'm educating a child on how to take care of things. But if she needs these reminders, that's fine by me, they don't bother me, and I'm not being judgemental about *her.* Edit: clarity: I'm insulting myself here, not her.



She however has told me I'm being passive aggressive. To me there's nothing passive about it: in every case I had alread talked to her twice about the problem. Likewise there's nothing aggressive about it: I'm not angry and I don't think less of her, I simply want to solve a problem.

1215,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit,

  
A few weeks ago, Florida faced a possible natural disaster. My mom and sister hate planning for disasters. Every year, I end up running around town to grab all the necessary supplies to ride out the storm. This year, my mom was out of town, and my sister was living with her fiance. My grandmom had been staying with me but decided to ride out the storm in her home instead. I started a new job a few months ago, and I wasn't able to grab supplies like propane, extra cases of water, etc.

  
My aunt's house has an extra room, and she was fully stocked on supplies. After putting up shutters at my home, and arranging everything as best as possible. I decided to go to stay with my aunt.

  
When I spoke to my family members to confirm their hurricane planes, my sister said she was staying in her apartment with my nephew. I told her that it would be better if she stayed with my aunt and me, or went to stay with my dad, who lived nearby. Her fiance was out of town, and I didn't want her to face the storm alone.  
In the end, her fiance returned to town and stayed with her and my nephew during the storm. Since the hurricane, my sister has been really cold and distant towards me. For a bit more context, I'm currently twenty years old. My sister is twenty-three, and her fiance is in his early 30s. When I got my home ready for the hurricane, my sister did not help. She was hesitant even to buy extra cases of water because she didn't think the storm would be severe. She told our mutual friend that she was upset that I didn't offer to stay with her during the hurricane. From her point of view, I left her alone with a 7-month old. She believes she needed my help more than my aunt needed me. At the same time, she did not ask for my help at all over the phone. She told our mutual friend that she felt as though she did not have to.

  
So Reddit, am I an asshole for not staying with her during the hurricane?

  
Quick Update--I did try talking to my sister about this. The maybe storm was on Sept 2nd, and we'd spoken several times since then. Not once did she didn't bring up her hurt feelings until a few days ago in a private conversation with our mutual friend. Our friend suggested she should share her hurt feelings with me. She responds by saying, she prefers to be petty and knows that I will inevitably apologize for my behavior. So am I the asshole for refusing to apologize and trying to ""fix"" things?",16,47,0.85

I knew breast feeding was a sore subject for her, so I thought I'd reassure her and tell her ""I don't think it is your fault"". She asked me what I meant by ""don't think so"" and I told her that ""I'm not a doctor, but I don't see how it could be your fault"". I wasn't sarcastic or hesitant like ""I don't *thiiiiink* so"" or anything, I meant it and I was really trying to reassure her.

She blew up at me. She said that there was no way it could be her fault, and I should have said so. I pointed out that she was the one who even brought up that she could be at fault, and she responded that she didn't mean it, she wanted me to reassure her it wasn't.

1219,Asshole,"Hey everyone,

I was recently promoted to a management position, but was transferred to a new department. As I was speaking with staff members, some of male staff informed me that they were being subject to a strict dress code while female staff were not. I personally felt the same frustrations at my old department, where would be dressing formally but women would be dressing casually, and decided to look into this. I believe in a formal workplace, and if men can dress formally, so can women.

I looked through the intranet, and found a dress code policy. I read through it and it turns out that while the men's dress code was enforced as written; women were consistently breaking written rules with no enforcement. I e-mailed HR who told me that the policy as it stands is valid.

I therefore called a team meeting and informed the team that the policy will be enforced starting next week.

Here is the policy:

**Men**

* Long Sleeve Dress Shirt
* Dress Pants
* Dress shoes
* Blazers are recommended, and required when meeting clients

&#x200B;

**Women**

* Dress Shirt / Blouse. Cannot be sleeveless. Shoulders must be covered
* No cleavage
* No bare midriff / back
* Blazers are recommended, and required when meeting clients
* Dress Pants (not capris, must reach ankles)
* Alternatively, dress skirts which cover the knees
* Alternatively, a business dress, as long as it meets the requirements above (i.e. everything covered from shoulder to knees)

The men were currently dress in line wit the policy, but the women were not. Sleeveless tops, T-Shirts, miniskirts, and Smart casual pants / capris / shorts were all common place. Cleary the convention was not equal.

I informed the team about the new policy and if they had any feedback or issues. The men were happy, but the women were extremely angry. They accused me of trying to push ""outdated norms"" on them, and that I was being ""misogynistic"" and ""trying to control women's bodies"". I, along with some male staff, tried explaining to them that men are also subject to formal dress codes and have always been; and that their dress code is in fact laxer as they can wear skirts, dresses, and short-sleeve tops. They didn't want to hear it. I also explained that this is company policy that is now going to be enforced, it is not something that I made up out of thin air. The female staff were still not happy. 

I met with staff individually to seek their perspective, and a lot of female staff just didn't want to dress formally. They (in general) felt that norms have allowed women to dress more casually in the workplace, and that I am ""just trying to roll back the clock"". I asked how they felt about men dressing formally, and they said that norms for them ""haven't caught up yet"", and so the norm for having men dress formally should be followed.

To me, an office is a formal environment, and that equality goes both ways - women, like men, need to start dressing formally in an office again. I therefore e-mailed everyone that the policy is in effect starting Monday. AITA?",395,82,0.8

1221,Not the A-hole,"I (36F) have 2 kids, both daughters one is 8 and the other is 7. My husband has started a new job this year that gives him a weird work schedule. He spends a month across the world in Pakistan working 9 hours days and spends a month here not working. 

Both of my daughters dispise each other. They've gone to therapy for almost a year now and nothing has changed. They argue about everything. 

They were arguing last month when my husband wasn't there and wouldn't listen to me. They kept yelling at each other and wouldn't acknowledge me. I couldn't think of what I could do because they were about to turn violent. I picked up one of my daughters and took her to another room and told her she needed to stop. Went to the other room to do the same to my other daughter. I told them they had to stay in their rooms in time out until I finished lunch.

I go to the kitchen to make lunch and I hear arguing again in my youngest daughter's room. Instead of picking one of them up again I just grabbed my spray water bottle (we have a cat that likes to jump everywhere). I sprayed them both until the argument stopped. It worked. They were mad at me but I finally got them to stop.

They don't respect me as much as their father. Since he is there for full time for a month and gets to be a full time stay at home Dad for a month. Meanwhile I still work at my accounting job full time. 

They were arguing the next day and I did the same thing again by spraying them. It worked. This was the only thing I've done that can get them to stop arguing. I can't take them out in public anymore because they would start something and throw fits. They just really have a tendency to misbehave more when my husband isn't around.

I started this habit because it's the only thing that worked for me so far. I did this for weeks and it turned down the arguing a bunch. 

Yesterday my husband came home and we spent some time catching up (kids were asleep). I told him about the water bottle and he got really upset. He kept saying I shouldn't do that and called me an asshole. He gave me the Cold shoulder all day and didn't speak to me aside from asking where my daughters backpack was.

So technically I have a net worth of $0.

But one girl, let's call her Sarah, got a bit pissed off. Btw, she's not poor, she lives in my neighborhood, and her mom  works with my dad.

She started going off about how 'You're not poor, you're rich' and 'you don't know what it's like to be poor' and so on and so forth. To this, I responded that 1) To a certain extent, yes, I did grow up pretty comfortably, but I have a net worth of $0. Which is literally poor. Besides, I don't have any money of my own, so I'm not rich, my parents are. And besides, she's taking a casual text way too seriously.

I continued to wear the engagement ring he gave me for 3 years on my left ring finger before I finally moved it to my left middle finger. I did this so it could still always be close to where it was suppose to be but because a lot of my family and friends said that it was a little strange because I was no longer actually engaged. 

It took me another year to finally get back into dating. And almost as soon as I did I met a wonderful guy. He made me feel like maybe it was ok to be happy again. He reminded me of the person I use to be before losing my late fiancé.

So we have been dating for 3 years now and about a week ago he proposed. I was beyond happy and posted it to social media a few days after to let everyone know. I posted a picture of the ring my current fiancé gave me on my left ring finger and i was also wearing the engagement ring of my late fiancé on my middle finger just like I have always had.

He claims my old ring looks too dingy, small and cheap next to his ring and it just looks awful. I was very hurt and I tried to remind him what the ring meant to me and he got very angry. He told me I was engaged to him now and not my late fiancé and that I really need to show my loyalty to him and just take it off. I told him no and he said he thinks I need time to think about who is here for me right now.

I work very hard at my job, love my job and have great feedback from my manager. She told me about the senior position and i took additional duties on myself with a view to applying for the position. I worked very hard on extra duties to maximise my chance of getting it.

The position was finally advertised and i applied. I attended the interview along with my folder as thick as a book with all the procedures i had worked on or optimised. During the interview, none of the questions related to the job or our department. I realised none of my work mattered as these were just vague questions about when we had managed people in the past. I was not surprised when i didn't get the job and it was given to a stranger from a different deoartment, who has never even seen our systems before, has no idea what we do but is already earning the higher senior salary elsewhere in the local Authority.

My line manager was devastated as it meant extra work for her to train a new person from scratch and she had really wanted me to get it. There is much rumbling that the job was already lined up for this stranger. She and the higher up bosses said i was the best person for he job and just sort of shrugged that i didnt get it.

I had updated my resume for the interview so i sent out several applications and am looking for a new job that fits in with my family life and pays better but the market is slow so I'm getting on with things and just doing my job.

A month ago my line manager asked me  to help with the monthly report work. Something i had been doing for the last couple of years in addition to my extra project work and procedural analysis. I advised i would help one final time and then i expected the senior to do it. I know this means more work for my very nice line manager as the new senior will take months to train, but i don't feel that i should be doing someone else's work.

I then decided that i would do only my work across the board. I worked hard at my job and i tweaked all the procedures to optimum so i get my work done quickly and have plenty free time at work. Some of my colleagues are inexplicably slow and are forever handing me unfinished work that they didnt manage to do that day. (Some are older and refuse to copy and paste for example)

Ive started forwarding these emails asking ne to finish their work on to the line manager and copying the worker who sent it to me in advising i no loner do other people's work. 

This means my colleagues now have to work harder and my line manager has lots more work. But i cant bring myself to put in the extra work any more for a job where they've rejected all the hard work ive put in.

1229,Everyone Sucks,"This includes me and three other classmates. Some say we were AH for stooping to his level, others say we were justified.

I'm a private-university student on their last semester. This semester we got a new professor. He seemed nice, but would avoid repeating himself or explaining things. He was pretty vague, and would drawl out whatever he said almost as if to waste time. Nobody pressed even if they had questions because it's the first few days and no one's comfortable yet.

The issue started when he posted the first powerpoint presentation to our class online (that has his name, his chosen theme etc) on a certain subject and we had to find more info on it for a lot of points; normal stuff. But when I was looking deeper into the subject for the assignment I came across an older presentation on the internet done by some *student* from another country. And it was word-for-word copypasted. He had just changed the layout, font and put his name on it. Prof's Powerpoint was made recently, we checked. I wasn't the only one who noticed.

We didn't think it was a big deal to get him *fired* over (plagiarism is prohibited in my university and gets students rightfully kicked out); we're talking about a single presentation here so far. Nobody has snitched on him yet. But his attitude did bother me. I just came to the conclusion that this professor was being lazy and half-assing things which were ultimately important for us (we're talking about our future career here, and are spending *hundreds* to attend this class only to be handed material written by a *student* from another country?).

So three classmates and I decided the assignment we handed back in also had copy-pasted material and was edited minimally. To our surprise, he raised a stink about it during class although he didn't call us out by name.

After the class was over, I approached him and told him it was unfair that he'd hold us to a different standard when he himself had plagiarized the original assignment from a student and gave not even some credit. He kind of sputtered a bit and told us that as students we had to be better than that because we were working towards a degree while he had already finished his.

He ended up giving us good marks and not outing us for the plagiarism, but earlier today in class he was grumbling about having to deal with a blackmail situation.

AWTAHs? Us not speaking up about it *did* let him keep his job.

and some commenters seem take personal issue with some posts (possibly because they've been hurt like this in the past) , which creates a personal bias immediately, thus creating the meanest responses. 
For example:
If someone was a cheater, the comment section is drowned in terrible terrible things being said to that person. Again, everyone makes mistakes.  Everyone. 

People come on here because they are conflicted and struggling. 

Yes some people genuinely suck and they are the asshole, but does that mean we have to be an asshole back to them?",52,140,0.8
1233,Asshole,"I'm throwing a Harry Potter-themed party next month for friends of mine who are serious fans.  I'm going all out - candles hanging from the ceiling, a Platform 9-3/4 backdrop, photo props for the ""Have You Seen This Wizard?"" and ""Undesirable No. 1"" posters.  I'm sending guests invitation letters and train tickets on paper that looks like parchment and using a Hogwarts seal on red wax.  I ordered wooden dowels to make wands, antique glass bottles and different colored mica to make potion bottles, and I'll be providing food, ""Honeydukes"" sweets, and alcoholic butterbeer.  I'm also hand-making my own Cards Against Wizardry deck, having a Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Bean face-off, and doing a house-team trivia game.  All of the supplies will probably cost close to $300, which is a lot for me.  It's not the kind of party where gifts are expected, but because people will get to take home wands and potion bottles, would I be an asshole for asking each guest to pay $10?

Edit:  Guests whom I've discussed the party with on FB have agreed to attend and know that this is going to be lavish and that they'll be making wands and getting acceptance letters (the potion bottles will be a surprise).

Edit No. 2:  Two of the people planning to attend went with me to Harry Potter bar crawl last spring.  We paid $35 to go and all we got was a chintzy plastic cup and a lightning bolt temporary tattoo.",54,58,0.87
1234,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my cat might read this.

In all seriousness, my cat was an outdoor cat when I lived with my parents. So, basically her entire life. She is six years old. My parents live in a cul-de-sac and I felt like the neighborhood was relatively safe. My cat is extremely smart and I trust her with taking care of herself out there.

I recently moved out of my parents house into apartments out in the mountains. There are more wild animals out here and I don’t really trust people to let her roam free especially since she’s such a friendly cat. She only lets people she trusts pick her up but if a stranger becomes someone she trust, they can easily take her away. The neighbors at my parents house knew it was our cat. 

Now, am I the asshole because I keep my cat indoors? She’s getting old and I don’t think she’ll be able to fend for herself forever. She is becoming more talkative and extremely impatient and I can just tell she’s angry at me for not letting her out. She’s miserable. AITA because I won’t let her out? She’s capable, but it’s a new area and I’m scared to let her run free. I just want to protect her and keep her safe.",204,137,0.92

1238,Not the A-hole,"Pertinent fact: I have mild OCD (germaphobic and ritual). I also have multiple contact allergens.

So today I was at the laundromat. It’s not the one I usually go to, but since it was Friday and I figured my usual would be swamped, I decided to try a smaller one. Everything went fine until my clothes were in the dryer with about 25 minutes left.

Since it was practically dead and there were plenty of open machines, I felt comfortable putting on headphones to watch part of a film. About five minutes later I happen to look up and see some older couple I don’t know in front of my open dryer and elbow-deep in my laundry. 

I admit I flipped out a little, rushing across the distance and asking what they were doing in a loud voice. “Oh, we’re just moving your laundry! We have a dryer that has 23 minutes left on it!” 

“And mine has 20 minutes left on it! I didn’t ask you to move my laundry!”

“It’s okay, we asked the lady working!”

“It’s NOT okay! It’s not okay for you to just touch my things!” 

The couple left grumbling that they were trying to be nice. I tried to talk myself down using all of the tricks from therapy but none of them worked—I had to rewash all of my laundry. When I was putting my laundry back into the washers, I noticed I’m missing my two best pairs of panties.

The lady working at the laundromat thinks I’m being “ridiculous” and keeps saying “They were trying to be nice!” She also thinks my missing underwear was an honest mistake. 

AITA for being suspicious that trying to “give” me three minutes on a dryer was a poor excuse for fetishists to steal a stranger’s expensive panties and that, regardless of motive, you just shouldn’t touch laundry that doesn’t belong to you?",48,79,0.89

1240,Asshole,"My wife texted me at work today. She said that my 4 year old son wanted to dye his hair pink, and asked me if I had any objections. I replied that I was okay with it, but I would appreciate if she chose a gender neutral color. 

In the next text I got from her, she blew up at me and said that she's ""going to dye it green instead but only because it was okay with him"" (he had asked for green hair the day before so I was a little surprised when my wife said he wanted pink). Then she went into a paragraph long rant about how I need to think about why pink is not an acceptable color to me. She went on to say that I don't seem to want my son to do anything feminine. So, I must think that a boy acting feminine is bad, and therefore I’m saying that a boy trying to be like his mom in any way is a bad thing, and that way of thinking is ""sexist bullshit"". 

My wife likes to dye her own hair various colors, and is often outfitted in very colorful ways. I don't object to any of this. She's an adult and can express herself however she chooses. It's not my particular style, but I've never criticized her for the way she chooses to look. 

I'm completely fine with teens and adults expressing themselves through their style. But I don't think young children have the maturity to understand that a style choice can sometimes come with unintended consequences. My son thinks ""pink is a bright color, it'd be neat if my hair was that color!"" He doesn't realize that going to school the next day with pink hair could very easily invite mockery from his classmates. He's already a shy kid. I don't want him to be isolated from his peer group for something like this. He doesn't understand the greater context, but his mother and I do. So, we should protect him from things like this. I'm not trying to stifle his individualism or anything. I'm just trying to protect him from a world that he hasn't yet learned to live in.

I have no problem with my son doing traditionally feminine things. We cook meals together. We clean the house together. Sometimes he’ll play with baby dolls, or watch cartoons clearly marketed to girls. I've never dissuaded him from following his natural interests in any way. I think my wife is reacting to something under the surface here that I'm not aware of. She thinks I'm trying to make our son into some antiquated version of a mainly man, but I'm just trying to protect him from making a choice he doesn't fully understand the repercussions of. He’s only 4. He doesn’t need to be a soldier on the front line of some social justice war to redefine what it is to be masculine. 

TLDR: My wife wants to dye my 4 year old son’s hair pink. I think it’s a bad idea because it will invite bullying. She thinks I’m a sexist asshole. I don’t want my kid used as a pawn to redefine society’s idea of what it means to be a “boy”.",155,35,0.67
1241,,"This past Friday I noticed two people at the end of my driveway and went out to talk to them. It turned out they were the prospective buyers of the house next door. They explained they were in my driveway/sideyard because they were looking at the neighbor's fence and trying to ascertain if metal fences were allowed.

One of the first things the prospective buyer's wife said was that it may not work out because the house needs a new roof. I said that a lot of homes in the area have been getting new roofs lately and we just had ours replaced 4-5 years ago.

Monday I get a knock on the door and it's the sellers (husband and wife both). He asked if I'd met them and I said that I had. He then claimed they were trying to back out of the contract because I told them the house needs a new roof. I explained to him that I didn't say that and I know nothing about his roof so I wouldn't ever make a comment about the life of his roof.

He said that he had 3 people tell him that I said his house needs a new roof and I told him that I don’t care how many people he had tell him that because a lie is a lie no matter how many people he hears the lie from.

This went in a circular fashion maybe 3 times with him accusing me, my telling him that it was untrue, him claiming that 3 people told him I said that, and my telling him that I don’t care how many people said that. It might have continued longer except my wife got irritated and came to the door and loudly stated, “Why would he EVER try to ruin your house sale when WE WANT YOU TO MOVE?”

At that point he started yelling about it and then walked away shouting about how I better never set foot on his property again. (I had met a person on his lawn a week prior while he was away on vacation and talked to them long enough to ascertain it was his real-estate agent. I thought I was doing something nice by keeping an eye on his place while it was for sale but the way the real estate agent tells it I was all over his property--it was maybe 15' in reality.)

After checking my security footage I discovered that I actually have video of the buyers in my driveway telling me that the house needs a new roof. Since he asked me not to step on his property I tried texting the proof to him and since I got no response I parked my car in front of his place with a screenshot of the video taped to the window along with a note that said “I even got the conversation on video. Asshole.”

The next day (I’m fairly certain he saw it by then) I moved the car back to my driveway and took down the sign in it. To amuse myself, I made a professional looking sign on an H-Frame that says “Neighbor Roof Inspections! Free opinions now!” Along with a functional email address… it was like $5 to register the domain and $5 to make the good looking sign. I put that sign out in the yard. It's funny to me and my wife and meets the townships municipal code for signs but it is also clearly meant to troll the guy.

1247,UPDATE,"[OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

It's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and I guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

In my last post, I stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

Alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. Despite the chain of advice I sent her, she ignored me still. I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.

I had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. LMAO. What a fucking asshole. Glad my sister finally returned to her senses. She told me she broke it off with him and I sincerely hope that's the truth.

This past Monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. According to my mom, she was begging that they do is ASAP, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

The future seems pretty bright right now for her. My parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and I think it'd be great for her). She's officially starting next Monday. I'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

TL;DR: Sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. Delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and McDonald's. Sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

EDIT: Forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. I urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",709,22669,0.9

1252,Not the A-hole,"I recently went on a father-daughter trip and after I got home I received a text from my father telling me I needed to allow him to track me through my phone in case I was kidnapped. I refused. He then threatened to delete my contact info if I didn’t add him. I responded asking if he was serious and that his response to my refusal seemed extreme. As a friend summed it up best: “let me stalk you or I won’t talk to you.” He hasn’t responded to any of my texts since then (about a week ago).

My father has always been paranoid. We had video cameras and high-tech alarms systems at our house growing up in the 80s. He has always been worried about getting robbed. My theory is his paranoia has to do with him being a wealthy, right wing Republican who’s scared he’ll finally get his just deserts. Anyway, he’s been buying into the Trump style fear propaganda and his paranoia has been getting worse. 

I don’t live a life of fear. I don’t lock my home or my car. I’ve never been robbed or assaulted. I don’t live in an area where kidnapping is common and it’s not something I even think about. I also value my privacy. I understand it’s almost impossible to have privacy in today’s world, but I refuse to actively consent to giving it up. I don’t use social media (except Reddit). The only thing you find when you google me is stuff related to my job. I disabled location tracking on my phone, don’t install apps, don’t have find my phone active, don’t use google maps on my phone. I understand I’m still being tracked through cell service (and probably things I’m unaware of), but my cell provider only keeps those records for fourteen days. I don’t want to give Apple my step-by-step movements for them to keep for who knows how long and do who knows what with. I know they probably already have it, but I simply can’t stomach knowingly and voluntarily agreeing to it. There’s probably a TOS somewhere that I already did which I didn’t read, but this would be me actively requesting they track me. I see it as different.  

Here’s why this is NOT a validation post: my father still pays for my phone. I am not a teenager. I’m in my late thirties. I make a good six figure income and could easily afford to pay for my phone. I’ve simply always been on the family plan (so are all my siblings and step-siblings, the youngest of which is in their late twenties). My father is extremely wealthy and has no issues having everyone on his plan. In fact, I think in a way he likes it. My father did not threaten to “take my phone away” nor would he ever. That would be silly. He knows my response who be to simply get my own phone. 

This is a very specific question I’m asking for judgment on: AITA for refusing to allow my father to track me while using the phone and plan he pays for?",51,52,0.83
1253,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a few weeks ago at my friends wedding. I was in the bridal party with 5 other girls. The day prior to the wedding we did some bridal party shots. Including one where we were in our matching bridal “pajamas”. Nice shorts and a top provided by the bride for her bridesmaids as favors. 

Anyway, we did some shots of us with pillows and stuff like that. The last shot the bride wanted to do was for everyone to “moon” the camera. This was one that “wasn’t to be distributed but would goto is girls”. 

So anyway. We pull the shorts down. Bend over. Camera girl takes a few snaps. And we go on our way. 

Last week my friend got the proofs back from the photographer. And she called me to come over. I thought all the girls would be there but nope just me. Here she points out that “you can clearly see your snatch”. “My husband saw these” and “what were you even thinking”.

1256,Asshole,"Sorry in advance for my rambling story, I haven't been writing often. So my girlfriend is currently ticked off at me and wants me to apologize for mouthing ""what the fuck"" at her.

Some background: my girlfriend and I are living with her parents, I have started going to school again this semester with the hopes of finishing my degree, my girlfriend works full-time.  Tuesday I had a long day of class scheduled from 10:30am to 8:45pm (with some breaks of course), but I tweaked my back so I skipped the evening course and went home early.  Now diagnosed as a back spasm relating  to a lower back sprain from a couple months ago.  I get home eat, do some homework, and it's finally around 12am that my gf comes home.  She had a really long day at work too, maybe they were understaffed, I'm not sure I didn't get to talk to her about why she got off so late.

She doesn't respond to this, and I lie there trying to ignore their conversation and getting increasingly annoyed. 20 minutes later I get up to get my gf's attention to see she's just grabbed another beer from the fridge, so I mouth ""what the fuck.""

1257,Not the A-hole,"I am 1 of 4 kids. I live with my dad, stepmum, and 3 siblings. I am 20 years old, a uni student, and I pay rent to my dad and stepmum. I live with them as they live near my uni and I can't afford to move out. I pay for my car and phone with my wages.

My siblings are 17, 15, and 13. They have rules around them going out. The rules are:

Staying in contact.

Home before sunset

If either of the above rules are broken, the rule breaker is grounded for up to 30 days.

Rules of being grounded include:

No phone/laptop/TV. The phone is kept in the liquor cabinet for the duration of the grounding, which is padlocked with a number lock that only me, dad and stepmum know the pin for.

The only electronic we can use is the desktop PC in the family room, which is older than I am.

No going out with friends/having friends over.

If we are able to drive, we must hand in our car keys,

These rules applied until I started paying rent (age 17) and once I started doing that they let it go, but still checked in when I went out.

This month I had my MOT, so I came up £50 short on my rent. I told them I'd give them what I had this month and I'd give them the £50 plus normal rent next month. They agreed.

I went out last night with some friends, home around 3 am. My phone died around midnight and dad and stepmum were still up. They said as I can no longer be trusted to get home on time or charge my phone I am grounded for 30 days. I was exhausted so I just went to bed. (note: I don't drink at all so I was fine to drive)

I came downstairs this morning, and went to get my car keys and phone, but both things were missing.

I asked if anyone had seen them. Stepmum and dad reminded me that I am grounded. I said ""no I'm not"" and went to the liquor cabinet. I entered the combination and took my car keys and phone back. Dad and stepmum said something like ""what do you think you're doing? You're grounded."" I said ""no I'm not"" and left.

I now have a bunch of texts from dad and stepmum, all saying some variation of ""you just disrespected us in front of your younger siblings, now we're struggling to enforce your step-sister's grounding as she no longer thinks of these as rules that have to be followed."" I also forgot to put the lock back on so my step-sister was able to just take her phone back, and found out the code to the lock while she did it.

&#x200B;

From my POV I am 20 years old, I have a job, pay my rent and phone bill and maintain my car. I am only £50 short on rent this month, and I am paying them the money owed next payday. They have no right to take my car key, or my phone, or ground me.

From their POV, I didn't pay my rent in full this month, which they argue means that the house rules apply once again. When they tried to apply the house rules to me I openly disrespected their rules in front of my siblings, and in doing so enabled my younger sister, who is currently mid-grounding, to go against her own grounding.

AITA?

INFO: The rent is £450 a month, I paid them the £400, and next month I'll be giving them £500 to make up for what I was short this month.

UPDATE: I'm meant to have a ""serious talk"" with them some time soon. I've found a few flats in the town my university is in ranging from £150 to £350 a month (including bills), and I'm going to talk to some friends from uni and see if there's a potential roommate situation there. If my dad and stepmum won't lower my rent enough for me to have savings, then once my student finance comes in (about 1k coming in the next few weeks) that should cover the deposit and first month or two of rent, which will give me time to save up my wages and hopefully have some savings.",507,1812,0.97

My in laws are late 50's and unfortunately my MIL needs to have a surgery that requires 2 weeks of bedrest and 8 weeks to fully recover enough to go home. She is the sole income of the home as my FIL does not work due to heart issues and has only worked in factories (retired early with no savings or anything but has an excessive gambling problem). My father in law is a very lazy person, needs to be catered to and does nothing around the condo to help MIL maintain their home. My husband , I and his other siblings will help out when we can (physically and financially). I get along with them but I don't like going overboard as they are \`100% the reason for the situation they are in.

Now the issue is that her surgery is in 2 weeks and my hubby wants to move BOTH his parents into our home to take care of her and split their home bills amongst us and his siblings families (both his sisters have said they can contribute a little because they have kids, they can't do much (totally understand this), so we would be on the hook for 80% of it, which is something we absolutely cannot afford without killing our savings. We've taken 2 days off to transition her from hospital to home.

Outside of the financial issue, I personally can not stand the idea of them living with us.  I feel we get along because there is some space, but I would not be able to be around FIL 24/7 and lose my privacy. My MIL is super nosey and do not like the idea of this AT ALL. I've offered my SO 2 other options.

1. We can go to his parents house every other day after work and the weekends and split days with other siblings to help out.
2. He can go live with his parents until she is back on her feet and I'll come visit him and/or sleepover on the weekends with him and help out.

My husband thinks I'm being an AH in their time of need but for me, every week they have multiple ""times of need"" and we go to help out so we will be doing the same. He says that he has trouble sleeping in another bed (which is true) and would prefer to sleep at home, I explained to him how stressful it is for me to have them in the house with FIL's behavior and MIL's snooping. I'm also worried that this would lead them to live in our home as every time they visit, they constantly make comments about how much nicer our home is and we live and ""upscale live"" while they live in the ""slums"" (we live in the Greater Vancouver area, they do not live in the slums..they have a condo, we have a house).

She went to a different salon that charged her $95 for the same thing. She now wants me to pay for the whole thing since I was going to give her money regardless. Thanks you for your time reddit!,184,397,0.92
1262,Asshole,"My sister asked me (she cannot have a baby) whether I would have a baby for her. I said yes. My boyfriend immediately became angry because I didn’t ask him about it first. 

Consider: she was not asking for OUR baby. She did not want mine or my boyfriends genes. She wanted her and her husband’s baby, inside me. She has a medical condition where pregnancy may kill her. 

I don’t think my boyfriend should have ANY say over what I do for my sister with my body. I would not be cheating on him, no sex involved in this pregnancy. It would be done medically. Then they get the baby. No responsibility on us other than I stay healthy. He’s just mad that I would say yes without asking because he “will have to deal with the pregnancy.” He doesn’t want my body to change as it does with pregnancy and he doesn’t want to deal with my mood swings because of hormonal changes. 

I think he’s the asshole for thinking he has any right to say what I do with my body. He thinks I’m the asshole for not considering him with what I do with my body. Even if it’s for my sister, the person I am most close to and if it ever came to it, I would end the relationship with him if given an ultimatum. So either way, she’s going to get a baby. Why do I even have to ask if what he says literally doesn’t make a difference?


UPDATE: to respond to questions, I have not had children before. We are not long distance, we live together. He was in the room when my sister asked, I didn’t come home and say “I’m getting pregnant” but he knows that this is really important to me and how close I am with my sister. I am positive that if the roles were reversed, she would do the same for me, and I just felt like yes, you’ll have to deal with me pregnant if you want to stay, but I don’t think I should have waited to respond to my sister because ultimately, what happens with my boyfriend and I because of it wouldn’t affect my decision.

Additional UPDATE: Boyfriend and I are both young twenties. We've been together less than three years. If I was married to him and already committed to sharing my life with him, I may have paused. But saying this again: He was in the room and immediately got mad with me for responding. It wasn't that I had time to think about say ""ew fuck him,"" but I did know that I would NOT be refusing to have a baby for my sister. The details of the, where, how where not hammered out. I could have very easily agreed to wait to have my own kids first and then have hers. May have sped up both of our timelines but she means the world to me. I was pissed that he was pissed before even considering it. To who said I was putting a spin on it, absolutely not. His two reasons were mood and my body changing, which is the literal reason I think that even after considering his opinion, I don't care. Yes those are valid and will happen to me, but I think it's a bs reason to not want someone to do it. 

It seems like the general consensus is that I am a raging bitch. Although I -still- say I would obviously prefer his support, his lack of support will not change my mind. Legally/medically, if I have to wait or have a kid first, So Be It. I honestly think that has no bearing on whether my decision was bad or not. It wouldn't have made it any less of a dick move if it was allowed without me having kids first, would it? Also- sister and husband would be paying all bills, supplements, maternity clothes, etc. I love the hell out of him but I've been in relationships before where people stopped me from doing things and having a life and I swore that it would never happen again, no matter how smitten. Maybe I over-corrected this attitude. 

But things I did begin to consider that did not cross my mind (honestly, thank you, internet)
1) He may want to experience pregnancy for his child first and I could potentially be depriving him of a special thing to him. I've only been considering the fact that he wants to deprive my sister of motherhood. I didn't think about him missing out on the ""firsts"" of pregnancy. 
2) Did not consider the fact I might not be able to work. I have known pregnant people and they dip out of work right before giving birth and wait a bit before coming back. However, my sister offered to let us live with her during the pregnancy. She was never going to be not heavily-involved. Nothing is expected of boyfriend in this situation except to let me do it without being callous. So I don't think money has a real issue here for him although I know it's a factor for my sister. 
3) Even though his opinion wouldn't change whether I would ultimately do it or not, he may have felt like his opinion in other things would not matter because of how quickly I replied to this situation. I agree I would not bring home a pet without talking to him. But I would never tell him whether or not to help out a family member, REGARDLESS of how it inconvenienced me. I do not think romantic relationships should dictate your relationship with everyone else. Sure, they can affect them, strain them, strengthen them. But whatever boy I am dating (I feel) has no right to protest MY sister's baby inside ME. I get that I'm asking a lot of him already to stick around. But I'm also ok if we DID put our relationship on hold because he didn't want to ""deal"" with my hormones and body.
4) It may not be WHAT decision I made, but HOW I made the decision. Even if I value my sister's relationship more than mine with him, responding immediately just pulled it out into the open and threw it into his face when I could still have made the decision, but gentler for him. 

Hope that doesn't count as arguing, not discounting anyone's opinion and I appreciate everyone who replied, even the ones who think I deserve to be alone for life. It gave me perspective because apparently other people (namely boyfriends) can legitimately feel entitled to parts of my life that I think they should have no say in. Just makes me rethink some other decisions I've made without asking. You're probably right that he puts up with a lot of shit to date me. I'm stubborn and argumentative and act before thinking. I'm emotional and passionate and respond how I honestly feel, but I don't act maliciously, even if I don't take the care to make sure I don't hurt whoever is around me. My assumptions skipped a lot of steps that would have been good to think about: like yes even though I WILL do it, I should give him notice. Give him the option of leaving or moving out before I do it. Or honestly, give him the option of finding someone else to have kids with and live with if he doesn't accept my faults (like impulsivity- working on it but obviously not very good at controlling it yet) like I accept his that can annoy me, although the point of this post is not to point out what's good and bad in both of us- it's a very isolated, Am I the Asshole, which apparently I am.

1263,Asshole,"I hate my name. I was named after a character from a popular fantasy book series. Mom sometimes tells me these books saved her life from depression and I’m named after her favorite character. One of my middle names is also the name of a “strong female lead” from a movie as dad’s input.

At school people make jokes about it. People photoshop my face onto memes (art from the books and videos). The school is useless. They make the bullies apologize and I have to accept it because that’s what a “good Christian” does.

So what I decided to do was every time this happened and I got home I’d tell my parents how much I hate my name and hate that they gave it to me. Sometimes I’ll be a bitch and push hard enough that I can make mom or dad cry. But if I have to live with this, so do they.

1266,Not the A-hole,"I'm a year and a half out of uni. My last year, I had to take an Ethics class to graduate. No big deal, but that professor seemed to not like me from the beginning, though I'm not sure why. She would be passive aggressive towards me, she graded unfairly (in group projects where everyone should get the same grade, she'd give students she didn't like lower grades). One week, I was missing class for a required trip for another class, so I gave her an official university excuse note a week early and my homework the class before. She refused the note because it didn't come from a business Dean (my major was business, my minor was music; it was an excuse from a music Dean), even though she couldn't, and gave me a 0 on the assignment because ""the only reason a student would skip class is because they didn't do their homework"" (per our emails afterwards), despite the fact that I turned it in early, so I clearly did it. I reported the grade related things to my advisor, since students aren't supposed to go to the department head over grade disputes.

Skip to end of the year, and our final is on 4 May, aka Star Wars Day. I finish early, but we're not allowed to leave early. She told us if we finished early, draw or write on the back of the exam. So I take all the ethical viewpoints we'd covered and apply them to Star Wars characters because I was bored, and I studied, so I was going to use that info! I get an email after grades are released from the professor saying she enjoyed my analysis of characters and asked if she could use it in future classes. I emailed back and said she could, as long as she credited me, at least as ""a student in 2018"". I hear nothing back.

Fast forward to a week ago. I get an email from my friend who is in the class this semester, and attached is a scanning of the back of my exam. My friend wrote ""Isn't this your handwriting?"" I respond back, confirming it was mine. I get a screenshot of my friend's class portal, and the text referring to my stuff was, ""The following is my analysis of Star Wars characters, based on the Original and Prequel trilogies. To what extent do you agree or disagree with each assignment?"" My friend also said that the professor referred to it as hers in class.

I emailed the professor, and said I agreed to let her use the material in the future, but with credit. I didn't appreciate her claiming it as her work and asked her to please just say ""a former student"" or anything of the like. She still hasn't responded. As a former student, any complaints would now be directed to her department head. I think it's pretty unethical to be using a student's work and claiming it as her own, all while teaching a class on Ethics. I don't know if this is worth it, since I probably wouldn't even know if I didn't have a friend in the class now.

1267,Not the A-hole,"Some context: this post concerns five 22-25yo gay men. If you're not okay with that for whatever reason, please just refrain from commenting.

Long story short, my boyfriend and I, plus another couple and one single friend planned a late-August-early-September vacation to the Adriatic shore together.

The vacation was actually going fine until the single friend met a local guy through Grindr in Split, Croatia. They started hanging out basically every day and spending most nights together, if you know what I mean.

We had already made a sight-seeing/dining and drinking out plan. However our friend went completely crazy over this dude, to the point that he once cancelled our city tour plans 5 minutes in advance because the Grindr guy asked him to go swimming together.

I was livid. Most of us were at this point. So following multiple failed attempt to get our friend to join us, we just stopped inviting him altogether. We figured, if he wants to join our plans, he'll just text us when he's available or something.

All hell broke loose when we attended a local concert 2 days ago. Our friend had a date with the Grindr guy that evening, but apparently it ended before the concert (which we didn't know about).

The four of us just went ahead and enjoyed ourselves, but the next morning our friend picked a hungover fight because we didn't inform him we'd be attending the concert. Apparently, he suddenly wanted to go with us because his grandpa has Croatian roots and he wanted to witness the traditional music. As if that's something we were supposed to figure out in all of that mess.

My question is basically if we're the assholes because we stopped inviting our friend to mutual events after he basically abandoned us for the most of the vacation for his summer fling? I personally don't feel like an asshole, but I might be biased here. You be the judge.",18,59,0.93

I told them that we didn't want them there because it's our own family thing that we do together and would like them to respect that.

1274,Not the A-hole,"I’m a freshman in college living living in a coed dorm. Last night a girl who doesn’t live in our building “Samantha”, was visiting her friend “Jennifer”. I know Samantha and Jennifer because my roommate “Ben” will sometimes invite them to our room to hangout. 

I was playing 2k20 but I was getting ready to go to sleep after I finished my game. It was like 1:00 am when I heard knocking on my door I ignored it because if it was Ben he’d just open the door he wouldn’t knock and no one besides Ben needs to be in the room at 1:00 am. The knocking stops and I hear my door opening and Samantha and Jennifer walk in. For context I leave my door open because Ben has a habit of not taking his key with him or he’ll leave it at the place he was at. They ask me where Ben is at and tell me that they’ve tried calling him but that he wasn’t picking up and I tell them that he’s at another building hanging out with friends. They tell me that Samantha has to get back to her building because Jennifer’s roommate wants to sleep but that Samantha doesn’t feel comfortable walking back by herself so she wanted Ben to walk her. Since Ben wasn’t there they wanted me to do it. I 

I told them that I was tired and that I had a test at 9:00. They kept pleading with me but I refused.

They called me an asshole because I was already up and that Samantha’s safety was more important than me sleeping.

A lot of these incidents happen to be homeless people asking students for food from the dining hall but there was a girl who reported a stalker.  After about 5 minutes of arguing Samantha says that she’ll walk by herself and tells to go fuck myself. 

I told Ben about the incident in the morning and he and a lot of friends agree that it wasn’t my responsibility and that Samantha should’ve left sooner, but Jennifer and some of the girls on our floor think I was being insensitive and that I don’t understand the fear that women face just waking late at night.

1282,Everyone Sucks,"I'm in my early 30s and my parents are in their 60s. A few years ago they retired and bought a house in an all inclusive 55+ community after some touch and go money issues.

My childhood home was in an upper middle class neighborhood, I was spoiled, but my dad lost his executive job in my teens and my parents kept spending. Things got bad until they received a 1mil inheritance, but they soon spent that too. They planned to retire to a smaller house in the planned community, but they had trouble selling and almost ran out of money. Finally everything worked out and they were supposed to be on a tight budget. They have been lamenting that they can't afford a vacation.

I had issues with mental illness and severe substance abuse my whole life but I've been clean for a couple years now and finally getting my life together. I have a good job but with my doctor's bills and catching up I live paycheck to paycheck. Last year I was happy to surprise them by giving them part of my yearly bonus just as a gesture.

This year, after I heard they couldn't take a vacation, I again gave them most of my yearly bonus to earmark for a trip (about $800.) I could have really used it, but I felt bad and they've spent so much on me over the years. I wasn't completely financially independent until I got clean.

But now my mom calls my brother to say they're excited that they were approved for an equity loan so that she can replace the carpets with wood floors in their house that's less than 3 years old. It cost 3k. 

I called them, told them they can do what they want, but to stop pretending they're poor when they're obviously not. And that it's my opinion they should stop being so financially irresponsible. 3k to remove carpets is frivolous. I didn't say it but I promised myself I wouldn't give them any more money for vacations.

It's caused this huge fight and some people are saying I was unreasonable. AITA?

INFO: They did say they still intend to take the vacation, but it's been months, we're not speaking because of this, and they haven't yet. I told them I was giving them the money for a specific trip that is their favorite. I did that because I thought they might feel obligated to just put it toward their day-to-day expenses or save it or something (lol in retrospect.)

INFO 2 if anyone new is still reading this: I didn't book the trip for them because they're very picky. Like my Mom thinks everything that's not a resort is dirty and my dad has really bizarre requirements for travel and accommodation that I don't understand. It seemed like a better idea to let them book whatever meets their preferences. I mentioned this, pretty much verbatim when I sent them the cash.

I have ULTRA sensitive skin, and if I'm passionately making out with a guy with stubble, the rubbing of the coarse stubble against my mouth and chin *always* gives me painful beard burn. After about five minutes or so it becomes so painful I'd prefer to stop, but of course push through it because I'm a grownup. Then the rest of the night my face is red and painful, and the next day the skin around my lips and on my chin cracks and flakes off very noticeably. It's embarrassing AND painful. 

Beards are great because they're grown out and soft, and clean shaven is great too. It's just stubble that gives me this issue. The guy I'm seeing now is amazing and very passionate, but I always have to sleep with medicated ointment on my face after seeing him; super un-sexy now that we regularly spend the night together. He shaves in the morning, but by nighttime he has painfully course stubble.

Would it be a total asshole move for me to ask him to shave before we're gettin down and dirty? I'd really just love to enjoy it as much as possible, but, conversely, if a man said to me ""you have to shave or wax immediately before hooking up with me, any stubble is unacceptable"", I would find that a little off-putting, because I see it as being ""enough"" to shave morning of (though he wouldn't be repeatedly putting his face on my legs, and my bikini area is always waxed and very smooth). 

Is this an asshole move?

1289,Asshole,"  

My bf Ben is one of those ""never met a stranger"" people. He’s  friendly, outgoing and makes friends easily and often. We live in a big city and he is probably the only person who knows all his neighbors by name and something about them. Ben has a lot of interests and meets new people (men and women) through these and ends up being friends with them and inviting them to other things. I don't really mind but it’s annoying when it’s a female bc there have been instances in the past where they get crushes on Ben and, although I trust him, I would rather not have some chick flirting with my bf (he doesn’t flirt back and usually stops inviting those girls or tries to fix them up with a friend). This past spring Ben met Leah through a running group. She was new to town, in a similar industry as Ben and they have tons in common. Ben invited her to trivia night. Leah is not only beautiful but she's funny, athletic and interesting. While I wasn't cold or mean to her I didn't seek her out in conversation and always held her at arm’s length. Turns out they are training for the same marathon so she also joined his long run group. Leah fit in with our friend group so she is around often. Since she and Ben are in the same industry, she's also at some networking things, too. I was getting tired of her being around all the time and a little insecure bc they have so much in common but they've never done or said anything that makes me suspicious. I've even glanced at their text exchanges (Ben asked me to look up an address she had sent in a text so I wasn't snooping) and there is nothing flirty or inappropriate. He's mentioned before that it doesn't seem like I like Leah and I've always denied it and said we just don't have a lot in common or I was busy talking to someone else. 

Well, a couple weeks ago Leah shows up with Jill and introduces her as her girlfriend. Ben says something like ""oh, its so nice to finally meet you"" indicating he'd known Leah was a lesbian. I won't lie- I felt a huge weight lifted off me and had more fun that night than since Leah joined our group. Ever since then I've talked to her more and found  I really like her. The other day, someone made a joke about how I was an asshole until I found out Leah was a lesbian and not going to steal Ben away. Leah laughed it off but Ben looked a little bothered and asked me later if that was true. I admitted that her being a lesbian made me more comfortable with their friendship. He was upset with me and thought that showed a lack of trust and faith in him. I told him that he knew I wasn't totally comfortable with their friendship and it would've been nice of him to tell me she was a lesbian. He said that he had just found out about two weeks before I did and that it wasn't his place to ""out"" her to me and he thought I didn't like her for something else, not bc I was jealous. 

AITA for only being friends with her after I found out she wasn't ""competition""?",142,314,0.88
1290,Not the A-hole,"The title looks bad, but it’s a complicated situation. 

My step-dad married my mom when I was 6 and my step-brother was 15. My step-brother did not like me or my mom. He was never outright rude or mean to us but he refused to talk to us unless it was absolutely necessary. For example, if he ran into us on the street he would walk right past without acknowledging us. If I called him my brother when he was around, he would correct me and remind me that we weren’t family. 

This continued when he turned 18 and moved out. He forbade my dad from bringing my mom and me to his college graduation. We weren’t invited to any of his special events.  Since he was 18, I have had no contact with him outside of family functions until a couple weeks ago.  He’s 36 now and I’m turning 27 next week. 

Last month, my step-dad died in a car accident. At the funeral, my step-brother told me that he wanted to try to mend our relationship. When he told me that, I said ok but, since I’ve had time to think about it, I’m really not ok with that. He has treated me like I don’t exist for 21 years. I don’t want to have a relationship with someone who would treat me like that. 

Yesterday, he reached out to me and asked to get coffee. I told him that I wasn’t interested in seeing him. He said that family always makes time for each other. It devolved into an argument that culminated in me telling him that he’s not my family. 

Since then, I’ve gotten a few calls from members of my step-dads family encouraging me to patch things up with my step-brother. They say that I don’t understand how hard step-brother took the divorce and that it’s normal for there to be tension between step-siblings. I understand that, but I don’t feel like I’m obligated to have a relationship with him. I will concede that I am being petty. But AITA?

Edit: I forgot this: The family members that have called me gently told me that it was uncalled for to tell my step-brother that he’s not family and that I need to apologize.",704,5816,0.96

1292,Everyone Sucks,"I'm a first time poster on this subreddit and not a native speaker.

So first the backstory. My mother had me while on drugs all her pregnancy. I came out normal tho. She got my father into drugs and beat him sometimes. My mother didn't do shit for me. After my father left I was all alone. I knew he loved me at least a little because he tried his best to give me a better life. He drove me to the hospital after my mother left me lying on the floor wit a broken leg. He said in court he's no good father but neither is she so I should go to my grandparents. Wich I did with my little sister of course( for who I cared for my entire life up to that point) My grandparents are giving me a really good life even if they sometimes compare me to my mother when they're angry and I can't blame them. They were being stolen from and lied to. My mother is not allowed to have contact with me and sis. She is living her best life with my other shit grandparents. My father on the other hand is allowed to have contact but hasn't talked to us in like 6 years. We came to our grandparents 8 years ago. 



So now my grandma received a letter from him. And I just wanna know how he's doing and what's in it. I had dreams about him and cried at night because I miss him. So reddit would I be the A if I read it ? My grandparents say I will get hurt.

Edit: he drove multiple times around my house but never had the courage to ring the bell. He is now in prison since this year. I am honestly not surprised. 
Edit 2 : in the letter he adressed me too.

1293,Asshole,"I hand wash my dishes, it doesn’t bother me, never has (I don’t love it either). I don’t do leaving dishes in the sink until later. The exception is dishes are left in the sink whilst I’m eating food that I want to preserve its prepared temperature. I’ll do this even after breakfast before work.

My partner, isn’t like this. She leaves dishes in the sink to soak and deal with them hours or a day later. She’ll put a used mug or plate in the sink to soak and take out a fresh one for a new coffee or snack. This leads to the sink filling up and stuff getting caked on cookware. Most of the time I end up doing these dishes. Partner uses this as an example why we need a dishwasher because it’s difficult to clean.

I guess I nag about this, but to me I see it as a small effort. Partner disagrees and hates doing dishes, to the point she’s demanding we buy a dishwasher because it would “make life so much easier”. I refuse as it’s not that big of an effort. I’ll concede it could make life easier, but not at that cost.

My stance is I’m not agreeing to spend our joint money on this or my personal money. I just don’t see the value it brings compared to its cost (price, maintenance, etc.). Partner is livid, but I’m standing firm.

1296,Not the A-hole,"This happened almost 2 weeks ago and I still feel guilty. 

I live in the country, around 15 minutes from a small city. My sink drain backed up. I called a plumber and got a quote. I asked THREE times if they had a travel fee because I'm in the sticks. They kept saying no extra fee. Plumber arrives, is pretty rude. Fixes drain. Presents me with bill and it has a 165 dollar travel fee. I asked what was up with that. He said it was standard. I said the person who made the appointment said there was no fee and he said well they're new. I asked him to show me on the website that they had a travel fee and he said prices aren't on the site. I refused to pay the travel fee. He got pissed and I said you can either take money for the work you did without the extra 165, or get no money and leave. He took the money, I got the receipt. The receipt states I paid and he handwrote that I refused to pay the travel fee. 

I left a review stating my experience on yelp. I didn't exaggerate. Stated he was rude but did the job well, but the problem with the fee. The company responded to the review saying I am a ""cheap bastard with no sense of decency"". Then they called me and threatened to sue me for the bill and sue me for giving them a so so review. 

I ignored it after asking LegalAdvice and they haven't pursued.

1297,Not the A-hole,"I’m sorry for the spelling mistakes, English isn’t my native language. This is also my first post so bare with me. 

This situation has really divided our group. Nobody wants to change his opinion so I’m curious to see what you guys think. 

I (22f) recently went to Barcelona for a couple of days with a group of friends. We are all between 22 and 24 yrs old. The group consists of 4 boys and 4 girls. 

During the last day, the boys came to us with the plan of joining this ‘party package deal’. Basically, you pay a set amount and then you have an open bar during a couple of hours. This price also includes the entrance fee for the clubs. 

The boys said they really wanted to do this because it would be a lot cheaper for them than paying for each drink individually. We (The girls) were hesitant because we don’t drink nearly as much as the boys so for us it would at most be a break-even. We thought it was pretty expensive. We eventually agreed to go because we really wanted to stay together for the last night. 

The price was €35 for girls and €38 for boys. This was clearly stated before everybody agreed. The promotor said there is a difference in price because boys in general drink more than girls. 

This is where our disagreement started. When we got home, the boys began saying the price difference was unfair en demanded we pay them 1,5 euros so everybody would pay the same amount. 

We said no, we won’t pay. They all agreed to the price and didn’t even say anything about the price difference before agreeing. They also didn’t ask us, they just said we had to pay because it wasn’t fair to them. I understand that it is maybe unfair, i really do, but we didn’t choose the price, this company did. 

Honestly, it really isn’t about the money. If they had asked before, we probably would have just paid it because it’s such a small amount. But they didn’t ask, they just told us we ‘had to pay the difference’ afterwards. This didn’t sit well with us. But they are still kind of pissed of because we didn’t pay. 

So, are we the assholes for not wanting to pay extra towards the boys’ higher entrance fee?

EDIT: this wasn’t a full blown fight, just a discussion that lasted maybe 30 minutes. Then we all got over it and enjoyed our night! :)",176,682,0.94
1298,Not the A-hole,"My boss is back on Monday and I'm wondering if I did the right thing. He's been on holiday for three weeks. Just before he left he hired a new girl in her mid-twenties to do admin/support work for our team. He put me in charge (officially) while he was on leave. 

About a week into my boss' holiday I had a catch up with the new hire and asked how she was doing. She had been very outgoing and friendly the whole time she was at work, but in a way that makes me think that she's covering up some self-esteem issues or something like that. This meeting really confirmed / highlighted that for me. She tells me that she really likes it here, but her last job has asked for her to come back, but ""fuck 'em"" and starts telling me (unprompted) about her grievances there... Essentially, she worked there for a while as a secondment from another section and when the job she was doing was advertised she put her hand up for the promotion and was successful. She was really happy to get the job, and accepted on the condition that she get a *huge* increase in salary (like +25%). Way above the admin type work the role involved. They said no in the meeting, and she says she went back to her desk and systematically deleted all of the new systems and processes she'd implemented at the secondment, shredded all the hard copies, and completely wiped the system of everything- including all the work in progress she'd been doing. Then she quit and walked out of the office.

She tells me this with an air of... pride, almost. She clearly thinks it's a very funny story where she won by getting one over on people who treated her very badly and didn't recognise her worth. 

I cut the meeting short at that point with a bullshit excuse, go to HR to double check that I'm in the clear, pick up the security guard to come back with me just in case, and then call her into my office and sack her.

From my point of view- we work with extremely sensitive and confidential material and she'd demonstrated a lack of integrity and professionalism. Having her on staff working with these clients' files was a huge risk.

She was extremely upset, and other people on my team think I'm an asshole because she was probably lying for attention / trying to impress me (or something) and I didn't try and investigate her story to see whether it was true or not. They also think I stepped way out of line and should have waited for my boss to make the call when he got back from his holiday two weeks later. 

I think that her lying and making up that story (if it is a lie) demonstrates extremely poor judgement and the risk was too high to leave her working for us for another two weeks. She could have done a lot of damage.

My boss is back on Monday. AITA? 

TLDR: new hire demonstrated extremely poor judgement in her past, or possibly by lying about poor behaviour at her last workplace. I sacked her. My colleagues still think I'm an asshole two weeks later for taking her at her word and for making the call on behalf of my boss.


Edit to answer some common questions:      
- I don't care about self-esteem issues, I only mentioned it as I think it might be why she was so desperate to tell this story about how amazing she is, that even after she did this crazy thing her old work are desperate for her to come back.       
- Where I live it's very easy to get in trouble for giving a bad reference. It wouldn't have come up in pre-employment checks and I don't think I could really have called them and asked whether it was true in any sane or professional way?       
- I'm not mad with power, promise.     

Update:


Thanks to the people who suggested I write up a summary and timeline of events, and put together copies of the paperwork and copies of the statements from the other members of staff who she’d regaled with the same story. I booked an early meeting and felt much more prepared.... but it was ultimately useless because the team member who’s been agitating about the situation caught our boss as he left the lift onto our floor.     

I got a heads up from a friend who rode up in the same lift and joined them in my boss’s office. He heard my colleague out and then asked him to leave so we could discuss it. After hearing what was said I wasn’t at all surprised that my boss thought I was a *massive* asshole - this guy painted me like a power hungry maniac who had gone out of my way for a week and a half to exclude and bully the new hire (no idea where this came from) and then tricked her into inventing the whole story so I could sack her, and then had other members of staff go through all her work so I could find something to pin on her to justify the firing. He painted himself as the only one calling for cool heads in a Lord of the Flies type societal breakdown.       

I explained what had happened - the new hire and I hadn’t had a lot of interaction, so I specifically scheduled the meeting to catch up and check in with her. She had told me this story completely unprompted and without encouragement, and in the few days preceding she’d told the same story to several other people, so it can’t have been a fabrication I’d forced out of her. I’d run the whole thing past HR, and given that it illustrated a tendency towards ‘taking revenge’ and either A) an actual history of sabotaging an employer who she felt had wronged her (without telling the employer she was unhappy) or B) a view that this kind of sabotage was clever and/or admirable and/or funny, they’d agreed to let me terminate her contract. I then asked two members of staff to go through her work and examine her account to make sure she hadn’t done anything wrong and to ensure she hadn’t sent any client data off-site, not to gather evidence to retroactively justify her sacking. I explained that I hadn’t wanted to put her on ‘busywork’ for the two weeks until my boss got back because I thought she’d be a significant risk if she felt at all maltreated, and I didn’t think she’d react well to the lack of trust.     

Thankfully, my boss agreed that it was the best course of action, as unpleasant as it was. He approves of the person I hired in her place and has asked the agitator to let it go, it was the best course of action, he would have done the same thing, etc etc. He asked that next time I cover for him I send him an email with any major events like this the weekend before he comes back to work so he doesn’t get ambushed with it. Totally fair, my mistake.         

An interesting thing that is possibly totally unrelated is that my boss and I had a regular meeting this afternoon to check in with one of our largest clients, and they mentioned receiving an anonymous call to their reception last week suggesting that they look closely at our firm’s work for them as we are apparently cutting corners and making errors that will severely impact their company. They laughed it off as a weird attempt by a competitor to unsettle them, but remarked that the person calling didn’t seem  to understand the industry. Obviously anyone genuinely sharking for business would also have relationships to leverage instead of leaving an anonymous message with reception, so it’s very odd all round. I’m really just glad it wasn’t someone calling reception (or the press, or one of their competitors!) with details that couldn’t have come from anywhere but us. Nightmare fuel.       

Anyway, that’s it, I’m really fucking relieved that my boss is back, and I hope your popcorn cravings are satisfied with this- I know a lot of you were looking forward to me getting sacked. Sorry to disappoint!",672,3816,0.96
1299,Not the A-hole,"Little background. I HATE my birthday, I have always hated it and probably always will so I take special care to make sure that my daughter will not. Growing up something was always more important than my birthday, and while I realise that I sound like a little shit, it's also taken its toll over the years on my relationship with my sisters and mother. My Dad always made sure that I had at least one thing that would make me smile that day but he passed away in 2012, never getting to meet my daughter, who was born in 2014. To add on to that my life long best friend was killed in 2016 and my Grandmother passed this past Christmas. I do not get along with my mother or sisters, but they are the only family I have left and they all live in Ohio. I live in North Carolina and my in-laws all live in Pennsylvania. 

For my daughters first birthday I had a small party for her at home, but was told to plan two parties...the one at home and the one my sister-in-law was throwing in PA. That's an 8 hour drive away. My husband's family has a lot more money than my family and it is painfully obvious. So now I have my  butthurt mother and sisters up my ass because I didn't throw a third birthday party in Ohio, because ""it's not fair"".

1301,Everyone Sucks,"Please read everything before you comment. 

In the summer of 2017, I met my ex. Let's call him Fuckface. I was 23 at the time, he was 24.

So it started out pretty well, Fuckface was nice and sweet. Before sex, I asked him to get tested because I got STD's from exes in the past. He kept making lame excuses about not being able to do it, not having time,... so I dropped it. After about 3 months of dating, he becomes increasingly mentally abusive. He'd call me stupid, tell me to go to a psychiatrist to get checked for autism and dementia (many times), blamed me whenever he got mad because if I wouldn't be so ""stupid"", he wouldn't have to get mad, isolate me from my friends, guilt trip me about anything, gaslight me, etc...

So Fuckface is clearly a dick, I dumped him soon after. We only dated 6 months. As a safety precaution, I always get tested before and after a relationship. Lo and behold, I tested positive for chlamydia and I was positive it's from him since I was negative before dating him and didn't sleep with anyone else at the time. I wanted to let Fuckface know, but he blocked me everywhere. I had an old Facebook account and went on there to message him.

Now it's been 1.5 years since we broke up and I got on my old account to check on something else in my messages when I noticed my message to him. Still unread and I have no desire to find other ways to let him know because one, he refused to get tested. And two, he blocked all ways of contact and I already went out of my way to let a piece of shit like him know about it. I realise he could infect other girls, but is that really my problem or responsibility? 

Am I the asshole if I stop trying to let him know and secretly pray he becomes infertile so he can't reproduce his horrific genes?

Edit: I'm from Belgium and we got no service to report sti's. Unless it's HIV, the doc said you can't do anything about it.

Edit: Yes, in the future I'll force every guy to get tested or they get no sex.

Final edit: Someone on the comments linked an anonymous std notifying website. I deleted my ex's number but still have his email address. Notified him via there. That way I don't have to directly contact him because I do care about the innocent girls he might infect. I know this ain't an advice sub, but now my conscience is completely clear.

He came out to the family as bisexual about half a year ago. While that was a bit of a shock, we didn't reprimand him. Wife and I are trying to as supportive as we can, while learning along the way.

He made friends with a 14yo boy at the center. I was glad about him finding company, especially since he seemed really excited about this new friendship, as he didn't feel so alone at the hang-outs anymore.

I wasn't so happy when he told his mother and me that he accepted to be this boy's boyfriend. First off, I don't think our son should even be dating at the age of 12.

Then the other woman starts sort of interrupting our talk to drop hints that she’s pregnant. Like, we were talking about my hip issues and she said ‘I better prepare my hips for the extra weight!’. We discussed a construction site nearby and she said ‘I’m thinking of moving apartments, now that it won’t be just me and my husband anymore’. It went on and on for the whole session. 

She didn’t have a belly yet but she was clearly super excited about being pregnant and it felt like she was trying to get me to ask her about it so we could all talk about her pregnancy.

Well, I got fired and he had known. I don't begrudge him for lying to me because obviously we didn't have that relationship.
I struggled but found a better job as an office manager for a large accounting firm. The furniture company went out of business a year later. My office is moving to a bigger building and needed to furnish. Procurement and I were in charge of that. We met with several potential vendors and one of sales reps was Andy. He was working with a new company. He were shocked to see each other. 
Andy trying to leverage that we had a relationship to get the contract (worth mid six-figures; most are five-figures). I do not forget that he lied about not knowing about my pending termination so obviously our relationship was not that strong. It feels wrong to award someone a lucrative contract who did you dirty. I don't care what legit reasons he had. He made a choice and now he wants it both ways.
TBH, had he stuck his neck out for me at my old job, then I would give him the contract because loyalty is a good thing to have in business. But he didn't so I don't feel like I should stick my neck out for him and his commission check. 
Whether I go to him or someone else makes no difference to me or my company. These office furniture companies are all the same.",104,479,0.94
1311,Not the A-hole,"Tldr is basically title

I’d like to start by saying this was a number of years ago, but it still bothers me. 

I used to go on Skype fairly often, and one night I got a message from a woman telling me she found my name in a random Skype search. We had a normal conversation for a while before she started gearing the conversation towards her being a cam girl. Once it reached this point I’d thought she was a bot, but our previous conversations were not bot-like at all. 

She told me a story that her supposed “friend” got her into the business and she’d like me, a random kid on the internet, to watch her. I didn’t want to but she sent me a link to her “cam girl” site, but of course as you know this was really just an obvious virus link. 

I didn’t open it, but I gave her a request to “get off” on this certain “video” I like, and so I sent her a website link that’s a screamer. I got blocked immediately after, so I assume it was opened. 

At first I thought it was funny, so I told a certain friend of mine about it, who did not find it funny at all. She went off and told me I was a sh*tty person, even if the woman WAS a bot that my actions were still unacceptable. Ever since I’ve really wanted to know, am I the asshole?",51,93,0.91
1312,Asshole,"My brother was telling me about his chronically unemployed wife's new job as a medical assistant. He described all these things she did on her first day, like taking vitals from patients, using an ultrasound machine, hooking up and IV, seeing a patient's genitals and some other stuff that seemed way beyond her skill level and training something a person should not be doing on her first day and it set off alarm bells for me.

I've been in a lot of medical facilities lately since I'm pregnant and about to pop and I like to chat up the people I interact with. I know a lot of the things my brother described involve certifications or multi year programs that my SIL has not done. So I expressed shock that the hospital would put an untrained person in such a patient forward position on her first day. I said I was uncomfortable with the idea of going to the hospital now if it was possible a person doing all this stuff for me was untrained like her. I also told him that going from never working more than part time to doing 12 hour shifts is very hard and instense. My husband said my tone of voice was super mean when I said this. 

I realized later that she and my brother were probably just overblowing her having a tour of the facilities. So by being shocked at this story not jibing with my experience with medical industry my husband said it came across like I was implying she was incompetent and a liar. My SIL wasn't present it was just my brother, parents and husband around when we had this exchange. Thinking back I could have been more tactful in how I said these things and I felt the need to set it straight.",69,117,0.92

1317,Everyone Sucks,"So my SO recently went abroad to study until May next year. It‘s just a 2.5 hour drive and we‘re probably going to see each other every other weekend at least. We write each other during the day, but since we both have a lot going on during the day, it‘s not that much.

Obviously, it‘s an exciting time for her and she experiences a lot she wants to tell me. I‘m fine with that, I like to hear how she‘s doing and want to be sure she‘s ok. 

For me, telling someone what happended during the day, how I feel about that and stuff like that takes something about 10 minutes. My SO can hold a monolog for 30 minutes and still not be finished. And if I say monolog I mean it. I sometimes try to make it a real conversation, but either I‘m cut off or too tired to process all the information fast enough.

Usually this wouldn‘t be a problem at all. I want to talk to her, I‘m interested in her stories, I want her to feel she can tell me anything. But currently I‘m under heavy workload with 12+ hours work every day. Sometimes I just want to fall into my bed and sleep. Sometimes I don‘t want to phone for an hour when the essential stuff can be said in 20 minutes. Tomorrow‘s another day, maybe I‘m more in the mood then.

Also, during her monologs she often digresses. Like stuff that is totally unimportant and that has no relevance whatsoever, which she herself has recognized a few times. But if I complain about that, it‘s a no-go. 

A few days ago, I just couldn‘t bear it anymore. I was tired as hell and my SO was talking to no end about some unimportant stuff, while she hasn‘t touched the important info she wrote me before. So I asked her whether she could ‚speed up a bit‘ so we could talk about the major news. She snapped at me, said she felt unappreciated and how mean I was. I figure she‘s still somewhat pissed as our phone calls have been noticeable shorter the last days.

This isn‘t the first time we had a fight about our phoning habits. But since we‘ve lived together for the last year, it didn‘t come up until recently when she went abroad.

AITA for telling her that I‘d like to change our phoning habits when I‘m not in the mood for hourlong phone calls or should I try to be more appreciating and understanding?",53,222,0.95

1320,Not the A-hole,"As you may or may not know, Instagram sends a  notification every time someone “unsends” a message to someone else. My friend, who has anxiety, has a habit of sending long fragmented messages and if she doesn’t receive a response within a few minutes, she unsends every single message because of her anxiety. This means that I (and the other people she texts) also receive individual notifications for every message that has been unsent. I had a feeling that she wasn’t aware of this as I couldn’t fathom the idea that she would want to bring more attention to herself if she’s scared that she’s been ignored, so I asked her if she was aware that this happened, and now her anxiety has heightened and she’s blaming me for not letting her be ignorant since she’s now realised the hundreds of notifications people must get from her unsending messages.

I was on a night out queuing for the ATM. A homeless guy asked me for money. I said “sorry, I don’t have any....that’s why I’m at the cash machine”.

The last comment is typical of my misjudging what other people might think is funny. He went off on a diatribe about my comfy perfect life and mocking him  for living on the street. I tried to explain but then just let him run with it. He then got another guy in the queue involved, directly asking him to confirm I was an asshole. The guy said ‘too right mate’. This is where I may be overstepped the asshole threshold. I lost my temper with that guy. “Who the fuck was he judging me, comfy life! I’d be lucky if the ATM even gave me any money, I give to charity all the time! (true), you give him some fucking money Mr. Humanitarian etc...” 

On reflection I think he was just placating an irate and desperate man. He argued a little but was obviously taken aback at me losing my shit (being berated in front of at least 50 people didn’t help). I still feel bad to this day and wonder...Am I the asshole?",298,1452,0.95
1322,Everyone Sucks,"Some context of why I don't like this guy besides the obvious.

We are in a private University, my classmates mostly come from upper middle class families for them to be able to afford this school.  My classmates are around 22 years old while I am older than them since I had to pay for school my self cause I am from a lower class family.

There is the geeks and quiet ones who tend to be the most hard working ones, and theres the upbeat undiciplined ones but are more social so they will most likely turn okay in life after school anyways.

I had never ever talked to this classmate, but had already judged him based on what I saw from him.  He is lazy, doesnt go to most classes, he wants to be social but people find him annoying.   He is not good with girls.  I guess his goal in life is to not work and be popular.  A teacher once told him he will give him permission to get out of class and not get an absence if he wanted to just leave, and he did get out.  I am guessing he will just live off his parents when (if) he graduates.

I just resented him since due to my economic status it took me years to finally start Collegue and this dude with all the resources is being a waste of space, but anyways I never thought much about it till today.

We had an assigment for last week we had to turn in today, which was making a 3D  helmet, which I took my time making it so it will be good,  some classmates did it quick and meh, some did took their time and looked great.

So that classmate was sitting close to me,and was bragging that he got an A for that assigment and that he basically looked for a 3D model of the helmet from the internet and just uploaded it as his work.

It just pissed me off how he has no shame and how a might get an A too for far much more work that what he does.

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole if I let my teacher know he just downloaded the model?

He will most like get a DA(diciplinary action).  If you get 2 of those you are out.

1324,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:

For a calculus course in our college, teacher assistants (TA) help the professor cover lectures. There are 4 lectures each week, but 2 of those lectures only have a TA present. Hope (21F) and I (Emily, 20F) are TAs. Hope runs one and I run the other, and both lectures are without the professor.

Both TA lectures cover how to use a program, MATlab. Both lectures are identical, students can pick which lecture to attend based on their schedule. The root of this AITA post is that even if a student already knows how to use the program, they still have to go to one TA lecture. The lecture counts for 30% of the total grade in the course.

My side (Emily):

Plenty of students in both lectures know how to use the program and lectures are a huge waste of time for them. They’ve started skipping, or coming 1 hour late.

I don’t mind. The students who skip/are late are still handing in assignments. I’m not taking any points off for those students since they’re still doing their work and I understand that the class is wasting their time. They’re paying to attend college, so if they want to skip class, that’s on them. It’s their money and their time, while I’m being paid to teach them. I only grade students based on their ability and on how much they’re improving.

Hope is taking points off for coming in late/skipping. She’s vindictive about it. If a student skips but emails assignments, Hope gives them a 0 for it. During quizzes, if a student takes 30 extra seconds to finish writing something after time is up, they get a 0.

I think she’s being too harsh. The students know the program, but she’s punishing students for reasons that aren’t based on academic merit. I’ve tried telling her this, we keep getting into fights. I think she’s failing students for the wrong reason. I’d understand if she took 10 point off max, but a 0 is too harsh.

Hope’s side:

I know it’s frustrating taking the lecture when you know how to use the program. I’d like to say that this is my 3rd year as a TA and it’s Emily’s 1st.

Part of college isn’t just about academia, it’s also about learning how to be a responsible adult. How to manage your time and be organized. Skipping/being late to obligations will not get you far in life. Being late is disrespectful.

I gave warnings without penalizing anyone when they missed class or were late. I told them that I would give them 0s if they kept it up. The students didn’t listen, so I started taking points off.

Emily is calling me vindictive since she believes that I’m giving 0s to assert my authority over students/scare them into listening, but that’s false. I warned them, they didn’t listen, so I followed through on my words. Actions have consequences.

Calling me vindictive is totally out of line. She has less teaching experience than me, and the way I run my lectures hasn’t been a problem before. She’s the only TA I’ve seen pick a fight out of it.

We’ll accept judgement.

1325,Not the A-hole,"So in 2016 my Dad died after a long very difficult multi-year journey through mental illness and self neglect. For the last few months of his life he was very angry, very lonely, and alternated between those emotions and others just as strong. He had put me(30F) and my sister (39F) through hell trying to get him care and help but no matter what I wanted to be there for him even when he didn't want to see me. 

I took him Thanksgiving dinner and had to have his nurse take it to him because he didnt want to see me. On Christmas my mom(his ex wife) took him Christmas dinner because he wouldn't let me see him. He only asked for one person. My sister. He wouldnt even spend time with his brothers but he ASKED for her. 

My sisters response to this was that it wasn't her problem anymore (he was in a nursing home) that she wasnt going to see him and I could go... well you get the gist.  My Dad cried for her but wouldn't see me, doctors called it misplaced aggression. I was his primary caretaker for a long time. Anyway, I begged her to see him knowing it was the end. She refused. She didn't end up seeing him until he was in a coma in hospice and no longer able to communicate. After he died she left me to take care of his effects, cleaning out his room in the nursing home with my husband alone. 

The DAY of the funeral after getting home she called me and demanded we start diving up his things in my home(he lived with me before going into the nursing home). This is AFTER my dad had already sent a truck load of his things to her house that she asked for before he died paid for by me. 

I havent spoken to her since that day. I resent her so much for her callousness towards our father as he was dying. I resent her for her greed and cruelty towards me and our father (there is a whole lot more involving that cruelty that goes back years) and frankly I have been perfectly happy not speaking to or even seeing her.  

However, my mother says I'm the A-hole for not speaking to her or wanting her in my life in any capacity. She says I should let bygones be bygones so she can have one big (dysfunctional) happy family. 

My view is that if someone can be so cold as to ignore their dying father thats literally crying for them I don't need that person in my life. This doesn't include the years of psychological abuse I suffered at her hands as a child nor her abuse of my other family members that goes back years as well.

1327,Not the A-hole,"Graphic Design student in MI. My bf lives in Philly. Sept 19 I'm flying out for his bday. I need to tell my professors. Thursdays, I have class at 8:30a, and class at 6:30p. I have a problem with my evening professor. It's known in our program you have to walk on egg shells with her.

Tonight was a bad night. She walks in annoyed. She says ""I'm planning on everyone leaving early because it's just one of those days."" She also says we will be having visitors talk about branding. We start to work, and she talks to other students so I didnt have an opening to tell her yet. 15 min in, the people show up. They are former students. Short conversation and the kids say goodbye, but my teacher is annoyed that they didnt say much.

Our teacher says that the deadline for the project was Tues at 6:30p, but she will give us 2 options. Due Tues at 8p, or move it to Thurs. She left the room saying it was up to us. I told everyone that I was flying out on Thurs to Philly and they agreed ""Okay! Let's do Tues"" except one boy. Boy ordered material online and has no idea when it's going to arrive. We asked him why would he order something without knowing if it would even arrive on time. Everyone still agreed on Tuesday.
Teacher returned and we say Tues. The boy chimes in with ""except me"". She asks what's the issue. He just kept shrugging, which made my teacher mad. She says ""does thursday work?"" I quickly spoke up "" I wont be here thursday."" 

She yelled ""What do you mean you wont be here?"" Tells me to leave the room with her. She's yelling at me about why am I leaving. I explain why, but anxiety kicks in. I tried to remain calm. She asks if I'll be ready Tuesday and I say ""Yes"". She walks into the room. I walk in and sit down, shaking. Everyone is quiet. I have to go to bathroom and leave in a panic. 

Teacher comes in and says ""you okay?"" I tell her to leave me alone. She leaves, and my friend comes into the bathroom. She talks about how ridiculous the incident was. My teacher enters the bathroom again. She says sorry and she's justifying herself. I say ""it's fine"". My teacher says ""I'm trying to plan out this class. Im having a bad day. Any other days you're going to be gone this semester?"" I will be absent the Tues before Thanksgiving. She snaps at me that I am ridiculous. My friend and I are like wtf. 

My friend grabs my bags and we leave. Other students are stopping us saying how uncalled for teacher's behavior was. 

I've felt like my teacher was hostile but I did my work to get through the semester. Now, I feel embarrassed by her and emotionally unsafe in her class. WIBTA if I filed a report about this? I doubt she'll get fired or anything major but I feel wronged and humiliated so I want to say something. Am I overreacting?

 Sorry for the confusing title, there’s no easy way to explain this. (I know this reads bad, just letting you know I never planned on either donating or sleeping with her)

Ok. So my girlfriend (24F) and I (23M) were asked out to lunch by our good friend (24F). 
She said she had something important to ask us so we heard her out. 

At lunch she asked me if I would become the father of her child. I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a few years now and this took us both off guard. Basically, she said she wants my genes for her kid. I knew she had a crush on me for a while now, but I didn’t have any clue about this. 
To make the situation worse, she doesn’t like the idea of sperm donation and just wants to have a one night stand with me in order to get pregnant.

My girlfriend was understandably livid. I had absolutely NO intention on having a one night stand with her, but I wasn’t so quick to oppose sperm donation verbally. I WAS NOT GOING TO AGREE. but just didn’t say anything . I didn’t think it was that insulting to my gf at first and was more confused than anything. 
Both my girlfriend and I weren’t planning to have any kids or anything like that and our friend promised us I could sign a contract so I could never be held responsible for child support. 

Point is, my girlfriend is mad at me because I didn’t outwardly and verbally  reject the idea of having another woman’s baby. I DO NOT want to and DO NOT plan to. I’m just baffled by the whole thing, but apparently I’m an asshole for not being so quick to reject this. (again, to clear up confusion I NEVER considered being a donor, just didn’t say anything)

Am I? Should I be so quick to say “of course not!”
AITA for not saying no abruptly? I said I wasn’t going to sleep with our friend... but my girlfriend still hates this whole idea. I haven’t decided what I’m doing yet. I’m just confused. 

Sorry if this makes no sense, I’m still a little out of it.

Edit: just making it clear, I told my friend I am definitely NOT going to sleep with her. I am NOT going to donate. Trying to be as clear as possible. 
I just didn’t quickly shut down the whole sperm donation idea quickly. I DO NOT want to do it, but I think I sounded like I was entertaining the idea. Which I’m NOT. I just was at a loss for words at the moment. I think my silence sounded like I was considering it. 

Though after reading this thread I think I should’ve shut it down faster and clearer... 
My girlfriend definitely gets some roses tomorrow for putting up with my dumbass.

Edit 2: Yeah, big old red flag here. I told her that I’m not going to become her sperm donor. I also asked if she’s going to continue with the idea of trying to get pregnant and she flat out said no. Big red flag. 
I got a phone call from her a few minutes ago where she said she loved me and whatnot, so I blocked her number. My girlfriend is pissed at her, understandably. So this is all just unfolding right now… At midnight.

Edit 3: OK, hopefully this is the last edit because for the most part I feel like it’s calming down… Or at least stabilizing. My girlfriend and I both apologized to each other. I explained I was caught off guard and that’s why my reaction wasn’t immediate. She apologized because she thinks she was taking out her frustrations on me when in reality she was frustrated with our “friend.”
Speaking of, the ex friend left some voicemails on my girlfriend’s phone (I blocked her so I didn’t get any) 
The ranged all over the place from crying and begging for forgiveness to racial slurs directed at my girlfriend.... so. That friendship is severed. 

In the comments I mentioned I had a stalker in the past, so I’m not playing any games. I called my godfather who helped me with my first stalker, he’s calling my work and friends/family, just in case they see her coming around. We might stay with him tonight. Just in case, I’m a little paranoid since I lived this before. 

I’d like to thank you guys here on Reddit. This is my first time really opening up about something that I was genuinely confused about and I’ve heard a lot of feedback that open my eyes. I definitely need to work on phrasing of things and be a little bit more quick in my response time, especially when dealing with crazy. Sorry for all the edits in my original post, this blew up so fast and I wanted to make my situation abundantly clear.

1335,No A-holes here,"On Wednesday morning I put my dog down voluntarily. Just four months ago another family dog had to be put down after struggling for months to try and treat his terminal cancer, which put me and my lower class family out $3,500 ish that we didn’t really have. He was not my personal dog, though we all loved him. After watching his long, overly drawn out struggle I decided and agreed with my family that if either of my two girls got anything terminal and detrimental I would not pursue treatment. Anything minor we would treat it, but anything SERIOUS would be euthanasia. In all reality, I didn’t realize I’d have to make that call so soon.

Roughly two weeks ago, she dropped weight rapidly. A huge amount all the sudden. At first I thought it was because she was extremely old, but then I realized she was moving around less and having some trouble staying balanced. Everyone was a little worried so we decided to gather a few funds and then take her in for a check up.

On Tuesday night everything deteriorated. She suddenly was falling over and, once I actually saw it happen myself, I recognized it as a seizure. She began chugging water but then began to throw it up soon after.

The vet ran tests and it came back that not only had she developed diabetes, but she had gone into serious ketoacidosis. He said that a normal glucose level was 100, hers was 545. He explained that she had probably been diabetic for awhile and we just didn’t notice. The weight loss was her body breaking down fat to produce insulin, and the sudden severe illness was because her body was now attacking her organs for the same purpose.

I can’t even remember how I did the math, but the total just for the initial phase was somewhere in the ballpark of $2,000, then the monitoring would be up to $160, and then the annual cost. When I asked him how long she could have left, he asked me once more how old she was. She was anywhere from 13-17, not exactly sure. When I said that his response was “then she should have been dead five years ago”. There was a chance she could survive, but no promises. 

After about an hour and a half at the vet, I made the final call to euthanize her without trying to stabilize.

I’m struggling here. This is not the first pet I’ve taken to be euthanized, but it’s the first one where I was the sole decision maker. This would also not have been my first choice for pet I had to decide on. Her and my other dog have been a bonded pair for 5+ years now, and my still living girl is struggling. She looks for her and has already started moving around less. She is 13 years old herself with a lot of health issues and I worry this is a death sentence for her too. This dog was also my best friends dog before she died a few years ago. I promised I would take care of her, and I feel like by euthanizing without first trying to fix the issue that I failed that promise.",42,39,0.84

1338,Not the A-hole,"Soo... My husband and I are both in college. He started a year before me. He ended up failing three of his classes, important ones at that. 

Anyway, fast forward a year and now both of us are enrolled together. He NEVER studies. It's been 3 weeks since school started and we already have tons of material to cover in our 3 classes. The classes aren't simple either, they aren't our basics. They are our CAREER classes. 

Last year when he first started college, he failed for the simple reason of not studying. He promised he would do better this year, and that he would prioritize school over games. He literally spends all his free time on his PS4. 

So here's me, concerned wife. Also! Almost forgot, we are both using financial aid. Since he's failed once, he only has one more chance to keep receiving financial assistance. Apparently if you fail twice, you aren't eligible to keep receiving aid. So, obviously y'all can see why I'm concerned. 

I didn't bother him at all the first week of college. It wasn't until the 2nd week after a decent amount of material we had handed to us, that I asked him "" when are you going to study babe?"" And he said "" I don't know, whenever I feel like it ."" I responded, ""well alright"" and left it there. Anywho, the professors keep packing on more work and the next day comes around and still he has not studied. At all. He won't look at his textbooks, nothing. I ask again, ""babe, when are you gonna study?"" He gets mad. Husband says ""I hate when you ask that, makes me not want to."" I am shocked because first of all, I am not even pestering him with the question multiple times a day. 

Next week comes around and he still hasn't studied, he spends his free time out of school playing his games. I ask again and the same conversation plays out, he gets mad and I'm left feeling bad for making him mad... Idk. The way he reacts makes me feel like I'm the bad guy here.

1340,Asshole,"My girlfriend, Alison, and I have been together for 3 years.  We've had some problems, we broke up about 4 months ago and have been back together for about a month.  There are some trust issues but I like to think we've done a lot to work through things.

&#x200B;

Several months ago (before we broke up) I went on a trip with my friend Jake who is part of a 70 person friend group that plans group trips frequently.  Alison and I were invited but she was unable to go due to work (she has sundays but not saturdays off).  About 25 people were on this particular trip to some cabins in the forest.  Jake had a couple of female friends that wanted to try shrooms, so I sold them some and kinda acted as a guide for them on their mushroom journey.  I had a great time on the trip and Alison was bummed she couldn't go but was happy to hear I had a great time.

&#x200B;

Well this weekend Jake invited me on a camping trip with him and the same three chicks from the last trip.  Well Alison is not cool with it now.  She of course is unable to go again and says she feels uncomfortable about me being in an environment of 2 guys and 3 girls, especially since she has not met the girls (she knows Jake).   I've told her I have no interest in them and it's not like we'll be sharing a tent.

&#x200B;

I think that's kind of controlling and apparently I'm not ""allowed"" to make female friends? I know it would bother her but that's her own insecurity.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I went even though I know it would bother her?

&#x200B;

EDIT\*\* The trust issues admittedly were because at one point I was not honest with her about talking to my ex and at another point I accidently emotionally cheated on her with a new friend who I just thought I was having a good platonic connection with someone because we weren't having sex.  

&#x200B;

EDIT2\*\*\* At one point I met a woman and we started hanging out quite regularly. Every couple of days. She had recently gotten out of a bad relationship and we connected over that as my relationship with my ex was very painful. She started texting me pretty much every day and my gf did not like it. She claims that's emotional cheating because I was talking to this woman about things I didn't feel comfortable talking to my gf about, apparently I'm not allowed to talk to a friend every day, and this woman did not like my gf after they met once and so we decided it would be best if we hung out without my gf tagging along. In no way was I trying to get with her, I still struggle to see how that's cheating",151,504,0.73
1341,Not the A-hole,"So, my family went to Disney without me. My dad let me know in a voicemail, as he was returning a call I had about breaking up with my ex. I didn't call back, because my initial reaction was to be hurt. Namely, because I didn't feel included, and honestly, I'd love to go to Disney. They've gone now four to without me. It's not usually their fault, they go during times when I'm teaching.

I guess I was feeling super passive aggressive, because I saw a post on my dad's Facebook wall of them at Disney. I decided to post, ""looks fun. Wish I could have come, too.""

Apparently, it caused a huge fight within my family, and now the trip is ruined for them. I'll admit, I wanted it to be known I wanted to be part of the trip.  But I didn't intend to cause the hurt I did.

I kinda feel like an asshole, so I'll just submit myself to y'all's judgement now.

1342,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I rent a house with his brother and wife. We live in a very expensive city and this is quite a big house with great metro access, so that's what's convenient. We get along fine usually.


My husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


Recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.


Today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. I'm kind of shocked that I'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. I feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

AITA?

ETA: For all those asking if I resent my in laws for not helping... I think any parent would like help. But I don't feel entitled to their help when it's my husband's and my decision to have said child. However I am feeling really resentful right now that they feel entitled to my help and the fact that they never helped me definitely makes it worse.",1915,15552,0.92

1344,Asshole,"Standard throwaway because I know people who know people.

I go to a university in the States and am taking a class that has only one section and only one professor teaches it. It is an upper division class that people on a healthcare track tend to take. I would classify it as difficult but doable.

A group was talking before class about how we were studying and one of the students, Fred, says ""I email professors at other universities for help."" Everyone started asking them a bunch of questions so I'm going to summarize their responses. 

They email professors at other universities that teach the same or similar subjects when they are having trouble understanding a class. They don't like to go to office hours because if they don't understand how the professor explained it in class, they are likely not going to understand if they explain it in office hours. Fred also said they often can't make office hours. They have done this multiple times for multiple different upper division courses. They said ""The worst they can say is no."" They made contact the first week of this semester with a professor who teaches a similar course at a different university and they have had two video calls and the professor has helped with the material. They said they did not pay the professor and did not offer to pay him. 

Everyone else was impressed with this student's tenacity and said it was a good idea. I said ""Honestly, it sounds a bit entitled to me."" I got a lot of funny looks and Fred says, ""I'm just asking for help, they don't have to give it."" I said, ""Yeah, but you aren't one of their students. You don't pay tuition at their university. Professors are always incredibly busy, and to reach out to a professor you have no relationship with, and whose university you don't support, seems entitled to me."" Fred said ""They can always say no."" I said, ""Imagine if everyone did this. Then professors would not only have to deal with the emails they get from their own students, but now they have to deal with students from anywhere? At least if your going to do this, offer to pay them like a tutor."" Fred countered that, ""They are paid to teach this, why can't that include me."" I said, ""Because you don't attend their university."" 

The class opened after that and we went inside and class went normally. Another student who I have had previous classes with came up to me after and said ""You were kind of harsh, I think it was a good idea."" I said, ""I wasn't trying to be rude, but it is crazy to me that you would think a professor at another university is obligated to help you. I don't think anyone is that special."" 

I don't think it matters either way, but the professor for this class is exceedingly helpful. She will bend over backwards to help a student. Even though she is the only one who teaches this class, it's not like Fred has no other resources. 

So AITA? Is this something that is okay and I just overreacted? If so, I will apologise to Fred on Tuesday.",45,46,0.78
1345,Asshole,"I'm not sure how much of this background info is relevant, but just in case: My (now ex-)boyfriend and I are both broke graduate students in our late twenties and were together for 3 years. In that time, my parents paid for him to come along on two big vacations with my family. I have never gone on a vacation with his parents. My parents are lower-middle class and his are upper-middle class. We were each close with each other's families and his mom even spent Thanksgiving with my family one year. His mom has never been anything but sweet and welcoming to me. 

About four months ago his mom announced a family reunion vacation this September. She invited me to join and paid for our flights. We were both really looking forward to it, and I was grateful for her generosity.

However, unfortunately, we broke up last month. While I was the one who initiated it, it was (and still is) very hard for me. Nothing terrible happened and there were no betrayals or anything, but we had been having many communication breakdowns and incompatibilities and I reached a tipping point where it seemed like the right thing to do. It's been rough and we're both heartbroken. We're no contact right now, but not on bad terms or anything.

When we broke up, I messaged his mom to say thanks for everything, I'll miss her, and I'm sorry it turned out this way. I also (and this is where I messed up) offered to reimburse her for the flight she had bought for me since I wouldn't be coming now. I was trying to be polite and end things as maturely as possible. I sort of assumed she would decline my offer. 

She thanked me, said that she was ""sad for us both"" and then gave me her Apple Pay info so I could pay her. I was surprised at this, but it was my offer so I figured I'm on the hook now. She then sent me the receipt and said the portion I owe her is $750. This was more than I expected. My only income is my student stipend, so $750 is a lot for me. I told her I didn't have that much up front and asked if I could pay her in monthly increments of $200. She said that was fine.

I've since told my friends this and they think it's absurd that I should pay her at all since the flight was a gift. I wasn't expected to pay her if I went on the trip, so why should I if I don't go? I see their point, but think that since I offered I should just suck it up and pay now. So, WIBTA if I now backed out of my offer?",22,56,0.91

1350,Asshole,"I work full time, and have a pregnant partner, the baby is due very soon. My partner has recently stopped working completely, with my unconditional approval and support. She has recently made some comments that makes me think that she's unhappy with our financial situation, but doesn't want to have an argument about it. She's a very non-confrontational person. 

I have decided to split my income into 2 accounts. I have one for my own personal use, which is used for my own entertainment and frivolous things such as beer, video games, saving up for larger items that I want for me. I give myself the equivalent of $65US per week, which is between 5% and 10% of my weekly income, depending on my hours.

Every other cent I earn goes into the second account, which we both have access to. I've made it clear that this account is for anything whatsoever she sees fit. Bills, savings, baby needs, or anything that she wants for herself. It's entirely up to her discretion. 

The comments that she's made, while not outright calling me an asshole about it, are very passive aggressive and show an obvious resentment about the situation. I think I'm being perfectly reasonable about it. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses, they've been enlightening. I obviously have a blind spot in my thinking, and was not putting full consideration into how my partner feels. There are 2 main things that I take away. 1, if I get to block off ""play money"" for myself, then it's only fair to do the exact same for her. 2, putting sole responsibility on her for the finances is unreasonable. I've essentially said, ""ok this is for me, you sort the rest out yourself"". I need to take a more active role in budgeting and not rely on her to do all of it. 

Also, to those that are saying, ""You have a baby on the way, you need to make that your only priority. Having beer money is selfish"". I say that i think that making 100% of your life completely about the baby is a recipe for mental health problems. I feel it's important to TRY to continue doing things you enjoy, as a sole person and as a couple. Even if it's in a significantly diminished capacity.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bdrxjd/aita_for_wanting_to_share_the_hotel_room_i_booked/

Hello, its been a few months since my last post but I thought that I'd give you an update. So, naturally, I talked to my SO the day after I posted this on the subreddit. She recently joined this subreddit so she'll probably recognise this post (if you see this, I love you very much <3). 

I expressed my concerns for the break up and how it would affect our vacation together, specifically the room arrangements and told her of my conversation with my friend. She basically said what you guys did: We have no obligation to rearrange our trip for their comfort if they're going to break up, so I shouldnt feel obligated to give up our room together for that. They, especially my friend, has the responsibility to work out something. We agreed that it's a weird situation overall, but with her support I felt even more confident.

Well, my friend and his gf broke up as expected a few weeks after I made the post. I casually confronted my friend some time afterwards. Like, ""oh by the way when we talked about you wanting to change the room arrangements. We're not really up for that, so if you can find another option then that'd be swell."" More or less. He took it well and said he understood of course, but his gf ultimately wouldn't be joining us even though all of us said she was welcome to do so and that she could find another room or hotel but it was her choice. We all agreed that it was his responsibility to find another person to join us if he didn't want to pay that much. He took responsibility for it which I really appreciated, but in the end he had to pay the full price. She still had to pay for the plane ticket and the activities we were supposed to go on, but she said it was easy to earn back and didn't hold a grudge. We're still very good friends to this day.

Overall, we had a good time on our trip. Although our friend was  single and wanted to explore the night life more, me and my partner enjoyed our time together in our hotel room and the public areas, we had a blast! We also connected a bit more with my friend over drinks and fun days. So everything turned out alright in the end. Thank you for all the responses that made me realize that I need to work on my confrontation skills and express my boundaries for my own, and my partner's, interests. I'm hoping that this post will encourage others in my shoes to do the same and hopefully come to a solution as friends and adults. Be respectful, understanding, and don't forget that we all have issues that we struggle with. Best is to encourage growth to strengthen ourselves and our relationships.",173,12677,0.96

Long story short, my little brother Sam is a recovering addict. He’s been sober 3 years and has been doing incredibly well for himself. 

Five years ago however was a different story.

He started out in college, played on an athletic scholarship, had a girlfriend, was considered extremely handsome by a lot of people, but things went to the wayside after an accident and he became addicted. 

He lived on the streets for a while but after ODing twice, he got his shit together. 

He’s now doing so well for himself and I’m so proud of him. 

The other day, I was browsing the internet and I came across a video. I started watching it and my heart sank as I recognized Sam. It was a video of him nodding out on a park bench close to where children were playing. It had a couple hundred thousand views. 

All of the comments on the video were things like, “Such a shame for a young guy like that” and “This is what drugs do. He shouldn’t have done it so close to kids.”

It beyond upset me to see that video and I didn’t sleep that night. I spent most of the night thinking about whether I should tell Sam about the video or not. As far as I know I’m the only one close to him that has seen it and I know he would’ve told me if he had because he tells me everything.

I eventually decided that it was best if I didn’t tell him because I’m afraid that it would set back all the hard work he’s put in and I don’t want to embarrass him. At the same time, I thought that if he knew, he could address it before it jeopardized his job or a relationship. In the end though, I thought it was best that I didn’t tell him. But I don’t know and I can’t talk to anybody in my life about it without the possibility of the video getting back to him.

- Limited attention span

Mostly because of the age difference, but also because we handle our responsibilities differently.

Later on, they settled in TX where I had training, my sister said I could stay with her, but when I arrived, she moved to CA.

She decided to drop her kids off with my mom in CA and told me she would stop to visit since I hadn't seen her in 6 years, only for her to keep driving and ignore any communication. 

My husband and 2 kids live in VA now and were invited to 2 weddings in TX and now my sister is marrying her 2nd husband in FL.  The dates don't interfere, but I can't afford to fly 4 people to 3 different events.  The friends are really just my husband's friends, but we all get along and we have actually let them watch our kids too.

1369,Asshole,"Throwaway in case my classmates use reddit. 

I'm taking a College Algebra class as a prerequisite before moving onto higher math. It's mostly serving as a refresher for me, since I graduated about a decade ago and I've always been fairly comfortable with math. Others in the class are struggling and have lots of issues/questions. My professor does it as a part time job.

One student in the class seems to be causing a lot of issues. I'm fairly certain he's on the spectrum and he doesn't mean anything bad by it, but the negative result is the same. A few of the things he does, which I think harm the class, are

* He constantly interrupts the professor in the middle of her explanations, so we don't get the full concept as one cohesive statement.
* He says the answer, about 50% of which are right, before anybody else can participate and answer themselves. When he gets it wrong, the professor then starts correcting him without calling on someone else to participate and work through the problem.
* He yells out how easy certain problems are, despite others having questions about it and often getting the wrong answers himself. Others are leaving the class without understanding the concepts and I think it's because they're discouraged from asking questions about ""easy"" problems.
* He consistently asks the professor to not move on from slides because he wants to copy every slide in its entirety, despite the professor repeatedly telling him it's available online.

As a result of the above, we cover about 20% of the material in the first half of the class and have to rush the final 80% of material in the last half of the class. This leads to even more issues with the harder material. 

So would I be the asshole if I asked her to take control and not let him dominate the class?",27,62,0.89
1370,Not the A-hole,"My partner and I get along well and I adore his parents. Besides his parents and sister, he has no other family and so when we visit it's usually just the five of us. 

The issue is his sister. She is very narcissistic and enjoys playing the victim, oftentimes screaming at other people when things go wrong and it's obvious it was her fault (ex: someone invites her to something, says ""we'll leave at 9am"", she doesn't get out of bed to take a shower until 8:45am, and then screams at said person when they say ""ok i'm leaving without you"" at 9:30am). There are other, more extreme examples, but this is the gist. She's 23. 

The issue is that for the last few years of dating my partner, I've put up with her behavior because I still felt like an outsider to the family and so on her birthday, I just eat my dinner with them, and grin and bear it. I don't want to do that this year. I am tired of my partner and his mom venting to me about her behavior and then turning around and watching them pretend to be happy when she's around. I just can't do it anymore. I'm not asking my partner to not attend birthday celebrations for her, but I can tell he's disappointed in me not wanting to come and he doesn't know how to tell his mom the real reason why I won't be there. 

So please, can you tell me if I'm TA, and if I am, I'll go to the birthday dinner. Thanks.",18,33,0.89

Obviously, that was mostly a joke so even though when I realized the implication I was a little stung for a second. But I brushed it off because, whatever, no one was being serious.

Later, when it was just the two of us, I half-jokingly reminded him of what he said and asked if he really thought she was prettier than me, and he just sort of laughed awkwardly and didn't answer. I admit it was kind of petty but at this point I was feeling a little insecure, so I got a bit more serious and pushed and asked if that was what he *really* thought.

1375,Everyone Sucks,"Some context: I am on crutches. I am at college. And today has been a very shitty day to begin with.

Usually when I go to this place on campus to buy a quick snack, I have two working legs. However, ever since I fucked up my foot and got a big cast, I’ve been on crutches for the past month. Since on crutches, I would put whatever I grab into my backpack, walk up to the register, and show them what I’m buying.

Cause I already ate earlier, I was grabbing a bottle of good ol Brisk. I did my routine, put the crutches on the wall, grab the Brisk, and begin to zip up the bag. That’s when a worker popped around the corner and told me to “Put it back.” I look at them confused and say back “What?” They then tell me to put it back and say “I know you’re trying to steal it” I give this dude the biggest ‘Are you fucking serious right now?’ Look and tell them what I’m doing “Dude, I’m on crutches I can’t carry that shit to the register” They say back “Put it back”

That’s when I snap. I put the bottle back and decide to lay into this guy for a couple seconds. I explain to them that I’ve been doing this shit before. That’s when this guy decides to drop the bomb “We know you’ve been stealing and you’re no longer welcome here” that’s when I almost fell flat on my fucking back “I’ve been fucking stealing?! Motherfucker, I’ve been paying for fucking everything I grab for the past month. I’m on fucking crutches, how the fuck am I gonna hold a big ass bottle of iced tea?!”

I then proceed to angrily, and albeit awkwardly, crutch out the store.  I’m fucking pissed at this guy right now. Honestly today can’t get any fucking worse except the fact the elevator in my dorm is broken and I live on the 3rd fucking floor. Yay.

TLDR: I have a routine to buy shit while on crutches. Guy accuses me of stealing while on this routine. I flip out on the guy.


EDIT: It’s 6 AM and this post kinda blew up. Might as well add on its resolution. Apparently the same guy calls up the manager of the store and the head of security at the college to question me and look through my backpack. Apparently, they saw me “drink a Gatorade outside the store that looked like one inside the store”. Cause y’know, Gatorade bottles just look completely different by location. I’m not in trouble and they just asked me to change my routine from now on. Could’ve just asked me to begin with.",160,229,0.93
1376,Not the A-hole,"So a little background, growing up I was super close with my Aunt and Uncle and little Cousin. They were great people and I really loved being around them. Then my Uncle bought a business he was working at and things started to change. They became wildly successful and i was honestly so happy for them. Something happened between my parents and them that involved my dad asking for a loan or something, I'm not 100% sure, but my Uncle said no. Ever since then there seems to have been a tension between my parents and them. Whatever, not my circus, I still loved them. Well the more successful they got, the more they started to get ""rich person syndrome"". I noticed my Uncle would still talk down to me like I was a 14 year old. Then Grandma died. It was sad and sudden, and everyone was upset. Except for them, apparently. They had her car and house sold before the funeral. My Grandma had been grooming my sister and I to take over the family business and we were ready. She made her wishes known to everyone that we were to take control. My Aunt and Uncle thought otherwise, taking over the business and then selling it a few months later claiming it was ""too much for them to handle"" and never once consulting my sister or I on anything, even though we knew the ins and outs of that place like the back of our hands. There has been a couple other incidents such as my Uncle never visiting my dad when he was in the hospital for a stroke, but then making snide comments on my sister or my facebook when we would switch off his care so one of us could take a break. Basically, ever since Grandma died they have just been acting like entitled self righteous jerks. 

So that brings me to my latest incident. I'm getting married in a month. My fiance was with me through all this drama so she knows everything. I didn't want to invite them to begin with, but she convinced me to. Shortly after we sent out invites, my Aunt texted me and told me to send my cousin his own invite so he could bring his girlfriend. Not asked me to. Told me to. We deliberately left out significant others (other than spouses) on invites for both sides of the family because we are paying for the wedding ourselves and unfortunately we just cant afford to give everyone a plus one, even though we wish we could. I have since sorted it out with my Cousin (he's 24, you'd think he could bring this to me himself like a grownup instead of having his mom do it), but to me it's the final nail in the coffin. Theres no uninviting them, but I'm done with their toxicity in my life. I dont want their money or gifts, I just want them out of my life. They've cost too much anger and heartache for me even though I personally have never wronged them. If they get us anything, I fully intend on returning it to them with a letter detailing in the most polite way possible that they can go shove off. 

So AITA for wanting to cut them out of my life? Or am I overreacting?",20,27,0.9
1377,Not the A-hole,"I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

Over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

It all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


We had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. 

Finally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

When we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I get to know her and things like that. 

I've not said that I'll never be in the same room as her again, I've just said that I won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but John says that I'm overreacting, and that I should give her another chance, which I have no intention of doing.

UPDATE: Thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. While I still stand by my decision and won't take Alicia on holiday unless John is there with me, a lot of people said that I haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. Even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), I think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. It is of course Leanne's decision but it isn't something I'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. As some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why I told John that I will make the effort to get to know Alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as I can.",1664,16524,0.93

1382,Not the A-hole,"This has been gnawing at me for a while. Last semester I (20F) was looking for an off-campus apartment with my friend (20F). I am a relatively low-maintenance person and she is a bit more Type-A, so she took the reins in apartment hunting. We looked for places for the two of us; albeit it was mostly her calling landlords and making appointments to check out the listings.

So, she finds a place, sets up a time, and I meet her and the landlord there. The place is walking distance to campus, has two beds and baths, is a good price (with utilities included) and the landlord is lovely. The immediate issue is that one of the bedrooms and bathrooms are SIGNIFICANTLY bigger than the other. The larger has a queen bed, an attached office, and a bath with a tub. It also had more privacy as it was in the back section of the house. The other was right off the living room and had a double bed and a shower. Within our friendship, she was the dominant personality and her immediate assertion is that she would get the bigger room. Initially, I was alright with this, but I told her that we would have to renegotiate the way we split the rent. She said that she couldn’t pay anymore, so I offered to pay more to have the larger room. However, this didn’t work for her either.

We discuss the situation for a while and don't come to a resolution. I remember that the landlady said she had a studio apartment in the same house. Because of the issues we were having and a whole bunch of other problems, I text her and tell her that I don’t think that living together is going to work out. I say it has nothing to do with our friendship, I just don’t think the environment would work for both of us. I finish the message by saying that I am going to message the landlady about renting the studio.

She calls me about five minutes later, says she was the one who searched for apartments and put in the work, she said no to living with other people, and she sacrificed a lot for me. I said I was sorry, I had no idea she gave up other opportunities for living situations, but I wanted to get out of the situation before we were miserable and living together. She said that she would also message the landlady to get the studio, so it was up to whoever could sign the lease faster. The conversation only escalated from there. At that point, I texted her and said that she could sign the lease and that our friendship was over.

Three weeks later, I finalize my internship in the town I attend college in. I have to find somewhere to live for the summer so, I text the landlady to see if she has any apartments available on any of her properties. Sure enough, my friend had not signed the lease and the studio was still up for grabs. So, I signed the lease as soon as possible.

So AITA, for renting the apartment that ended out friendship?",33,116,0.93
1383,Not the A-hole,"My mom and I are planning on living together. Here is some backstory.  


I am 19 years old. We're having to move out because my step dad recently passed away from cancer. And this is his house, and how he left the will we won't be able to live here anyways. So we need an apartment. She wants me to put bills in my name (ex. Lease, Utilities) My moms credit is fucked up because she took all of the bills from my dad when they divorced to ""keep the peace"" while also taking the minimum amount of child support possible. My mom has alienated me from my dad, and made him sound like the bad guy a lot through my life. She even has to mention every time about my $8,000 hospital bill from when she put me in the mental institution. (Lots of childhood trauma I went through)  


I just start training on my job this Monday and I need money to pay for a TB test and a money order for the application. I gave my mom all of my money ($70, I do landscaping to get money for now) for the cable bill that was overdue, and it was shut off. I also gave some money for the electric bill. And trying to give her to spare me $40 for all of this was like pulling teeth. She's borrowed money from her boss, coworkers, friends, family and it's easily like $800+ right there. She doesn't have to worry about the mortgage. Only cable, electric and a car payment. So I expected her to be able to help me out for this job I need if I want to support us. I've given my mom over $2000 easily from a college grant last year (I'll talk about that later. I couldn't go to college for a lot of reasons that were out of my reach) When she handed it to me, she asked me to run to the store and get her cigarettes, and drinks and toilet paper. So I told her no. She tried to take it back but I demanded that I need it for my job. She then threatened and said for me to live with my dad. She did this before to hurt me because I used to not talk to him. (again, alienation so I thought he was the bad guy)  


If I live with my dad I have a promised place to live, and not worry about bills being in my name, and overall my credit can start to be built. My dad just wants me to pay off the other half of the car he gave me, my insurance, and some money for bills so we both can live comfortably. I have the moral dilemma because of how vulnerable she is. Am I the asshole? I can give more backstory if need be.",45,364,0.94

1385,Not the A-hole,"I was married to a guy who had a son from a previous relationship. We have 2 daughters together. He didn't see his son for many years because he said the mother ""wouldn't let him."" I eventually found out that wasn't the case, and that he got into an argument with the mother and instead of dealing with it, he just stopped talking to her. He never took initiative to deal with anything himself, he always had to be told to take care of his responsibilities.
We split up when the girls were 9 and 5. After he left, about 2 months went by of no contact from him, so I reached out for him to see the girls. A year goes by of random visits. Then one day, they get back from their visit and my 10yo tells me that she has a headache and doesn't feel well because her dad smokes too much cigarettes in his house and the smoke makes her sick. I say I will talk to him about it, but she says she doesn't want me to say anything to him because she doesn'twant to hurt his feelings. The next week, she says she doesn't want to go with him. So I tell him they're not going with him that week. 
That was 4 years ago, and that was the last time I heard from him. He has not once tried to visit them or ask about them. The girls just kind of forgot about him along the way. About two years ago, he had another child with someone else. He apparently told this woman that I ""won't let him see the girls.""
I am not opposed to my daughters spending time with him, if that's what they want, but I refuse to take it upon myself to reach out to him yet again to set it up for him. He skates through life without a care in the world while everyone else in his life does all the hard work for him. 
A few months ago (a week before Father's Day), his new gf messages me to ask if ""we could talk."" I have no problems with this woman, as I've never met her. But I ignored her message because I know exactly what she wants. She most likely wanted to make contact with the girls, to try to surprise him with some grand gesture for Father's Day, by getting all his long lost kids together. I get where she is coming from, but I feel like it is not her responsibility, nor is it any of her business, to try to contact my children for him. If he ever decided to pull his head out and actually ask for himself to see his kids, then that is a different story. 
Am I the asshole here? I get that the kids are the ones that are kind of caught in the middle of all of this, but my kids are doing just fine right now, with or without him.

I'm posting this at the urging of my wife. She is from Russia, immigrated here when she was 5, met me, an American, at school and we got married. Her family is all bilingual, with the exception of her parents, who only speak russian. 

We have two kids, and they grow up in our english speaking house. I do not speak russian nor does my wife consider russian her primary language, as she was brought up in the English school system. 

Her parents persistently yell at her about how terrible we are for not teaching the kids to speak russian. It's not a question of if it's possible, I'm sure it is if we switch to speaking russian in our house. That seems like a stretch though, as it's not her primary language, we live in America, I do not speak russian, we are not involved with any other russians. Why is it not their responsibility to learn english, so they can communicate with everyone, including the individuals from this country, as opposed to our entire family learning russian to speak to just two people.

1392,Not the A-hole,"So I live on a college campus in an apartment building. The building has an area with picnic tables and grills and ash trays behind it.

I'm a smoker. (Flthy habit I know, but this post isnt about that so please dont tell me I should quit, I know I should quit. I'm working on it, but life is stressful right now.) I usually go out back behind my building and smoke at one of the tables by the ash trays a few times a day.

Recently a daycare for students' kids started bringing the group (~20 kids) around the building I live in and having picnics/playtime on a grassy hill behind the smoking area. Important note: The grassy hill is far enough away that the kids would not be smelling the smoke, however they can see me smoking.

Yesterday one of the daycare leaders approached me and asked me to smoke elsewhere. The problem is, there are very few designated smoking areas on campus and the next closest one to my building is about 1/3 of a mile away. However, the grassy hill the daycare has been taking the kids to is not at all unique. There are grassy areas everywhere, and there are even playgrounds and picnic tables all over the place. They could easily walk a minute or two further away and not even be able to see me, and if they did that they'd even be by a playground for the kids which they currently are not doing for some reason.

I told the daycare leader that I lived in the building and where I was sitting was a designated smoking area, but she still insisted I go somewhere else. I asked them why they chose that particular hill for picnic time with the kids when there are dozens of other places to go, and she didn't have an answer. Just told me I was being disrespectful and putting the kids at risk by continuing to smoke. I just kind of shrugged and didn't move or say anything else until she walked away.

Today an email was sent out to all the people in my building and surrounding buildings asking that people please be respectful of the kids in the daycare. I can't help but feel it was directed at me, and now I'm wondering, am I an asshole for refusing to budge? My reasoning is this: 1) I have every right to sit and smoke in the designated smoking area where I live, 2) the next closest smoking area is not at all close, 3) the smoke doesn't even reach them, its just that they can see me smoking, and 4) the daycare has countless other places they can go if it really bothers them that much.

1394,No A-holes here,"This has been an issue for pretty much our entire friendship which is about two years now. I'll give you all the latest example that started this big argument.

My friend was interested in this guy, I'll call him Jake. Jake seemed like a good guy, but my friend was nervous because for various reasons she's not ready for a long term commitment. When she asked me for my advice I said going on a few dates with him isn't a big commitment and if he makes her happy she should try.

She decided instead to not date him, and try to avoid him on social, when she went out, etc. She asks me again about what to do. Whatever, that's her decision to make I tell her. If she's not ready, she's not ready.

Fast forward a few months and she tells me Jake has ""popped up"" again and she's gone out with him once or twice but she's still conflicted. 

Keep in mind this Jake situation is not the first time this has happened. She will constantly ask for advice and ignore it, then complain later.

1396,Not the A-hole,"So a little over 6 months ago I(21F) moved out of my old apartment. My lease had come to an end and while I wasn’t planning on moving out at first I abruptly decided too after a few bad altercations with my roommate towards the end. 

When I decided to move out it was very last minute and didn’t give me time to save or find a new place. I had nowhere for me or my cat. So when my BFF(21F) and her roommate(23F) offered to take my cat I was beyond relieved. They said they would be happy to take her as long as I needed. 

When I moved my cat in I had brought her litter box, litter, food, toys, scratching post, etc. And I told my best friend that of course when she ran out of food and litter or anything I’d pay for more. 

So her roommate fell absolutely in love with my cat and actually offered to buy her. I told her that I wasn’t really looking to give her up but if I couldn’t find a place that wouldn't allow cats she could have her for free. 

After about 2 months of me not finding a place the roommate made it clear she would be happy to start buying her litter and food and I could just pay her back whenever. I told her it was fine and that I had the money but she absolutely insisted. But anytime I tried to pay her back she would not accept it.

After 4 months of me still not finding a place I found out the roommate had taken my cat to the vet without telling anyone. She saw my cat scooting on the carpet and assumed she had worms. If she had just asked me I would have told her she sometimes gets litter stuck to her butt and that’s her trying to get it off because I had already had her checked for the same reason. Even tho I saw no reason for the vet visit I still offered to pay her back because I appreciated her concern for my cat and she said it was alright. 

So flash forward to today and I have just moved into my apartment yesterday and I want my cat back. So I texted my BFF I’m coming over to get my cat and so she tells her roommate. Her roommate then proceeds to tell her that she thought the cat was hers now and she won’t be giving it back. My BFF told her she wasn’t her cat but she then proceeds to lock my cat in her room so we can’t get her. 

When I got there she still refused to give me my cat. She told me because it’s been so long and she’s been taking care of the cat and paying for everything she has claim to it. I told her I’d pay her back for everything and for it’s care and she told me no she wants the cat. I told her no and she actually started fucking crying. She told me she just loved my cat so much and didn’t want to give her back. I ended up just saying she can stay her for the night but I’ll be back tomorrow to get my cat.

1398,Asshole,"Literally every single day, as I walk from the train station to my office, the same two intersections have people who run the red light, get stuck in the intersection, and block the crosswalk. This has happened enough that I've even been able to get a photo of the same driver doing it twice. Full disclosure, I'm angry. In my city, a pedestrian is killed every three days. 

I looked online, and I can obtain semi-permanent vinyl stickers that read ""If you can read this, I'm blocking the crosswalk. Again."" It's $200 for 1000 stickers. The only way I would even be able to put these on the car in the first place is if I have to walk around it, onto the road or the intersection.

So, if I did this, WIBTA? Really I just want people to stop being so careless, so if this is just something to make me feel better, then I suppose it wouldn't be worth it.

1401,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: So for the past couple of months me and my gf have been hanging out together at my house everyday after i got home from work. This isn’t a problem I love my gf and enjoy her company.

The problem is i also love videogames and when im with my gf she might let me play for a few hours but i can never immerse myself into the game because im worried she might get upset with me if i play too long. 

Today I woke up for work and was in the mood to play some ps4 when i got home. I text my gf and ask if it was cool if i just chilled by myself today. She said “thats fine i guess” so i knew she was mad about it then she just started getting short with me. Am i the asshole for wanting to play some games instead of hang out with my gf?",25,49,0.96
1402,Not the A-hole,"(This is actually something that happened to a friend of mine, not me, but for ease of writing this post I'll claim her spot in the story.)

So our residence hall is putting on a skit (for an upcoming campus-wide competition) based on Hercules. Last night, we had a meeting about said skit. It's the third such meeting we've had so far. During said meeting, I was assigned the role of one of the Muses, as were 4 other people in attendance.

When I returned back to the dorm, I (white 21F) encountered two girls (black 21) sitting in the hall. Racism or claims thereof are a part of this story, which is why I indicate their skin color; more on that in a second. It should also be noted that although I've seen them in our residence hall before, I only knew them by face, not name.

Both girls asked about the results of the meeting. I told them which roles had been assigned to which individuals, and they were incensed. Apparently, they had spoken with our director ahead of time to reserve the roles of 2 of the muses. They had not attended any of the three meetings we had so far, but assumed that reaching out to the director was alright.

I told them that I didn't know about the decision and told them to take it up with the director if they were bitter about it. They fumed and said they better not be cast as monsters because ""that would just be racist!"" They were, in fact, cast as monsters, but only because all of the named roles had been filled by meeting attendees. Not that I was going to tell them that. I told them I had homework to get to as a way out of the conversation and left.

A few minutes later, our director texted me asking me to come to her room. When I arrived, I saw the director, the two girls I had encountered, 2 more black girls who were friends with them, 1 white girl who handles some of the diversity stuff on campus, and 1 more black girl who has sort of a mentor/advisor on campus. 

The two girls got started. They said they felt like I was rude and racist in my comments. They said that being called ""bitter"" is a demeaning stereotype of black women and that I intentionally ran away from them when they challenged the group's potential racism. I offered to give up my role as a muse, but they declined, insisting that this was about ""something bigger."" After they called me racist, I said I was sorry if I had offended them but that I hadn't meant anything by it. The mentor spoke up for the first time, asking if anyone else had any challenges, but no one had anything to say. I left the room, humiliated and angry.

Look, I know there are bigger issues on this sub than a residence hall skit, but what really bugs me is the challenges of racism, especially in a context where it was me versus 7 people, 4 of which had nothing to do with the actual conversation. Was it wrong of me (well, actually, my friend) to handle the conversation the way I/she did? Is the word ""bitter"" actually racist?",279,483,0.92
1403,Not the A-hole,"I(18M) was going to work at my dads firm and he said that I woulds easily get 1200 euro a month for a 40 hour per week time. 

I had planned to get a gap-year so i could see what studies I wanted to do and get a little bit of work experience, I wad thinking working at a restaurant (doing dishes etc.) But I was rejected by 2 restaurants so my dad offered me a job at his firm.

He told me explicitly that I would ""easily"" get 1200 euros (wow thats alot!) It got me hyped AF, he said you would get around 6 a 7 euros on your debit. So i was convinced. 

Fast forward to a week ago. I haven't signed any contract and I didn't wanna push him to get me a contract. I have been working for 4 weeks without a contract now, still waiting to see what my salary is. 

Now its been 5 weeks and he told me that he fixed a contract and would be discussing it with me soon! Im Hyped....

I calculated my salary; like what I'd really earn instead of what I ""earn"" ( government takes some) 
I come around 900 euros. So I pointed it out that he promised me I'd ""easily"" get 1200 euros. He said that I'm ungrateful for this oppurtunity and that he is tried his hardest to get me this amount.
But I told him the amount was fine but I am not fine with him ""promising me money"" and luring me to his firm. I get it 900 euros is still alot but im just saying that for the manual labor that I do being let down is just a bummer.

Now he is threating me to lower it even more, now sitting at 800 euros a month. I told him jokingly that he is getting to the bare minumjm for a 18 year old he searches it up and changed it to that now at 750 euros

1404,Not the A-hole,"My (25f) boyfriend (25m) and I are going back to visit my family this weekend, largely to shoot guns with my parents and so my dad can work with my bf on siting in a new rifle. A few years ago my parents moved into my dads childhood home so “home” isn’t home to me anymore. It’s also very packed full of things and clutter. The walls are paper thin, there is a big, rowdy dog and more recently a new puppy. My bf and I are not allowed to sleep in the same room (Whatever, we don’t really mind, but it’s a factor). He sleeps on a couch and I sleep on a stiff mattress. My parents stay up later than us so we don’t sleep well because we can hear the TV and then talking. We are also woken up very early in the morning when the dogs want out, and I’m typically the one to get up and let them out because I can’t stand them whining and my parents hushing them. Neither of us sleep well there and the clutter really stresses me out, not what I want on a weekend after a stressful work week.

My aunt and uncle live about 15 minutes away on top of a mountain in a huge house with an entire living space downstairs, complete with bedrooms, a kitchen, tv and incredible jacuzzi tub. They don’t give a fuck about us sleeping together and we use the kitchen to cook our own food and continue our regular routines. He has a special diet so this is unbelievably helpful and allows us to not only eat how we want but to also avoid having to turn down homemade food because of his diet. The rooms are pitch black and we sleep HARD and for as long as we want, as it’s also silent. This also helps me get face time with more family members, I love my aunt and uncle and we very much so have that ‘I can’t tell my parents these things’ type relationship. 

The plan is to stay there, eat breakfast then spend most of the day with my parents, return for the evening and repeat. My brother (17) also intends on staying there so we can all hang out. 

My brother told me this hurts our parents’ feelings. I don’t intend on changing plans, staying with my aunt and uncle is damn near a vacation and gives us quality time with more people in my family. However, if I’m being insensitive and an asshole towards my parents I will sacrifice it in order to change that. I’m also looking for insightful ways to express to my parents our reasoning. I don’t want them to just marinate in their sadness, but I also really enjoy being at my aunt and uncles house, especially now that I don’t feel like home is “home” anymore. Should I message them and explain the reasoning? Let them know my brother told me their feelings are hurt? Say something in person? Not say anything?

1412,Everyone Sucks,"Hey All, need some weighing in here.

Move into a new house a few months ago. Brought my outdoor cat. He is more of an outdoor cat who comes inside occasionally, usually he just suns himself in the backyard as he is older.

Recently, a neighbour has come to my house 3-4 times a week complaining the cat is meowing at their door and accused me of negligence and not taking care of the cat. I apologized and let him him and kept him in for a few days then let him back out. Same thing happened again, cat meowing they come over and complain.

Their daughter accused me of being a negligent owner because he is out during the days, and when they gave him food that he ate the entire can. He is also a very thin cat (has been his entire life). Their belief was that he wasn't being fed. I told her that he is on a special low protein diet and requires special food, which is why he ate their crap quality tinned stuff (it is like McDonalds to cats). She apologized for feeding him (no problem, they didn't know). I then found out they have been feeding him all sorts of things like sausage and other tinned food.

The mother of the house came by and got uppity about him being outside and bothering them. I asked her if they fed him, which she denied. I called her out on it immediately as their daughter had told me they fed him, and a neighbour also commented that they feed him. I told her that I was not keeping him inside permanently because of a mistake THEY made (I thought it was common knowledge not to feed animals). She got more uppity with me and I closed the door on her. I have kept the cat inside for a week or so, but he is antsy to go outside.

I also spoke with all of our neighbours, and he doesn't bother anyone else. No meowing at the door or anything, at most they see him walk on the fence in my yard. Sometimes will approach them for pets if they offer.

AITA if I let him back outside?",120,92,0.9

It’s always hurt and irritated me. None of them have ever said why but every year I hope for a text or something and it never happens. 

We didn’t know anyone who died or was directly affected by the attacks. We lived across the country. Other than watching it on tv like everyone else it wasn’t something that was  directly connected to us. Because then I could understand.

I didn’t even know to connect the events of 9/11 to the lack of birthday acknowledgement until this morning when my stepparent messaged me and said they never say anything about my birthday because they don’t think it’s appropriate while the whole country is mourning. 

It boggles my mind that these two sets of people who hate each other so much have come to the same conclusion that this is the best course of action without ever mentioning it to me. I always feel so rejected.

1415,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé and I have been together for 8 years and he’s always been horrible with money. He can’t save for the life of him and definitely learned his bad habits from his parents. I bought a house when we were still just dating and make all the payments on it. I make almost all the payments on everything since I make significantly more money than him ($60,000 compared to $30,000). His ONLY bills are the cell phones and car payment, about $600 a month total. Well, the cell phones almost got turned off yesterday and the car got repossessed this morning. Repossessed! I’m livid. How could he let that happen??? I’m supposed to be marrying him in 6 months and I’m worried about our financial future. I love him more than the world, our relationship is perfect, which is why it’s even harder to come down hard on him. So, WIBTA if I requested him to direct deposit his money into my account and pay all bills from that account? He’s pretty sensitive about money and not making enough too. But he also knows his weaknesses. To be fair, I’m not the best with money, just much better than him.

UPDATE: he feels horrible, obviously, and Very very ashamed. Im still mad but recognizing that I also wasn’t ‘on it’. I know he’s an adult, but we’ve been together for 8 years and I know his strengths and weaknesses. I should have checked in when it seemed like he had too much money in his pocket. I def need to help him learn to be more responsible for himself (as many of you recommended). A financial class could be good for both of us.

Also, why the hell would I throw a beautiful relationship away over one thing?! What’s wrong with you people? It’s a learning/growing opportunity if anything. We’re getting the car back in a few days and it’s only costing about $500 (which we agreed is coming from canceling an upcoming boys weekend he had planned). No big deal - I would never trash a whole relationship for something so material. 

I spoke to him about doing a joint account for bills and he’s totally on board. A percentage of each of our paychecks will go into the account and the rest will be ours. Many of you suggested this and I think it’s the best route. I will definitely keep my finances safe and am considering a pre-nip. 

Also, he’s a cook who just started out — he loves it, but the pay is shit.

I have a fairly young prof for one of my mandatory classes who tries way too hard to be 'hip' and be that 'chill' prof who acts as if they don't give af about anything.

She constantly swears (ex. Fuck, shit, I don't give a fuck, fuck off, studying's a bitch). She honestly says fuck way too much, literally the first day of class she was sitting on her desk talking to us, she was talking about attendance 'ya hey, come, dont come, honestly, I dont give a fuck if you decide to come but fuck it, its your life man'

When she's explaining something, she'll say things like 'the metrics are fucking difficult to understand, but practise and it'll be your bitch'

I would switch out but every single lecture is full, and she's the only one left.

everyone I tell my feelings to tell me to that I need to chill out 'its not like she's directing the swearing to you'. Yeah, honestly that's true, but I personally think when talking to a prof, it should be professional or casual, it shouldn't be like a Highschool group chat where you can just swear candidly.

I had a question to ask her after class about her lecture, and honestly I really didn't want to, but I didn't know who else to turn to.

I walked up to her and the first thing she did was take a chair and sit on it the wrong way (the back of the chair facing frontwards) and yawned. I started asking her some questions and she examed the sheet and while yawning said 'fuckkkkkkk this is a hard one'. I asked her not to speak that way to me and she said 'touchy touch, how 'bout we just not talk at all?' I told her that was fine, and I'd prefer to talk about her behaviour with the programs head prof. Everyone behind me gave me dirty looks.

My friends who have had her before tell me she's a good prof, and her vulgar behaviour is not even really a big deal... AITA? I feel really uncomfortable with it, and I really don't know if I'm being unreasonable

I've told her this is unacceptable because I'm still sleeping usually (still a morning person so I'm not being woken up too early) and I'm in my PJs, which is usually a shirt and undies or just a shirt. She's given snarky responses like ""just keep your eyes closed"" or ""you'll be waking up soon anyway"" or ""just stay under the covers"".

Anyway, one day I got the idea to just ""sit up and chat"" with the bf while she was in the shower/getting ready. We have a bunk bed and I'm on the top. So I'm sitting there with my legs hanging off the side chatting, playing on my phone, and trying to be oblivious to his looking. She walks in and catches him looking at me. When she gets back she blows up calls me a whore. I tell her that she should just not have him come around in the morning when I'm dressed like that. She tells me to just stop being a whore and deal with it because it's what they do.

Its important to note most of the neighborhood kids play at my house. While they are usually respectful I often remind one child ""you dont live here please clean up after your self"". They are a bit of a bully and I try to remind them if they cant be kind they can't come back.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

We would have to go out to pick up food if we wanted to have dinner with her. In addition, while here, her teenage son got bored and decided to taunt our dogs who were chilling in the backyard. The dogs started to bark like crazy at him. He would not stop taunting our dogs despite me and my husband telling him that the dogs do not like what he was doing. 

Eventually I got annoyed so I told her that I needed to go back to the nursery room to feed our baby. I then rushed them out to the door and told them I would take them out for lunch in the near future. 

Looking back, I suppose I could go get food before they came over but that means I would have to eat dinner with them instead of taking a much needed nap. Hubby said it was rude of them to expect us to entertain them knowing we just had a baby. So here I am trying to put this to rest: redditors, was I the asshole?

Tl;dr: a distant relative insisted to stop by to visit us 2 weeks after I gave birth to our son despite me telling her that I would not be available for too long. She brought gifts for the baby (that she got for free) and expected us to feed her and her son. During their visit, her son was also being a dick to our dogs. I then politely asked them to leave the house without feeding them.",95,272,0.94

So we invited them, but not my MIL’s two brothers, sister, and spouses because they don’t have young grandchildren or anything. My MIL confronted me and told me it’s “weird” I’m inviting her best friend and not her family and I explained why, she then blew up my husband’s phone with texts about it, then even went so far as to text my own mother about how she’s not happy about it. Annoying thing is we did this exactly last year for our child’s 3rd birthday and she didn’t complain then. Maybe her family complained about not being invited but again, our house is small, and we want it to be a more child-orientated event because it is for a four year old, not us. AITA?",33,111,0.95

Extra emphasis on barista because that’s what I’ve done for years, that’s the role they were hiring for, and that’s the role I accepted. Since the day I was hired I have not made a single drink. Instead, I’ve been in a disgusting, hot, sweaty kitchen making crepes, complicated omelettes, fancy salmon breakfast platters, etc. I’ve never worked in a kitchen, I hardly cook for myself, and I made it very clear that I have no idea how to do any of this and I am not a cook whatsoever.

And the woman at the front making drinks hasn’t stepped into the kitchen once. 
She even took an order today for 3 fancy platters and immediately told me to go make them. It’s my 3rd day. I said, “I’m not a cook, I don’t know how to make this.” She got very frustrated with me.

1431,Not the A-hole,"I was born in Ireland but live in the UK. I’m getting married next year and I wanted to have 2 hens (bachelorette parties) one for my best mates in the uk where we rent a cottage for a weekend and get messy. The other one in Ireland with my mum, sister, family etc. 

As a side note I HATE people surprises. I get super anxious when I don’t know who is coming and also, it’s my bloody hen, I want to be able to pick who goes. 

I just found out that my sister (matron of honour) has been sending invites to everyone in my past. People from school, people I used to hang around with around 15 years ago. People that have stayed in the past for a reason. Not only that but she’s invited my best mates who are coming to the UK hen putting them in a really difficult spot to have 2 hens and a wedding in the same year. 

When I found out I told her and she absolutely lost the plot with me. Told me I was being a control freak and that I don’t get a say in my hen, she’s doing everything so butt out. I explained that I don’t want people there who I don’t know anymore and she should have at least asked me who I don’t want there. Her response was “it’s too late the invitations have gone out” and to “shove it up my a***”. 

I’m also really embarrassed that these people think I’ve invited them to my hen when I haven’t. Like, if it the other way around I would feel awkward. But anyway, my sister has called me every name under the sun and told me she’s going to cancel it and not do anything because I’m so ungrateful and controlling.  My mum is also taking her side.

1432,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, this is my first post on reddit and still quite new so my apologies for any mistakes. I am on mobile.

Ok so a little back story.

About 6 months a go I found out an old school of my wife’s was making moves on my wife and trying very hard to convince her to leave me for him. Now my wife has always been gullible and trusting which he knew and played on a lot.

It started out small at first, reminiscing over old times and general friendly conversation before he started sending messages saying how he always loved her and how she was the one that got away before he started changing tactics by picking holes in my marriage and stating how bad I am at being a husband because I would go to work and leave her all on her own. 

Before long he was convincing my wife to give him my work schedule so he “knew when the best time was to come and f**k her in our bed” (to give you a better idea of the type of man he is, whilst he was doing all this he was also asking her to speak to her best friend about becoming f**k buddies)

It went as far as him trying to convince my wife when the best time was for her to leave me for him and him making plans for her to do so. He even had it planned down to within half an hour of me coming home so our kids wouldn’t be home alone too long because he wasn’t going to take on 3 kids.

It was at this point my wife told me about what had been going on and I read the messages.

When I found out I gave her an ultimatum, either break all contact with him and never speak or see him again or walk out the door and never to expect a relationship with me again.

She chose the former and we have/are working on our marriage and she has not had any contact with him, even going so far as to cross the street and walk the other way when she saw him whilst out shopping in the next town over.

Fast forward a couple of months and her mother unfortunately and unexpectedly passes. She wanted to contact him to tell him as he knew her mother whilst at school and I told her my ultimatum still stands. She was a little sad but said ok and hasn’t contacted him but still brings it up every now and then.


AITA for giving her the ultimatum in the first place and not allowing her to contact him after finding out such devastating news?",46,48,0.89

1434,Not the A-hole,"**Update:**

Talked to BF. We agreed that this only came about because we never discussed it prior. Which is true. I've given him my background, basically, done it before and it's non-sexual and I wasn't ""showing off"". He said he was mostly just nervous of his friends giving him shit or whatever about seeing my tits. But, because they didn't he feels like it was nbd to them either and he was the only one who actually cared. He also agrees that it wasn't ""Fair"" to try and make me sit out. And me being topless wasn't as bad as he thought it was going to be. He said in his mind he felt I'd be more ""exposed"" (like out of the water/visible) with his friends cheering me on staring at my tits. But, that didn't happen. So he feels he overall reacted poorly and he just had crazy ideas.

I did mentioned the suggestion from crackermachine about having him carry a bathing suit or top for me and he said that was a good idea.

&#x200B;

**Original:**

Keeping this as short as possible.

My BF and I usually go hiking with his friends on weekends when the weather is nice. Last weekend we went hiking on a new trail and came across a small lake after a few hours of hiking. This trail was a loop so we were maybe a mile or two from our car. One of his friends suggests we take a break and hop in the water. Everyone agrees.

The two friends shed their shirt and shorts and jump in in their boxers. As I'm getting ready to take my shirt off my boy friend stops me and says I gotta just sit on the side because it would be inappropriate for me to go in. I tell him that is ridiculous. He says he doesn't want his friends seeing me in my undies.

I tell him to stop being ridiculous strip down to just my undies and hop in (no bra). He comes in shortly after but hardly says anything and I can tell he's upset. We swim for maybe 30 min. Dry off get dressed and go eat. And now he's being all ""I can't believe you did that"" and ""You gave my friends a show"". It's been a few days now and he's wanting me to apologize. But, I think he should be the one to apologize.

Was I the asshole here? I just wanted to swim with everyone else.

**Edit:**

Regarding the 'skinny dipping'. I had my underwear on (a SmartWool Thong) but no bra (i was worried it wouldn't dry out fast enough).

**Edit 2:**

I'm in Cali. We have nude beaches (I've never been) and hot springs where people are generally nude or topless (I've been prior to dating my bf). Additionally, in the past I've done 'full skinny dipping' with friends, both male and female. So I didn't think it was a ""big deal"".",1830,1293,0.88

1436,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit.

I am starting to lose my mind.

Since I was young I had a knack for computers and electronics (phones, televisions, basically anything tech related). I can fix almost any tech related problem that I encounter and I love fixing problems and finding solutions. This is also the reason I now study IT, which in my case consists of a mixture of a lot of different subjects, such as project management, business studies, data structures and algorithms, programming, networking, etc. I am the only one in my whole family who knows a lot about tech and can solve tech related problems.

Here is the thing: everyone expects me to always fix things, because I am the IT guy, and I keep hearing people say: ""But this is what you study. Why don't you want to help me?"" when I tell them no. Your TV has no signal? They ask me. Your emails aren't working? They ask me. You want to Google something? They ask me. You want to write an email to someone? They ask me. Even my girlfriend's parents call me and ask me to fix things, and when I go to visit her over the weekends (she is at her parents house over the weekends) they always ask me to do things tech related. Even her parents' friends call me to help them with their fucking Apple IDs and shit, which is way out of line for my taste. It feels like I cannot go anywhere without being asked for help. I am really getting sick and tired of helping everyone with their shit but I don't want to be an asshole if I tell them to rather call their experts or go to the nearest cellphone store for help.

Now I am in my last year of studying, 21 years old, and yes I still live with my parents as there isn't money to let me have my own place.  The reason I mention this is that I kinda feel bad for not wanting to help my parents but I still do. I will be 22 next year, working at the second largest bank in my country (who also gave me a bursary for a full ride to college), so I am pretty brilliant if I say so myself (no humble brag), so I get why people ask me for help.

But I am an adult now, and I think that I may say no to anyone asking me for help. I feel like I am under no obligation to say yes to even my parents or my girlfriends parents. Will I be the asshole telling people no?",69,30,0.89
1437,Not the A-hole,"Update: thanks for everyone's input when my sister came home today I spoke to her about a joint party and didn't mention anything about a stupid party as I realised from all the comments I just sound like a right dick. 
As I was talking about splitting the main area of our house which is a living room connected to a dining room connected to a conservatory. I suggest one group in the living and the other in the conservatory as our friends are of different kinds. I put forward the dining room table has hand food and the kitchen would have some actual good maybe take out. 
Upon hearing this my mum popped up and told me that my sister has been looking at houses with her family recently and she may not be at the house by that time. My sister replied ""I'd still have the party here even if I've moved out"" so I just told her we should split the house like I suggest as it's only fair. 
Thanks for the all comments and advice, me and my sister don't often get along and we butt heads often so the thought of a joint party didn't come into mind as everything is usually a competition with us. 

So my sister (24F) recently told me she wants to have a party on new year's eve but my (20M) birthday is on new years eve and obviously with it being 21 it's a big deal (I don't see why because I'm British so I've been drinking a long time) and she knows every year I have a party at our house because obviously it's my birthday.

When telling me and I objected she basically told me ""you're just going to have to deal with it we've already sorted it out in the group chat"" which I think is her and about 6 friends. I think this is a bit of a dick move as she already takes over the house with her boyfriend (23M) and her two kids a 4 year old boy and a 8 month old girl. So usually I'm cooped up in my room 24/7 unless I'm at uni or at my SO's I think it's unfair that on my birthday she wants to take over the house with her friends. 

So WIBTA for just inviting everyone I know and their mums (not literally inviting their mums) to my house on new years as a counter party and fill the house with people so her friends wouldn't want to be there?

1438,Not the A-hole,"I (27M) have been with my girlfriend (26M), 'Julie' for about five years. Julie has a niece (15F), 'Elise'.Me and Julie smoke weed quite often, and we are quite open about it with her side of the family, who are all quite chill and open minded (mine freaks  if I even drink). I know Julie is very open with Elise especially, offering birth control and such if she wants it (Elise has never accepted). Unbeknowst to me, Julie has also offered to supply weed in the past, although Elise has never accepted before.

Recently, though, Elise approached Julie and asked if she could supply her and some friends (2 or 3) weed. Julie agreed. We were having dinner tonight, and I guess it came up in conversation. I was really shocked that Julie would offer that in the first place, and told her under no conditions was she to give those kids weed. Weed is illegal where I live, and whilst kids caught smoking it get a slap on the wrist, the adults supplying it can get in major trouble - I'm talking fines or jail time. I can't believe that Julie would ever risk earning these just to let her niece have a little buzz. 

She got really mad at me, and told me that she's the best place for them to get it from: she said if they want to smoke weed, then they would find a way to do it no matter the supplier. Because we know our dealer (friends), we know that they don't add synthetics or lace it with anything dangerous. She said that they wouldn't know for sure if any other sources were laced until it was too late. Basically said she was doing it for their own good, because they may end up in serious harm with some random dealer's stuff.

1441,Asshole,"So, a little background: I have two extremely close friends who I have known for a really long time (once since I was, like, 2 years old, and once since I was about 16). We're all in our thirties now. My oldest friend, let's call her Jessie, is married and has kids. My other friend, let's call her Molly, has a boyfriend that she has been with for about 3 years.

I've never really liked Molly's  fiancée. He's not a bad guy, but—well, you know when you just can't click with someone? And being around them makes you insanely uncomfortable, no matter how hard you try? And I really feel like I've tried over the last few years as well. He just does small things that bother me; like, I always think he's a bit controlling. Never outwardly aggressive or mean, but sometimes passive aggressive and occasionally manipulative (albeit only over small things, from what I've witnessed). Anyway, I digress...

So I recently got engaged and my boyfriend and I are planning on a destination wedding abroad. Neither of us are close to our families, and we only have a handful of very close friends between us, so we're arranging something really small and intimate for those who can/would like to come (and a larger party for our extended circle of friends when we get back).

The reason I mentioned Jessie at the beginning of this post is because she has already asked if her kids are invited to the intimate wedding. I said of course—her kids are like my nephews (she has three boys)—and her husband will come to the bigger party later on.

When Molly mentioned bringing her fiancée, I told her it was going to be a more intimate gathering and said that Jessie's husband is sitting it out. But when I told her that Jessie's kids are coming, she got really angry with me and said I was being unreasonable for leaving her fiancée out. I have made it clear that he's welcome to the larger party, I would just prefer to not have him at the ceremony.

Am I being the asshole?

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

To make it clear: no partners were ever invited to the wedding. If everyone was bringing their partners, I would not exclude anyone. This was more about Molly losing it because Jessie is bringing her kids, so she felt like she should be able to bring her fiancée. We have discussed it and reached a compromise—our friendship existed long before the men in our lives, and I'm fortunate that we're not going to lose each other because of this situation.

1442,Not the A-hole,"This is from years ago but bad feelings still come up.

1. My husband had a psychotic break and was detained under the mental health act. Diagnosed with bipolar. No previous incidents.

2. I have a young child from a previous relationship who was at summer camp during the breakdown, so fortunately did not witness anything.

Who, if anyone, is TA in the things that happened after?

a. My husband's parents were around and even went with him when the police took him to hospital (he had been running round our neighborhood naked and screaming). However they had a holiday booked and went a couple of days later. It was just a local trip to see family. They would have lost a couple of hundred pounds. I think they should have stayed to offer support during that stressful time. AITA?

b. Children's services said they needed to do an assessment to see if it would be safe for my young child to live with someone who had had a breakdown and that we could not live under the same roof until after the assessment. Fine. 

His parents said that me and my child should move out of the house my husband and I rented (we both paid the rent) to live with my parents, who lived 2 hours away. That would mean I would have to quit my job and the little one move school.

They did not want him to live with them (they have a spare room) because it would disrupt their routine. They said I was selfish for not 'letting him recover in familiar surroundings'. That's stupid because he would need supervision after coming out of hospital. In the end he went with them. AITA for not moving out?

c. He ended up staying for a year at his parents house until children's services was satisfied he was stable on his medication that had been prescribed. From day 1 they charged him the standard amount of rent for renting out a room. He still had all his normal bills and rent coming out of his account (luckily illness insurance was covering that). This was their spare bedroom and I'm sure they are in government subsidised housing already. Basically they made a profit from their son who had just come out of a mental hospital. I pointed this out and they banned me for visiting for 'being rude'. AITA for calling them out?

d. Just after being discharged from hospital he had a mental health assessment at (their) home. The dad went out shopping and the mum was 'asleep upstairs after a night shift'. Without being too specific, they both work in hospital settings and know full well that if the assessment had not gone well he could have ended up back in hospital. Even worse he was saying stuff like 'I murdered the president, I murdered my mother' obviously not true, but should not have been left alone with a government person without them to note what he  actually said. I said 'why the hell did you leave him alone with them?' they said 'oh we thought they just wanted to see the house'. I said that's asinine. AITA ?",146,498,0.92

I don't know exact details but as far as I'm told she slowly turned 'crazy', and a whole bunch of bad things happened which I won't go too into detail about since it's not relevant, and some stuff isn't really for me to share. She was admitted to a psych hospital just to paint a vague picture. Long story short my dad got custody after a long battle and there was a restraining order put in place that she wasn't allowed to contact me until I was 16. I've received and read letters sent by her since probably 12-13 since my parents read them first and a letter isnt really going to cause any harm (I also live halfway across the world now). Shes also sent and still sends birthday/Christmas gifts. Her letters are generally about my half-siblings, what shes doing, comments about what im doing (my dad will briefly tell her what I'm up to in terms of hobbies and studying, but very short and concise as he GENUINELY despises her because of some of the things she did). I should also add that she seems to be doing ok now mentally (as far as I can tell), she's allowed to see my half-sister but I don't think they're allowed to live together.

Anyway, most of her letters will include her saying how she would love to hear from me, here's my email/facebook etc, hope to hear from you soon... Shes added me on facebook twice on different accounts but I haven't accepted. I've never actually thanked her for any of the letters and gifts shes sent. Part of me feels bad, but I mostly just don't want anything to do with her. I don't care what my half-siblings are doing. I don't care what she's doing.

We had issues with her from the time we started. Even though timings and time off was discussed in detail with the nanny and the agency before hiring her, after she was hired she ask for more time off, with no reduced pay of course. She wasn't really that great at being a nanny either. She screwed up a few things (food, bathing, etc) and overall didn't really seem like she had any actual professional nanny experience. We never said anything to her or the agency because we accepted there would be an adjustment period. 


She suddenly told us at 6 am in the morning one day that a relative had died and asked for emergency  leave. I had to take emergency leave as my wife couldn't. That day our cleaning agency came in and seeing that I was there and the nanny wasn't one of them asks, ""So she took that other job huh?"" That's how I found out that she had been offered a  job closer to her apartment with less pay but less hours. I tried to call her but she wasn't picking up her phone. She never turned up and I had to extend my emergency leave until we could get another nanny and my daughter adjusted to her. I was really worried that I'd lose my job over this.

1455,No A-holes here,"My wife and I have been married for under a year. She has ovarian cancer and needs a full hysterectomy. Our insurance isn't great, and we have had to lean on family. 

This will take any chances we have at biological children together. While that's sad, we can always adopt or foster when the time comes. We're in our early 20s, we have decades. The problem is, she has a very limited window to try to freeze some eggs or embryos. We absolutely cannot do that. It would cost at least 14k just to harvest some, and then we'd be paying storage fees until we got together another 100k+ for a surrogate, not including IVF or any other fees I'm not familiar with. 

I'm sorry, but we don't have the money to do that, and it's disturbing to think about. Our genes aren't that great to justify spending so much.

My step-mother is very controlling and likes things done her way. I generally abide by her expectations, but when it comes to taking out the trash (specifically the day before trash is collected on the street) I usually wait until the evening to do it because I consider it a waste/inefficient to take it out early only to have people put more trash into the emptied bin. My thought is why not just take it out at the end of the day so that any excess that would be deposited there can go out with the rest. If the trash is smelly, or full, I have no issue taking it out earlier or more often, and will do so without being asked. Today, my step-mother left me a sticky note on the front door saying:

""Trash & recycle are **FULL**. Why do I need to remind you??""

I decided to leave her a note as well:

""I took out the trash & recycling. Perhaps I should remind you that I see the world differently than you. I could have easily fit more in both cans. Waiting until they are **actually** full is not a slight against you. Your condescending post it **is** a slight against me.""

My comment about how ""I see the world differently than you"" is a reference to the fact that I have OCD and tend to view things more black and white than others. When my black and white thinking impacts me or others negatively, I work to manage the issue and the anxiety that comes with it, but in the case of taking out the trash, it seems more like her issue of trying to control any and everything. Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clarify some things... I pay to rent my room. I choose to rent from them rather than elsewhere because the money stays in the family and it gives us more opportunity to spend time together. Issues with her trying to control everything in my life come up often, and I have always taken the time to hear her out and speak with her about her expectations, my feelings, my OCD, and how her treatment of me affects me. This is the first time I have responded in this manner, and I posted here because I don't know if this is ""stooping"" to her level, or perhaps my reaction is warranted.

Edit 2: It was slightly more than 3/4 full. I wiped down the kitchen counters with paper towels, gathered up some fruit that was going bad, threw that all away and still had enough room to fit my arm up to my wrist if I wanted.",21,69,0.9
1457,Not the A-hole,"When we were together i was paying for both of our amc a list passed and i put my card on her account. Today i checked my email and saw a receipt for 2 movie tickets, and one was charged on my card. So i got angry and because i created the account i went in and canceled the order. 

I know i need to take my card off, im in the process but amc doesnt make it quick. I already emailed them so im just waiting for a reply.

 Because i did it out of sudden anger and we ended on ok terms, im a bit conflicted. I mean, she didnt send me a text or anything about using my card. I need to know if im the asshole for canceling the tickets.


Update: So she finally contacted me, said it was a mistake and she planned on handling it on her own(sending me the money). She understood it was wrong to not ask and apologized. I got an email back from amc and canceled the subscription.

1458,Not the A-hole,"This is a bit complicated and long, but please bear with me.

My ex-husband and I were divorced in 2014. I left him, and was awarded full physical custody of our daughter. Because my ex was unemployed 4.8 of the 5 years we were married, I was awarded just a measly $200 in child support and was required to provide health insurance and pay for 75% of all out of pocket medical costs. This was fine by me honestly because really all I cared about was having my daughter...

The two years following our divorce the ex husband barely saw our daughter. Then in late 2016, he got a new girlfriend, and all of a sudden he wanted more custody.

Fast forward to mid-2018, and the court awards him 5 days custody and me 9 days. So he basically only has her 10 days of the month. That's the only thing that's changed. Child support and all my financial obligations remain the same.

Well, here comes the sad part. 

At the end of 2018, our daughter was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. With this, my still unemployed ex husband begins ""asking the community for help"" financially. He's appeared on our major local broadcasting, the radio, posted on Next door, etc., all asking for financial help. 

On my ex's fundraising campaign, he says that he's asking for money for medical travel, handicap accommodations to his home, and because he has to take time off work for all the medical-related things. 

The issue is, my ex was never even employed when my daughter got diagnosed in the first place. The medical equipment is covered by my insurance. He even had Make A Wish fulfill a simple request for our child to attend a summer camp because he ""couldn't afford"" the money for travel. Then, when presented with a bill, he told the collector, who knew about his fundraiser, that it was ""not (his) responsibility"" and to ask me for the money.

He raised over $30k with his fundraiser, whereas I've raised less than $5k because individuals believe that they've ""already donated"" and that the funds they donated to his fundraiser would be shared with me, which is not the case.

The sad part is, I'm a single mom. I still continue to work full time while I care for my child by myself. I have to still provide the health insurance so I can't quit my job. Luckily, I'm a developer, and can work odd hours, but it's still exhausting, and I don't feel like I can give my everything with so much financial stress on my shoulders.

Meanwhile, individuals are continuing to donate to his fundraiser, and I'm really struggling.

Hes much better about getting the public's attention than I am. I'm not the attention seeking type, so this is so new to me.

WIBTA if I just came out and said all of this on social media, the same places he's asking for help? I'm even willing to expose parts of our divorce decree and the written transcript from the bill collector stating that he refused to pay for a bill. I've already reported him to authorities for what I believe is fraud, but these investigations take time, and who knows what the outcome will be.",217,2146,0.96

1460,Not the A-hole,"Okay so I already know I'm more or less TA here, but I just want to hear reddit's take on whether I'm a justified asshole or just a pedantic one.

So late last night, I was walking home from the train station after a long day of work. I was also carrying a massive box as I'm currently moving houses (it's been a long week). I was waiting at the lights to cross a very busy road in my area, however when the lights went red, a middle aged Karen decided to purposely overshoot the stop and deliberately park herself partially in the intersection in order to get a head start whent he lights turned green again, as the lane merged shortly after the lights. This meant that she was completely parked over the pedestrian crossing, making it harder for me to cross.

I decided that I shouldn't have to deal with that. So I crossed the road as normal until I reached her car. I put down my box, got her attention, smiled at her and repeatedly gestured for her to reverse her car so I could continue crossing (there were no cars behind her, so reversing was entirely plausible). I then stood on the road, staring at her and smiling uncomfortably and condescendingly until she felt obligated and pressured into reversing; all whilst screaming profanities at me. Once she had cleared the pedestrian crossing, I cheerfully smiled and waved at her whilst she continued to scream at me, picked up my oversized box and finished crossing the road. Although it was clear that I was doing this in a condescending way, I had not impeded any traffic during this, and during all this the people in the cars next to her were watching and laughing at the interaction. It was actually quite comical and I when telling my partner about this, he and I had a good chuckle over the situation.

I know I'm TA here, but I'm not even sorry. So Reddit, do y'all think this was a justified TA, or just a pedantic one?

**Edit 1:** I previously described her as a ""white Karen"". Whilst she was indeed white, that was just poor wording on my part as I changed my sentence when originally writing it and forgot to edit it properly. Also just to clarify; it was clear she was parked over the lines intentionally. I see many people doing this to avoid getting caught in the lane merge ahead; however because of the intersection being a T intersection and the weird corner, I've seen my fair share of accidents caused by people doing that. I am normally a very passive person and actively avoid confrontation, but I felt that something needed to be done for both pedestrians and for safety.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** Thanks for your views guys. It seems I did act a bit rashly, and dispite my valid concerns for safety, should have either ignored it or approached it in a different way. I'll try not to be so uttlerly insufferable for you guys in the future :)",32,40,0.83
1461,Everyone Sucks,"I have 5 siblings, they’re all super social and outgoing. I am not. I simply am not a social person. I don’t like it when people abruptly come over, and I don’t feel comfortable when there’s a lot of people in the room. Because I am this way, I also am very considerate and self aware. I ask very little of people and keep to myself. My parents and I live together, and my mom always tries to hand me the phone when someone asks for me. I have told her again and again I dislike this. She doesn’t get the hint. Today my uncle wasn’t to see me, she asked me. I said no and went to my room. After she was done talking, she gives me an earful saying I’m sick, implying because I’m closed off. And also saying that I have no respect. I told her I am exactly that and to never do that again. Obviously, I actually went but shit crazy and even though the discourse was about a minute long, the volume of our voices was through the roof. 

I don’t get along with two of my siblings.

My wife and I just had our first baby together in August and it’s been an amazing experience so far.

We’ve been married for a few months now just for background but back to the point, my wife is breastfeeding and I’m not really uncomfortable with it in public or anything despite the stares we receive in some places. She has a knack to over share intimate details of her life on Instagram and Facebook but it’s never been a big deal to me until recently in which she has been posting pictures of my daughter feeding with her entire exposed breast in the pictures knowing my friends and family all follow her.

1465,Not the A-hole,"**TL;DR** Niece's teacher took an instrument that I lent my niece for repair without authorization, shop repaired it, and I might as well just have lit $30 on fire.  

I lent my niece my old clarinet for her music classes in elementary school. My thought process into it was that it would save my sister time, money, and not dealing with a music store. Before sending my niece off with said instrument for school, I had to fix the tenon cork on it. While that repair didn't go 100% as planned, the cork held the joints together as I assembled and disassembled it multiple times to test my repair. It was solid enough to make it to the weekend and I would have more time then to redo the tenon cork so that it would be fixed correctly.  

Yesterday I ask my niece how things went to be told that my clarinet ""fell apart"" and that her teacher was taking it to get it fixed. No contact was made by the teacher to my sister to verify what protocol was being followed to fix the clarinet. My sister reaches out to the teacher to tell her that my sister or I would be handling any repair and in return gets an e-mail back with quotes from a local music store that they work with for replacing the tenon cork ($60) and a tune up ($220).  

Today I made calls to determine who I want to do the work. My decision gets made on how I felt my interaction over the phone with the one shop went and by a few of their reviews on Google. My sister sends me a text message later in the day with the address of the store that the teacher took it to. Upon arriving at said store, they cannot find the clarinet. I get told that it was taken to their other location after they made a phone call and get handed the phone to which the owner of the store is on the line. I inform him that my niece's teacher had no authorization for repairs and I was there to collect my instrument to find out that they already started the repair and would write it off as goodwill if money was an issue.  

I explain to him that I wanted to be the one to decide what repair shop it went to and the repairs would be in my name for any type of workmanship guarantee. He continues to tell me that they work with families that have difficulty of paying. I explain to him that is not the situation for me and will pay for the work as I'm not out to screw someone out of time and money.  

My original cost of fixing my clarinet went from $13 and DIY to $73 and a shop doing it due to my niece's teacher taking it to the music store and assumptions being made. The area we live in has inflated prices which the reason on why I wanted to choose where it went. The place that I had decided on, wanted $30, stated the repair was not time consuming, and could have it back next business day.  

AITA for wanting to tell my niece's teacher off because she couldn't be bothered with taking a minute to contact someone to be told we would get the instrument repaired?",32,82,0.91
1466,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so, basically; during early June, I was on a spoiling my girlfriend spree and went around looking for things that would make her happy. (Supplies so I could make her a love letter jar, candy, etc) Well, around this time, I was scrolling on Instagram and noticed one of my classmates from school was a talented artist who had commissions open. I found her art cute and thought, since my girlfriend kept mentioning matching icons for us for social media, it would be a great idea.

I DM’d her, we talked, I gave her a rough idea of what I would like and references. I decided to go with a full body piece, with a detailed background; thinking I could crop out icons, but also be able to admire the entire piece itself. It came out to around 45 dollars and I paid her in cash, full, the next day at school. Now, since I’m an American that meant summer was coming up and the artist (who I’ll start referring to as C) assured me she would probably get the piece down in a weekend or two.

Never having commissioned someone before, I told her to take her time, saying I understood we all have lives and we’re both in high school so completely understandable. However, by the time August rolled around, C still didn’t complete the commission.

I contacted her over the summer a couple times. In late June, asking how it was going. Then in July, seeing as she had posted art with something along the lines of “finally found a style I like and got through art block”. She replied with 

“Hi! I’m sorry for such a long wait, it’s been surprisingly busy

The art is going pretty well! I’ve found an art style that I believe will be able to remain consistent, and I can send you a picture of the progress in a little while. :)”

I told her that’s great and I’d be glad to see. She later sent me a sketch which I adored, with this message

“I’m finally free, so I’ll be finished with this by this week hopefully X)”

Until she didn’t. I messaged her again when school started (August 21) and she sent me finished line art, apologizing, and that she’d finish up this weekend. Yet, it’s September 11th and I’m still yet to have any product. I’ve been bummed, because I wasn’t able to show my girlfriend “the big surprise” a month or two afterwards from paying her, but now, another month later, I just feel scammed. She had done commissions in the past and even has them up on her Instagram. 

Which brings me to a point where I want to cancel and ask for my money back. I feel bad, though, since she already did work for it. So WIBTA for cancelling?? Or should I just stay hopeful and keep waiting?",12,37,0.92
1467,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: after a very long discussion with him and bringing up points from this comment thread (thank you all btw) she won’t be named for his ex. He broke down and began to talk about how she affected him and her impact on his life which I understand but it seems like it’s too much at this point, especially considering he would definitely choose favorites with her, and telling our daughter she’d be a living memorial for someone that dumped her father would be uncomfortable. I’m going to help him seek group therapy for it and take down all the photos of her inside the house, which personally opened my eyes to just how much of our lives she had become apart of especially considering I’d never even met her before she passed. Our daughter will be named Agnes based on a song from a band my husband and I both enjoy. So thank you everybody! Blessings xx

Cut to the point: So we’re expecting twins, a boy and a girl and my husband and I just said “hey since there’s two of them we’d just both choose a name and roll with it” I’m naming our son, and my husband is naming our daughter. As the title suggests, he wants to name her after his girlfriend that died in an accident a few years ago, which is sweet in concept but I’d rather not have my daughter named after a previous lover regardless of whether she passed away or not. My husband’s been pretty bitter about it and he’s sticking by the name, but I just find it a bit inappropriate.

Edit: it’s also because we do a lot of preserve her memory anyways, we visit the cemetery, I allow him to grieve on her birthday (and since so many people have talked about the “allow” thing, I mean I stay out of his way, I let him be alone and if he doesn’t want me around that’s fine and I allow him to be alone and take time for himself. Of course I have no control over his emotions nor would I want to, I hope that clears it up) and in total the relationship only lasted about 11 months but it did have an impact on him since she was able to comfort him through many awful things that happened in his life at that time. I’m fine with it being her middle name, it’s nice name but her first name definitely seems like overkill. If our kids accompany us to the cemetery on her death anniversary at any point it would be an uncomfortable situation. She was still an ex when she passed away.",230,564,0.97
1468,Not the A-hole,"So I got a sublet for the month of September and there's a few... odd things. One is that the handyman comes over pretty much every day to do... I'm not sure what? He's friendly enough, but it's a lot of him sitting on the porch drinking coffee (that he makes in our kitchen) and smoking. It's like he's treating it like it's his house too. Strange.

But the thing I want to ask about has to do with the landlord. She told us she would be overnighting on the couch out in the common space and she showed up tonight to crash there. When she said she was going to bed, I was sitting on a chair in the common area working on my laptop. I said ""goodnight"" and went back to my work. She then asked me to go into my room. I don't like working in my room, because I try to follow the idea that bed is for sleeping (or maybe a good book), but not for work or being ""productive"". My feeling is: I'm paying to rent this space and I have every right to be here. I agreed that she could overnight here at times, but I don't feel like she can kick me out of the common space just because she wants to sleep. I'm fine to turn out the light, but since she's a ""guest"" here, I feel like it's kind of asshole behavior for her to kick me out the common space. I would have refused, but I want my security deposit back (not sure if she can withhold it).

1469,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.

These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. 

Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize.

1473,Not the A-hole,"I know the title makes me sound like an asshole but I’m hoping my explanation doesn’t. 
My wife exclusively bf our daughter for 6 mos. after she returned to work it was too hard to find time to pump as a busy ER nurse so we switched to formula. No big deal. When our daughter was 18 mos old my wife was miserable in her job due to a new mgr and wanted to quit. We crunched the numbers, sold a car, downsized a lot and made it work. It’s super tight. We had about $50-$75/month left after bills, groceries, etc. 
A year ago my wife talks about wanting another baby. I was about to start a nurse anesthetist program and told her I’d prefer to wait when our situation was better. She talked about how since we already had cloth diapers, all the baby gear and she could EBF this time since she wasn’t working that it wouldn’t add anything to our finances. I reiterated I’d prefer to wait which she took to me not saying no, went off bc without telling me and was pregnant in a couple months 
Fast forward to 16 weeks post partum and my wife says she doesn’t want to ebf anymore bc formula  is easier. She’s having no supply issues or latch issues-she just doesn’t want to anymore. I told her that we couldn’t afford formula and if that’s what she wanted to do then she’d have to go back to work. She could easily find a PRN position and work a few times a month. I’m in school M-Thurs but home mid afternoon and I work weekends and our parents both said they’d provide childcare if need be. My wife thinks I should just pick up an extra shift which I could do but currently I have every other Friday off and it’s my day to study, do some chores and spend time with my family. 
 Before anyone asks-I’m heavily involved in the household. I clean and cook and take care of the kids just as much as my wife (except bf). The older one is in pre-K during the day so it’s not like it’s hard to nurse the baby bc she’s minding the toddler. It’s her body and if she wants to stop that’s fine but even with coupons, discounts, etc. $15-$35 dollar cans of formula are not in our budget.


Quick Edit: My wife is getting roasted in the comments. I was going to leave out how she got pregnant but felt like it would  make it seem like we weren't careful and I'd be an asshole because I should've been more careful and not gotten her pregnant. My wife's intent was not to deceive me or go behind my back to get pregnant. The conversations around having another baby were long and plentiful with me agreeing with her on a lot of stuff like, yes it'd be nice to have kids a little closer in age, yes I can see how your revised budget would work, yes I know it took a long time for you to get pregnant before, yes I think Maddy would be a great big sister. But at the end I always said ""I'd prefer to wait."" It took us a year after my wife went off birth control to get pregnant the first time. She assumed it'd take the same amount of time and if she timed it well then going off birth control when she did and then 3/4 of a year of pregnancy, I'd almost be graduated. She should absolutely have told me she never refilled her bc prescription but she made a mistake, we worked through it and she is not a horrible person.",248,949,0.94
1474,Asshole,"Let me preface this with I live in San Francisco. 

My boyfriend owns a 2 bedroom house in a non-gentrified area of the city and it has a studio downstairs that’s turned into an AirBnB. This is relevant as he makes a few hundred dollars off this every month. 

His mortgage is $3800 and in his ideal world I’d pay half. I’m not sure what’s fair. I have offered to pay for utilities and groceries which probably is a max of $500. He said this wasn’t a good idea as he doesn’t think it sets us up for success in terms of me monitoring usage of electricity, lengths of showers, etc. In my ideal world I would pay somewhere under $1000 but no more. I’m currently paying $2000 for a nicer apartment, closer to work & better area apartment (no roommates). 

I’ve asked for advice from friends and the majority have said it’s weird to pay him rent like he’s a landlord and other friends have said why wouldn’t you just like you have been paying rent to your current landlord. 

He can afford to pay the full mortgage just fine and I can afford 50% just fine so this is more a matter of principles. Help?

Adding info based on comments:
- In all previous relationships I have paid 50/50 but this is different as he owns the house. 
- He makes twice as much money as me
- This is a serious relationship, talking engagement next year, kids in 2 years.
- I arrived at $500 - $1000 based on splitting a room which in that neighborhood a room in a house would be about $1200.
- Second room is his office, garage is solely used by him for his two cars. I don’t drive them but benefit from them.
- Not his fault but I’ll be financially responsible for my parents in the next few years, he is only financially responsible for himself.
- He hasn’t proposed splitting Airbnb gains.
- I do all the cooking, I love it, he loves it - we both win. I meal prep for him to have lunch during the week. He pays for dinners when we go out.
- Cleaning will likely be split.
- All home repairs and upgrades have historically been on him. There’s a full kitchen remodel coming up so advice on that would be helpful too.",388,172,0.92

1478,Not the A-hole,"I manage a group that does shift work 24/7. Positions are salaried with PTO. An employee, Mark, was excelling: he put in time outside the clock on extra projects, mentored team members, etc. Though young, I promoted him to a senior role with the plan that I'd bring in someone experienced tod mentor him. Mark could come to me with his questions in the meanwhile. I brought in others to mentor him, but they were disasters, and both got fired in under 90days. Mark was left working as the only senior.

Mark struggled to perform in the new role: he repeatedly ignored project deadlines, didn't show up to client engagements he was leading, wouldn’t answer messages if he was off shift, would have shouting matches with the Asst. Team Lead in front of the team, and complained people were deliberately cutting him out. I took his complaints seriously and investigated each one - always someone had attempted to contact him first before proceeding to the next person.

He sent me emails complaining he was overworked and, where I could, I moved work to others – sometimes even giving his work to people whom it didn't belong. Moving work off him had no performance impact.

One day Mark said he wanted to work remotely out of state so his wife could get her Master’s. We came to the compromise that if he wanted to move out of state (to a state with a significantly cheaper cost of living), we would let him but he would give up the role of Senior and step down $10k/year (still $10k/year more than what he'd been making previously).

He agreed and took the remote position. His performance got even worse - even the most junior were outperforming his metrics. All his work outside of normal duties halted and his answer was 'not my problem, I'm off shift in 15 minutes' (paraphrasing).

Realizing his performance wouldn’t improve, I worked to try and transfer him to a team with work he would find more interesting. Mark jumped at this and began interviewing for the other team.

Abruptly Mark put in ""two-week notice"" (it takes a month to get a new hire up to speed). He changed that to a week notice and said he would not be working one of the days of that week because he put in an extra day last week - that extra day was a travel day to come back in state for our team bonding event, which we paid for.

When he left, he was -30 PTO because we forwarded him time off for family issues he was allegedly having. I was told by others who are friends with him, that the time off and the moving for his wife's degree were so he could interview for the new job.

He returned his corporate laptop with the operating system and all files and software wiped, against corporate policy, and he kept the laptop charger.

His new job requires a security clearance and as part of that they conduct a survey of his previous work. WIBTA if I disclose all this knowing it could slow his process/result in denial, or should I let it go?

1480,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, with the hope that no one I know sees it.

I've (30M) been dating my GF (29F) for almost eight years. We met in college and haven't left each other since. At nine months she moved into my apartment and we've lived together ever since. Around five or so years ago I started calling her my wife, though we were not married or engaged. The first time it just sort of slipped out, and she didn't correct me or even seem surprised so I kept doing it. In front of family, friends, and strangers, I introduced her as and called her my wife. One time I did ask if it bothered her, and she said it didn't and asked why I didn't just propose since we were both in that mindset. My reasoning was pretty much I wanted to be able to afford the kind of wedding she imagined-big venue with all our family and friends, good catering, plenty of decorations and food. And she wanted that too, so we agreed to wait to get married until we could afford it.

Now, we can. I've spent years at school working towards a higher level degree in a well-paying field, and I'm finally at a very good job that pays very well. During this time my wife has mostly supported us with her job as a counselor while my money has gone towards expensive schooling to avoid loans as much as possible. For the first time, we have enough money to afford a big wedding. I proposed, she said yes, we planned the wedding, and sent out invites.

I guess one of my older friends, my roommate at the time my wife first moved in, had some secret grudge against me. When I called her my wife he assumed I got married without inviting him and was upset, but never told me. When he got his invite he blew up at me saying I hurt him for no reason and I shouldn't throw out the word ""wife"" lightly-that it's misleading and I've been lying to people for years.

AITA for calling my GF my wife for years before proposing? Is it lying?",463,3026,0.95

1482,Everyone Sucks,"Hiya Reddit! I made an account for the sole purpose of asking this so here we go!

I rent an apartment with 3 other people. They’re awesome and I have no qualms living with them except for this one thing.

I have a few guinea pigs in my room that are my beloved pets. They have a super cool custom enclosure that I designed myself. My roomies are cool with the piggies... a little too cool with them, actually!

My roommates had a bad habit of taking my guinea pigs out without permission. Sometimes I would come into my room to find one of my roomies hanging out with the pigs. Which is all fine and dandy, but it kinda bothered me that they didn’t ask me first. They would also take them out when I wasn’t home home or take them out to show guests.

I had no problem with my roommates wanting to interact with my pigs, but I wanted them to ask me first. I told them this and they didn’t really listen, and continued to play with my piggies without asking me. I asked them several more times to please not take the pigs out without asking or letting me know, especially when I wasn’t home. Didn’t work.

I decided to put my foot down. I now have a lock on my bedroom door and don’t let my roomies interact with my guinea pigs anymore. They started asking me politely if they could see them/started asking permission, but imo too little too late. I have effectively banned my roommates from seeing the guinea pigs.

My roommates are pissed and this has caused a huge rift between us. They are arguing that they “share” their pets (which is true — I frequently hang out with the cats in the household), and that they have a bond with my guinea pigs. They say it is unfair of me to ban them since 1) they now love the piggies and 2) they don’t ban me from playing with their pets.

I understand that my piggies are lovable but I had to put my foot down! I gave them the chance to just ask me and they didn’t respect that. 

My friend group has been calling me a jerk, saying I’m being rude and creating unnecessary drama, and they are siding with my roommates.

In retaliation, I am now banned from interacting with the cats in the house which sucks but whatever. 

My roomies and friends say I’m a grade A asshole and should lift the pig ban so that the house isn’t a tense dramafest but I’m not budging. It’s created such a horrible atmosphere in the apartment that being home sucks.

1486,Asshole,"Backstory: I have a swollen salivary gland and have had this for about 2 months now. I first noticed this a couple of days after hanging out with one of my best friends who has genital herpes. The two of us had gone on a hike and shared my water bottle as well as her weed pen. So having a medical issue I did what every non-insured American does and went online to look up my symptoms. Cancer, Mumps, salivary stone where all possible causes but the one that stood out to me was herpes. I was thought that somehow my friend, who presumably has an active sex life with her current partner, unknowingly also has oral herpes and that somehow our sharing of a water bottle and vape pen spread that on to me.

For whatever reason I latched onto that possibly being the cause and was freaked out until I finally went to urgent care to have it looked at by a real doctor. Turns out it wasn't herpes but the doctor basically told me that it is entirely possible for my friend who has genital herpes to have it spread to her mouth and for that to then spread to others through 'casual' contact. This eased my worries about my medical issue but definitely freaked me out about how someone could get herpes from non-sexual contact. 

So we were hanging out again yesterday after work going for a lovely fall hike when I mentioned my initial medical appointment. I told her to be kind of joking about how I thought she gave me herpes as well as to sort of warn her as to the possibility of her herpes spreading to her mouth. I thought, no one wants to accidentally spread it to their friends or have visual mouth sores so I would just enlighten her about her diagnosis. I wasn't trying to be accusatory and honestly before I went to the doctor I wasn't angry towards her if she actually did give me herpes, but she was silent the whole time I was talking and didn't say anything after. I decided to have this 'light' joking conversation at the peak on our hike so the whole way down she was silent and death marched back to the car. I tried to talk to her as she was getting into her car but she just quickly got in and left me standing there feeling like an idiot and she hasn't responded to any of my texts.

1488,Not the A-hole,"Ever since I was a kid I have always considered my cousin to be one of my closest friends. I am the oldest of at least 7 kids via my dad, my has always been closer to her and treated her better than he has treated his actual kids. My cousin is my aunt's only daughter and I have spent pretty much every day with her since we were babies. 

Recently I found out that my dad and my aunt have been engaging in an on again off again sexual relationship for years and that my cousin is the product of this relationship. I don't want to tell my cousin because I know that she would be mortified and I'm worried that this could ruin our relationship but at the same time I feel like this could ruin our relationship. What should I do?

Edit: Since everyone keeps asking my aunt is my dad's sister via adoption, I am pretty sure that there is absolutely no chance of them being related since they are different races (my dad is white and my aunt is black). Despite the fact that they have no biological connection I still find it disturbing because they were raised as brother and sister since they were infants and I always knew my aunt as being my aunt and not one of my dad's girlfriends.

1490,Not the A-hole,"Allow me  preface this post by saying that we live in an extremely small town. There aren't really any options for kids outside of the local school, and there aren't many options *within* the school.

My daughter is thirteen. She has been cheerleading since Kindergarten. This year is her last in JV, and she is the captain of the cheerleading squad. 

My son is six, and he just started first grade. He wants to play football. His mother and I refuse to allow him to do so for a variety of reasons. 

First, and the initial reason is simply because of the danger of the sport. It is full-tackle football. The helmets are not up to regulations. The school system has three years to comply with the new helmet regulations, and they will not change until all of their time is up.

Second, and the major reason, is that the pee-wee league coach's family has issues with my wife's. One of her cousins had a foster son, who she has since adopted. The boy has an IEP, which was not being fulfilled. The cousin went to the school to know why. Basically, the teacher, who was the varsity football coach, just didn't want to take the time to do it. At practice, the boy hurt his hand. The teacher/coach yelled that he was ""Just a fuck up at everything, wasn't he?"" and made the boy keep practicing. It worsened the damage. He had to have surgery. The cousin is now suing the teacher/coach and the school as a whole. The teacher/coach's brother is the pee-wee league coach. As such, we feel very uncomfortable allowing our son to play. 

He thinks it's very unfair, and several other people have told us so as well. However, we feel it is wrong to deny our daughter the ability to do something she has worked very hard for.

1491,Not the A-hole,"Board game store. This should be enough info for the thread but I'll elaborate.

Customer, Jennifer (not real name), is in every Friday for MtG. It's a big public event about 3-4hr. We get around 40 people. I just work the store during these hours, I'm not involved in any of the events, but where I work is directly adjacent to where Jennifer usually sits.

She has bad BO. I dealt with it for four weeks before I asked my manager if we could put up signage ""This is a public area and as such we expect customers to adhere to basic hygiene protocols."" So we did, but nothing changed.

So three weeks ago I pull Jennifer aside covertly and out of earshot of others and asked if she saw the new signage. She said yes. I told her this is starting to be a problem and if she could rectify the problem. She said yes.

Last Friday, after weeks of zero change, I thought it was enough and if it wasn't going to stop in private, I'd make sure it stopped in public. So I reminded her about our talk, in full earshot of many people. I didn't whisper, either, it was my normal talking voice. I told her that we take hygiene very seriously and if she can cooperate with us, it would be just great, thanks. She stormed out of the store in tears.

Did I go too far? This is months of dealing with it, trying to deal with it without singling her out, then privately singling her out, and now publicly signing her out. 

A friend said it was insensitive because I don't know Jennifer's situation, but she's is in her late 20s and doesn't appear to be disabled. She's not overweight, seems ""normal"" enough.

1493,No A-holes here,"So I’m a senior in high school this year, and because of my schedule, I don’t have any free periods, lunches, or study halls. Apparently I needed another art credit to graduate, and the only available art class was the period I would have had lunch (small school) so now I have to skip lunch and take art if I want to graduate on time.

Anyway, I assumed it would work like it did last year. Every semester there are a few seniors whose schedules are all fucky, so teachers just let them eat in class or let them sign out to go to the cafeteria or nurse. Except our school changed its policy this year, because one freshman has some allergies. 

The new rule is absolutely no eating anywhere in the building except one section of the cafeteria during specific periods. You can’t even have drinks in the classrooms (just in case your Gatorade is secretly harboring peanuts, I guess) or take your lunchbox with you to class. They’re insanely strict about it—they even made one girl throw away her breath mints—and they keep threatening to punish people for “hiding” food. And, even if you’re in the small section of the cafeteria devoted to actually eating, your food must be free of milk, eggs, soy, gluten, tree nuts, peanuts, apples, and like eight other extremely common ingredients found in practically everything. Because of the restrictions, most people just buy the (terrible) school food. 

Now, I can’t do that, because I’m in class for the entire time the cafeteria is open. The administration told the teachers to grant students who don’t have lunches passes so they can go buy food, but that process takes at least twenty minutes every time. You have to get a pass, get the teacher to sign the pass, get the teacher to sign your “agenda log,” sign out of class, sign into the cafeteria, get the cafeteria monitor to log you on the attendance sheet, wait in line, etc, and that’s before you can even eat. Almost all of my classes are APs, so the teachers are not happy about giving kids lunch passes that excuse them from nearly half of class every single day. 

Normally I don’t even mind not having food, because school is like 7 to 2:30, but now clubs are starting up. Sports and clubs can easily make it so I don’t get home until 5 or later, meaning I have to go a solid ten hours without eating. I’m on a course of antibiotics that makes me vomit unless I take it with food, and I’m not supposed to have ten hours between doses. What I’ve been doing is sneaking food into the back of the library while I wait for clubs to begin, since it’s too crowded for anyone to notice.

The reason I’m concerned about being an asshole is that I know the allergy kid—all the allergies are real, and pretty severe. I don’t want to give her anaphylaxis because I contaminated a library table with apples or something. At the same time, though, I have meds to take, I have to eat, and the school administration won’t help me. AITA?",793,3864,0.97

Hers is less than three weeks before mine, in a different state. All my available vacation time is caught up in my own wedding/honeymoon/ect. Any time I take now is another shift I'll have to add, potentially working the night before/morning of my rehearsal dinner.

I'm a nurse, so I can't take non-allotted vacation, especially since we're very short-staffed and the fall is a high-census season. I told her I couldn't make it based on these reasons. She got very upset. My fiance and I offered to go on a trip with her and her fiance when our finances and vacation times recover. She was pretty unenthused by this idea and told me not to RSVP no and to just figure it out.

Plane tickets alone are $500. I'd be going for one overnight. I would probably end up working the night I flew back. My round trip would be about five hours in the plane. As far as I know, she is coming to my wedding and is going to make a trip out of it by going to NYC during the week.

1498,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone! 2 weeks ago I started college as a freshman and I must say, it’s a blast!! However on the first day of school, a boy (let’s call him X) came up to me after we had our first class together. He asked me if I was in the class we just came out of and I said yes, we talked for a little bit and then I realized, we also had the same second class together. I had no friends so I thought this was a good opportunity.

While in the second class (Sociology), me and X sat next to eachother. I kid you not, the whole entire class period, this guy was talking non stop, even when I was clearly ignoring him. He talked to the point where the professor called him out for talking (also his breathe smells really bad). He kept trying to encourage me to talk to some girls in my class (150 students), even though I mentioned to him that I had a girlfriend. Also encouraged me to try smoking with him one day, even though I told him I don’t smoke and have no interest of doing so.

After Sociology, X asked me if I wanted to grab lunch with him. I made an excuse because personally, I don’t view him as the type of friend I’m into. I went about my day and avoided him on campus at all cost. 2 days later when I had the same two classes, it’s almost as if everything repeated itself. However this time when he asked me to grab lunch with him and I made an excuse, he offered to come with me. My excuse was that I was going to the Gym with a few buddies of mine (which I wasn’t). X kept insisting that He go with me, even though he didn’t have gym clothes? He follows me around all day after class and I don’t know how to get rid of him because everytime I make an excuse, he wants to ride along. Another example would be that one day I wanted to go to Meet the Clubs, and he followed me there too, and he didn’t even look at the clubs. One time, to avoid sitting by him in Sociology, I was purposely late to class. I showed up to the door at Sociology 5 minutes AFTER class started. X was standing right outside of the classroom, and said, “I waited for you”. TALK ABOUT CREEPY!!!

I don’t like X one bit, everywhere I go he follows. I try to give him hints that I do not want to be friends by being EXTREMELY dry. Not only that, but somehow he found my Snapchat, and when I didn’t accept his friend request, the next time I saw him, he asked why I did not accept. Out of pity, I accepted. I purposely do not reply to his text messages, and most of the time he is asking about homework. X asked me to go to the library and print HIS homework and turn it in for him, X asked me to buy HIS scantron, X asked me to send him the answers to the homework, and everytime, I read and ever reply.

I don’t know how long I can keep this act up, it’s only been 2 weeks and I’m getting sick of it. I want to meet new people and diversify, but I can’t seem to get this guy off my back. Am I the asshole for not accepting him?? Sorry for the long read, this sort of felt like a rant",26,45,0.92

1503,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit. Throwaway for the usual reasons.

I am 21 years old and addicted to opioids. I recently came to terms with this and checked myself into rehab, which is the best decision I have ever made. I am now 6 months sober!

I believe my addiction started when I was about 11 years old. I had terrible migraines and my mom would share her Vicodin prescription with me in an attempt to help. Obviously at that age I had no idea how addictive opioids were. I trusted my mom. They did help my migraines so I took them regularly (several times a week).

This, of course, turned into an addiction for me. I began to have withdrawals if I did not take them. My mother finally realized that she should probably stop giving them to me, so she did, but it was too late at that point. I would have meltdowns begging her to give me one, or I would resort to stealing them from her. This continued until I was 18 years old and moved out of her house, at which point I began to buy them myself.

My addiction destroyed my relationship with my mother and she hates me and wants nothing to do with me (which is understandable, my behavior while in the throes of addiction was deplorable). Many of family members were supportive but had to keep me at arm’s length for their own safety and well-being.

I was invited to a family reunion last weekend to celebrate my sobriety. My family is extremely happy to see me doing well. I was happy to see them all again because I love my family immensely and wanted to apologize for hurting them.

To everyone’s surprise, my mom showed up. I was initially thinking that maybe she wanted to make amends, but turns out that wasn’t the reason she came.

She spent the entire reunion bad-mouthing me, talking about what a terrible daughter I had been, saying I’m an irredeemably shitty person, etc. My family was ignoring her for the most part but it was like a knife in my heart and I felt my anger build.

One particular comment made me so angry:

“I don’t know what happened. I raised her better than that.”

I blew up at her. I told her SHE was the reason I became addicted in the first place. She was the reason I had to fight through addiction. She did this to me.

She was shocked and started bawling. She said she was trying to help me and she knows she fucked up, but it wasn’t her fault I became a selfish junkie. She left the reunion.

My family is fairly split on this. Half think I am a huge asshole trying to blame my bad behavior on my mother. The other half are appalled that my mom was involved in getting me addicted in the first place.

I don’t know how to feel at this point... She was trying to help me and I don’t think her actions were malicious, but I can’t help but feel like she did this to me.

1505,Asshole,"Background info: We have been married for 4 years now. We have two kids. When we dated my wife was on birth control and our sex life was great. My wife got pregnant a couple months after we got married. Obviously women's bodies go though major changes and our sex life fell off a cliff. I tried to be patient and understanding of everything going on with her body between the pregnancy, breastfeeding, and recovery. My daughter was born and had medical complications. This was obviously very stressful and our bedroom stayed close to dead. As stress went down, our sex life got a little better, but never close to where we were dating. I always initiated and she treated it like a chore most of the time. We decided to have a second child , and sex became nearly non-existent during the pregnancy and again after. I tried to be understanding but after 3 years, I was getting frustrated. After having a serious conversation about how the infrequency of sex and little interest she shows towards sex was making me feel, she responded mostly positively. Sex got a little better the summer of this year, but I always initiate and she still treats it like a chore. When were were dating she would initiate, seem to enjoy sex, think of things to try, etc. Since getting married, she mostly just lays there, kisses me a little, and not much else. I understand kids are hard work. I understand that as you age, things like sex drive change. **The issue isn't that I want her to hit a quota or anything like that. I know that I am owed nothing.** What frustrates and hurts me is that my wife says she loves me but treats sex like cleaning the floor. It is making me feel undesired and used.

AITA: Recently my wife had an ear infection and she went on an antibiotic for two weeks. This makes birth-control pointless and she stopped taking it. Suddenly she wants to have sex all the time. She is flirty for the first time in years. When I initiated sex, I didn't get a passive-aggressive comment or a sigh in return. She actually was passionate and involved. **We do want try to and have another kid.** But not for another year or so. Last night she comes to me and says she doesn't want to use birth control anymore. She says her birth control is making her feel the way she does and that is why she doesn't want to have sex. She wants me to use condoms from now on. I try to explained to her, that condoms are uncomfortable and that if I had to use a condom every time, sex wouldn't be enjoyable for me and now I would be the one treating it like a chore. As a man I have very few options; no sex, condom, vasectomy, or risk pregnancy.  I asked her to talk to her doctor to go over all of her birth control options and see if maybe there was another option that would be a better fit. She said that she would not, she doesn't want to be on any birth control at all from now on. No shot, no implant, no IUD, no pill. She got very frustrated with me and didn't talk to me the rest of the night. Am I the Asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit for clarification: I offered to have baby number 3 now. She wants to wait. I asked about oral. She refuses to finish with oral. (I preform oral every time we have sex. I want to make sure she has an orgasm.) Anal is out of the question. I asked about hand-jobs, she refuses. I asked about the pullout method. She doesn't want to risk it. **I offered to get a vasectomy and freeze baby batter.** She is concerned about the cost. I will be talking to my doctor and will try different condoms.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Apparently Rule 1 doesn't apply in this thread. Some of you all clearly made assumptions about the entirety of my relationship and applied some monstrous character to me. I do not yell at my wife. The conversation was not, ""OOOO HELL NAW, BETTER TAKE THAT PILL WOMEN!"" I could have worded things differently, but there is a 3000 character limit on the initial post. I had to eliminate lots of quotes and context. My wife is exclusively interested in me preforming oral sex on her or me wearing a condom. No other forms of sex, or not having sex are acceptable to her. I offered to be celibate until we are ready. She wants sex and that is unacceptable. (Yes this is what I wanted and am glad to have her back.) Apparently as a man, I need to also be a expert in women's health and should have already known about all the options out there. I do need to learn more. I do have two daughters and I need to learn more about women's health. I am not saying that I am not the asshole here. That much has been made very clear to me. But I am not the wife beating, controlling, horrible father, deadbeat that some of you are accusing me to be.

1508,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend began to become friends with someone that we both knew and kinda felt bad for. Now what began to happen was that she felt the absolute need to be apart of our relationship. So she wanted to hang out with me but I felt that it’s weird for me to hang out with some other girl when I have a girlfriend. That made us hang out with her as a couple. She consistently got in between us and made me go do things for her (as she was injured at the time) so we wouldn’t be next to each other.

Here’s the problem: my girlfriend wasn’t super upfront with how their relationship was going. It seems to me like it was that they were best friends or something because she was doing things that were abnormal. In addition, she convinced my girlfriend to lie to me about being with her while I was gone on vacation.

There was one final thing that set me off. My girlfriend and I came into a fork in the road regarding the consideration of our future. Problem is that she got involved and started to convince her that there’s no way we could get through that and the only option is to just be friends from now on.

That didn’t happen but now I can’t stand her. I’m super passive aggressive toward her and (as she has mental health issues) am on the verge of stopping to try to help her. I can’t fight the feeling of being mad at her anymore. Am I the asshole for not forgiving her and trying to help her?",23,58,0.81

I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

1511,Not the A-hole,"So the other day I was driving down a 5 lane street. 2 lanes south bound, a turn lane, and two lanes north bound. No median.

A school bus stops in the furthest south bound lane in heavy traffic in the adjacent SB lanes, but people are still passing on the north bound lanes. This is illegal since there is no physical median.

I was driving in the closest NB lane and the vehicle in front of me stopped for the bus. I chose to switch to the furthest NB lane to also stop for the bus and keep any further traffic from flowing where kids might be crossing.

I had a lot of pissed off people behind me honking because I blocked the lane.

Full transparency, once the bus turned off the red lights I immediately switched back to my original lane to turn left, so I moved over for no other reason than to block the traffic. My significant other called me out for being a pretentious social justice warrior and said it wasn't my job to police people or keep them from breaking the law. 

I get that, and I'll admit to it in this case. But if I hadn't moved over and some asshat hit a kid when I could've stopped them, I don't think I could live with that guilt. Also too many people refuse to stop for school busses. I saw it more as protecting kids than policing strangers.

So reddit, am I the petty asshole?

EDIT: This is in Texas. In addition, a law was just implemented that you can have your license revoked for passing a red lit or stop sign bus. Texas does not have a 4 lane rule. If there is no physical median and the red lights are on/stop sign is out, all traffic stops.

Also, I did not cut anyone off or go into the shoulder. (There wasn't one). I switched lanes safely when there was room for the next car to stop.",78,158,0.89

HEY! SO - i just got married on Saturday. YAY! SO excited and happy. We planned a great wedding and had a blast. One of the things we decided during the wedding planning was that we did not want a wedding cake. While I love sweets and cake, I find that wedding cake is normally not even that good and the whole cake ceremony seems kind of weird. We opted to have ice cream sandwiches instead.

To my surprise, the venue made me and my bride a small wedding cake! We took it home the next day and had a small piece. The next morning, I went down to the kitchen to serve myself a piece of cake for breakfast, and find out that my mom had given it away (I am living with my parents at the moment). I freaked out! I love sweets and was so excited to have a cake in the fridge to pick at for the next few days. She said that I didn't want a cake, so she just wanted to get rid of it to clear the fridge. Being the sugarholic that I am, I am still feeling upset by this. She knows how much I love sweets, I don't understand why she wouldn't ask me if I wanted to keep it or get rid of it.

My grandmother also did not raise her four children well and they all turned into addicts, my mom getting clean later in life. Not an excuse, but it’s an explanation for her erratic behavior all my life. When we found the will, my mom had been cut out of it. My grandma’s possessions, money, and cars were left to me, my sister, and our cousin. This wrecked my mom. 

It’s been almost four months and the will is finally going to be read by her lawyer and executed. My parents are angry that I want one of the cars that grandma left to us, and it’s lead to many blow outs between us.

1. My mother didn’t know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother’s side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn’t a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn’t look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn’t long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he’s not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It’s not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

I didn't call him Caesar Salad every time I said his name either, it would be like passing in a hallway or randomly at work I'd say ""what's up Caesar salad?"" and he'd respond normally with ""nothin much what's up with you?"" or proceed to tell me a story.

I had a roommate who decided to move out after two weeks. The landlord has been generally sketchy, he tried to guilt trip me into renting both rooms, saying that it was my fault the roommate moved out. He tried to make me think that he would evict me if I didn't agree to rent both.

Last week I moved my SIM card to my phone, from the iPhone that I was borrowing before, and my landlord wasn't able to contact me because he only had iMessages enabled. After 3 days, I woke up to find his wife, who I had never met, had let herself in. The place was pretty messy because that was my cleaning day. Almost all of this mess was hobby stuff that I had left out because I was working on it. The landlord's wife told me that she was here because she needed to make sure the place was in good shape because 3 people were coming to look at it soon. I cleaned everything up, including putting the hobby stuff away. Then I worked out why the landlord wasn't able to contact me.

Later, the landlord contacted me, saying that he was struggling to find someone to fill the other room, so if he didn't find someone in two weeks, he would be moving in with his wife. When I was looking for apartments, I was only looking at two bedroom places because I only wanted one roommate. The place was advertised as being for only two people. I wouldn't have even considered the place if it was for more than two people, and I even asked if the landlord would be renting the other room out to couples. He said no. Not only this, but I'm extremely uncomfortable with having to live with my landlord, because he is about 3 times my age and holds significant power over me as my landlord.

He told me that he would evict me because the mess was a breach of contract. He lied about the extent of the mess, claiming that I had left a bra out in the main room. He also said that I can't bring any of my stuff out into the shared part of the apartment, which isn't in my tenancy agreement. He said that he wasn't in breach of the tenancy agreement by having his wife enter my apartment without permission because I wasn't responding to him. I think that it's unreasonable for him to think that he can have someone enter my apartment unannounced when his phone said that his messages weren't sending and he made no attempt to fix the problem or contact me another way. I also seriously doubt that he could think something had happened to me when he organised for people to come by shortly after his wife arrived.",18,95,0.92

They sent each other care packages every week, used pre-paid long distance phone cards to talk to each other every night(to give you an idea how long ago this was) and messaged each other on AIM constantly. They met in person one entire time at a theme park for an afternoon, and eventually had a falling out a year or so later. It was 17 years ago, NBD, right?

I only learned about all this when some old hoodie of hers finally fell apart a few years ago when we were dating still and it turns out it was his.

Recently, and I honestly don't know which one started it, but they reconnected over Facebook. Again, not a big deal. We've been married for three years and are very happy, he's been married for 5 years and has a kid and they seem perfectly happy. Just old friends reconnecting.

Except they talk *constantly*. It started with a few phone calls that lasted an hour plus each time. They mostly text now and I swear every time she sees a message from him she gets this little half smile. They aren't sexting or anything, she's shown me what they talk about(it's mostly fantasy or comic BS) but she still turns the phone away when she's answering him and curls up like a little girl answering her crush. A few days ago we hit a head when the mail came and there was a little box for her. I asked her if she ordered something and she just cried out ""Mine!"" and scurried off with it, IT WAS A FUCKING CARE PACKAGE FROM HIM! She doesn't understand what the big deal was, she actually scoffed and said ""I sent him one like a week ago."". Granted it's nothing explicit, it's just candy a few comics and a pair of sock, but it's still weird!

I talked to *his* wife and she agreed it was a bit strange but doesn't feel threatened by it, not just because we live several states apart(although I think if we lived closer her tune would be different) but she offered to talk to him about it. I said no, that's probably not necessary if she was ok with it, but then she paused and said that she wasn't super thrilled with it but she couldn't rightly tell him not to talk to her and we kinda left it at that. I've tried talking to some other people about it and everyone seems pretty split between they're just being dorks and that this whole thing is super fucking weird. So WIBTA if I asked my wife to kinda cool it with this guy?

EDIT: A lot of people are jumping to assume I don't care about my wife's interests because I called them BS. That was the wrong word, I was trying to brush off the relative harmlessness of the messages, not shit on her. I proposed to her at comic-con, people. Ease up.",108,197,0.93

We did this with around 15 people and one of them way a boy with a physical disability. I do not know the specifics but he struggles for running fast and for long periods of time. Before his trial my coach said the boy wouldnt make it onto the team but asked if I could let him win because it will help with his self confidence. I was like sure, i didnt mind and it would be obvious to anyone who was watching what was happening. So I let him win a d he celebrated and I thought I had done a good thing. But then I was kicked off the team. Two new people had been selected and they were very good runners and the boy who I let win had taken my spot. I was pretty upset because the coach said he wouldnt get on the team, so I went to him and asked why I had been kicked off. He said that the boy had beaten me fair and square and was much better then me. I reminded him of our agreement but he pretended he had no idea what i was on about. I said ""screw you"" and walked out. Literally running practice and competition was all I looked forward to at school and it had been taken away for a dumb reason.

I told my friend how unfair I thought it was and he ghosted me saying I was being discriminatory towards people with disabilities and that made me question myself.

1543,Not the A-hole,"I smoke cigarettes and weed. Friends and family all know it and we all live in a legal state.

I smoke in my backyard. When people come over with kids the kids always want to be in the back with me. When its time to smoke I tell the kids to run inside and tell their parents Aunt Jane sent them in because she's smoking. I figure after that its on the parents to keep the kids contained. And if they come back right away I assume their parents don't care so I carry on. The kids don't care what I'm doing anyway. They're busy playing.

Anyway I always kind of worry I'm being an asshole about it. My cousin thinks I am but she's also very conservative and anti drugs and alcohol. I feel like I'm mostly okay because I let the parents know and do it outside and its my house. I should probably be clear its something I only do at my home, I'm not bringing my bong over to other peoples backyards.

Context: 
We met around 2 years ago at a professional event and around 3 months later we were offical. We work in the same industry and both paid quite well so our finaces are seperate even though we live together. I earn quite a bit more than her roughly 5-6 times more than her and im not including any bonuses on that

Issue:

After testing driving an huracan performante. I knew that i needed one in my life. I have the money and no kids. I put the deposit down and sorted out payments plan. 

Fast forward to today and i show my girlfriend my new car and rather then be happy or be happy for me. She tells me i am being financially irresponible and why wasn't she consulted. 

My response was its my money and we have seperate finances. At the end of the day  it should be my choice. 
It would be different if she was sacrficing her career so I can earn more then i would understand but we both have our careers and we both do the same amount of work around the house. 

Am i in the wrong for not consulting her? Can you provide a different viewpoint then the one i am seeing. Am I the asshole? My view is no but i might be too close for this one",302,326,0.89

1547,Not the A-hole,"I (21 M) started working part time when I was 16 and signed up for a scholarship bond with the government for 5 years. In this 5 years I have to be fully committed to working for the government, not allowed to work any other jobs. The pay is decent, I am earning a bit higher than the average yearly income in my country in my first year of the bond. I did this for 2 main reasons - to be financially independent and to pay for my dog’s surgery and medication. He suffers from a severe slip disc and had to go for surgery. 

My parents gambled away all their savings for my education back when I was still a kid. I could not get into a University due to financial problems and therefore had to work. My plan now is to support myself, take the load off my parents’ back (Pocket money, school fees, food etc.) and save up so that I can get my degree after my 5 year bond ends. 

However, it was rather difficult to save money because my parents demand me to give 1/4 of my salary to them every month. I know I am supposed to be giving back to them for what they have provided me with all my life but the thing is, both of them now are well to do with NO financial problems at all. Their reasoning is I have to give them as a form of respect (I am Asian) and I obliged. 

Few months past and due to this I see myself getting nowhere. Having to take care of all my own expenses at such a young age, I was already stressed enough. I am only able to save a little bit every month (after struggling the whole month) and I snapped. I told them that this is unfair for me and reasoned that I am actually trying to help myself and my future here. They scolded me, told me I was unfilial, told all their friends ‘their’ side of the story and now I am on bad terms with them. 

AITA for this? There is no other way for me to save and I do not take a single cent from them, at least not for the past 3-4 years.

EDIT: THEY ARENT ASKING FOR RENT!!! It is Asian culture to give what you earn to your parents, but if I do I have very little left, and no future ahead of me.",329,1673,0.95

He’s the sweetest kid (I know he’s technically an adult, but trust me, he is still just a kid) and he was having a rough time at the shelter with the older, more seasoned residents. 

We decided we wanted to let him live with us. He can get a job, save money without having to worry about expenses, and we are going to help him get into trade school next year. He just needed a safe place to be where he can mature a little and hopefully get a decent future set up. 

The biggest rule my husband and I have is we need to approve who comes to our house. We are very particular with who we let know where we live. 

The kid said his friend wanted to pick him up to hang out today. He asked if that was ok or if he needed to meet the friend somewhere. My husband said it would be best for him to meet up. We live right off a busy road and there is a Taco Bell literally two blocks away. The kid seems to be cool with that and my husband is still adjusting to having one stranger here, so he feels more secure knowing someone we don’t know won’t be over. But I feel weirdly guilty.

1557,Not the A-hole,"Hi Redditors. Strap in. This is kind of long. So, due to some financial troubles, I'm a boomerang kid. I'm an adult living back at home with my mother.  The issue is, her financial trouble is worse than mine and I didn't know it.

We've gone back and forth about cutting costs in the household.  Her dream was to renovate an old house and she did that. The trouble is, she hired ""friends"" and unskilled people to do a lot of basic work and cheaping out in the beginning is costing her in the long run.  Right now we need an electrician because half the lights in the house don't work. She's got external lights hooked up with extension cords. I've  explained how dangerous it is, but she feels like she's safe because nothing has happened so far.

She wanted to get cable, but I explained to her that it's not in my budget.  I'm trying to pay off debt so I can get back in a better financial situation, so I've made a lot of sacrifices, including living an hour away from work, not going to movies or out to eat (even fast food) and packing my lunch every day.  I have a detailed budget spreadsheet that all of my expenses go into. But things are just so bad I'm not able to save any money here..i can pay my debts and help her with bills, but I can do no more.

So fast forward to the incident at hand. My mother asked to ""borrow"" some money to pay a bill. She has a habit of asking once a bill is past due, and I knew this was the case. She's also never paid back what she's ""borrowed"". At the time I had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and was dealing with a million emotions and a million doctor visits so I admit that my brain was on autopilot when I pulled out my wallet. Then it hit me: I didn't know what this $$ was for. So I asked several times before she told me. It was a payment on high interest payday-type loan that was already over a week late. I said no and she got really upset. I said that I had my own struggles to deal with and she needed to budget and be more responsible from here on out because I'm only willing to pay shared household expenses.  I maxed out my work HSA seeing specialists and had just begun using my credit cards (which I worked so hard to pay down) to pay my copays and fees for oncology treatment. I told her she was selfish for even asking me, knowing what I was going through.

1559,Asshole,"TLDR: Girlfriend’s friend is getting married next weekend and I agreed to go with her as her plus one. I have to skip my best friend’s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she’s angry at me.

A few months back my best friend asked over group chat if I and our other friends have anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wants to have a dinner party. Everyone said they’re free so far, but other details were never finalized and she never said anything else about it after that so I didn’t think much of it.

Girlfriend asked me last week if I wanted to go as her plus one to her friend’s wedding and I said yes. The next day my best friend messaged me reminding me of her birthday dinner this weekend. I said I didn’t know she was going through with the dinner and I already said yes to going with girlfriend to her friend’s wedding, so I can’t go to best friend’s dinner. 

Best friend said she never said it was postponed so why did I assume that she wasn’t going through with it. She said it’s hard to coordinate everyone’s schedule and everyone else is free this weekend so she hoped I would go. I said I’m sorry I assumed wrong but again I already said yes to girlfriend.

Best friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. I said thanks and promised to make it up to her and our other friends. But later that night she messaged me and said she’s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can’t get over the fact that I chose a girl I’ve been dating for a month over people I’ve been friends with for years. 

I told her I’m not choosing girlfriend over them, it’s just that girlfriend invited me to a finalized event first. Best friend said the wedding is full of people who don’t know me and won’t care if I’m there or not, while it is her birthday and the dinner is with people who’ve been friends with me for 10 years and will miss something if I’m not there. She said she’s always been there for me and the one time she asks me to be there for her I put a person I barely knew first and she doesn’t know if she can get past that. 

I tried calling and messaging her but she blocked me. We used to talk every day but she hasn’t said a word to me in three days. Our other friends don’t seem to know what’s going on and will go to her dinner as far as I can tell from our group chat. 

She’s my best friend and I don’t want her to be hurt but on the other hand I feel like she's overreacting. She knows my girlfriend is very important to me too, and even though we’ve known each other for just two months, I have very strong feelings for her and can see a future with her.

1560,Not the A-hole,"I was on my way to the train this morning and there’s a woman that has her daughter(?) drop her off every day. They double park (this is against the law) each time which causes traffic back up since they’re blocking the whole road. 

Before what comes next: I see them in various places on my commute, and they drive very slowly. Nothing against slow drivers, but people, including me, get around them because we are in a rush to get to work. 

So I decide enough is enough, and honk at them while they’re blocking the road considering the laws and the somewhat inconvenience it causes. Immediately after doing so, the woman proceeds to chase me down in my car screaming at me while I’m parking.

I get out and am immediately met with a bunch of “You’re a crazy driver” “You were riding our ass the whole way” (I only saw her on 1 street this morning within the first 5 minutes of my 20 minute commute to the train) and “You’re an asshole” statements.

It’s too early and I’m not about to just take any of it.

I always refer to him as ""the blind man"" and so do the rest of our flat mates. The reason is because one of the HUGE vans he leaves in the road is for his blind fitting business. 

So, my roommate is getting pissed that he keeps blocking her in and bumping the car. I told her to go to his house and speak to him and she went ""well I can't really say anything, it's not his fault if he's blind"" and then she went on a rant about how is he allowed to drive if he's blind? No wonder he's always wearing sunglasses, etc. 

Anyway, the other day I came outside to find her helping the man across the street. Like, she was holding his hand and the man looked utterly confused. 

Then, the next day The Blind Man reversed into her car with his van and she went outside. I went with her and she confronted the guy politely saying ""look, I know it's hard for you being blind and all but I can't afford to keep having my car bumped, you've ripped the plate off"", the man, again confused, apologised. He says, ""I'm not blind"" and she glared at me. She asks what he said and he says again that he's not blind. As she glared at me again, I pointed at his van - advertising his Venetian blinds.

1563,No A-holes here,"So I run a small residential and commercial cleaning company, and we currently have 6 full time cleaners.

We hired her on about 2 months ago unaware of her medical situation.  We have been really trying our best to work with her but so far she has called off the morning of work 5 times and requested off 2 additional days. When she calls off in the mornings it’s because she isn’t feeling well because of her chemo. The 2 call off days were because her daughter was graduation kindergarten. When she does call off she offers to work late or work weekends but people don’t want cleaners in their homes past 5 or weekends.

Now we have never said anything and we always try to work with her and reschedule her clients but this isn’t the type of business where someone not showing up isn’t a big deal. Her call offs have cost us 2 clients canceling their accounts so far, and about 12 missed one time jobs.

All of our cleaners have full schedules so we can’t just send someone else and we are completely booked out for 2 weeks so usually rescheduling these appointments isn’t possible, they just go somewhere else.

I understand her situation is bad and we said when the call offs started that we would just work with her and keep her on because of how nice she is and how good she is at the job. She always says how much she loves to work for us because we understand her situation and she feels grateful that she found us and she doesn’t worry for her job. But now we feel like it might be getting to much and costing the business to much.

I’m really at a loss and I feel like a dirtbag even thinking about it but I feel like it might be the right move

tldr: Very good new employee has cancer and calls off a lot because of chemo. Costing business a lot of money. WIBTA if I let this person go?

EDIT: This is an at-will employment state.

EDIT: We just spoke with her this morning because she called off again and I took someone advice and asked if she thought it better for her to move to a part time schedule with days after chemo off, she agreed. So we are going to see how this situation works out for now and keep her on for the foreseeable future.

1572,Not the A-hole,"In 2015 I rented an apartment for $3350 a month with a $3350 security deposit. She was a less than stellar LL often taking days to respond. She had me pay rent directly to an out of the way bank, and I was once late when he wouldn't accept a postdated check while I was away. I sent it in but was charged a $200 late fee. She never gave me an electric bill, but after the first 6 months, she sent one for $1800. I started writing my checks for $3500 so $150 would cover it. Over 4 years I helped them out by fixing things myself in order to save them the hassle and hoping my kindness would be paid forward.

As per the lease, I expressed my intent to leave within the allotted time and they accepted my notice to move by August 9th. I had it professionally cleaned with the carpets. I was told that I had to have the parking spaces cleaned for oil spots. Although there was no notice in the lease regarding this, it was easier to have it done for $100.

Upon final inspection we met, and I submitted all receipts and the keys. She mentions that there  were missed oil spots in the parking stall and it would have to be re-cleaned. She then asked me questions about damage that was there before I moved in. I explained it was on the pre-inspection checklist. There was also a stubborn stain on the carpet that didn't get out 100%. She asked me repeatedly if I had an animal and if it was urine from a dog. I politely explained I have never had any pets there.

I have moved many states away and in the last month have received many texts and e-mails asking me about a pet and describing very minimal damages. I told her I had no pets and those items were damaged prior. Of course, I cannot inspect these items now.

Last week I received a letter, saying she forgot to mention there was over $3000 of unpaid electricity and that they had to fix items they re-cleaned some things (with costs but no receipt). None of this was mentioned when we were in the apartment. There were no receipts and the estimates had no cost. Also not mentioned were my 3+ years of paying an extra $150 for electricity.

I came from a very renter friendly state and the laws are written as such. A few examples are: 1. Notice of any withheld money must be sent or delivered on or before the 14th day after expiration. 2. Any work done or money to be collected must be accompanied by receipts. 3. If there was estimated work to be done, it must have an amount.

In regard to these issues, 1. The notice was postmarked August 24th, and since the lease ended on the 9th, the 24th would be considered the 15th day. 2. No receipts were given for work done or the electricity. 3. The estimated work was left blank.

WIBTA to demand all of my deposit back? The law is clear about notice on or before the 14th day. The law allows me to sue for 3x the deposit plus court costs.

I was very pleased to have him back as we get on very well and I missed him when he initially moved out. Maybe this is my own fault, but the boy who went off to college was a sensitive quiet individual and the person who he is now is loud, reckless, arrogant, and cocky to live with. He’s changed a lot since college / the short time he was living on his own. He fights with his dad *all the time.* and only listens to me I believe because I’m pretty much like his mom. 

I know he’s young and successful and I know he’ll take time to calm down because he’s riding a high but one of the things that I just can’t get behind is him traipsing around the house practically naked (I’m talking just in his ck’s) 

I host many wine and film evenings with my friends, or book club meetings, we do frequent meet ups at my house and at the risk of sounding like a prude, my friends and I are all older women and some of our group are religious and conform to ideas of modesty. I myself don’t think it’s appropriate he wonders around naked. 

I spoke to him privately about this and he said that he gets really hot in the house because I always have the heater turned on (true, I guess) and that it’s no big deal especially since my husband does the same. The difference is, my husband won’t wonder past the the lounge where all my friends can see him, and he certainly won’t wonder into the kitchen to get a drink when we are baking etc.

I apologized and offered to stop hosting at my place but it’s convenient for most of us so they said no.

As we are neighbors, and the wedding is happening soon, I have been involved with planning and helping MoH with some details. (I live in the capital city 10months, 2 months in the 'Bride' city.)

&#x200B;

I was talking with the MoH (who I met a few days ago) and she told me she is worried about not being able to handle the alcohol during the gift recieving proccess. Apparently, there is a particular way the gifts are being recieved at the weddings here, and I was shocked to learn about it. Around 3 in the morning, the guests usually form a line at the venue, come up to the MoH and best man one by one, and announce on the mic who is giving what kind of gift to the newelyweds, and then the guest and the MoH or BM take a shot. Thing is, it is tradition to give money in the envelope, and there is not a set amount we are supposed to give, but it's usually around 200-300 euros (from my experience) or more (if the person can afford/wants to give more).

&#x200B;

I asked the MoH if she was sure they had to read the amount of money that is given, and she said yes, and even asked why not when she saw the look on my face. Now, I didn't want to say it was incredibly rude to put your guests on the spot like that, but the more I think about it, the more I'm annoyed. I don't want the amount of money me and my family are gifting to be read in front of 250 people. We are not rich by any means and even though I won't be giving less than the usual amount of money, I still feel it is disrespectful to put anyone on the blast like that. It's our gift for the bride and groom, not a gossip piece for people to talk about later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Because my sister is incredibly shy, and only me and her are going to the wedding, I will certainly have to be the one to do the wedding gift proccess. I was wondering if I could simply ask the bride or the MoH to give them the gift before or after, but also I don't want to put more preassure on the bride because she is already stressed out and the MoH seems to like the idea of that kind of gift proccess.

1578,Not the A-hole,"I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


I got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?",2120,25753,0.93
1579,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a barista at 2 coffee shops. Coffee shop A is a smaller coffee chain. Coffee shop B is a local church coffee shop. This may sound a little confusing but please just bare with me. 


I primarily work at coffee shop A. More hours, more pay, and much more business. I’ve been working there for a year now. I took on coffee shop B as a 2nd job about 4 months ago. My original hours were Monday-Thursday at shop A and Friday-Sunday at shop B. Since I’m a student, I had to give up some work days (Mondays and Wednesday’s) at coffee shop A. Coffee shop B is only open from 8-2 so it does not work with my class schedule. I figured I would get more hours if I widened my availability at coffee shop A to Friday’s and Saturday’s as well, and then I would work at coffee shop B on just Sundays. 

Well my manager at coffee shop B was not fond of the idea. He texted me in a passive aggressive tone and said “I only hired you because you said you would work Fri-Sun” (he knows I’m a student). We only have 6 staff members currently employed, so I can understand why he is frustrated. However, we only need 2 people working for the Saturday evening service (we are only open for 3 hours). And 2 of my coworkers have open Saturday availability, so I don’t understand why he only counts on me to work that day. He also throws me under the bus in the staff group chat, and makes snarky comments about limiting my availability. A coworker asked if she was the only one working on Saturday, and my manager responded with “OP can not work Saturdays, so yes you would be alone”. So basically, my manager is guilt tripping me to switching my availability back, which means ultimately means less hours for me. 

Funny thing is, he will schedule himself and then no call/no show. He does not care to show up to work sometimes. One day, he left one of my coworkers alone because “his wife didn’t want him to go to work”. I think it’s unfair how he inconveniences us but gets mad when I choose to work only one day a week.",44,73,0.91

I try to pack them something different each day and only do peanut butter once a week. It's really the only lunch my younger daughter enjoys, she kind of just tolerates other stuff. PB&J has the highest success rate of actually being eaten during their lunch break. They bring home a lot of lunches that just have couple bites eaten ...

I was actually a little concerned; I didn't want my daughter's lunch to affect someone else. After talking with her about it, it sounded like the teachers actually did a good job explaining nut allergies and safe practices.

I told him it was gross and a dick move for him to be dating this girl because I believe that she still isn't fully capable of discerning wrong from right or making the right decisions, and that if it were to get to a relationship he would basically have the control of it and her. He told me that's not the case and that he truly likes her and would like to go steady with her, however, I don't think that's enough reason to overlook the fact that according to me what he's doing is wrong and gross.

A few hours ago my wife showed me this fundraising folder for my daughter's school. I'm sure you all know the kind I'm talking about. It has a catalogue filled with overpriced useless crap, and if the student sells a certain number of items they get certain prizes.

I have always hated these fundraisers, even as a child. So I may be biased on this and would like an outside perspective on if I'd be an asshole in this situation.

One of the prizes for the fundraiser is a party bus. If the student sells like 15 items they get to go on a party bus or limo to a pizza party (or something like this).

According to my wife my 5 year old daughter came home super excited about it today and could not stop talking about this party bus.

My issue is this: My daughter is autistic. She is high functioning, especially socially, but has issues academically and cannot read yet.

 The only way she would know about this party bus or prizes in general is if someone sat down with her and explained everything to her one on one. 

I feel like they did this to get her to set her heart on this prize so she would tell us about it and go out and sell all these items for the school. Which I feel is manipulative af (I felt like the whole prize system is manipulative and gross even for people with kids not on the spectrum).

My wife and I are constantly working and we really have no friends who could buy any of the useless junk anyway.

I feel like this is a tactic used by the school(s) to guilt trip parents into buying this crap so their kids won't have their hearts crushed if they can't go.

I feel like my daughter would have been better off if she was none the wiser to the fundraiser, and now I have to worry about her heart beung broken because she can't ride the ""party bus.""

So, WIBTA if I called the school out on this, and let them know that I don't appreciate them manipulating my daughter into making my wife and I feel like shitty parents because we can't buy or sell any of their crap? Or am I just biased and should let it go and suck it up?",196,799,0.94

I'm a research student at my university and I get a $5000 technology grant every two years to be used for laptops, sensors, PCB, wiring, etc. I'm in a technical program, technically robotics but I don't really deal with hardware that much. My thesis is in music and AI.

I'm also a musician. I've been playing for 12 years and I've been using the same $400 junk guitar. I'm in dire need of an upgrade.

My local shop has had this $4000 guitar for a couple of years. I play it whenever I go in. I'm in love with it but I just never could afford it. Plus how could I explain it to my spouse? She'd never approve so I never asked.

But I can now, using my technology grant. My thesis is in instrument reproduction using neural networks. Something like you can ""clone"" what a song sounds like by recording it, thus giving you that sound whenever you play. I've been using my $400 guitar up to this point.

I *could* just keep using my old instrument, or get this new one. This is an investment, something I'd pass down to our kids. This is an ""endgame"" guitar. I'll never need another. I would use it for my work but also for myself long after I submit my thesis.

I've already talked down the price to $3000 but my spouse is not in the loop. She doesn't even know this guitar exists. I could buy it and lie and say it's $1000, for example. She'd never know.

I feel like an asshole if I do because it's a big purchase without her involvement, but it's for my work, it's my money, my hobby. I should be using it for other stuff but there's nothing else I could really use this grant on. And it's a ""spend it or lose it"" type deal.

1584,Not the A-hole,"So, long story short:

Three years ago I hurt my pinky toe by jumping into a pool wrong. I was pretty sure it was broken because it hurt like hell and was turning purple. My parents couldn’t tell if it was broken or not, and despite me asking to go to the doctor many times to check it, they just told me to wrap it next to another toe and let it heal. Their reasoning was “the doctor wouldn’t do anything but tell you to wrap it.”

Fast forward to this past month where I started having pain in the same toe again. We go to the doctor to see what’s up, and surprise surprise: it’s in pain because of that injury.

Turns out that I fractured the toe along the joint, and when it healed it pretty much fused the bones together and now I’ll have chronic toe pain for the rest of my life. The reason I’m pissed is because the doctor said if I had gone to the doctor in the first place, they could’ve put pins in to make sure it healed properly.

So, AITA for being pissed at my parents over this? From my perspective, they wanted to be cheap and now I have to suffer for the rest of my life with annoying pain.

TL;DR - Broke toe, parents didn’t want to see doctor, now I have arthritis in my toe because it healed wrong",29,41,0.91

I have a pet rabbit. My rabbit is almost 8 years and I’ve had him since he was 2 months old. I love my rabbit dearly. 

I’ve (24f) been with my boyfriend (25m) for four years. He is severely allergic to my rabbit. We don’t live together, but there have been times where he’ll sleep over and have to leave in the middle of the night because he’s wheezing too hard. 

I do what I can to minimize allergens. I regularly clean the cage, I sweep and vacuum everyday, mop frequently, do all of the laundry regularly, run an air purifier, and I restrict the rabbit’s access to certain rooms of my apartment. 

My boyfriend and I do not live together. I have my own apartment and live on my own, he lives with his parents. He’s mostly over at my place, except for during season changes when my rabbit’s coat is changing. 

After the most recent time he was at my place for the night (Friday), he is now saying he refuses to come over. I know he’s not outright telling me to re-home the bun, but it’s there. He was saying that he hates my rabbit and can’t wait for him to die so that he doesn’t have to deal with the allergies. I know he doesn’t really mean it, but I know he’d rather I didn’t have the rabbit. 

Anyway, I got frustrated and told him to shut up and that I refuse to get rid of the rabbit because I made a commitment when I adopted him to have him for his entire life. Same as any other pet. My boyfriend seemed pretty peeved and said “yeah I know” and ended the conversation and hung up.

I did not want to take them home because I was tired and did not feel like making more stops than I needed to or getting my car puked on. I told my friends this, and they were furious with me, telling me that I was selfish and an asshole for not taking these stranded drunks home.

When I pause, they usually say something like “ok, well I’m on my way” or something similar.

I feel that when I am paying a premium for delivery service, it’s reasonable for me to expect them to deliver to my door since they are the ones who chose to be delivery drivers in a big city and that parking can sometimes be tricky.

When she first mentioned it, it was like I didn’t even have a choice in the matter. She turned to my dog after he had gotten ahold of one of our couch pillows and in a dead serious tone said “That’s it, we’re taking you to the shelter.” To which I said we absolutely were not.

After awhile of arguing she said I could find a new home for him personally if it made more comfortable, but he “had to go”.  When I again told her he wasn’t going anywhere, she said that if I didn’t re home him she was going to find an apartment on her own (We could both technically afford our own place, but got one together so that we could save up money). I told her that I’m sorry she felt that way, but he was staying. 

After that, our argument turned into a huge fight. She got really upset that I would choose a dog over her and she couldn’t believe that family was worth that little to me. 

The thing is, my pets are my family. When I bring an animal home, unless it’s in that animals best interest to go somewhere else, they’re family. They stay for as long as I am able to care for them. I don’t want my sister to leave, I love her more than anything. But I don’t think it’s fair to put out my puppy because he annoys her.

My sister and I haven’t spoken since that fight, but she has complained about me to most of our family and a couple of mutual friends. Only two of them are on my side, while both of my parent, our sister and one of my best friends keep telling me what an awful person I am. I’m just really conflicted.


Edit: Okay, so I feel I need to add a bit more information based on everyone assuming that I’m just forcing my poorly behaved puppy on my sister. I’m going to elaborate a bit more, and answer some of the questions I keep getting.

I didn’t buy him or get him from a shelter, I found him on the side of the road when he was around two months old. I’m not entirely sure what breed, but my best guess is chocolate lab mix. 

I have been working on crate training pretty much since I got him, and he’s fine with it at night or when he knows I’m there. The behavioral issues only happen when he’s left alone. I take him for an hour or so run every morning, and again when I get home (if he needs it, sometimes he prefers to go slower but just need a long walk at night) to make sure he doesn’t have any excess energy. He’s extremely well behaved aside from the separation anxiety, and I’m at a loss on how to tackle the issue. I’m not opposed to going to a professional trainer, I’ve just never had an issue like this before and just thought I had to stay consistent. 

Lastly, I do not force my sister to watch him when I’m gone. I’ve offered to get a pet sitter, but she said there’s no point because she’s there most of the time I’m not anyway. I absolutely understand her not wanting to live with a destructive dog, but she never told me she had any issues with him until that night. So there wasn’t really much discussion aside from “he’s leaving”.",57,85,0.95

1601,Not the A-hole,"Well it seems like of course I’m an asshole for that, but lemme ‘splain myself. 

A few years ago I sliced open a finger because of a minor kitchen accident. The next day there was this long ass convo on my wife’s Facebook with all her friends about it, what happened, what the doc said, and all of them offering their opinions on what I should take re: pain medication. I told her to delete that shit because it’s my personal medical stuff and I deserve my privacy. 

Then after that she was at a friend’s house with a bunch of her other lady friends and came home laughing and joking because the husband who lived there just had some medical issue with his penis and was hobbling around the house sore while it heels and they all thought it was funny.

Then after that I had a fairly serious medical issue re: my testicles and come to find out she told many many people about it: her family members, her local friends, and her college friends from around the country. I was pissed when I found out, especially about the same group of friends she was with when she was mocking the other man’s penis. Worse yet, she told me that she did tell me that was all the people she told and several months later I found out she told at least one work friend also. 

Now, we are in our 40s , we have 4 kids, and we both want me to get a vasectomy. Well a few days ago I had it done but haven’t told her. I feel I deserve my privacy  and I don’t trust her to not tell people.  Part of the process is you have to go back and masturbate at the docs office and I don’t need the world knowing I have to do that. I deserve privacy and if I tell her I will lose my privacy. 

I’m not asking if this sounds like a healthy marriage. I’m not asking if I am a great communicator. I’m asking AITA?

Edit: she has never used or considered using hormonal birth control, so my omission is not making her be on it unnecessarily.

Edit: Most of what you read on the Internet about vasectomy recovery is probably mostly false. There was no bruising,  no swelling, no need for ice, minor pain for a night and that’s it.

1602,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway and changing a few minor identifying details for this, since my family knows my reddit username.

I know this might sound like a shit-post or validation post, and I have a feeling I know how this is going to go, but my husband asked me to post on here since we cannot come to an agreement on this.

For some quick background, I have had a pet cat since about 6 years before I met my husband. I love my cat. I am a huge animal person, and a softy for animals. I once cried over a Facebook post about a dog being left alone at the animal shelter after all the other dogs were adopted (To be fair, I was also like 8 months pregnant). My husband and I also got a dog together about 2 years ago. 

My husband HATES my cat. The reasons why he hates him is because...well...he's a cat. He liked to swat at my husband's feet when he's sleeping, and walk on his face and meow, which is why he's not allowed in the bedroom at night. He also has a habit of jumping on the counters and knocking stuff over (again, you know....cat stuff). He has also clawed at my husband's ankles a few times. I think at this point he's picked up on the fact that his ""step-dad"" doesn't like him, and is responding accordingly.

We recently had our first baby, and we are both extremely protective over her. (She's a newborn, we're first time parents). Sometimes when we're relaxing/watching TV, she will hang out on a baby lounger pillow on the couch next to us. 

A few weeks ago, our dog chased our cat across the house and the cat leaped over the couch to get away from him and almost landed on the baby. My husband told me that if it happened again and the cat landed on the baby, he would ""throw it against the wall.""

Now, a few weeks before this occurred, our dog did the same thing...BUT, landed on the baby partially. The dog was reprimanded and put in time out. My husband didn't witness it but was told it happened. There were no threats of violence towards the dog, but he has said if the dog ever bites the baby, he's going to the pound.

He says that his reasoning for all of this is ""if it happens once, then it will happen again."" 

I don't even know how the conversation came up again tonight, but I told him that if he ever threw my cat against the wall, or the dog, that I wouldn't want to be married to him. I'm equally concerned about the baby getting hurt, she is my priority but I just don't think physically assaulting a cat is a reasonable response to this. He disagrees.  What say you, reddit? Who is the asshole here?

We have very open relationships, they are good students, have jobs, talk to me if they are going to a party where people are drinking etc and never ever drive under the influence. I have a full time job and sometimes we don’t connect until nighttime. 

So. I love having them on location services for a couple of reasons. First of all, i don’t want to be a helicopter parent who says “where are you” all the time.

I was told I would get paid, but they (my mom and sister) never specified how much. She moved back home after this because she can't drive herself anywhere, so I started driving her and after about a week I decided to ask for a certain amount. It's about an hour drive round trip 2 times a day. That's 10 hours a week. I asked for 50 a week, or 200 a month. She makes enough that this is perfectly reasonable. I am asking for 5 dollars an hour, with super awkward hours.

  She works 4pm-12:30am. The earliest I can go to bed is 1 am when doing this. I also have to be free before hand because sometimes she wants to go to the gas station on the way to get cigarettes. I can't always take her because I try to hang out with friends or I may have plans so I have to let someone know before hand so they can get her there. They're using this against me and saying that I'm asking too much because I can't be there every single time, ignoring that fact that if for some reason nobody else can take her, I still have to be free to do it, even if it means cancelling plans. So in a month in a half, I have received 60 dollars. It's stressing me out that I have to do this still considering they refuse to agree to a set amount, so I have no clue what I'll receive if I receive anything.

The other day I was babysitting, and my sister was being really badly behaved. I just told her that if she didn't behave I would put her in the trash where she belongs.

I had to come up with a plan so that my mum wouldn't tell me off and ground me or some shit, when I didn't even want to babysit in the first place. 

I told her that she should quiet down, because the trash monster might hear her. She looked dumbfounded. I told her the trash monster eats all the trash when the bin men take the trash, and if she carries on he will get her. She very quickly got quiet and nodded, and behaved for the rest of the visit.

I thought I was in the clear, until I noticed she moved her bedroom bin into the hallway, and is carrying trash in her backpack because she is scared to go to the bin. I know if I tell her the truth, she'll tell mum, but she is obviously scared of the trash monster.

Every text ends with ""txt STOP 2end"". I have texted ""STOP"" at least a dozen times. This has been going on since 2016.

Some info about me: I'm a 20 year old male, dating an incredible 21 year old female, who I love so much. A couple days ago, I met her parents for the first time, as they had invited us over for dinner. At first it seemed nice, we were just sitting down and eating dinner like a family. I tried to be very polite, and to make a good impression on her parents.

As the night wore on, however, things took a turn for the worst. Her family started to mock her over dinner. Just subtle jabs at her like ""Not like you need any extra food"" and then looking at her and smiling and shit like that. You know, the type of quips that are *said* as jokes but mask a deeper more hurtful connotation. She laughed about it on the outside, but her normally sparky and jovial self grew quieter and quieter with each passing jab. As the night wore on, and I kept seeing how shitty they treat her, I got more and more angry.

&#x200B;

The last straw was when she told her parents that their remarks hurt, and her dad just waved her off and said ""Oh stop being so dramatic"". I then flew off the handle.  I started telling him how they were assholes for treating her that way, and she was obviously hurt, and I ended up arguing with both of them. I said that they both obviously don't realize how fucking incredible their daughter was, and that they had no right to treat her that way. I then asked her if she wanted to leave and she said yes. We stormed out together.

I didn't regret it until I spoke to my mother a few days later, who I trust very much.

I was really happy and enjoyed that gift and i've decided to make something special for her. I had 3 months until her birthday. I've started brainstorming all kind of ideas and in the end came to the conclusion: it's not about gift as a material thing, but its about emotions (cpt. obvious).  The thing is that i love all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and i was trying to make my girlfriend join the dark side. After some time she also have started to enjoy theses kind of activities, especially break rooms. So my idea for her birthday present was to make her cool city quest. In my town, there are a few companies that  organize city quest and they have only a few set quest scenarios. So i've decided to make my own super cool romantic quest. First of all i've searched for an app to make things easier, but i could not find one, so i made my own app for quest creation(putting markers on the map with description to guide my girlfriend through quest). Then i wrote a scenario. In the end quest included places of our first date, first kiss, etc. also i've added a few historical city places, it had to be fun and educational.

Three days ago the day has come. It was her birthday. I've showed her my quest-app and the quest had began. To keep thing short it was really fun, romantic and entertaining; we had a great time. It seemed that she liked it a lot. When we came home, we had a dinner, watched TV and started to prepare to go to the bed. At that moment i've noticed that my girlfriend looks sad. I've asked whats happened, but as always she said nothing, however after some time, she said that she is very upset that my gift to her was unequal to her gift to me.

I understand the struggles our teachers have getting school supplies. However if you need those supplies there are other ways to ask instead of taking such a nonsense route and hold my sons grade hostage. This has strained an already difficult relationship I have with my son. He told me I dont care about him, I dont love him since obviously i won't just go buy the stuff to help his grade. 
Sure it's a box of tissues but as any grown adult should know bribery and extortion should not be something we teach our children when it comes to problem solving.

1636,Not the A-hole,"there’s a tldr down at the bottom


so i (14F) am in middle school, and there’s this guy, we’ll call him john. john had a crush on my friend last year, and she kinda overreacted about the whole situation. this year, he likes me. so everything is fine, he tells my friend that he likes me, and to tell me that, and i politely decline his ask to date me (not allowed to date). a couple days go by we were in my second period, and he stares at me all the time. i understand that it is hard for him to know what is ok and not ok. at the end of class i tell him that it makes me uncomfortable when he looks at me. he apologizes and i get on with my day. the next day, after my second period, he asks me if my father’s name is ______ and it is, he then asks me if my middle name is ______ and it is, he asks me if my sibling’s name is ______ and it is. he then asks if i live at _______ and it is. i was pretty shaken up at this, and so i promptly left area. he says that he used facebook to look that up, but how would he get my address and middle name from that? idk kinda weird
should i report him to my second period teacher?

the reason i would think that i WBTA, is because when i asked my own friends for advice, a few said that i shouldn’t, because i’m making a big deal out of this, and he doesn’t mean to make me uncomfortable because he has autism. so idk what to do now.



TLDR: an autistic boy has a crush on me, he then recites  a lot of my personal information that i did not give him to me. WIBTA if i reported him to the teacher where this all happened?

edit: for clarification, my parent’s and sibling do both have social media/facebooks. i have reddit obviously, but i am very careful not to let anyone know who i am, or any other confidential information. my parents and sibling are both also very careful about what they post, and would never post any sensitive info about me or them. i was not the account he found, it was most likely my family.


edit 2: i’m sorry i have so many edits, but the reason i included the “last year” situation and why my friend overreacted is, because she did not handle the situation well, when john told her that he liked her, she was really weirded out and kind of cold to him because of it. she said no, and he moved on. but when i brought up my situation, my friends were thinking that i was overreacting like my friend was, because we’ve established that she did not handle it well, and they thought it was the same for me. but just wanted to clear that up too. i am not a good writer, so sorry.",98,172,0.92

He kept it hidden in his drawer for 4 days before he decided to tell me. I was furious. I can’t stand guns, I don’t feel safe around guns and my boyfriend barely knows how to use a gun. He said he bought it for “protection” and to keep us safe but I honestly don’t care and told him to get rid of it or I’m leaving.

1640,Asshole,"Never thought I would have to post on this subreddit despite reading it daily.  Very much never thought I would be posting about dildos.  Anyway, last week my best friend decided to ship 3 dildos to my house. Two were a gift to me and one for her, I guess to save on shipping she sent them all at once to me. I didn't ask why.  Anyway, her's was $60 and mine was $30 plus the free gift. I unboxed them, hid my two in my room and left her's in the discreet box inside another discreet box in my living room on a chair.  This way I could remember to give it to her when she came over (although, I guess a dildo in a box is hard to forget).

I am in the process of buying a house, and my apartment needed to be shown off to a potential client. I was under the impression new tenant wouldn't come by until days later (which would be after my friend gets her dildo) and I knew I had time to clean up and hide whatever needed to be hidden. Well, without telling me my mom's husband came over that next day and CLEANED MY APARTMENT! Without my knowledge or permission, despite knowing how much I hate it.  He moved stuff, hid stuff, threw stuff out. The boxed dildo had disappeared and I didn't realize until the next day as I was already angrily looking for some other work stuff he shoved around. My realization came after the garbage men took away my recycling.

She wants me to buy a new one, a new $60 dildo. I can't exactly ask my mom's husband about it without an embarrassing conversation.  So now, while already tight with money since it is all going to the house, I'm supposed to spend $60 on a dildo when I didn't even ask for any in the first place.  Just gave permission to have them shipped to me. Would I still be an asshole if I just offer to split it? I even offered to just give her my unopened one she got me but it isn't the size she wanted. Alas....AITA???

K guys thanks - my girl deserves her dildo compensated for! I'm going to venmo her $60 plus shipping for a new dildo of her liking and have a very serious boundary chat with my mom & her hubby.",241,1450,0.95
1641,Asshole,"So, broke up with my girlfriend last week. I discussed this with my friend, before I did it. I never broke up with someone before, and frankly, was somewhat afraid to do it.

My friend is getting married next weekend, and I'm coming. The girlfriend and I were going to go together. My friend is texting me now, and has clearly been talking with my ex, via Facebook. And the more she texts me, the more I get the feeling my ex is putting her own spin on the breakup, and my friend is taking her side. She has said things like the following:

""Maybe she doesn't like your kinda cop out that it's prompted by wedding coming up that you can't promise her marriage"" (note: one of my reasons for breaking up was that I didn't know if I could give her the wedding and marriage I think she wants. Which is true. I never said anything about my friends wedding prompting this feeling. Not once.)

""You aren't always super honest with me so this actually isn't my place""

A part of me is upset because clearly, they're conversing via Facebook about the breakup. And it infuriates me that my friend, without really reaching out to me,is making this judgement. A part of me wants to be frustrated at her.

But I also know she is getting married, and doesn't need any extra stressors. I realize that she is going through something that causes her a lot of stress. I don't want to upset her before what's supposed to be her day, but this just such a betrayal, to me.

So, would I be the asshole in this situation?

1643,Not the A-hole," 

Last week I was on my way home from work when I received a call from my wife. She told me to stop at the gas station to pick up some beer because we were having dinner at her parents house later that night.

We have a 10 month old and we were planning on both arriving at home around the same time. She had the baby and the plan was to grab the beer park at home and jump in her car to depart to her parents house.

I arrived at the gas station which is always at least moderately busy. It’s was about 5:30pm when I parked my car to walk in. I noticed there was a women outside the door with her head in a car just chatting it up with some person in the parking lot. I continued to go about my business and just grab what I needed.

It took me about 3 minutes to get my beer and get to the check out line. When I went to ring up my order the 2 cashiers said that they couldn’t cash me out because they were not old enough to scan beer. The one said give me one second and I’ll go and get the one who can ring you up.

He proceeded to go outside and talked to the woman who had her head in the car chatting with some friend or whatever. I watched him mention something to her, but she didn’t even poke her head out. He came back in and said something along the lines of “she will be in when shes done.”

Interesting I thought. Here it is 530pm and no one can ring up alcohol sales. I had my beer on the counter and said to the two under age clerks, “is that your manager?

“Yes.” They both responded.

“Is she the only one who can process this sale?” I asked.

“Yes.” They replied.

I then left my two six packs of beer on the counter and said to them, “Tell your manager she can put these six packs back in the fridge” and I walked out of the door. They both looked at me a little confused, but I hoped they relayed the message to her.

When I walked out of the store, I walked passed her and said, “there are a few items you will need to restock that I left on the counter.”

She looked at me and said, “What?”

I then started my car and drove to the gas station next door.

TL:DR - manger was to busy socializing with a friend outside, and I told her she could restock my beer.

1645,Not the A-hole,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

WIBTA if I refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? I know wedding meals are expensive, but I think this was their mistake.",2586,24362,0.95

1650,Not the A-hole,"My gf and I have a child, due to financial issues we haven’t been able to live together until now. She’s been vegan about a year, and wasn’t when we met, I have always been an omnivore and never suggested that would change. Now that we found a place, she now says that she doesn’t want to live with me if I don’t agree to go vegan. I responded with [this](https://i.imgur.com/rd4a9Ck.jpg) after my frustration reach epic levels AITA?

**Edit**: our child is being raised vegan against my wishes but in the interest of compromise I leave it alone and made sure our child eats as complete a diet as possible. 

Currently I only eat meat 2-3 days a week at most. I already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at “our” place would be limited to when she isn’t there. 

I forgot to mention I have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.

**Edit 2**: I agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.

**Update 1: we spoke and this summarized what I said:**

“Yesterday doesn’t sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you’re not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. For instance, the few times I eat or cook meat could be done when you aren’t home, I could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there’s a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. Your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, I am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you’re unable to compromise, or unwilling to. This will become a pattern, because you know I want this more than you, and you won’t have to compromise cause I’ll cave to have our family.

You have a right to state how you feel, as I do. If you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. But the lack of communication about this isn’t going to change anything. I want you and this family, but I’m not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren’t going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. “

**Addition: I feel like I should add this reply I made to a militant vegan here **

~~https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~

I replied to the wrong comment and now I can’t find it.

**Update 2:** All she’s said to me is “I’m dreaming of a future that I won’t have. “ not sure what that means but I don’t want to go down any more rabbit holes today. I think I’ll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, I’ll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. Right now I want to think about everything that’s been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what’s best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do I see with her right now.  I’ve read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. I believe there’s merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but I don’t believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. I have reading to do..

**thoughts:** I am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that’s causing me to get hate mail, I was referring to a specific subset of vegans, I would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. 

I support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. I want the same accommodation. 

Was I the asshole here? IMHO Yes in some ways I was. Is she the asshole for the ultimatum? Possibly. What I know for sure is I don’t think I’ll ever understand how this “lifestyle” and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. 

Some have called me a pushover, that may be true, but I’m trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.

I am reading most of your comments, and to those who say I’m being intolerant, I’m not, I’m seeking compromise. To those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, I agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn’t happened.",2652,11653,0.9

apologies this is quite a long story

Me, (20M), at the gym yesterday at 1pm round lunchtime. I was on the benches right in front of the huge mirrored wall using the free weights to bench, about 2/3rd of these benches were free so by no means was it packed. some older dude like 40ish comes right in front of where I was benching and reaches for the weights (not a problem weights are right in front of the mirror and I'm about 1m from the mirror on my bench). this guy picks up a dumbbell and stands literally right in front of me like at my feet and starts rowing with a dumbbell. I'm in the middle of my set and looking at myself in the mirror (normal thing to do I want to check my form, hes now in my face blocking me so I finish, 20 seconds later he finishes his set and moves back to rest on his bench, like 1 meter away and also right in front of the mirror. onto my next set and I'm maybe 4 reps into my 12 rep set and this guy comes again and starts rowing again right in front of my face. I put the weight down and look at his face in the mirror and I can tell he can tell I look pissed off. 

He does a few more reps and he doesn't realise hes being a jerk, so now when we meet eyes again I quickly look him up and down slowly while smiling, I know he can see me. he turns around after his set and i say ""nice ass, bro"" and half smile. he gives me a look of disgust picks his towel and bottle up from his bench and walks away.

I was telling my friend today about this jerk and how I messed with him a bit because he was being rude and not sticking to the unofficial gym rules. he says I purposely made him look an ass and embarrassed him and I was shitty. I argue he was being rude and it's not like I spanked him or swore at him which would make me a prick

I'm not posting in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) because we already worked through this but my wife still thinks I'm an asshole and I don't so we thought we'd let the internet decide. 

My wife has major lifestyle inflation. Always has. From the first time she got a job, whenever she'd get a raise or come into some money (tax return, bonus, etc.) she'd have it spent on “upgrades” like a new car, new apartment, designer clothes, handbags, trips, etc. We handle our finances together but everything is pretty automated. Our regular bills are on autopay, retirement and  kids' college savings, investments, charities all come out of my paycheck and go into their respective accounts. I make low to mid 6 figures and our only debt is real estate and vehicle related debt so whatever is left after all the auto accounts just goes to everyday expenses. The thing is, my wife manages to spend a lot of it. She spends thousands of dollars a month and whenever I get a bonus it is already spent. I can count on at least two bonuses a year and leading up to that my wife is already planning a kitchen remodel, big trip, landscaping, etc. Whenever I get a raise, she wants to ""upgrade"" the vehicles. Right now she has her eye on a Range Rover (because its somehow better than her Audi and my Volvo). Sometimes, it is small lifestyle inflation- like she does those Stitch Fix boxes for herself, our 3 children, and me (although I asked her to cancel mine and until my deception was found out she hadn't- just kept the clothes she liked for me and put them in my closet). At some point she started doing weekly massages, monthly facials, belongs to three gyms, the list goes on.  

We would discuss this spending issue but since we can afford it, there was really no leg for me to stand on. I just felt like it was unnecessary spending but couldn't tell her what else we should be doing with the money. About 8 months ago I went to a conference, obtained a new skill and my practice gave me a significant raise because I was the only one who could do this in our office. I did not tell my wife. I just adjusted my paycheck so the exact amount of the raise would now go into a separate savings account (my wife has access to this account but doesn't monitor it). The money accumulated and it felt good and I could start clearly why I liked not spending everything and started thinking that if we cut back on spending I could retire 5-10 years early, we could buy rental properties, or pay off our mortgage. Couple weeks ago my wife requested a copy of my paycheck from our office manager to verify income for something, and saw the net amount didn't match the amount that was being deposited. I came clean, we fought, we talked to our therapist, we came to an understanding, all is good. Except she still thinks I'm an asshole for hiding the raise from her. I think I was not an asshole because I had no ill will and wasn't putting it in a place where she didn't have access to.",837,4812,0.97

I (19f) enjoy going to bars with friends, I love the dancing and playing pool. But I don't drink alcohol. Some of my friends have pushed me a bit to try it in the past, saying that I would be 'more fun' (I took some offence to that) if I had a few drinks. Most of them are okay with it now though. 

But a few times people who I've chatted with in the bar have gotten me drinks, and have taken super offence to me not accepting them. I've been told that I should just drink it to be polite, or that I shouldn't be in a bar if I don't drink. Bugging me about 'just giving me one good reason why I don't drink.' 

Plus just in general conversation (usually in bars, not always) people can get exceedingly pushy about wanting to know why, as if it's some strange thing. No one bugs me about not smoking cigarettes, but alcohol seems to be some weird thing when you say no. 

So if they keep pushing for an answer I give them one, usually in a sad backstory form. Because I don't want to share the real reason, and some people just won't take no for an answer.

Normally in my company (Fairly small), we have to give 1-2 months notice (simply submit a form to the office) of a week of vacation, because this was very short notice, I decided to ask my boss upfront if it was okay to take the vacation. I figured this was the right thing to do given the short notice of the vacation.

When I had asked him if it was okay and would work with the schedule ahead, he agreed. I asked once more if it was 100% okay and that I would totally understand if I could not. He still agreed. Given that, I went and booked a flight, and hotels for my vacation. 

Now, 3 days before I’m suppose to leave, he says I might need to work the week I was told I could take off. I called him and said I can’t, all the flights are booked and all the hotels are booked and I cannot cancel it without losing my money.

Originally I was planning to work with 3 of my friends (2 of which were twin sisters) and the other was my best friend however the sisters had a family emergency that they had to miss school for a week for so it was just me and my best friend left. Therefore there was 2 empty slots in our group that to my utter dismay were taken by 2 obnoxious, bratty people but one of them moved groups like 10 minutes later. We had 3 people so we were already at a disadvantage. We had to write repprts on 16 different elements in the periodic table and each report had to be at least 1 page long. I said I would do 6 and so did my best friend so the other person had 4. They promised they would do it. It had to be handwritten btw.

I wrote my 6 reports that ended up being 2/3 pages each and my friend did his work, by the 3rd day (we had 7 days). Our other group member hadnt done his work yet but no big deal we still had time.

Also, the twins sent me 2 of the reports over discord and apologised and said they really couldn't do anymore and that I would have to handwrite it. So me and my best friend hand wrote one of the twins' reports each. This other guy had 2 reports to do and we told him that in person. By the 6th day he hadnt done it and he told me this at 6pm the day before it was due. His excuse? He forgot. What the actual fuck. Okay, fuck this guy I did all the work he should have done (my best friend didn't have time that day so he asked me to do them both and i didnt have a problem with that as he had already written 7 of them).

So i did it and me and my best friend handed it in. We informed the teacher how our other teammate had done nothing and showed him the texts and showed how none of their handwriting was anywhere to be soon. Luckily our group member didnt try to lie. We got an A on the project and so did my best friend AND SO DID THAT LAZY IDIOT THAT DID NO WORK. I complained to the teacher but he said he couldn't do anything about it even though he knew what happened.

Then this idiot started bragging about getting an A and me and my best friend were fuming.

Angrily, I went on twitter (where literally everyone in the school had each other added) and posted how he didnt do any of the work but how he got an excellent grade, and how people should try to avoid working with him as he was lazy and tries to tske credit. And I linked screenshots showing he admitted doing none of the work where he says he forgot.

Everyone starting replying saying ""spill the tea"", ""exposed"", ""how awful"", and stuff like that.

He immediately defended himself calling me a liar, and I am lying to which people just sent him the screenshots I  linked.

AITA for outing him or was it justified as I was not lying?",43,109,0.95

1670,No A-holes here,"I am very good friends with one of my coworkers. He's the person I go to if I'm having a bad day or need someone to vent to. He's a really good guy.

However, his love language is acts of service/gifts. He'll surprise me by bringing in snacks for me or bringing in food he made me for lunch.

Most people would find this super sweet, but I find it annoying. I have my own meals planned out and me having to politely eat what he makes me kind of ruins my plans (also it takes all control away from me, I no longer get to decide what I want to eat that day). Today, I can't go out and get chinese with my coworkers because he brought me in some pasta he made me, and so I am going to politely sit here and eat it and say thanks. 

I've tried to politely hint that I don't like it when he brings me in things, but I don't know how to get it across to him without being incredibly rude.

1673,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday was my 27th birthday, and it kind of sucked. Work was good, and I came home in a good mood. My boyfriend told me a month ago that he had a big surprise for me. I was so excited. He put his hands over my eyes and took me to the garage. He showed me a new surf rack he got, which was nice, but I already have one and don’t need another one. All of my boards fit on the rack I already have, except for one. It’s usually propped up against the wall. After he showed me the rack (which is super flimsy and I honestly don't even trust it to hold my boards- multiple reviews say that it breaks immediately) he then pointed to a pile of my stuff and told me I needed to clean it up and get it out of the garage. I felt really horrible. I felt like he got me the rack as a message to get my shit out of his way. (We talked later and that wasn't his intention, but it made me feel bad in the moment.) A few minutes later I was getting in my car to take my dogs for a walk, and my boyfriend came over and said, ""Sorry we didn't do a trip or anything."" I hadn't thought about it, but our main group of friends have all gone on trips together for everyone else's birthday except mine. We went to New York for the last one, we have a trip coming up to the mountains for the next person's birthday, and I'm taking my BF to Colorado for his birthday. It just kind of added to the feeling that my birthday isn't as important as everyone else's. Then, this florist called and asked if I could take a delivery. So backstory; my mom is a unique person. She can be extremely self centered. As a child, she would give me gifts I explicitly asked her not to get me. She would get me presents that were actually things that she wanted and she would even keep them sometimes. I don’t understand it. She sends me flowers for every birthday. I have politely told her many, many times after the fact that I appreciate her sending me flowers, but that I do not like flowers so please do not send them. She spends at least $100 on each bouquet of flowers so it’s a ton of money wasted. Well anyway, I went out in the driveway to meet the florist. They handed me a balloon and a vase full of flowers. I waited until they drove away at least, then I smashed that fucking vase all over my driveway. I just felt hurt from earlier with my boyfriend, and then angry that my mom once again chooses to ignore what I say and wastes her money on flowers. I understand that she thinks she's being nice, but it feels like a slap in the face that after all these years, she refuses to listen to me.

She's now asking me to send her a picture of the flowers. I don't know what to say to her. It seems useless to tell her that I don't like flowers.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to be clear, this is not about the gifts. I thanked them both and I appreciate that they took the time to get me things, but it seemed to me like the thought behind them were not really for me.

Also, I know I need to work on my anger. I have bipolar disorder and sometimes it gets out of control. I don't know what to do about it. If anyone has tips for dealing with sudden anger, I would truly appreciate it.

1675,Asshole,"I'm a female university student. I signed up for my university's voluntary language exchange program. You get paired up with an exchange student who speaks the language you want to practice, and that person will be able to learn the local language from you. I'm learning Spanish and my pair turned out to be a Latin American exchange student, let's call him Diego.

We meet up for coffee near campus, we're talking about our language learning goals, how often our schedules would allow us to meet up to practice etc. After no longer than about 15 minutes, he tells me very sternly: ""I want to let you know that I'm only looking to make a new friend and learn a new language. Only friendship, no romance."" I am confused as can be but I manage to say: ""Sure, that works great, that's exactly what I'm looking for, too."" One would think that it was just a cheeky joke he tried to make, but I assure you he was very serious when he said it.

We were at the coffee shop for an hour but I just felt awkward about the bizarre ""no romance"" speech he had given me. I have a boyfriend I've been with for 4 years and I truly am not ""looking for anything"". I wondered if I had been acting interested or flirtatious, but I can't see how. I don't think I'm ""overly friendly"", I'm a little bit quiet and I feel like you would have to use a lot of imagination to think that I'm flirting with you when I'm not.

I'm supposed to message Diego later this week so we can arrange our next meeting, but I'm having cold feet about agreeing to be his language partner. He basically told me to ""not try anything"" 15 minutes after meeting me, and I think that's really strange behaviour when I certainly wasn't ""trying anything"". I feel uncomfortable with this guy and it is allowed to request a new partner if it doesn't work out with the first one. On the other hand, am I just being too sensitive? He might be overly confident but that doesn't mean that he can't be a nice guy and a good friend in other ways. And being a foreigner in a country where he doesn't speak the language, I'm sure he could use a friend.

AITA for considering requesting a new language exchange partner because of this?",42,53,0.89
1676,Not the A-hole,"Quick background info: I drink maybe 3-5 times a year, have a history of alcoholism in the family so I have to be more careful than others. I also have pretty bad social anxiety, and I do NOT drink normally to deal with it.

&#x200B;

Last weekend, I was invited to go to an event with my(33f) boyfriends(35m) family. I like his family, but I still have trouble getting along/relating to them. They are very different than my own family, and I still have no idea how to act around them. The event in question was an outdoor festival. Something, I would never ever attend on my own. I wasn't exactly looking forward to it, but none the less I was invited and my boyfriend really wanted me to go. I was afraid of ruining it, and saying something I shouldn’t. This tends to be a bad habit of mine, not knowing my audience and trying too hard. I knew this festival was important to them. So I did what I thought was the smart choice. I borrowed my brothers flask, and drank (not driving) on the way down. Boyfriend knew and didn't have a problem with it, and it legit did help me a lot. It calmed my nerves and it made the festival more bearable than it would have been. Comments were made, I've heard, along the lines of ""she seemed to have a lot of fun"" and ""I knew if she could just FIND A WAY to relax she'd have a good time""

However, then yesterday they found out I was drunk all day. I'm pretty sure the culprit is the aunt, who was next to me for some parts and saw me drink. I wasn't hiding it by any means (alcohol was permitted, but his family doesn't drink, because they just don't, not for a particular reason). But I certainly wasn't announcing ""HEY I'M WASTED"" Now, apparently (being told through a 3rd party) that they think I'm a drunk, and they are offended I had to drink to get through the event. They are saying some pretty hurtful things behind my back. My boyfriend, in an attempt to stand up for me, made it worse. By pointing out, they themselves said ""if she could find a way to relax"", and I did, it just happened to be alcohol. Which is, I think, where the comments about me being a drunk come from. I've since told this 3rd party, that I'm an adult, and if I want to drink that's my business, and they were fine with me before they knew, so I'm not too worried about it to be honest. I thought for sure 3rd party would agree, but they said I should apologize for upsetting them, and promise not to drink in the future. I have not responded to this last message. The most I'm willing to do is a half assed ""Sorry you were offended by my choice of beverages"" but I think that will just make it worse. I also will not promise to drink again, because I shouldn't have to, and I will do what I need to too make myself comfortable. BF is torn as well, he is exactly in the middle, and can see both sides and said he supports whatever I decide to do. So was I the asshole for drinking at a family (yet public) event?

EDIT:

OKAY looks like it's time for an edit. Most of you seem to have read this as is, and understood what I was saying. Many haven't. I'd like to reiterate, I did NOT bring alcohol and drink because I can only be around them when I am drunk. I was not, at any point, saying ""I can't stand these people, I have to be drunk"" I've been with my boyfriend for several years. I have spent MANY weekends/days with them without ever turning to alcohol, (a lot of you missed the first sentence, I DO NOT use alcohol to cope with social anxiety). I brought the flask for many reasons: 1. This  was not the usual 4-6 person gathering, but 15 or so people most of whom I feel awkward around. 2. I do not enjoy group functions of any kind 3. I do not enjoy outdoor (or indoor really) festivals, I don't like crowds and I REALLY don't like the type of event it was (think a church social and you are an atheist, and before anyone jumps down my throat it was NOT religious just using it as an example) 4. it was TWELVE hours long. So I brought alcohol to make the day somewhat enjoyable because I was afraid of saying something snotty when I meant to make a joke (I have done this before around them) and Saturday was a big thing for them so I didn't want to ruin it. I thought if I could ease up on myself then I wouldn't be prone to trying to hard and making stupid jokes.

&#x200B;

Also to add: I was not falling down drunk, I kept a steady buzz throughout the day, as far as I know only one person noticed because they saw me take the flask out, which is who I am thinking told the parents. The parents were 100% fine with me the day of, it wasn't until someone pointed out to them I had been drinking the whole day that they got upset. They were RIGHT to get upset, I 100% understand that. My issue I was asking about was: I'm not apologizing and promising not to drink because of a conversation I wasn't apart of, and because someone ELSE made them feel like I had to be drunk around them. A few people made several good points about why it would bother them, and I'm taking that into consideration when I plan out my next step. Hopefully this clarify some of the questions.",193,552,0.95
1677,Asshole,"So this just happened in science class. In science we stand or sit on stools at each table. Anyway a girl a kinda know named “Jane” was in front of my table of four guys. 

She comes in late and I notice that her skirt is caught up on her backpack. Basically it’s holding it flipped up with her butt to the world. 

Class is about 45min long and the other three guys are basically looking the whole time making comments. 

I tell Jane after class and she turns red and gets upset and asks why I didn’t tell her sooner. And accused me of being a perv. 

I didn’t tell her earlier Bc I didn’t wanna get in trouble with the teacher.

Edit: 
This teacher is very strict. People get in trouble for asking to borrow a pencil.

1678,Asshole,"Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.

I have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).

Around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.

John was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.

Here's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. 

Matt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.

To this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.

My parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.

Matt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.

Am I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? 

Matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.

I can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.

But I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?

My poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.

But I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. I also worry about his mental health.

There also the innocent child in this. He deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.

I have recently been visiting Matt and his family. They are clearly struggling with the isolation. His wife broke down and apologized as I held my nephew for the first time. My heart tore in two.

1679,Not the A-hole,"So I (m 28) was asked by my grandpa to wire and install pretty much everything in this new house he was building for my uncle. They were trying to save money and do it all for as cheap as possible. I am no longer an electrician but I had nearly 3 years under my belt and had reached journeyman level before I decided to change careers. 

The offer was that I would be given all my meals for free, but I had to drive 4 hours every friday, work till I needed to go back on sunday and do this every weekend until I was done. 

I dont have that great a relationship with my family anyway and my grandpa even less than others. When told that this was going to happen (no I was not ask if I wanted to or even would do it) I did my best to reply without flat out telling him no because he will freak out. Well he did anyway, going on a rant about how it was being built on his land and that it was part of my inheritance when he dies and I better work on it if I wanted it.

When I ask my mom about it and what I should do, she just shook her head and told me it's up to you.

I'm pretty sure hes found someone else to do it for cheap, but no permits have been filed for, all the wood was cut in my grandpa's ancient water powered sawmill from the 1800s that his grandpa used, and most of the other materials were bought second hand.

They love to tell me how hard it is for them especially since I'm not helping them and costing them money.

1680,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend's family are super straight-edge, upper middle class, conservative types. This has rubbed off on my girlfriend as well, and I am totally down with that. However, her little sister is starting to break from the mold a bit. The past 6 months or so she's begun dressing a tad more out-there, dark clothes and makeup, and ""Satanic"" jewelry. As far as I can tell it's just pointy metal things, but the S-word has been thrown around by my girlfriend and her parents.

Deep down I think she for the most part looks ridiculous, it's not something I would ever choose to wear, but I think it's kind of cool that she's fronting up to her parents a bit. So, I've been chucking a few compliments her way. Nothing major or often, but I'll compliment her shirt or something occasionally, and I'll defend her when everyone else is crapping on her.

Needless to say, nobody is appreciating my white-knighting except the princess of darkness herself, and ""don't encourage her"" is becoming a regular phrase said to me. If I was just complimenting her to be nice I would obviously not be an asshole, and I am partly doing it to be nice, but I'm also doing it because I think her parents deserve a bit of a rebellion. I like seeing them get challenged on some of their crazier ideas about morality. I'm hesitant to call it entertaining to me, but I think that would be an accurate descriptor.

I also have a partner of 7 years (M34). We don't live together yet for career reasons, but he spends every weekend at my place. He plays with my nephew a lot in that time, so much so that George has started calling him uncle just like me.

1682,Everyone Sucks,"My sister got involved with a guy who was no winner. But to be honest, neither was she. After the ""honeymoon"" phase of their relationship ended and he started cheating on her, she became pregnant. There is no doubt that this was on purpose because a baby always fixes things, right?
The guy tried to stay with her, but it was not happily ever after enough for her so she left him and took their baby with her. She fought tooth and nail to keep him away from his son. All of a sudden he was some kind of monster. Was he a loser? Yes. A monster? No. Keeping his son away was her bizarre way of punishing him for not making her happy. 
They went to court and the dude got a raw deal. Basically became an every other weekend dad and even then my sister made it hard for him. It became such a toxic situation that he just stayed away and became the birthday card dad. He married and has kids of his own and seems to be a really good dad.
My nephew is now 9 and my sister plays up the single mom victim card every chance she gets. Her narrative is that her boyfriend ""got"" her pregnant and ""basically"" abandoned her and made no effort to be a part of his son's life. It's a role that I see a lot of single moms with the same story play up. 
Well she went on on social media about how hard it is to raise a ""fatherless"" boy and how awful it feels to be abandoned but she's doing just fine. She compared herself to widows who lost their beloved husbands to cancer or war. Then pictures of her and her son smiling. Uh, no you're not. Your son has issues. He's been emasculated. He gets picked on at school because he's too sensitive. He's never had a dad teach him about being rough and tumble. He's not even a Mama's boy. He has emotional issues. 
So I corrected her on social media. I told her that my nephew's father was an ass but she's not that much better. She was the one who did not want him in the picture and she got what she wanted. It's been almost 10 years and she needed to grow up. Her son's father is the one who's solidly married and coaching his kids sports teams and your the one with two kids by two different dads (the other baby daddy is a crazy war vet... another story).

I have this friend, we're pretty close. She is in her mid twenties, pretty, good personality, full time job, own car and own apartment. Basically she lacks nothing expect the love of her life. And the lack of love in her life is what's currently making her very depressed. She had a boyfriend for 4 years, but it didn't work out. She always tell me how she didn't get why she had to meet him and eventually break off and what a waste of time it was. She is really desperate being with someone and had tried tinder a few times, but none of them wanted something serious. Her sister got married recently which made her more depressed, because she feels all alone. Most of our conversation revolve around how upset she is, why she can't meet someone, her job sucks, why she have to be so unlucky and so on. I tried helping her a lot, giving her advice, try to tell her there's still many good thing in her life, but it doesn't seem to help. I really don't know what to say anymore, I tried saying everything that's helpful but it's like I've run out of things to say so it's kind of awkward. She has an appointment with a doctor soon, so hopefully it would help. 

The thing is I've begun feeling it's a bit burdensome to be around her. It's kind of watching well-off people constantly moaning about how life sucks even though they have it better than most people.

I've always been someone who likes to help people in a game and if someone wants to add me to play with me then I'm usually cool with that. Fast forward to today a girl in our game said I played quite well and she asked if she could add me to tag along for a few games before she had to leave to which I said sure.

My girlfriend was also playing with me at the time and she said that she didn't want me to add the girl to my friends list or play with her, to which I responded then I want you to remove every guy you have added and only keep the females and stop talking to guys in game.

She didn't like that I said this and she said I was being completely unreasonable and that I didn't trust her. She then proceeded to delete everyone and stay super mad with me and make it seem like I was out of order for asking her to do this.

She’s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she’ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don’t feel as though it’s my responsibility.. AITA?

EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he’d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she’d be able to spend time with him. It wasn’t just ‘babysitting’ but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as ‘payment’ for watching my son. Every other time she’d had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",5109,20522,0.88
1697,Everyone Sucks,"I'm not a child psychologist or anything and I come from a very competitive family. My dad had no mercy when it came to Monopoly, chess, and especially bowling. In fact, we still have an annual tournament when we're all together with a trophy and everything -- one which I've never won in the last 25 years or so.

I've grown to be a mom who let's my 6-year-old win at all the games. I think it's a confidence builder and will encourage him to play again and again until he wins on his own (he can get to ""check"" in chess now on his own, but I need to be pretty negligent to get him to checkmate). 

My husband, however, is ruthless. He will fire a football so far and fast that our little guy is basically playing fetch. He even plays Don't Break the Ice like it's a world championship. Fun trivia questions at dinner have turned into The Chase and Husband is The Beast (Google ""The Chase UK"" if you don't know).

We both grew up in opposite households where I was pushed by my parents in any and all competitions and he needed to be self-sufficient by 11. Husband thinks pushing his small child now will be character-building, while I think he's only 6! Throw him a bone! Stop being such a butthead. In fact, I think his competitiveness has put me in the other extreme, where I now applaud the most inane achievements -- ""Oh my goodness, little Billy! You moved a checker piece! AMAZING!""

So, AITA and setting my impressionable child up for great disappointment in the future, or my husband, who will decapitate someone with a football before conceding defeat?

INFO: our child doesn't doesn't ALWAYS win, as explained in the original post, he loses quite often to his dad. I think a lot of people are assuming I'm the main caretaker, hence why he would throw tantrums if he always won. However, my husband is a stay-at-home dad and I'm the working parent. Therefore, our son is 75% more likely to lose a game than win. However, I wrote somewhere below that out son is a very graceful loser and was stoked about archery despite being awful at it.

(EDIT: I wrote ""however"" twice in that paragraph. I'm so, so sorry. So very sorry.)

Also, my husband is not mean or nasty. They have other hobbies they share, building skills outside of competitions, because our lives are much bigger than a Reddit post. This is a snapshot of a single issue.

Update: I like a lot of the suggestions here and will take all of them to heart. The ones that stand out the most are to play games that are more lucky, as well as coaching him as we go though certain games so he can eventually trounce his father.",267,694,0.95

1700,Not the A-hole,"Backstory, 
My Mom is extremely opinionated and when I bought my wedding dress I did so without showing her or anyone in my immediate family. It was too big and needed work done before I showed anyone so I took it to be altered and the seamstress made some alterations that I didn’t approve of and kind of ruined the vibe of the dress for me. 
I sent a picture to my Mom and my sister who HATED IT. Didn’t have a single nice thing to say about it and insisted I find a new dress before my wedding in 30 days. 
I should mention that I’m not the biggest fan of the dress - the alterations sort of ruin it for me, but since my Grandmother did them and she is my best friend I’m going to wear it anyways (she also said she would beat me senseless if I didn’t wear it so.....) 
Anyways, I went to David’s Bridal and tried on a short dress which was $200 and was cute but gave me the same “meh” feeling as every other white dress I’ve tried on (my dress is pink) and my mom thought it was amazing. 
After some careful thought I’ve decided it isn’t worth shelling out more money for another dress I don’t feel wow about. 
Well now my mom is saying I’m being selfish and cheap (I have the money for it, I just don’t want to put more money into something else) and all around just being horrible. 
I feel obligated now to go back and buy that dress. And my pink dress. 
AITA for not wanting to have to buy another dress?

I (23M) valet cars at a hotel as a side job and typically a guest’s first encounter at the hotel is with valet. A woman pulls up onto our drive at a speed that indicates she’s in a hurry. Sure enough, before I could open her door she opens the door herself and firmly tells me she is TWO hours late for her convention and needs to quickly check in, but not valet her car. 

The woman fast walks into the hotel and storms back out. With a raised voice she asks me where’s check in. I told her the second floor. In an even louder voice she asks how to get to the second floor. I told her the stairs. Her eyes widen and she sternly says DON’T BE A SMARTASS. She complains to the front desk staff saying I should be fired. 

Keep in mind she’s in a hurry so the stairs are a better option than the elevator. Keep in mind the stairs are the first thing you see when entering the hotel. And for the sake of common sense, 2nd levels anywhere are generally attained by the stairs or elevators.

1703,Not the A-hole,"\[Before I start, this is a throwaway account that was made for this post because I don't want family or friends relating this back to me\]

So that title alone is gonna make it sound terrible, but hear me out.Long story short,  I am 29 years old and my sister is 35, and in my entire life she has never given me a reason to believe that I can trust her to give something important back to me.

Now with more detail; Not too long ago, my sister \[who lives in a different state and whom I see MAYBE twice a year\] found out that I still have our late grandfather's dog tags and she called and asked me to bring them for her wedding. I just recently moved and in that time, they've been put away somewhere safe, but I don't remember exactly where they are. When I told her this, she told me to look for them and bring them if I find them.

That said, there have been many times in my life when my sister has 'borrowed' things from me, and then never given them back. I would always get excuses when I asked for them back, and promises that I would eventually! But it never happened. They were mostly things like movies or clothes or little things that can be replaced, but I did still have to replace them myself and I've never gotten an apology or anything. It's made me wary of lending any of my things to anyone at all because I'm afraid I won't ever get them back.

But I digress. I didn't get a concrete reason why she needs the dogtags before our call ended, but honestly \[and I hate to say this\] I really do not trust her at all. I'm afraid that like so many times before, she will find reason after reason to not give them back to me. If it were something replaceable, I would be a little less wary? But these are important, and if anything happened to them I don't know what I'd do.

I think that I'm going to 'don't and say I did' try to find them. I know it's something she wants for her wedding for whatever reason, but straight up I have trust issues and I just can't bring myself to do it.

I decided to let her borrow them for the duration of her wedding. They were placed in her wedding bouquet along with a ring from our other grandfather who passed.

1706,Asshole,"So to set the scene. My friends and I are talking about how one if my friends, Daniel, is trying to apply for a dance program but he misses the age cut off by a year. My friend Aaron tells him to apply anyways and then in person tell them he is not the right age when they are watching his recitals; he is older than the cut off by a year.

I interject, people lie all the time, and tell them about how I applied for a scholarship for left-handed people in the last year of high school (to be used in college) and won.

Aaron and Niall get extremely angry, as they are both left handed and think that I took the money away from ""someone who was actually deserving and fit all the requirements"" (Aaron's words).

I ask them how this is any different from them telling our friend to apply to this dance program even though he doesn't make the age cut off. 

Aaron insists that it is different as he never told Daniel to lie and said that he told him to ask if he (Daniel) could try out and perform even though he doesn't meet the qualifications as Daniel looks very young. I remind them that Daniel said you have to put your birthday in the application and that you have to show ID matching the information on the application when you go to try out.

Aaron then said that Daniel can still contact the people in charge of the program to ask if they would be able to bend the rules or he could fill out his birthday as 12/30/XY and then write in the ""additional comments"" section ""My birthday is actually on 12/30/XX and I'm only two days older than the oldest student you would allow to try out.""

I said that I see both situations as comparable since we both didn't meet the qualifications but applied anyways. Aaron and Niall disagree. Aaron has  done gotten it in his heads that what I did is just as bad as the people who are less than 2% Native American claiming that they are Native American for extra scholarships and an easier time getting accepting into prestigious universities. Niall thinks what I did is even worse because those people are still ""technically"" Native American and I'm not left handed at all.

I think they're overreacting because pretending to be a race is not the same thing as pretending to write with a different hand. Also, they're both still encouraging Daniel to apply to the dance program when he doesn't meet the qualifications just like I didn't meet the scholarship qualifications. 

Can I really be the asshole about this when this happened two years ago? The money is long gone and the people who ran the scholarship never forced me to do a handwriting exam in front of them proving that I was left handed.",63,38,0.71
1707,Not the A-hole,"I accidentally broke my phone at the beginning of summer and have gone without it since. Recently, I've discovered that it's super inconvenient to not have one. I walk home everyday and there are some times that I've missed appointments due to the fact that I have no phone for my parents to call when they need to tell me. Also, because I sometimes have to walk home later due to my extracurriculars in school, it's just unsafe for me to not carry around communication.

I've started asking my dad to get me a phone (I have no source of income, they won't let me get a job), which he refused. I offered to buy myself a phone with my own money (a used IPhone around $600) that I've saved up. He also refused. Instead, he insists that I carry around his tablet incase I need to text him at school. It's not a huge one, but it's not as small and portable as a phone. Around the size of an IPad. 

I explained to him that I need to connect to WiFi to even use it, and school WiFi isn't very reliable. It would add more weight to my already loaded bag, and plus it's just kinda weird to carry around a tablet when I could easily get myself another one. 

When I told him this, he called me ungrateful and told me that if I bought one without him knowing about it first, he would take it away and wouldn't let me use it. I can't argue with him about this anymore because tbh, he's kinda hard to talk to and he just repeats the fact that I could just take the tablet to school.

I get my guest to my room, the room is locked all the time and there are minimal interactions with the shared place (no long hours of cooking or in the bathroom). It started good with my roommate, I close my door while they are here to leave the freedom to move without me having an eye on everything. However, recently things changed, me closing the door meant for them: you are free to use the place while I am locked here waiting for them to finish. It started getting uncomfortable for me waiting for their long hours of cooking to make my tea or have a snack from the fridge, or use the washroom while they are having a meal right next to the door.

I changed my policy and decided to leave my door open and not wait for them to finish but just get what I need and be back while they are there. It didn't change much since them cooking for 4 hours meant 4 hours of chaos in the kitchen and not a lot of stuff you can do there, and I was slowly loosing access to the shared place while she's here (everyday). It started all affecting the way I am leaving here and decided to come up with something stronger.

I started being topless in the place all the time, it started being disturbing for her, they limited their access to the shared place and I got what I wanted (gaining access back to the shared place).

We never discussed rules about overnight guests and it's mostly been us staying somewhere else. If the there is a guest, it'll be a one off kinda thing.

However, one part that I've been dreading about what should be the happiest day of life is facing my finace's brother and nephew. Throughout the entirety of my relationship my fiance's brother and sister-in-law (brother's wife) has treated me like dirt by spreading nasty rumors to other members of the family and constantly insinuating that I mean nothing to my then boyfriend because I am just simply ""another girl in his life."" After some time my fiance did distance himself from his brother. He basically told him that he would not accept this sort of treatment toward me and if he couldn't act like a decent human then he didnt want him in our life. However, my fiance is extremely close to his nephew and would do ANYTHING for him. They are only 6 years apart (him and his brother are 15 years apart) but when things got rough his nephew was quick to throw me under the bus and say nasty things about me to his parents. This happened about 2 years ago and I have yet to receive an in person apology. The only apology that I have received was because my fiance told his nephew he needed to say something to me. The resentment and anger has only grown to the point where if I even think about the situation I start to shake in anger. I have no desire to become friends with the nephew again and I dont believe at this point there is anything he could say to change my opinion about him. So am I the asshole for not wanting either of these people at my wedding despite how much my fiance loves his nephew? what is the compromise that I should make in this situation?

1716,Asshole,"I'm 27 and in late 2017 I got married to a man two years older than me. He has two daughters who are now 8 and 6. Once I married their dad, they started calling me mommy, and I've been one to them ever since.

As for their biological mother, she left them with their dad, when the oldest was 5 and and the youngest 3. The younger doesn't remember her and assumes I birthed her, but the oldest does, and obviously has mommy issues over it. I've always assured her that I am her true mother and that I won't leave her.

As you can guess, I'm not too fond of their biological mother, and neither is my husband. She lives all the way across the country, and called me last July out of the blue to ""thank"" me for doing the job she never ""could"". She asked to speak to her daughters and I said no.

We've been talking more cordially since then, and last week she spoke to both of her daughters. They were confused but somewhat grasped what was going on. She promised to call them the next day, and she never did, which pissed me off.

Ever since then I've been ignoring her calls but finally answered today. She announced that she is coming to our state next week for some friends wedding, and is in interested seeing ""her"" daughters.

I barely feel comfortable with her speaking to them on the phone, let alone letting her spend time with them. So I said no.

So their biological mom called my husband and complained about how bitchy I've been to her, and to my absolute shock, my husband sided with her and said I've been unnecessarily rude to her.

1718,Not the A-hole,"Background: I am 16, my mother just found her biological father last year, and he's finally shown up to meet her and my family.

My mother was adopted and always struggled to find family. She's spent most of her life and almost all of mine searching for people she was related to. She found her birth mother before I was born, but her birth mom refused to tell her who the birth father was and left some vague hints for us to go by after she passed.

After a DNA search, we found her birth father almost a year ago. It was really hard for me to process as a 15 year old that assumed my mom had no biological family alive or known. They had the parent-child reunion and things seemed fine.  I always felt a little off being around him, especially when he said he has ""no regrets in his life"", but I did my best to shrug it off. *He is family after all.* but a few days into his stay, he began to show more of his ""true colors"".   
He repeated his stories, which wasn't bad, except for the fact the details were beginning to change bit by bit. The first time he told his story he said he never knew my mom's birth mother was pregnant, but later said he might've known. 

We moved past the fact he was lying just to him getting into fights with my dad about things they were having casual conversation about. My dad is a very level headed person and the first time my grandpa got shitty, my dad talked things out and was willing to make amends. It happened a second time. My dad had to leave his own house because of my entitled grandpa. Later when my grandpa went back to his hotel, my dad finally went off about how he was disrespected by basically a stranger and about how he abandoned my mother and how it led up to her having to suffer with the pain of being  adopted. And I agree with my dad 100% on this. But at the same time I know to an extent it does hurt my mother that I'm not fond of her dad. Also it isn't that cool to hate your family according to social standards

1723,Asshole,"My wife and I (34M, 36F) have been a couple since I was 19 and were married when I was 21. She has always been on the bigger side but I appreciated her body, and she liked me (and still likes me) as someone who's willing to overlook her weight and tell her that she's still beautiful. We're both 5'7"", and she is up at \~250 pounds (she doesn't like telling me exactly) - and her weight is at the point where it's making me less attracted to her.

Multiple doctors have told her that she needed to lose weight - her regular physician, the doctor who diagnosed her hiatal hernia, the fertility specialist who said she needed to reduce her BMI to make a pregnancy viable. (She listened that time and with medication she got pregnant and we have a daughter who's now nearly 3!) But she thinks the doctors are just prejudiced against fat people, and as she's not dying of diabetes and her overweight mother isn't either, that she just needs to find a doctor who accepts her body. Even so, she has a bad knee (so can't do heavy exercise and can't climb stairs) and a condition that flares up occasionally with a bad pain in the nerve in the back of her leg.

I should admit here that I'm not exactly going to be on the cover of Men's Health myself, as I've been hovering at 190 for a while and have been a bit on and off about addressing it. To her credit, she has started on a small amount of exercise with me - she goes to yoga occasionally and takes our daughter swimming most weeks. And to be honest, I really don't see her eating all that badly - we eat the same meals, so I'm unsure where her extra weight comes from. She has PCOS, which I believe contributes to it, but I don't know enough to say if that accounts for the full difference.

Selfishly, at some point in my life I want to have sex with someone who isn't significantly overweight. It makes me feel so shallow and selfish saying that, but my sexual frustration has been building ever since we had our baby, and we've been having appointments together at a therapist about what to do about it. She hasn't had anywhere near the libido I have since very early on, and her unavailability after pregnancy when her body belonged to the baby really brought that to the front.

In private sessions the therapist has assessed, correctly, that my sexual frustration is mostly due to not being as attracted to her as I once was, rather than any lack of sexual interest on my wife's part - and she wants me to bring my attraction to my wife up with her as a different tool to try to get through to her to lose weight. (Her weight has come up in the joint sessions, but she gets annoyed at it being discussed or deflect to something else very quickly). I worry that doing this won't make her motivated to lose weight and that on top of that I'll dent her confidence.

My brother (“P”) is 6 years older than me. He lives with our dad and our dad’s new family. P has 2 jobs and pays for his own expenses and rent.

P is an aspiring actor. He always been a charismatic, funny guy. High school was great, but at home life was different.

We lived with our r/raisedbynarcissists mother. P was physically and verbally abused. He was forced out of the house at 17 and then eventually moved in with our dad.

P and dad do not have really any type of relationship. He tries to say it’s okay, but P is always disappointed when he tries to start a relationship with our father and never gets any reciprocity.

About a year and a half ago, P was diagnosed with schizophrenia after having a psychotic episode and being admitted to a mental institution. He is still struggling with accepting that he needs to take medication to not spiral back into that hole.

He had to take breaks from school due to his mental state, and was unenrolled from school due to absences. 

On top of that, P has only worked night shifts at several part time jobs, had his bike stolen, was forced to give away his cat, and is in some trouble financially.

While we were on the phone, he says if he just had 1000 dollars, he would be able to fix so much of the shit on his plate. He’d be able to pay off his credit card bills, get a new bike and pay to travel to look for gigs. He says all he has to do is just work for it and he’ll be there, but he is tired of bad shit happening to him out of nowhere.

By the time he finishes, I tell him to check his PayPal because I sent him the money. No strings attached, just do what you need to do to steer yourself on track.

He immediately says “Why would you do this?” and is upset that I would send him that money, saying he “didn’t ask for it” and “doesn’t want [me] to pay for him”. It doesn’t matter how much I tell him that this isn’t out of pity or because I expect repayment, I just want him to know I believe in him. P tries sending it back, but I tell him no, but if he wants to send it back so badly, he can send me it out of his next couple of checks. He hangs up after a few minutes saying he “just needs to go” and will call me tomorrow.

In my eyes, I wouldn’t be where I am without my older siblings sacrificing for me and believing in me. My parents were never rooting for me, it was always P and our older sister. So now, I want to support P. He needs someone—anyone—to just be on his side.

Tl;dr:
I sent my aspiring actor brother $1000 to help him chase his dreams and get his life on track because I am in the position to do so and he has been struggling for a long time. He is upset because he didn’t ask for my help and wants to do the work himself.

AITA?

also just wanted to clarify that I am a little sister, not a little brother. not a huge deal, but idk if that would change anyone’s answer.",27,35,0.89

1728,Not the A-hole,"I am someone who is high up in a company. My friend and I are close, who used to be my Manager at another big company that I used to work at. Then we both became managers and I oversaw some people she has not worked with. Recently there have been a lot of lay offs, and i see my friend very seriously denouncing pretty much every girl she maybe may not have worked with, as far as recommending them goes, and going so far to remind me to not think with my dick when it comes to recommending people for roles at my new job. 

Her close friends at the company are guys who are very bad at what they do, but she never mentions them. 

She focuses only on girls who work with her and with us in the past, and denounces them quite seriously. Her and I both worked with a number of people but she goes out of her way to refer guys to me, even the ones that are absolute garbage at their jobs, but girls who are even halfway decent to high performers, she alienates and leaves out. 

I called her out on her recent behavior, and she told me she got incredibly upset. 

I apologized because it was a generalization and I could have worded what I said better, but the truth is her behavior has been very specifically towards girls she works with and denounces them for some reason, not the guys.

TL;DR: friend got mad when I called out a very specific trend in how she sees people she works with. She has been denouncing all thr girls, but almost no guy.",18,27,0.83
1729,Not the A-hole,"So, recently I went back to college and moved into an older house with 6 other people. We were all friends and room mates previously. There are three stories in this house, my room being on the top floor. One other girl has the floor opposite of mine and we are the only two up here. Last year, when we signed a lease for this house, there was talk about getting a dog. Most of us agreed we shouldn't as it would raise our rent and we didn't have the proper time to care for it. However, this one girl still wanted an animal in the house. She mentioned bringing a cat from home, which we all said no to. She also talked about getting a bunny. In our lease, there is a strict no ""critter"" policy ***unless*** we have all signed an additional agreement and pay an additional fee. Last week, she said she was going to go look at hamsters and see what she could find. Well, she ended coming home with a guinea pig without asking anyone else before bringing it home. She's had it for almost a week now. My long-term, serious boyfriend came over the other day and turns out it's one of many animals he's allergic to. He couldn't even breathe in my room. Until this pet is gone and both of our carpets have been cleaned, he can't come over any more. Due to not previously signing the critter policy and not even being asked about having this pet, I would like to ask her to get rid of it. But some of my friends think I am in the wrong and that she should be able to have this pet since it is in her room. Also, I read our lease agreement again and realized that there is the possibility we could all be evicted to due our landlord not knowing about the pet. So, would I be an awful person to ask her to drive the hour drive home to her parents house to get rid of it?

1730,Everyone Sucks,"New to reddit, on mobile, all that jazz. But I'm(21F) 8 months pregnant with my second child. I've had some minor problems with this pregnancy, nothing too serious, just been rough on me. This past weekend I went out to dinner with my mother and a few of her friends. I've only known the one woman, we'll call her Deb, for a little over a year. She's always been kind but she gives off that ""everything I say is right and I know what's best"" vibe when it comes to anything related to pregnancy or children. You can't argue with her.

She's said things that have gotten under my skin before, such as implying I was an irresponsible mother for not getting my child baptized or criticising the food I feed my son (she thinks he needs to have butter and salt on everything he eats). I've just ignored these comments because she's one of my mother's closest friends and I don't want to start problems. She also has a son my age who she adopted because she's unable to have children of her own. 

So at dinner I was talking to my mom about how difficult it's getting to lift my son and do general cleaning at home. Deb interjected and said ""you shouldn't have had your children so close together then."" Okay. I ignored her. My mother started discussing my birthplan and the hospital I'll be having the baby at. Deb said I chose the wrong hospital and this other hospital was much better. I was irritated and just dropped talking about my pregnancy all together. 

I then switched from drinking water and ordered a sprite. When I took a drink I swear this woman looked like I just lit a crack pipe and took a hit. ""You can't drink soda while you're pregnant! Do you know how much sugar is in that?"" I said it wasn't a big deal and drinking one glass isn't going to hurt anyone. She said ""Its not a big deal only for someone who doesn't care about the miracle growing inside her."" I flipped. I said what I did wasn't her business in the first place and she has never been pregnant and she isnt a doctor so why does she think she can sit there and lecture me on something she knows nothing about. She cried, my mother was angry with me, and now I'm questioning if I went too far. So AITA? 

Tldr; got tired of my pregnancy and my harmless decions being criticized by a woman who has never been pregnant, brought up the fact that she couldn't have children, and now everyone is mad at me.",150,484,0.94

1733,Not the A-hole,"My sister in law has a baby, he’s a year old now. She got pregnant new junior year of college, had the baby that summer, went on to finish her senior year and graduate this year. Her and the father broke up early into her pregnancy. 

Her parents were already paying her tuition, which they continued to do. They had her move back home with them and they babysit her son (they keep him A LOT). They pay for all practical costs of living for her such as food, diapers, phone bill, car insurance, gas. She hasn’t had a job since she got pregnant, and has never paid for her own living expenses aside from extra clothes/going out money. I’m not mad about what they do for her, I just think she’s really out of touch with what being a single parent is like for most people and he goes on about it in a way that rubs me the wrong way.

When she was pregnant she made several posts on Facebook like “if you need a sign to leave a toxic relationship: this is your sign. You can and will thrive etc etc etc” with a maternity picture of herself in designer clothes. Knowing the full extent of her situation, it felt really tone deaf because most people who are pregnant and in a toxic relationship don’t have the support system that she does to fall back on. As someone who was previously in a very bad marriage, I couldn’t just leave and I when I finally did I certainly wasn’t thriving for a long time.

Then she graduated from college and started doing the same thing. So many posts “for all you single mothers out there who has the whole world doubting you, you can do it. I am living proof that if you work hard enough and believe in yourself etc etc etc. I accomplished something that a lot of people think they can’t and no one thought it could” with pictures in her cap and gown. Again, as a former single mother who actually had to support myself and kids, going to college full time was out of the question.

Then she did it at the dinner table one night in front of me. She’s done it in front of me a couple times but this time it went on and really annoyed me. So I straight up told her, “look I’m proud of you, I’m happy for you, I’m very glad you finished school. But you’re so far out of touch with what 99% of other single mothers in this country experience and I think the way you talk about it is really tone deaf considering all the help you have.” She was like “no matter how much help finishing school after just having a baby is hard.” I was like, “I’m not saying it’s not hard. I’m saying it’s not as hard as you make it out to be. You didn’t have any obstacles standing in your way which is something you never acknowledge. You act like you’re inspiring when really you just have it easier than almost everyone else in your position it comes off like you’re bragging.”

She’s really offended but I feel like she asked for it by bringing it up so many times in a really arrogant way.

1734,Not the A-hole,"This is a bit of a weird one, thanks for bearing with me.

I’m pregnant with twins at the moment, something I’m struggling with a lot as I don’t want to and will not keep them. Due to loads of personal reasons I decided not to be involved in their lives. (Even strongly considered abortion before. ) 

My plan was to give them up for adoption, but their father (who I have no relationship with) decided he wants to keep them and there’s not much I can do about that. However, I made it clear to him that I will move away once they’re born and want to know nothing about them, sign away my rights, etc. 

In my last appointment he wanted to come, and I agreed, though I said I didn’t want to find out their gender. He asked if HE alone could find out and he wouldn’t tell me. (He can come across quite strong and I struggle with being assertive like that, so I agreed.) 

Little bit later and he already let me slip what they are, which has made me incredibly upset. He says he didn’t do it on purpose but I don’t believe him. (He wants me be to be their mom.) 

I told him I don’t want him joining any of my appointments ever again and would prefer to see him as less as possible until they’re born. He thinks I’m completely overreacting and as he will be their only parent, he should be there ‘so at least one person who cares about them is there’. He wants to be as involved as possible now. 

AITA for telling him he can’t ever come to my appointments anymore (taking away this experience from him) and I don’t want to speak to him anymore (not more than necessary)?

Edit: I didn’t expect so many people to reply to this. Thanks for taking the time. Just a few small things; I can’t abort anymore. Please stop suggesting it. I know you mean well, but now I’m just worried I made a wrong decision. Also, if I have to pay, so be it.. I’ll talk to a lawyer asap either way.

Edit #2: This is all spiraling out of control. Just some things I feel like I need to address. I’m willing to pay child support as much as I can (being not that financially stable myself), honestly. I just don’t want to/can’t be a mom. Second, I absolutely don’t want him in the delivery room, as it’s already stressing me out so much. He can see them IMMEDIATELY after, but I don’t want him there. 

Lastly, I decided to stop replying or reply less to the comments. It’s all gotten a bit too much for me (abandoning, selfish, etc.) This is my own resposibility and fault, as I was definitely not prepared for this to grow as much as it did. A lot of people are saying NTA, a lot are saying YTA. I appreciate all of you for taking the time to reply.

1735,Not the A-hole,"There's this club at my University that's for business but they do a lot of philanthropy events to help raise money for charities. I (21M) am not in the club but I do on occasion go out to their events because I have a lot of friends in the club. In May they had an auction to raise money for a local animal shelter. They auctioned off t shirts, free tutoring sessions for math and science, mugs, etc. I bided on a couple of things and won both of them. 

The first was a free tutoring session for Calculus for an hour (that saved my life) and the second was a date with the president of the club, Valerie. She's this real pretty girl that everyone likes. I've always had a small crush on her and thought hey why not buy a date with her. It'll go to charity and I'll get a date with the girl I liked. I bought the date for $40. 

I got her number and texted her a few days later asking about the date. She said to wait until the summer (we both stayed in town). I'm like ok that's fair. I texted her like once every other week about the date and she always just had some excuse to not go. Some things were really valid like class and work while others were complete bullshit.

This happened all summer long and she never set a date with me. I saw her on campus last week and asked her about it. She said that she didn't like me in that way and didn't want to go on one. She said she also thought her crush would bid on her and that was the only reason she did it but he didn't show up.

My response to Valerie was basically this ""Ok. I'm fine with that but since you don't want to go on a date then can I have my money back?""

She got really defensive and basically said ""It's for charity and we already donated it.""

My response was ""Well I paid for a date which you don't want to go on and I don't want to go on either at this point. I want my money back.""

She said no and I threatened to go to the university about it because it was a school sponsored event. She told me fine and she'll get me a refund from her club budget. Today she handed me the check and now I kinda feel like an asshole.

I'm both mad at myself and happy for myself at the same time. I keep telling myself that she shouldn't have put a date up for bid if she wasn't going to go though with the date. 

So am I an asshole here?

Well, she went ahead and bought them both (have no idea how she will pay for the rest of it) against my wishes since, I think that the place she went to isn’t the most trust worthy of businesses.

Nevertheless, I told her that I either want to write a check to the business and know that it went towards her new utility, or I want to see her go in and pay for it (I've checked, both ways are legitimate ways to pay with that business). Well, she keeps insisting that I just wire her $400 and not be nosey. After refusing that, she told me that ""she should slap my ignorant mouth for not wiring her money"".

1738,Asshole,"Im 16 and I live in England with my mum and my step-dad. My brother, 25 , has moved back in due to my mum not being able to afford rent for my brother. I was tasked to get the apartment in a reasonable state for the security deposit, when I found out that he hadn't cleaned the apartment in 1+ year(s) I was worried, when I entered the kitchen area was disgusting. E.g literal food waste not being moved. Black mold was also collecting in the top corners of the rooms. Obviously my mum didn't get the security deposit back.

For the past year, and the most recent months he has ballooned it weight. 300kg is my estimate as he refuses to go on scales. I have offered to go to the gym with him or help him on a diet but he refuses. All he does is eat and play Xbox all day. Nevermind that he has a minifridge full of energy drinks that he has replaced water with. 

My brother drenches T-shirts when walking 100 meters.

Last month he was diagnosed with type 2 diabities and refuses to take it seriously. He also complains of having sleep apnea. I believe he falls asleep all the time as his body can't support his own weight while doing simple tasks.

Next month he starts University for the 3rd time doing social sciences for the 3rd time. As he didn't pass the first two times. My brother is jn £40,000 worth of debt from the University and doesn't take it seriously. 

Yesterday was is third appointment with his counselor. And all he does is post shitty quotes on Facebook about how mentally strong he is.

My Grandma religiously defends him, She was very angry when I said that my brother is nothing but a detriment not only to my mum's life but to mine as well. 

I would be genuinely relieved if my brother died of a heart attack. AITA?

1740,No A-holes here,"We have a tradition in our family where we go to Disney world. My parents were simply waiting for their grand children to become of age to really enjoy the trip. They have been planning for 2020 for about three years now.  So we've known about the trip for quite a while.  Me and my husband have been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant for our 2nd child for about a year and a 1/2. It's been a serious stressor for me as for any woman who experiences the inability to get pregnant when they want to. But now the trip is coming up. Were still trying to get pregnant. But obviously it's not working.



So now there's a problem. I can continue to attempt to get pregnant, which is not guaranteed to work. And we can have a 3 to 4 month year old when we go to Disney world.I can wait a little bit and be pregnant when we go to Disney world, again assuming we even manage it. Or I can have him wait and we can have the baby after we come home from Disney.

 We both wanted to have our children relatively close in age. But now we're getting to a point where my daughter is going to be four by the time she has a sibling. We were planning on two or three. My thing is this, our original plans got screwed up already. What's another year? 



His counter argument is that he has a say in the matter too, since he's the dad, and he would rather the age gap not get any bigger. I also said he would be okay with taking a 3 to 4 month old to Disney world since he doesn't like rides anyways. He could stay out with the baby. The problem with that is that there's no guarantee that it'll work like we want and I may end up pregnant on the Disney trip, which I DO NOT want. Or it could take so long that I have the baby WHEN we're supposed to go and thus forcing the family to reschedule the trip completely or miss out on it. Which, again, I DO NOT want. 

So, AITA for asking my husband to understand and stop trying until after Disney?


Edit 1: I'm not picking Disney world over my family.  We're going to have that second child,  even if we have to adopt. That doesn't make me a terrible wife because I want to wait.


Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the advice! It seems that a lot of people consider me NTA and that helps me feel better about the choice of waiting. As for those who are baffled about postponing my life for a disney trip. I don't see it as postponing my life. I see the trip as a big part of it. Me being pregnant during the trip means I'll be miserable and miss out on a lot of stuff. Bringing a newborn to Disney has turned into a bad idea, so that won't happen. The only logical solution is to wait. And one year when you have a toddler goes by with the blink of an eye. So it's really not that long of a wait to dedicate our lives to a new family member.

At the time I was young and dumb - I recognize this (and I was admittedly a player before my wife) - and I said it back. I probably didn’t mean it... not because I didn’t like her a lot, but I didn’t see us being serious or together forever. 

Three months into our relationship, she came to me with a positive pregnancy test. It sounds corny as all hell, but I realized then how much she meant (means) to me. We got married when she was about halfway through her pregnancy. When our daughter was born, a clone of her mother, I fell in love in the “I never knew love before this moment” way. Not that I didn’t love my wife when we got married — I did — but the gravity of my love for both her and our daughter hit me when our daughter was born. 

Fast forward a little over a decade. Our daughter is thriving. We have added two sons. I run a successful software company and my wife (mostly) stays home. We have a fantastic life together. My player ways are gone- I’ve never even considered looking at another woman. I don’t say this for praise but to set the scene, I guess. 

Over the weekend, my wife and I were hanging out after our children went to bed. We talked about the earlier days. She is well aware that I wasn’t looking for anything serious when we met. She said to me “I said I love you first. I loved you so much from the moment we started dating. Did you love me back then?” Something to that effect. I was silent and contemplating my answer and said something boneheaded to the effect of “probably not at that time...”

My wife started crying. She has told me before that she had a crush on me for a year before we started dating - and she saw me being a player and it hurt at the time. Our first year of marriage, we struggled - she worried I only married her because she got pregnant. She said me admitting I probably didn’t love her back at first brought back the old insecurities, made her feel lied to, etc etc.

To preface this story I have another roommate (20 M) who has his own room. The couple live in the third bedroom. The first roommate and I have lived here for 2 years and I have a cat, which is an important part of this story.

So in May of this year our old roommate who living in room 3 decided he was moving out and so we asked around to our friends and a couple was interested in moving in. So we opened up our apartment to them.

I believe this was a mistake looking back.

That was in May, my other roommate moved out in June. The couple is currently living here, but still haven't gone and put their name on the lease. They completely rearranged the living area while I was gone one day, which is annoying but not overly terrible. And then today happened.

Some important backstory about my cat is that I rescued her from her previous owner where she was abused both by the other animals and the owner. So she's very skittish and doesn't trust a lot of people.

My roommates decided today that they are going to be getting a dog. I immediately told them that they can't get a dog because my cat freaks out any time she even smells a dog. This isn't the first time we've had a conversation about them getting a dog, so it wasn't a surprise to them that I was against it. At this point they got kind of mad and said it was unfair that I had a cat and they can't get a dog and that they had done us a favor by moving in. I quickly cleared up that they didn't do us any favors, they decided to move in to our empty room knowing that I already had an animal.

1746,Not the A-hole,"Around 30 years ago my parents came to work to the US legally(papers in order), and I (26m if it matters) was born in Houston,TX  although at very young age, my family moved to Mexico and that's where I basically grew up. Now, since then, I have always wanted to come to the U.S, my uncle who is living in Texas told my dad that he would take me in and give me a place to stay while I get a job and make something for myself. This happened when I was in the University so he basically asked me to drop out in the middle of the semester and go. I was excited (like, finally happening) and then after checking schools around and jobs, he pretty much slammed the door in my face and I had to come back to Mexico.

Now, years after that, I came to US by myself ( worked , saved money, etc etc) this way I would not be depending on anyone. I've had a few jobs here and there but nothing to settle down, and now I came across X company and they're hiring, payment might not be much but they have growth and it's located like 10 min away from where I live, next to the gym I go(ironically) so it fits pretty damn good. So I apply, I make it through the hiring process and I'm selected  (yay!) , they ask me to bring my ID and SSN just to fill more data and that's when they told me ""Your SSN has been used before with us, we can't hire you and it's gonna take a few days to weeks to fix this"", they even told me the name of the person using it, I don't know the name, never herd it. I contact my family to ask about this and it turns out back when I was born, my uncle ""took for a moment"" my SSN and this guy appearing on the company is his stepson, as he came from Mexico ( illegally ) and he gave him my SSN to get a job over there, after I found all of this I was, to say the least, furious.

Now my dad just called me, saying that my uncle and his stepson are offering me a ""well paid job"" and I would be ""irresponsible of not taking  it"" to ""contact them and they'll help you out"" to which I replied- ""Are you kidding me?, is this some kind of joke?"" he went further on to push me onto getting it and now he and my mother thinks that I would be an asshole if I reject my uncle of taking said job, and being too prideful it's a bad thing, to just let it go.  


P.S  I have no proof of the job being a real thing, and I only have one uncle, so its pretty much the same guy I talk about.

1747,Asshole,"We go to different high schools and this happened on her bus.

She sent me a video today of an older class men saying “I’ll offer you $10, $15, $20 to suck my dick. That’s a lot of money”

And she just keeps laughing at him like it’s some sort of a joke but says no while giggling.

I’m telling her to stand up for herself but she replies with “I’m used to it”

Then she’s like “this is just a small portion of what happens to me everyday. It’s not that big of a deal. I just blow it off. You need to chill”

1748,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I went to a friend's birthday party at a nice restaurant. A mutual friend was there; he's significantly older than most of our friend group, but is married to a girl our age (mid 20's). Basically, he was a huge jerk to the waitstaff, ordering them around condescendingly, yelling at them, loudly complaining. It was great service, honestly. He hadn't been drinking enough for it to be solely because of alcohol. It was absolutely embarrassing and uncalled for. 

As the night went on, we went to a bar. He drank pretty well, but he definitely wasn't sloshed. I don't drink as a rule, so I'm completely sober. 

Bartender was great, waitress was super attentive. We're within an hour of closing and he ordered food. But he started getting very aggressive with our waitress about an ingredient in the item- he's not allergic or anything, he just doesn't like it. He kept stepping forward, yelling at her, and again, being a jerk. A couple of the other guys in the group stepped towards him in case he tried to hit her- it was that bad. She kept her cool, did a great job. He then storms into the back kitchen area to do who knows what. 

He came back out and settled down a bit. Another girl and I were quietly talking about what we should do. I 100% wouldn't blame them if they kicked us out. We just decided to quietly apologize to the waitress, which both of us did. I briefly mentioned he'd been drinking long before we got there and it wasn't her fault at all. She seemed visibly calmed at it, when she had been super uneasy about being anywhere near us. 

About 5 minutes later, he grabs his wife and literally drags her out of the bar (she's tripping over herself), then comes storming back in. When they leave, he gives me a hug and tells me ""I don't need a bitch mother, I'm a grown man."" There's 0 chance he heard me say anything himself, so someone must have said something. I didn't really care, he's drunk, whatever. 

But THEN other people come up and tell me I need to stay in my lane, it's not my problem, etc. They never said this to the other girl who apologized. Even my husband was like ""Yeah, you did the wrong thing and it's not okay to apologize for someone else."" He then went on to apologize for me to jerk drunk guy a couple days later, even though I don't think I owed him one. 

Am I the jerk for trying to make the waitress feel more at ease? I realize she deals with drunks every day, but the this seemed way out of line to me.

EDIT: 
Thanks, everyone! This incident happened a bit ago, and it has REALLY bothered me. It was recently brought up to me again and I wanted to see if I was completely out of line. I always try to let people learn their own lessons (actions=consequences, both good and bad), but this scenario impacted every single person there. 

Soon after all that, I had some major life changes and stopped hanging out with that group of friends. I saw Drunk Guy once after the incident; he wanted to act like everything was normal. I was polite and cordial, but didn't engage with him outside of shallow chatting. 

Since leaving, I've definitely been in a better spot without having to worry about drama over ridiculous behavior. <3",38,57,0.94
1749,Asshole,"I have 2 Shiba Inu mix with a sheltie that I got from a breeder when they were about 8 weeks old. I took their training very seriously because I've had bad experience with untrained dogs my parent had at a young age. They also had several trainers and gotten many certificates and qualifications over the course of the first 2 years of their lives and after that, they have essentially became perfect dogs. 

Around the 2 years mark, I started walking them without a leash. I've never had issues with them bothering people or other dogs because they're anti social and they usually walk by people without even looking at them. They use to run after squirrels at first but eventually I trained them to only do it on command. 

The actual walking itself is no issue. One is trained to walk on my left and the other, on my right and they will walk less than a feet from me when I tell them to come to attention. They walk when I walk, They sit when I stop and all this without any gesture or verbal command. 

For 4 years off the leash. They have had 0 major issues. But like 2-3 times a year, there would be an uptight person screaming at me to put a leash on them. 

Today, sitting on the usual bench at the park with one of my dog sitting next to me enjoying the breeze, and the other one somewhere in the woods hunting squirrels and birds (he's a terrible hunter btw!). Some old lady started telling me to leash them. I usually just nod and ignore them but she was persistent. She has a tiny dog parking furiously at my dog and pulling her towards me like a beast. Her dog was clearly untrained and she has no control over him/her.

I told her ""my dogs are well behave as you can see"" (gesturing toward my dog still sitting next to me, not even alarmed at the barking dog). But she threaten to call the cops. After going back and forth for 2min. I decided to just leave. She continues to follow me with her barking dog saying things like ""I don't see you leashing your dog."" At this point, I guess my dog sees her as a threat and she begin growling and finally let out a bark. This was a rare event as my dog (Shiba's in general) rarely ever bark. She even begin showing teeth. And to make matters worst, seconds after, my other dog came, probably answering to his sister's bark. The park is a huge open field, so you can see him running from the distance and he's bigger than his sister (about 10 pounds heavier, due to being mix) I guess this startled the lady and she eventually turned around and walking away while pulling on her, still barking dog. 

I have heard the age old argument of always leashing your dogs because they're unpredictable. But am I the asshole for believing that, that rule shouldn't apply to extremely well trained and well behaved dogs? Especially ones that are anti social and usually ignore other people/dogs.

Edit: to answer some questions, I don't leash them because they're happier that way. 

My local law does not require dogs with a certificates/badge (to signify they pass a specific training course) to be leashed at designated dog parks which includes the one I always go to daily. 

And also to clarify. My dogs would be on a leash had they keep going up to other dogs or people to sniff them. But my dogs don't do that and the other dogs are usually the one pulling on their owners trying to sniff my dogs as they walk by.

And I can't put enough emphasis on how anti social my dogs are. You can have their favorite treats, but if they don't know you or have me at your side, they will ignore you.

Edit 2: The interaction is indeed at the dog park which is a VERY large open grass field with a river running by it. It has a very nice scenery so a lot of people end up strolling here and it became an unofficial community gathering spot for picnics or even hikes as the park also borders a minature wood area.

One of my dog hunts behind a mostly fenced off area where none of the ""hiking"" trail or people can't get to. Fence is about 4 feet high but he can jump it easily which has almost became a sightseeing event for other daily goers here. As for how I get him to come back when I want to leave, I just shout his name and he'll usually be flying back within 10-20 seconds.",664,714,0.84

1751,Not the A-hole,"I want to preface this by saying that I have also had mental health issues myself, and I'm very sympathetic to mental health issues in general, or at least I try to be.

I have a good friend of many years, Mattie, (we've known each other since we were 7 and we're 25 now so a very long time) and she has this brother, Mike, who is about 5 years older so he never really spent time with us when we were kids, but we started spending more time with Mike as we got older, to the extent that 8 months ago, we saw each other nearly daily and I considered him a friend. I know he Mike a crush on me at one point but when I came out as a lesbian that was probably the end of that.

Anyway, Mike has had some mental health issues as of late. IDK what he was diagnosed with exactly but he had an episode wherein he texted Mattie saying that she was the only person he felt he could trust, listing some people he felt were untrustworthy and saying that I (using my name) could be trustworthy as soon as he had ""fixed"" me. As a lesbian raised in a very religious/homophobic environment, I have some issues with the whole concept of being ""fixed"" but IDK if that is what he was actually referring to. I got scared, as I am 5""3 and skinny, and I lived alone at the time, while Mike is around 6 foot tall and muscular and knew where I lived. However, as far as I know, Mike had no intention of hurting anyone.

Mattie got Mike admitted to a mental health facility, where Mike has been for around 6 months. He was released about a month ago and he's meant to be finding and apologising to people he hurt before now. He's staying with Mattie until he finds a place of his own. Mike wants to talk to me to apologise.

I don't want to be near Mike. According to Mattie, Mike is on meds, doing well, unlikely to have another mental episode, however it's the ""unlikely"" that's stuck with me, as that seems to allow for a potential second episode, which is something I don't want to be anywhere near.

They offered to meet in public, but if Mike is still struggling then being in public might not prevent anything, they offered for me to come to their place, but that feels like he'd have the advantage, and they offered to come to my new place but I don't want Mike having my new address.

Mattie is upset with me, and said that I was treating Mike like he might go off any minute, and if he can't get back to normal life then he might not make a complete recovery. She also says that all Mike wants is 5 minutes of my time to explain where his head was at and apologise to me for his actions in order to help his recovery. I'm not saying that Mike definitely will go off, but I am saying that if he does, I don't want to be in the blast zone, and there is no ""normal"" after everything that's happened. I still wish Mike all the best and hope he recovers, but I don't trust him and I don't want to be anywhere near him.

AITA for not giving Mike a chance?

&#x200B;

Info: Although I don't think Mike was going to hurt me or anyone else during this episode he does have a past history of getting into altercations. Mattie won't clarify what he meant by ""fixed"" or his diagnosis, and says that Mike has asked her to stop asking him about those things. He doesn't want me or anyone but her to have his diagnosis, although Mattie mentioned a ""personality based disorder"" (her words) and says that having to go over the letter makes it worse for him, which I think is understandable, but makes it harder for me to get specifics on what could be deciding factors.",50,87,0.94

1754,Not the A-hole,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.

I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.

Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open

My friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

1756,Not the A-hole,"So basically, the team I am on was tasked unexpectedly to be the party planners for a big corporate event. They asked for volunteers to use a corporate card to purchase all of the alcohol and transport it with their personal vehicle(s). I was completely uncomfortable with doing it because:

A) I don’t drink and would have no idea what I’m doing anyways. 

B) I feel like it’s a major liability risk to transport something like that in a personal vehicle for a company event. Even carrying cases of liquor up stairs seems like a liability risk.

C) I have deeply held religious beliefs against consuming alcohol. I don’t care if others do it. I don’t judge them, I’ll even hang out with them if they are drinking. I just don’t want to be a part of it myself. Just don’t ask me to hold your drink for you.

I mentioned this when they were assigning tasks and everyone was like, “that’s totally fine, I get it, etc...”

Then the person who procured the order sent a message to the whole team asking for help carrying it up the stairs in our building. Again I’m super uncomfortable with it and the whole team walks past my desk and someone asks “are you coming to help carry the alcohol and stuff?” I said “sure I’ll come help if there’s other stuff!” And started to stand up from my desk. 

Then I got a kind of nippy response, “nah it’s fine. We got it.”

Ok... so now I’m writing this and feeing like trash because of that.

TLDR; Company asked for volunteers to handle alcohol for an event. I felt uncomfortable and let them know. Things seemed fine until the entire team went down to help carry it up and made me feel like shit for not helping with it. 

AITA?

Edit: Obviously I felt conflicted about it. I did bring up my religious beliefs to my team and framed it that way. I also was concerned with others doing it from a liability standpoint and I did mention that to my manager. What if someone DID injure themselves doing this?

But then I wonder if it was a recovering alcoholic would people still criticize? Or would they still say the same thing? It’s interesting to see people’s take on where they draw the line and what beliefs they consider “sacred” enough to respect.",103,208,0.91

1758,Asshole,"I just moved into dorm, like a week and a half ago, and they allow small pets. I LOVE animals and wanted to get a pet right away so I asked my roommate if it would be okay if I got one, and she was completely on board. Originally I was going to get a gecko and I asked her a number of times if it was okay that I was getting a pet and she said it was fine. She said that she loved reptiles and was cool with me getting even a kind of big one, so long as I took care of it myself.

So, last Friday some friends and I drove to the pet store and when we were there I saw the best rabbit I've ever seen in my life. I fell in love with this amazing little guy. The shop owner saw this and said that if I bought the bunny cage ($150) then the rabbit was free. I text and called my roommate and she didn't pick up, so I bought him because I was really worried that someone else was going to get him, and better forgiveness than permission right.

When I got back my roommate was super pissed, saying that her phone was off cause she was in chem lab and it wasn't right for me to get him without her permission. But, I'm still going to take care of him myself and he's not that much bigger than a medium-ish reptile, which she said was fine. So am I the asshole or is she just being overdramatic?

Edit: My roommate and I talked after she got back from dinner to see if she was feeling any better about the rabbit. She said that, ""I haven't been holding up my end of the bargain,"" (AKA taking care of him) because I sleep at my boyfriends and not in the dorm room. Right now she's threatening to tell our RA and get the rabbit kicked out because technically ""ferry creatures"" aren't allowed in dorm.

I'm super upset because she's being a total nark and I've really bonded with him and everyone on our floor loves him. I don't think I can take him back to the pet store, but I can still a really good home for him. I'd rather just get a new roommate and keep him, but I don't see that happening.

Edit 2: A girl on my floor, her family keeps rabbits, she says that she would be happy to take him. Her family lives about an hour and a half away but she goes home every weekend and says she'll take him up next Friday.

1759,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I know the title sounds bad, but here's the story: 

I am 15 and my mom and I were talking about my brother's situation. He had just turned 18 and things were changing as to where he would be living, life insurance policies ect. My brother is mildly autistic, mostly concerning social behaviors. Because of his autism, he doesn't have great understanding of how his actions affect other people, and he doesn't have much empathy. He also has really poor anger control, he has sometimes resorted to physical violence to get his way, and is much bigger than me and my siblings. He is learning and changing every day, though. 

So I was sitting in the car and my mom was filling me in on what was supposed to happen to my brother is she were to die. It's morbid, but it was a conversation we had to have. She basically said that if she were to die in the next 10 years, my brother would live with my aunt and uncle, but if she were to die later, she hoped I would take him in. 

My brother will probably never be able to live entirely on his own, so it was a valid question but DEFINITELY not something I was thinking about. I was completely caught off guard and she took my shock as saying that I wouldn't take in my brother. She started trying to make me feel guilty, saying that he is my brother and don't I love him... 

I just don't think I will ever be able to take care of him. I desperately want to go off the college so that I can get away from him and some of his behaviors. I'm sure he'll grow up and change in the next 10 years, but so will I. I know he's my brother, and I do love him, but it just feels so rushed and crazy. I don't know what my life will be like in ten years, but I just don't think I could put myself and my potential family through his behavior.

1760,Not the A-hole,"Background: I’m 28M, my wife is 30F. We’re high school sweethearts and got married 4 years ago.

So my wife is around 19 weeks pregnant, with twins. It’s been a rocky pregnancy so far and she’s had problems with throwing up, dizziness, the whole deal. For this reason, and because twins are obviously a high-risk pregnancy, we both agreed that she would take a leave of absence from her work, who was gracious enough to give her mat-leave early. This is made easier by the fact that we live in a country with amazing mat-leave laws.

Anyways, throughout our relationship, I’ve always done most of the cooking. I never minded because I quite enjoy it and I think I’m decent at it. My wife agrees (or at least used to). However, since the pregnancy got going, she started hating my cooking more and more. She’ll make snide comments like one that really hurt me “a teenager with one hand tied behind their back could cook this steak better” which I laughed off at the time but over time the comments have gotten much worse and hurtful over time. 

Last Friday, I finished at work and came home with her favourite cranberry juice flavour and cooked one of her favourite dishes, tikki masala, which I’ve perfected over time. She took one bite and made another snide comment, “so you couldn’t do any better than this?” And I finally lost my patience, threw down my fork onto the plate and I told her that I’m tired of her comments and if she thinks that then I’m done cooking for her and she can either get some cookbooks or takeout cause I can’t stand it when she does that.

She started crying and took a cab to stay with her parents who live ~35 minutes away. I assume she talked to my family because my 2 older sisters (who she’s close with) told me that I was in the wrong and that her hormones are probably causing her to act that way, and that I should apologize for the sake of peace in the household. It’s Monday and she still hasn’t said a single word to me.

1761,Not the A-hole,"I (23F) am currently making my way through medical school. Doing research, volunteer work, an extra certificate program, and trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In short, I'm really busy all the time. 

I recently hit a hard patch with mental health issues, a break up, and a rejection letter for a leadership position I really wanted. As a result, my grades and school-life balance took a hit. I missed submitting an assignment and barely passed my last exam. I'm on the up a bit now, but it's been a struggle.

In conversation with my brother (34M), I mentioned I was struggling a bit and he asked for details. When I described it, his response essentially accused me of slacking. Even when I tried to explain the situation, he just said I needed to work harder if I ever wanted to get where he is.

That last part got to me. I admit I was defensive, but then I just got mad. I told him that all his advice about medical SCHOOL is useless to me because he went to the Caribbean for school. Not only that, my aunt and uncle were both faculty there and got him in. He struggled and worked hard after, but he never had to balance extracurriculars and research with his bachelor's (which he flunked out of) or med school. I pointed out that I got in by my own merit and he had to be babied by our family. I'm glad he got a second chance at a career and he is a good doctor from what I can tell but he never acknowledges it and acts like he did it himself. He gets praised for ""setting the example"" for his siblings but really, it was just bad decisions and nepoticism that gave him the opportunity. All that frustration and being looked over (esp because the culture I'm from always favors men) just came to a front.

Now, he's not talking to me, which I get. But my parents are telling me to apologize to him and quit ""slacking"" in school. I told them I would apologize for how I said it, but not for what I said. I wanted an apology myself, but I was told I was being ""hysterical"" and ""unreasonable.""

I looked out the window and saw a streetlight and I got the idea to tell the story of a monster called the ""Bunyin"", a tall demon that disguises itself as streetlights during the day and spies on kids in the neighborhood to see which kids are bad and good. He doesn't do anything to the good kids, but when the bad kids are asleep, he drops the streetlight facade, reaches into their windows and takes them away to his underground lair. Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight. He's crying and screaming ""BUNYIN! BUNYIN!"" We told him to calm down and that it was just a story, but he wouldn't settle down. My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.

Well, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it. They asked me to leave and never come near Timmy again.

Even my girlfriend made me feel like shit about it. Me and her both occasionally browse the r/UnresolvedMysteries page and my girlfriend said ""This is what causes kids to vanish and never be seen again."" I tried to add some levity by saying ""Well, I guess we know why Asha Degree left her house."" That upset my girlfriend even further and I admit that that joke probably wasn't needed, but I just want to know if I'm really at fault for what happened here.",32,51,0.92

1767,Asshole,"Throwaway just in case I'm TA.

Went on a date yesterday and when dinner ended I asked if she wanted to come back to my place but she wasn't feeling it. No big deal, but when the tab came I paid my own and she asked me if I was going to pay hers and I told her I wasn't feeling it then got ready and I left.

Posting this because I got a text from her this morning apologizing for not coming over but that she thought what I did was wrong and in retaliation and that she really wasn't just feeling it that day, but we had never discussed anything about who pays the tab beforehand so I explained it wasn't my intention to make her feel like that.",974,1086,0.87

1772,Not the A-hole,"This happened many years ago. So the deed is done, but after reading some of these stories I have been wondering if I was the asshole. 

It was for my birthday. From a very young age (around 11; I am in my late forties now)I had stopped celebrating my birthdays. I just got tired of them. So for the longest time my birthday came, and went like any other day. 

If I would go out on birthday for dinner I made it very clear that this is just like any normal day. No singing. This was my only birthday wish. One day my family decided to go to a restaurant on my birthday. Which I said that I will agree to go is this is just like every other day. No singing. So they agreed.  


We get to the restaurant, and everything is going smoothly until about the end of the meal. A group of waiters came up, and said ""I hear someone has a birthday here!"" I looked at the head waiter with a straight face, and politely said ""Please. Don't"", and the waiter started to say something, and again politely I said ""Please. Don't"" the waiter kept pressing. Finally I got annoyed. I said ""Please. Don't"" got up, and walked out of the restaurant. 

Of course the family called me an asshole. Had the waiter not pressed like he did I wouldn't have walked out of the restaurant.

1775,Not the A-hole,"I own a small cafe, and the staff consists of about 10 people. 2 students who were working full time over summer dropped back to part time as school is resuming, so we needed to hire 1 or 2 more part timers to make up for it. We hired a guy (16) and a girl (17).

The cafe is family friendly, although not family oriented. We have comics and colouring for kids and allow breastfeeding and never discourage families from coming in, but it has become something of a hangout for local students, so the majority of our patrons are adults.

New Girl started on the first of this month, and due to a combination of me catching flu and our different work schedules I haven't been on the same shift as her yet. From what the others tell me, her work is alright. She's had to be asked to do the same tasks more than once and apparently takes her time a bit but I've not observed her firsthand and I've been told that she does ultimately accomplish everything we ask of her, and she started unsure of herself but is steadily growing in confidence.

Today my kids (10m and 12f) came to the cafe, which is unusual for them and New Girl has never met them. New Guy and another employee were working with my brother at the bar. I was going to have the kids sit in the back with me after they'd gotten their drinks but my brother said he could watch the kids as there were only a handful of people in the cafe at that moment and the kids are comfortable with him, and they said they'd rather be out in the cafe than in the office.

About 20 minutes later I came out and asked if everything was ok and my brother said that he went into the fridge to get another bag of milk and some syrup and while he was in there New Girl came in and walked past the line, which consisted of just my kids. New Girl stood at the counter and talked to New Guy.

My kids tried to speak but New Girl spoke over them and gave him her order. New Guy apparently tried to tell her that my kids were in line first but she didn't acknowledge it. Unsure if New Guy said they were my kids. Other coworker saw what was happening and also tried to tell her but she ignored him, too. My brother came back out front, saw what was happening, and said that the kids were there first. New Girl immediately saw my co-owner and apologised, and the kids ordered.

After that the kids went to sit down, she ordered, she got her drink and as she left she stopped by where my kids were sitting. Kids say that she told them that the cafe isn't for kids and that they'd held her up before she left.

Her probation ends on the 10th, which is tomorrow, when I'm meant to meet with her and either confirm that she has a permanent job with us or tell her that it won't work out.

WIBTA for firing her over this one incident that happened when she was off the clock?

&#x200B;

Edit: if it was any pair of random kids I'd never seen in my life, I'd react the same way (although I admit I might be being a bit overprotective in this case). We're family friendly, and try to be welcoming to families in general, she just happened to have the misfortune of it being my kids. To my knowledge the only shifts she's worked so far are shifts where kids aren't there (weekdays during school hours or first/last thing) so IDK how she interacts with kids while on the clock.

UPDATE

I asked a few people at work today what they thought of New Girl (which is standard for these reviews), and they just repeated the first set of comments, including them having to ask her multiple times to do a job, and then I asked if anything changes the last time she's told to do something, and who asks her. It looks like the last time she is asked to do things is the first time my brother asks, and the rest of the time if she's asked by a coworker then she doesn't do it.

I had the meeting with New Girl and I asked her about yesterday. She, proudly, said that the ""brats"" were ""ruining the atmosphere"" so she told them it was adults only. I corrected her that this is a family friendly establishment, we just happen to be near a university and so have a lot of students. I then told her I'd had feedback that she isn't a team player, and only listens to me and my brother, to which she replied ""you're the bosses"". I asked her to clarify and she said that as everyone else is part of a team, the team shouldn't be able to tell her what to do so she only took orders from me and my brother, not her other coworkers. I asked her what kind of stuff they asked her to do and from what she said there is no doubt in my mind that they have only asked her to do her assigned jobs.

I said that I was willing to write all this off as her training wheels, and that now she knows she won't do it again, and said I'd extend her probation by 10 days, but in those 10 days I had to see a change in attitude. I told her that I needed to know that in a family friendly cafe she could be friendly to families, and work with people.

I then ushered her back out onto the floor, and took my place behind the counter with her and New Guy. Half an hour later we ran out of caramel syrup. New Guy was busy cleaning asked New Girl to go get some more. New Girl ignored him for 10 minutes until he gave up and got it himself. I pulled her aside and reminded her that she needed to show she could work in a team. Later a mum and her kid come in. I recognise them as regulars and the mum is very nice. I tell New Girl to take over the till. The mum tells the kid to choose something and then orders a coffee, muffin, milkshake, and the kid, age 5, asks for a cake pop. I start mixing the milkshake while New Girl punches in the stuff the mum asked for, and doesn't put in the cake pop. The mum sees this and asks for it to be added to the order. New Girl says ""oh, sorry, I didn't think he was allowed it"". Mum says ""why wouldn't he be?"" and New Girl says ""well, he asked for it himself, you know what kids are like"". I immediately tell her to finish the drinks while I finish the order.

New Girl's shift finished at 12, but at 11:40 New Girl said that as the cafe was pretty quiet and she wanted to catch the early bus, she was thinking about leaving early. I was in a state of shock at that stage, because less than 2 hours before this I warned her that she had to be on the ball for the next 10 days, and instead she pissed off her coworker, pissed of a customer, and now was trying to leave early. I told her, fairly bluntly, that she'd be paid for the 10 days she'd worked but her probation wouldn't be extended and she wouldn't be hired properly. New Girl just left quietly.",187,930,0.95
1776,Not the A-hole,"My (16m) parents separated back in June for unknown reasons at the time, it took me by surprise as they always seemed so loving to eachother, and people would always tell them the  same thing. I also have a 12 year old sister and a new baby brother who was born in May. 

Back in April, my parents surprised my sister and I with tickets to Disneyland, we had never been before and it was there way of saying thank you to us for being understanding while my mom was  pregnant as to why we were never able to much during her pregnancy, ( my mom was really sick the whole way through, and in and out of the hospital with dehydration) it was also decided it would just be us and my dad, and my mom would stay home with the baby. We would be going at the end of August before School started again.

Fast forward to June, and my mom tells us my dad won't be living with us anymore and that they are separating,that they both love us and all that Jazz. My sister and I were really hurt by this as we have amazing parents, but I guess that's life.

2 weeks before we were to go on our trip, I was staying over with my dad (he's living with my uncle right now) and I overheard them talking about another women, and my uncle makes a comment about my dad being with a 20 something year old he had met at a bar and if the sex was worth losing his wife. 

I instantly felt ashamed and disgusted, my mom is the best person I know, and him doing that to her makes me actually feel sick to my stomach, I still hear her cry at night sometimes but she says she's fine 

I never really said much after I heard that to my dad, despite him asking what was wrong, when I got back to my mom's and heard her crying again while trying to get my brother to sleep, I decided I wasn't going to go on this trip, even though everything had been paid for. I told my mom I wanted to stay with her,  she tried to talk me out of it, but ended up respecting my decision.

My dad was crushed, and couldn't understand why I wasn't going and called me everyday trying to change my mind. Him and my sister ended up going, but my sister said she had a bad time because our dad was miserable about me not being there.

They came back a week ago and everything just sucks, my sister is still talking about her terrible trip, and my dad and I are hardly speaking. AITA

Edit: so my mom dropped my sister and my brother off at my grandma's and asked if she could take me out to a movie and some food, and apologized if she hasn't been there these last few months for me. I instantly broke and told her what I heard and she broke down, apologizing for not being honest with me, and that my dad doing this to her doesn't take away how good of a father he is .... I now feel more hatred towards my dad, I asked her not to tell him that I know, as that is a confrontation  I think I would like to eventually have myself, she promised not to say anything, but to remember that he is a good dad to me and my sister. I am supposed to see him this weekend, but my mom stands behind me if I don't feel comfortable going....

Edit: my mom told me that my dad did not leave her for this woman, just that she found out and left him, as for my sister, I don't see my mom having this conversation with her nor do I have any intentions of telling her, I have apologized to her for ""being weird"" as she put it,  (she thinks a girl dumped me) and I'm fine leaving it at that with her",148,683,0.96
1777,Everyone Sucks,"So I just started at a new company, and when I was bored I searched through the company's network and saw a few people I went to college with, including one girl who I dated in college.

The relationship ended amicably, and she sent me a heartfelt letter when she broke up with me because it was due to us both being too busy to make the relationship work.

Over the next year, we were both on a sports team and could never get along. We argued constantly, and the rest of the team knew we didn't get along, but didn't know we dated. 

When I found the friends in the company's network, I set up a day for all of us to get lunch. One person invited my ex without asking me.

When we met ready to leave, the person who invited her must have noticed my facial expression when he told me she was meeting us there, and asked why I was upset if she and I only ever argued on the team, and it probably would be fine now.

I explained that we had dated, so it probably wouldn't ever be great, particularly with the amount we'd have to be careful to keep every conversation in the workplace professional.

He lost his mind at the idea of her and I dating. He told the rest of the group, and everyone was in disbelief. It became the topic of the day, and they continued asking for details as we went to lunch.

When we got there, my ex denied ever dating me. She said I was lying, she would never date me, I wasn't her type, wasn't attractive enough, etc etc. As this was going on and my friends began to think I made it up, I pulled out my phone and read her letter she sent when she broke up with me that went on and on about how she loved me, saw us marrying someday, etc and then showed the group the picture of it with her signature at the bottom.

She began to cry, left the restaurant, and is now saying (a few hours later) that it was uncalled for and a breach of trust, but I don't see how her lying wasn't a breach of trust either. My friends seem torn about whose side to take. AITA?

Edit/INFO: No I don't have any pictures of us when we were dating. I have a new girlfriend now so I deleted all previous pictures with any exes. The only reason I had a picture of the note was because my friend at my previous apartment found them and sent pictures asking if I wanted him to mail them to me.

1782,Not the A-hole,"So this happened at the end of my last job, and I still wonder about it sometimes, because the whole thing was so surreal.

My former coworker, A, is trans.  There were never any issues at the office, and except for a tendency to overshare (no I don't want to know about your porn interests, coworker), we had a good working relationship.

Eventually, we all got laid off (tech industry, not THAT uncommon).  A bunch of us got together, dressed in fancy formalwear, and did a bar crawl to 'celebrate'.  A good time was had.

Near the end of the afternoon, when we were all pretty wasted (so forgive me, details are a little foggy), A asked me who told me she was trans.  Honestly I was kind of nonplussed, but after a short pause, said ""well, nobody.  I knew when we first met.""  She gave me a look as if I'd taken a shit in her cheerios, and was annoyed and distant the rest of the outing.

As I type this I come to the realization that her question even was pretty inappropriate, but I also realize that my answer was equivalent to saying that she in no way 'passed'.

1785,Not the A-hole,"Very recently, my SO (40m) started bringing me (25f) and my kid (5m) from a previous relationship, to their family gatherings. Now he has a nephew (7m) who's obese and does not talk at all. I met the kid's family already but this is the first time I am bringing my kid.

My kid is a friendly child while on the other hand, the nephew is kind of a bully. I mean everyone in the family admits to it. Naturally, my kid went to the kid to play. At first, they were playing ok but after 15 minutes my kid came to me crying saying that the nephew pushed him over. I brushed it off at first and told my kid that it was an accident. He understood so he came back to the nephew to play again. After an hour, my kid came to me and said he's scared to go near my SO's nephew because he presses his weight on him and that my son couldn't breathe while he sits on top of him. The nephew is more than double my kid's weight.

I told what happened to my SO and he said that that's just how his nephew horse around. He said that he's like that when he becomes fond of the kid he plays with. I told my SO that I am not ok with that but he looked at me like I was overreacting. I also told the mother of the nephew what happened but she just shrugged it off and basically told me that my kid's fine and they were just playing. Every one in my So's family seem to think that the kid is okay but to me, he needs help.

Now the kid is already 7 but does not speak at all. He just gestures for whatever he wants. Also, the fact that he pushes people around and sits on top of them got me thinking that the kid could have a spectrum of autism. Of course that is not for me to diagnose so I told my SO that they need to get the kid checked so we'll know what type of care he needs. Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there. My SO and his family think that I am a dick because I don't trust them and this is a huge deal-breaker for us.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I asked my SO why the kid is not speaking at his age but they all didn't know. So no diagnosis yet. The kid has not been checked for anything and they solution for it is to have the kid enrolled in a school so he can have some sort of an interaction. I don't know how well he does in the school. I just want SO's nephew to have all the help that he needs so he can grow normal. We all have to admit that any 7 y/o that is completely silent and is not deaf, isn't normal.

Also, I appreciate all the replies.

Until then, I refuse to bring my kid to any family gatherings if I knew the nephew will be there.

I am not saying that he gets tested specifically for Autism, I am only saying that he needs to have medical intervention so we'll know how we can help the nephew further to be better. Also, I do not want to bring my kid anymore because my son is the only kid there within the nephew's age group and I don't want him to feel isolated because my son is scared of going near him.

1786,Not the A-hole,"I'm coming to reddit for this because I feel incredibly guilty, but for obvious reasons I can't go to my best friend with this. When my friend and I were in high school, I came out as gay. He always has been my closest friend and he was incredibly supportive. Our other, female, friend was not, but she eventually came around. During college, the two of them shacked up and got married a bit after. All three of us have been close our entire lives. 

A few weeks after her 35th birthday, she was diagnosed with a life-ending disease (trying to keep this vague). Over the next few months she got worse and worse until there was almost no hope. 

While visiting her in the hospital without her husband one day, close to the end, she confessed something to me. Apparently, the reason she was upset when I came out was that she was in love with me. She always had been and always would be. She said that she couldn't bear the thought of me being with a man and that her husband was a consolation price until I was free and ready. She even asked me if I felt the same.

We ended up talking for a bit because I was so confused. I felt honestly bad for this dying woman who spent half her life waiting for me. I knew she didn't have much time left anyway, so I feigned interest and told her some kind words about loving her back and kissed her. She was my friend and I wanted her to die happy.

She died the next week.

Now, it's a few months later and I can't help but feel like I violated my friendship. I don't want to tell him and reveal that his entire relationship was a lie but the guilt is insane. The way he talks about this woman breaks my heart.

1791,Asshole,"My \[31f\] husband \[33m\] is a professional dog walker. He's been walking dogs for about 4-5 years and has regular clients, and gets new clients all the time. He works for a local dog walking service - not like Wag but a more concierge and personal service. I would estimate he makes about $5,000 - 7,500 annually from this job. He also primarily takes clients when they go out of town - he's not a regular dog walker day to day for people, if that makes sense.

He also has another full time job managing a local clothing store.  So dog walking is not his main source of income, although he loves doing it.

The August and September months are incredibly busy months for him, as this is when people tend to go out of town. I've seen him maybe an hour a day for the last four weeks. And that hour is not quality time, as he gets home and is exhausted after working a full time job and walking a ton of dogs, and just wants to go to bed.

It's really taking a strain on our relationship. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a needy person. But we've been together for over 5 years, married for 2, and he knows this about me. And I've been patient.

I was really excited because he said that the dogs were winding down now and we made some plans with friends and to go out to dinner, but I found out he took three more clients over the next two weeks. So, the plans are essentially caput. And the thing is, once November comes around, he's pretty much booked solid with dogs again until January because of the holidays.

He's admitted that he knows I miss him and want to spend more time with him, but he can't say no to needy dogs. But there are plenty of dog walkers!

One other thing - we are also in debt. Lots of credit card debt. He puts almost all the money toward paying off his credit cards, which is great. I make more than him in my full time job, so I don't need this additional income.

All I want is one weekend together. One weekend where he doesn't walk anyone's dogs. But he can't seem to say no.

So, WIBTA if I asked him to arrange for a sub one of the upcoming weekends so we could spend some quality time together?

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm the asshole. I would never ask him to stop entirely. But I need to remind myself this is his way of paying down his debt.

Edit 1: Long time lurker, first time poster, so I didn't get how titles worked. The title should be ""WIBTA if I ask him for a weekend off""

Edit 2: I can't go on walks with him because it's against the contracts of his clients - only he can walk the dogs

Edit 3: We both are paying down our own credit cards - he needed this side job because he makes less income than me. But we are both paying down our debt, which we have the same amount of, at equal rates - him with his side job, me with my regular job.

Edit 4: I'm getting many wonderful suggestions to ask him to schedule around a date night or something. But I have, and he doesn't. We did make plans, but we will now have to cancel them because he took more dogs. It does seem he puts the dogs/his clients schedules first, which makes sense for that business.",23,42,0.88

1793,Not the A-hole,"So a buddy of mine lives in a condo - the parking is severely limited. Some people have driveways, some have an assigned parking spot, there's street parking which also gets extremely packed on the weekends. I have literally seen visitors spots disappearing before my eyes. They're painting over them and giving other people extra spots.

So it's about 10:30pm and I'm driving down his street and not surprisingly I don't see any spots. I do another loop and still nothing. I check one last spot and tell myself if there's nothing there I'll double back and check the street (which was packed seeing as how it was saturday night).

I pull up and find a spot, huzzah! Only problem is there's an asian woman standing in the center of it. Now I realize possession is 9/10ths of the law but I was upset. I'm not a confrontational person but I had to say something. This woman claimed they have two cars and only one assigned spot. I told her that wasn't my problem and that this spot was clearly marked and labeled VISITOR and, clearly, they are not visitors.

I told her she didn't care about her fellow neighbors and citizens and literally offered to come find her and give her my number or contact her when I left (I was staying an hour or two max) all which I explained to her. She wasn't having it and was being insufferable. Refused to move an inch, refused to apologize, kept repeating ""no, this my spot go away. no you go away""

I ended up leaving but not after giving her a few harsh words (that all were directly related to her selfishness and had nothing to do with her ethnicity, sex, or some other obscure irrelevant insult)

So.. AITA?

Edit: I didn't even think mentioning her ethnicity mattered I was just being descriptive and was a bit shocked this 4'11 Asian lady was so brave. It's the second most common descriptive trait. 1) gender 2) ethnicity. That's it. Nothing ominous people I swear",105,411,0.91
1794,No A-holes here,"Edit/Update:

The moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

I know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.

I spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

I have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

They agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

However, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

I reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

I need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

I don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

I'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

I also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.

Thanks everyone.


This is the original story:

This has quite literally fractured my family.

I have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

My divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

Over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

I have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

This was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.

Also, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

The major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

My older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.

Part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.

And now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.

He is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.

This was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

I'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

My oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

Our Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

He accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.

Should I have done all this differently?",5426,18379,0.91

Edit: Additional info. When this happened I was not mentally stable and was in and out of rehab, I hated myself and hated the idea of having kids that were like me. This changed over the years, that's when the guilt started

1799,No A-holes here,"I work for a large company and I’m located in a different state than my boss and the rest of my team. It’s been this way for about 3 years and I haven’t met them in person. We have weekly team meetings over the phone, and I have one on ones with my boss periodically. She’s been mentioning how she want me to fly to their location so I can meet the team, but I really don’t want to go. I don’t want to have to travel and be away from my family just so we can all go to dinner together. Plus I’m a fairly introverted person, and I’m ok with not having a closer personal relationship to them. 

I think she feels like I feel left out, but I’ve already told her that being remote doesn’t bother me at all. I think in the corporate world it’s common to have people working in different locations, and not meeting in person doesn’t affect how the job gets done. I don’t really know how to tell her that I don’t want to go. So, AITA?

Edit: These comments make a lot of sense. Thanks for the feedback! Maybe I should have mentioned that the reason I am remote is because a larger company bought out my smaller company a few years ago. Most of the people in my current office have managers and teams that are in another state, and a lot of them haven’t met in person either.

1800,No A-holes here,"My 11 year old hates to move.  He's got some minor motor control issues that make him a bit uncoordinated. He's also physically weak and skinny compared to other boys his age. So any type of physical activity makes him uncomfortable. He shows no interest in sports, he hates hiking, and still hasn't learned to ride a bike because it freaks him out. I'm concerned about his complete lack of physical activity. Except for his weekly 1/2 hour swim class and whatever they did in gym class in elementary school twice a week, he's very sedentary.

When he was  little I put him in a Tae Kwon Do class, which he enjoyed because at that level it's mostly just running around playing games. Once he had to start focusing and putting in an effort to use his muscles, it became very difficult for him and he started falling behind the other kids. It eventually became very frustrating for both of us -- he hated the class, I hated having to deal with his tears and stubbornness before every class. So I pulled him out of the class and he did other  activities that he actually enjoyed (drama, robotics, creative writing -- nothing physical)

So now that he's starting middle school, I've signed him up for a martial arts class. He goes twice a week, still has his swimming once a week, and will have gym class every day. I figure this is an acceptable amount of physical activity for a growing kid. The school that I've put him in gets raves from the other parents for how well they treat the kids, so I'm not worried that they will push him too hard for his skill level. His best friend also goes to this same studio (at a much higher belt level), and his mom says it's been very good for him (he and my son have similar coordination/focus issues).

But my son hates it. He fought with me to the point of tears when I told him I was signing him up. He goes to the classes and participates, but very reluctantly and he complains about it a lot. Its been a few weeks and he's gotten used to the routine, but he still hates it. I know that forcing a kid to do something they don't want is generally a big parenting no-no, but there is literally no physical activity that he is willing to participate in.

SO AITA for forcing my son to do something he hates?

ETA: He only cried in the beginning when I told him I was signing him up. He doesn't cry any more, but he still doesn't like the class, even though his friend is in the same class. I've also stopped sitting in the waiting room even though driving back and forth twice is a pain int he ass, because he doens't want me watching him.

Second edit: On our way to swimming, he says ""I don't think I can do this swimming class anymore. It's too tiring."" He recently leveled up and this level is more rigorous than previous ones.",135,140,0.91
1801,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time poster. On mobile so please forgive me. 
So my BF is an electrician and enjoys his work. However he's had a bad history of ""job hopping"". He's made some bad judgment calls in the past that have given us some financial strains and really put our relationship to the test. There have been times where we barely had enough money to pay bills. I've been working consistently for 5 years (at a job that I hated) and for the longest time was our sole breadwinner. I've had to help dig us out of these holes that I felt that he caused due to his unreliability. We've talked about him needing to find a job that offers good pay and benefits and sticking with it. He agreed with me and found work at a company paying him more than what he's actually qualified for. We just recently had a baby and I went on short term disability because my work doesn't offer paid maternity leave. I was also on leave for 12 weeks so needless to say, he became the breadwinner and we both relied heavily on his paycheck to support us and our baby from day to day. I just received the last of my SD checks last week so every penny counts right now. 

Recently, I've been asking how works seems to be going and he just gives me ""fine."" No worries then. Then one week he missed two days in a row and said it was because he had sick time saved up. He was also going to be starting work 30 minutes later than his normal schedule. Fair enough. Last week on Tuesday he tells me out of nowhere that he is now going to a new job site on the complete opposite side of town and is going to be getting up an hour earlier instead. This raised some red flags for me. He still stonewalls me when I ask how work has been and changes the subject rather quickly. Tonight while he slept I went onto his phone I checked his email and saw that he had applied for a new company and actually started working the new job Wednesday. 

My dilemma: rent is coming up this week for our apartment and he kept mentioning that we might need to ask family for some help, cash wise. Two weeks ago he told me we were going to be okay, and I know things happen but I can't help but feel that because he started this new job he's going to make us short of cash due to the fact that most places hold the first weeks check and pay the next week. And I just started working from home (quit that job I hated and working part time hours) so I can help contribute to our household funds but am not sure if I will be paid this week so I feel like we might be screwed. It hurts me that he'd not only not tell me about even considering finding another job but to deliberately go behind my back and find a new one and also put us in another strain financially. As his partner I'd hoped that he'd discuss this with me first so we could talk this out.
I really want to confront him about it. But that would also mean that I have to tell him I went through his phone. It doesn't feel good for me to have done that. AITA here?",38,103,0.92

1807,Not the A-hole,"So this last saturday i went out drinking with my partner (let's call him S) and a bunch of our mutual friends. We went to multiple different bars and throughout the evening i had a glass of wine, two ciders and a beer. He wanted me to stop drinking after the first cider. Our friends kept telling me i didn't have to listen to him about not drinking.

I'm a bit of a lightweight and got a bit buzzed (the beer was going to be the last drink for me that evening) and planned on sticking with my friends until i sobered up a little and no longer felt like being there. When drinking my beer S took the glass out of my hands and told me to stop drinking because we were going to head home for the evening. We live an hour apart from each other.

I decided to finish drinking up my beer which greatly upset him and he kept being rude to me. He didn't let me have a choice because according to him i would just keep drinking which i shouldn't do because according to him i was shitfaced (i wasn't). My friends asked us why we were leaving and i answered truthully telling them that S was making me go home.

I called him the next day and we had a fight which to sum it up was me trying to explain to him that i'm an adult who can take care of herself and don't need him to make my decisions for me and him telling me that i'm obviously acting like a child and that i HAVE to promise him i'll stop drinking when he tells me to stop drinking. He hung up the phone on me while i was talking and blocked me on everything. He always flees during our fights and acts very manipulative only to show up at my place during the week and tell me why he's right and i'm wrong.

I need to know if i'm actually the bad guy here it's tiresome to have him constantly act this way.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok so some of you think we drove around ect, neither of us own a driving license much less a car, sorry for not including that bit of INFO. As for those of you telling me there might be a reason he acts that way there definitely is. When i was writing this i was pretty distraught about the situation but after calming down a bit i remebered that some of his friends have passed out after drinking and things i don't want to mention have happened to them. 

He himself have gotten so drunk that he passed out as well and a girl was trying to take advantage of him as well (luckily one of his friends was there and stopped it before it escalated). I've also had depression and had a tendency to either over eat or eat too little, i guess he's just scared i'll start abusing alcohol the way i used to abuse food.",61,38,0.82
1808,Asshole,"So context: 

Its a special table that I'm just stupidly attached to. A couple months ago my manager passed away unexpectedly and it really hit me hard. He was my best friend at work and honestly I saw him as an older brother. We were really close for co workers and I'd only known him for a little over two years, which I know isn't much but working 8 hours together for 5 days a week really adds up. 

He sat at this one table everyday for all of our breaks. It never changed, that was his table. Everyone who works in this building knew it and kind of just respected that once he passed. We had another man that join our crew a few months before the passing and this guy never liked my manager. It was constant shit talking and back talk. 
And now, whenever he has the chance to he sits at that table. It's maybe a few times a month since he doesn't work on our side of the building. 

I usually bite my tongue cause rationally, that's  just a stupid table and anyone should be able to sit there. But to me it's /his/ table. 

Today the man was throwing a kind of joking fit, nothing serious because at my work we tip chairs and tables over all the time to mess with each other. But today he tipped that table. 

So I blew up at him, I screamed at him for tipping /his/ table over and for sitting in it these past few months. I told him to fuck off and never take his break there again, among a couple other things regarding his respect. 

A couple of my other co workers were there when it happened and they all just stood there. The guy left without saying a word and my co workers didn't say anything until break was over. It was insanely awkward. 

Now people are just pretending it never happened. 
I feel like I was pretty damn justified because everyone else knows that's /his/ table and we've all had this kind of silent agreement to never sit there. 

But things are awkward and I don't know if they think I was out of line. Obviously I could've told the guy it a more gentler way, but it just happened like that.  AITA?



EDIT: I'm getting the sense that I was a complete and utter douche ahhah 

I know rationally it's just a table and I shouldn't be attached to it like I am, but I'm so hyper focused on it. Like it's not even the same damn table, these things have been shifted around so often I'm positive that he probably never sat at the one that's in his place now. But to me it's still his because it's in his spot. I feel the same way over his other equipment even though I know it's not his. His cleaning cart with all his dumb stickers on it, or the vacuum that he scribbled all over all still feel like his and I know it belongs to the company but it just doesn't feel like that. 

He committed suicide almost 6 months ago to the day and I thought I'd been handling it like how anyone else would but obviously I was wrong about that.  Taking a step back and actually looking at it as a whole picture, I really haven't move past this at all. I cried last week when a candy bar was stuck in the vending machine because he was always the one to shake it loose. 

A lot of you guys are saying I should go to grief counseling so I'm going to look into it. I thought that kinda stuff was just for the initial month or so afterwards but I guess not. I'm afraid everyone will forget him, me included, but obviously this isn't healthy.",61,342,0.9
1809,Not the A-hole,"My dad has been with this woman for seven years now and for as long as I've known her she's never had a normal job. She's always jumped from one ""internet business"" this to an ""affiliate marketing"" that. Most recently, she's got involved with a new MLM, which of course she's super excited about. She's one of those people that posts ""inspirational"" quotes on Facebook every day just to put you in the picture. It drives me nuts but I ignore it.

As someone that did Amway for a while a few years ago I know all about the business structure and the way these MLMs operate. I'm not one of those people that say ""they're cancer to society"" and all that (met heaps of those people) but having spent a full year ""chasing my dreams"" and realising I wasn't getting anywhere I knew it wasn't meant to be for me. I bowed out with no regrets, having given it a good shot.

Fast forward to last night, I have my dad and her over for dinner. They just got back from a ""business trip"" I avoided asking about all night. My dad knows about my views and experiences with MLMs so he didn't bring it up but the whole time his partner kept skirting around the topic, alluding to all these ""great times"" they had on this trip they just got back from. Eventually I gave in and asked how it was. Big mistake.

The next half hour was nothing but an advertisment campaign for this new MLM she's doing and how great it is and how I should join. I ended up making a bit of a dick out of myself by bringing up all the experiences I had, how there were countless people I met saying the exact same things she was, and how she even said the exact same thing before about other ventures she'd done. Needless to say, the rest of the night was pretty awkward and was littered with me being passive aggressive about it, calling out her BS on certain things, and wishing I could leave my own house.

Today I was texting my dad about something unrelated and he brings up that I hurt her feelings and they might not come over again for a while. My first thought was ""thank fuck for that!"" which I feel kinda shitty about it, as I still want a relationship with my dad, I just don't want anything to do with his partner while she's involved in a MLM.

So, this happened a couple of days ago, and it stirred up a lot of controversy within his (my dad's) family and coworkers, and he is wanting to find out, what you, the fine people of reddit, think about this situation.

My dad (64m) we'll refer to my dad as ""Marty"" now, Marty owns a restaurant and he had a couple come in for dinner (A woman and a man) and they happened to get engaged that night, at the reastaurant.

Marty is a very social person, and will talk to anyone. So, he went up to the couple (apparently the guy was in the bathroom at the time) and he went to congratulate the woman with ""Congratulations on your engagement sweetie!"" Apparently she turned around and had a go at him ""you can't call me that"" ""that's so sexist"" ""I'm really offended"" etc.

Marty was very upset by this because he was being genuine and didn't understand why she felt so hurt. But he was very upset about this and turned around to this woman's fiancee saying ""Good luck on the engagement! You're going to need it!""

Now, I tried to explain to my dad that we're in a different era now, but, of course, it falls on deaf ears!

So, we've taken it to reddit, is he TA?

Edit 1: A commenter made me realise that I probably should note that Marty's memory is extremely bad. He constantly forgets names and I know for a fact that a lot of the time he \*does\* use names like ""sweetie"", ""darling"", ""mate"" etc when he can't remember someone's name but doesn't want to be impolite. This isn't to excuse anything, I just thought i wonder if that should be noted?

Edit 2: Marty doesn't have dementia - He just has a shockingly bad memory

My parents are old and old-fashioned, but very open-minded and have no issues with my future BIL being gay. I always thought my older sister (42F) felt the same way. However since my fiancé and I got engaged and after I asked her to be bridesmaid, she has made some thinly-veiled comments about his brother’s sexuality. I always defend BIL when these comments are made and the conversation moves on, but she keeps passing remarks. She only ever says anything in front of me and her nuclear family (her husband and kids) - to my knowledge she has never said anything in front of our parents or my fiancé.

1812,Not the A-hole,"So, for context I have never had much of a relationship with my paternal grandmother. She was a shitty mom and her sons all grew up with various issues due to her terrible parenting. When I did see her as a kid it was always with my parents there (I think she babysat me all of about five times my entire childhood for a few hours at a time if my parents couldn't find anyone else.) and she'd make comments about my weight and how big my breasts were, or how if I wanted a good life I should marry a wealthy man. To this day she misspells my very common name and calls my sister by the WRONG name entirely. She 's always been rude to my mother, who was only ever nice to her in return. When my parents would argue when I was a kid, it nearly always was because she was calling my dad and asking for money or wanting him to ""do something about"" his brothers. 

My dad passed away five years ago and I saw her at the funeral and three times since. I am in my thirties and I have six children and she's never even met the youngest. Now she's older and has health problems and my uncle has started messaging me and heavily hinting that he wants help taking care of her. I want no part of it. He has one living brother still and I have seven other cousins who were all around her far more than I ever was but I'm the oldest and I have a ton of kids, so surely taking care of one more person shouldn't be an issue for me, in their minds. This uncle literally NEVER has any contact with me unless he's asking for something, usually to do with her. 

I feel like I have never had much of a relationship with this woman, and what I did have was stressful at best.

1815,Asshole,"I’ll try to give as much background as possible so that you lovely strangers can judge the situation properly.

I (M29) started dating my gf (F27) three months ago. To be honest the relationship was kind of rushed (we had sex on our first date) as we have only known each other for 6 months, but we both agreed things felt different than past partners and so we went for it.

Within the first 2 weeks of meeting she told me that she would be moving 1,000 miles away in the fall to another state to finish her masters degree. She had already been accepted before she met me.  I never had a problem with this and we openly talked about trying long distance and if that went well she could transfer back so we could be together.

Well after 3 months of dating she’s now 1,000 miles away and within her first week has started school and is working a part time job. Prior to moving there she only knew a friend of a friend who she will be living with and outside of that she does not know that many people. Although she does not know hardly anyone, she has been extremely distant ever since she left about a week ago.

We texted a little throughout the day as I didn’t want to bother her while she was working her new job. Just sweet nothings mostly. After her shift however, she told me that she was going to get dinner with her male co-worker. Which she has known for 1 day. And while I appreciated her honesty I was a little skeptical as it was midnight and she’s in a new city with a total stranger. I tried calling her to get more info and see how her day was, to which she ignored my phone call twice. She texted me back saying that I was being too pushy, and she would call me when she got home.

Her response set me off and we got into an argument that spiraled way out of control. After some back and forth bickering I called her a slut and she completely lost it. 

Now we are broken up and not speaking. In hindsight I shouldn’t have called her a slut just because I was raised better than that. But in the moment I was just so angry and hurt.

My post history has an in-depth explanation but, in short, my MIL has blatantly expressed that she WILL NOT respect rules and boundaries that DH and I have put in place for our daughter. She also was very disrespectful to me, my physical wellbeing and, most importantly, the well being of my child in my later stages of pregnancy. My fear is that, by naming my future child after GFIL, my MIL will view this as an invitation to weasel her way into our parenting decisions.

I do not actually like said name. I would happily use it as a middle name but it is a very old fashioned name that I don’t believe would suit a child.

My father’s name has been in his family for generations. My generation is the first to not have an boys and, after a recent health scare that my father had, I’ve realised how important it is to name my son after my father.

So.. WIBTA if I didn’t use GFIL’s name as a first name for my future child? As I said, I would certainly use it as a middle name but I am beginning to dread the idea of having a son as I just can’t bring myself to like this name!",77,158,0.86
1819,Asshole,"Pretty sure I'm the asshole but not sure:

Freshman year, which was 3 years ago, I (17F) was in a loop of loneliness, social discomfort, and feeling uninteresting. I thought I wasn't intriguing and that's why I didn't have many friends. Then, my best friend at the time came out to me and told me she liked me. I sat on it for a few days and decided (stupidly) to say yes. I think I just wanted the attention of being the gay couple in a catholic school. I came out to my parents which was difficult but manageable for them.

Turns out I don't like girls. We dated for 5 months and I felt nothing romantically or sexually about her in that time, but I kept with it out of guilt. We had sex but I never enjoyed it. Eventually, we harshly went our separate ways and I've only dated guys since.

However, my parents are extra and whenever something in the news happens with the LGBT community, my parents tell me all about it. My mom took me to pride this summer and I felt like I was an imposter. I'm not bi but I don't want to hurt them by telling them I lied for 3 years. It was really hard for my dad to fully support me and I don't want his work to be in vain.

1820,Not the A-hole,"Husband hasn’t been working since Jan-Feb. We have 1 bird 2 cats 0 children. We moved into our place in November and he has had an odd job here and there but I mostly handle all of the bills myself including insurance.

My commute is an hour both ways so I’m ultimately out of the house for 11-12 hours a day. When I get home I don’t mind cooking a bit or doing minor chores. That being said, sometimes he says he’s going to do these things but when I get home he says he “didn’t have time” or “didn’t feel like it today”. Half the time I end up doing it on a weekend, even though I’ve given him $ for the chores (laundry quarters because we don’t have a washer or $ to take the cat to the vet for shots) which I get back 1/2 the time. This week I finally hired a laundry service. I budgeted for next week to hire a cleaning service.

Last Monday as it was a holiday I was home with him on a day I would typically be working. He slept/laid in bed until 3:30 pm. It was the final straw for me.

Today I woke him up at 11 am (I “slept in” and woke up at 8). I asked him if he would help me clean the kitchen and do the yard work today. He agreed but said “I’m not doing the dishes though, there’s a pan in there that’s been in there for days and it stinks”. I agreed to do the dishes but when I came to the pan (which I washed), I turned to him (still sitting at the kitchen table, as he was still trying to wake up) and said, “I will wash this, but I don’t feel as if I should have to. You cooked in this pan days ago and you’ve been home every day since then, yet here it sits.” He got defensive which led to me saying, “I feel like if one partner is working full time and paying all the bills, it’s pretty unfair to expect them to come home and take care of all of the chores as well. If I have to support you, you should support me as well.”

He responded by saying he felt like he felt poorly about not “being able to provide” and that I was just “trying to make [him] feel bad” and that he didn’t feel like he should be the “designated ‘housebitch’”. 

Now, while I understand I could have used different language, the fury that I felt (“HOUSEBITCH”?) was enough for me to ask him to just please leave until I calm down. He went back to bed and stayed there until 5 PM.

I know he feels sensitive about not working, and that he never intended to be a “stay-at-home husband” but the reality is, that’s where we are at. That being said, the language I used was almost demanding and entitled. Am I the asshole for not being more understanding of his feelings?",108,182,0.92

1822,Not the A-hole,"So I live in a household where gaming is a big thing. Everyone games, including me (though I'm the most 'casual' gamer). There are four of us that come into play for this post:

* Me: 20f. I do have anxiety, which becomes relevant later and which I am seeing a therapist for. I don't tend to get angry at games.
* Older brother: 25m. He uses games to vent his frustrations, but is understanding that his yelling can get a little loud and encourages people to let him know if he's bothering them (something which I find hard to do regardless because of anxiety).
* Younger brother: 19m. Doesn't yell at games too often, and is usually quite muted about it so that parents don't hear him swearing.
* Younger brother's BF: 19m. Has been yelling at games a lot more recently with some updates to Smash, and can get very loud for long periods of time. He's almost always here except when he's sleeping, and even sometimes when he is sleeping, to the point that he's basically a resident.

Recently, we actually created a rule to 'stop getting angry at videogames', because the yelling with all three of the guys was getting out of control. Important to note: I didn't come up with the rule, but I was a vocal supporter of it when Older Bro made it. The rule doesn't really effect me, since I don't really get vocally mad at videogames.

In practice, the rules has basically turned into us being able to pick each other up if the yelling and screaming gets to be too much. It's helped me in particular, since yelling tends to set off my anxiety, and my room is literally right across the hall from the room with all the consoles in it. Being able to just knock on the door and remind whoever is yelling of the rule is a lot less anxiety-inducing than having an unscripted conversation about it every time.

Even so, I do feel bad for telling someone who is already upset to quiet down for my own emotional needs, especially since I'm the only one enforcing the rule anymore. So, AITA for enforcing a rule that everyone else seems to have forgotten?

EDIT TO ADD: They don't get mad at me when I remind them of the rule, the worst I've gotten is a frustrated 'yeah, okay, but look at how bullshit this is' from them. The guilt is more coming from myself, since I don't wanna be the emotion police.",20,23,0.72

1824,Asshole,"I don't know if NSFW posts are allowed here and if not, sorry for posting it.

I'm a photographer, most of my portfolio is weddings, portraiture, things of that nature, but a few years ago a friend asked me to do boudoir/erotic photography for her and I thought why not? This friend is part of a community (Fetlife) and if I do a good job, maybe she can refer me to some of her friends. It turns out I did a great job, so much so that I shoot something like that once a week or so.

Things are pretty clear about consent, boundaries, etc. My wife's in the know, she's cool with it as long as it stays strictly professional, and it has. I have a profile on that website where I can post my portfolio. My release form states I can use them commercially and keep every single photo I take.

A new client asked me last week what happens to the photos after I send them to her and I told her outright I keep them as it states in the release I have everyone sign. She off the cuff asks me if I ever masturbate to the photos and I wasn't going to lie, so I said sure, sometimes. It's just photos. She wasn't happy about this and we didn't end up doing the shoot.

I never really thought about what others would think what I do privately but I can kind of see her point of view. Maybe it's a little slimy but it doesn't hurt anyone. It's literally just photos and it's done in private. My wife doesn't care, I asked some other photographers and they said people are sometimes even flattered if you do.

I don't know. Am I the asshole?

edit: just for those OOTL on what Fetlife is, it's a BDSM/fetish social media site. People post the photos I take of them publicly for everyone to see. I'm sure most people on that website use it for self gratification.",102,101,0.85

1828,No A-holes here,"The fence between our house and the neighbor’s directly behind us fell over on a particularly windy day. Evidently the grass had overgrown the cement and it caused the posts to rot quickly. 

My dad came over to help us assess the damage and we decided the slats were still usable. Good news because we could repair this relatively easy on our own and save some money. While we were out there our neighbor came out and introduced himself. He was cordial, and said “I’ve already got a guy coming to look at it and give us an estimate. Then we can split the cost halfway.” I said “that’s fine but we were thinking we could have my brother come over, fix it ourselves, and only have to pay the cost of materials.” He didn’t really respond to that, other than just saying, “ok well how about you have your guy look and we’ll have ours, and then we’ll compare estimates.” I was willing to hear the estimate, so we left it at that. 

Later, my brother comes over to look at the fence himself and start digging out the old cement (I didn’t know he was coming, and my wife and I were both at work). Evidently he met our neighbor who told him that they really wanted the new fence to match this premium wood they have their side fences. My brother told him we were trying to save money, and neighbor apparently offered to set up a payment plan as a compromise. Whether anything else was said, idk. 

About one week after the initial encounter we come home and there is a proud new fence staring at me. We never heard an offer, never agreed to anything, and obviously didn’t install it ourselves. At first I was mad because I thought they’d come by asking for money, but they never did. We haven’t even seen him since. I feel bad that we get to enjoy a brand new fence and didn’t chip in, but I also don’t think it would have been fair since he ignored what we wanted. AITA?

1829,Asshole,"I know the title makes me sound like an asshole and maybe I am. This is why I’m asking here. 

So my ex and I split 5 years ago. We have a 12 year old daughter together. I have custody but she spends her summers with her dad and his new wife (married 5 months ago). She now has two step sisters (teens) as well.

While I’m on okayish terms with my ex I do not get along with his wife at all, for reasons I’d rather not blather on about here. Anyways the issue is this: she’s half Chinese and is teaching her daughters Chinese during the summers. When my daughter lived there these past few months, she’s been learning alongside them. 

I’ve tolerated it in the beginning but it’s become something that’s grown to bother me a lot. For one thing, my daughter has been learning Spanish since she was in 2nd grade. She now wants to drop this language altogether for Chinese (they offer this class starting in 7th grade) as soon as she can. This really bothers me because I speak Spanish fluently (learned in schools, not native) and I was looking forward to sharing this language with her.

She now wants to chat in broken Chinese to her step sisters who she looks up to because they’re “cool teenaged girls” who go to parties and all that. Which makes me think this is all just a phase. Furthermore I just don’t think Chinese should take over the Spanish she’s been learning already. We live in Georgia. Spanish will be FAR more useful to her here than Chinese ever will. 

I haven’t outright forbid her from learning but I have been vocal in my disappointment. My daughter apparently told her step sisters and my ex as well, and now he’s furious at me for “driving a wedge between her and everyone else because I’m jealous.” I’m not jealous at all, but I feel like no one else really gets where I’m coming from and thinks it’s a non-issue.

1830,Everyone Sucks,"My (now ex) wife and I were together for 19 years. We have 4 children together. Our marriage wasn't great, and ending it was reasonable enough. I didn't want the divorce but I was ok with it. I had personal failings, so did my ex. I've accepted a ton of the blame but got the blandest of acknowledgements from her about her own failings. Starting in january she would be gone all bizarre hours - ostensibly ""working"". Having so much solo parenting time (all 4 kids under 10) was wrecking me. I confronted her and she said she wanted a divorce. Fine. I come to learn her friend ""Cole"" admitted he had feelings for her at Christmas time and she fell for him. I only tolerating Cole being around because they worked together a lot and just about everyone was sure he was gay (myself included). I cycle through what hurts the most about the situation, but right now the main focus is that this fucking douchebag continued to come to my house for things like a new years party, and a superbowl party. All under false pretenses. He didn't want to hang out with everyone in the house. Just my wife, my kids. He came to more of their baseball games than their grandparents did.

He came into my house when it was just him and my wife. He came into my house and gave gifts to my kids, AFTER he confessed his feelings. Adult relationships are complicated I get that. I was ridiculously mad at first, but got over it over fairly quickly. The way she treated me as a babysitter infuriated me, but now that the decree is finalized, I can't help but go back and think about how much it hurts that he came into my house under false pretenses. That my wife invited him in. You know, if I got divorced and they became a thing? Fine, he's a nice enough guy. But stay the fuck away from my kids and my house until shit shit settles. But he didn't do that, he was around all the time, including after they started fucking. 

Lately, I can't control myself and I'll post pictures of him sneaking into my house that I took with a security camera on twitter. A story about Ilhan Omar seducing a man and going into his house and giving gifts to his kids kinda set myself off again. So I posted to twitter about my personal ""Ilhan"". and what his name is and where he works (he's an attorney for kids, so is my exwife). BTW - they're both endanger of an ethics complaint because they works as opposing counsel on the same side AFTER he confessed his feelings for her.

Suddenly this lady (in her late 40’s id guess)  goes in front of everyone in line and went up to the cashier, threw her arms up and said “MAYBE YOU GUYS NEED TO
OPEN ANOTHER REGISTER, HUH??” In a really rude tone. Then screamed at the cashier how ridiculous this was. The manager handled it well and said both employees were in training so they could only have 1 register open. The lady kept talking and being rude and I yelled oh shut the f- up, and started talking to my husband loudly that she was a typical entitled rude customer who probably wants a gift card and talked about how if she was in such a rush maybe she should have planned her day better. I didn’t say it to her directly but loud enough so she could hear, and she kept glaring at me. Others in line heard and chuckled because everyone thought she was rude, another customer in front of me even told
The cashier she was sorry for how rude the lady was being.

We agreed to see the movie with her 10 year old because he is also a fan of horror. (Mom's choice, so whatever). So I sent her a fb message today asking when she wanted to go. She replies telling me that she hasn't had enough quality time with her 10 year old, so they went to see it themselves.

1836,Not the A-hole,"So, basically, this took place a few weeks ago.

My family and I (28) were visiting my sister (37) and her husband and kids. My sister and I have never had the smoothest of relationships, hence we've never been close. However, when she had kids, things seemed to have calmed down between the two of us... Or so I thought.

So, we arrived at my sister's house, things seemed normal, she was talking to my family, I said hello to my sister, brother in law, and the kids. My dad was making coffees for everyone, and I was making my own. I specifically took out two spoons, because I know my sister is really particular about stuff like that and as I like my coffee sweet, I like to try it and see if it's sweet enough etc. So, I tried my coffee, and decided that it wasn't sweet enough but to my dismay, one of the teaspoons that I had got out of the drawer went missing, I freaked out because my I tend to be on edge around my sister as it is, she's very quick to start arguments and I am always her target... And I honestly thought if I got another spoon, she would most likely flip out. So, I just thought, I'll use the same spoon that I stirred my coffee with... Well, boy oh boy... This was the biggest mistake. How could I have made such an error in judgment? How could I have been so careless?

Anyway, this is where it all began.

She did not miss a beat. She saw me doing it and never in my life have I regretted a decision so much. And I have made a LOT of bad decisions.

She turned around and said ""I cannot believe you just did that! That is disgusting!"" It just went on and on...And on. I was just not in the mood, plus I was feeling really self conscious at this point, so I said nothing, I walked right past her, went into my wallet and took out all the coins I had (around $5) and put it on the table for her. Never had I EVER seen such a disgusted glare... To better describe it, my sister's look on her face could have put Medusa to shame.

To cut a very long story short, a massive argument ensued. She called me every name under the sun. I wasn't innocent in all of this, I definitely went off at her as well in the end. But, I did manage to calm down when I saw how upset my niece was. However, my sister just continued. I tried to walk away (thinking it would help matters) but, it only got worse, and she started abusing my dad and I ended up asking my brother to take the kids away and then I went back in and went off at her again telling her it wasn't right etc.

So, it all ended when she told us all to leave and none of us are speaking. My niece was extremely upset because we were leaving and my dad went up to her to say goodbye and my sister told her daughter ""Say goodbye to Grandpa, this is the last you will be seeing of him!"" Which of course made my niece even more distressed. My Dad says it wasn't my fault, that she was 100% in the wrong.

But, I just don't know hence I am here. Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: typo's

EDIT: Okay, so while I appreciate people taking the time to vote on whether or not i am an arsehole, and i am happy for people to give me their genuine feedback, I think it's a little unnecessary to call me disgusting. I want to be extremely clear that I never put the spoon to my mouth. Not once did I do that. I am not an unsanitary person, I was a person feeling extraordinarily anxious about my sister. Also, to the person who suggested that this story has been somewhat embellished. I showed my Dad this post and he was like ""yep, that's how it happened"" Not sure what else you would need without giving away my identity or breaking my sister's right to anonymity! To the people who have given me their honest opinions without the need to tell me I'm disgusting or call me and my other family unhinged, thank you and I will take on board what you've said.

EDIT 2: Just to be crystal clear on a couple of things: 1. I NEVER put the spoon in my mouth, nor did i have the spoon in my coffee when i sipped my coffee. The chain of events are as follows: Poured the boiling water into my cup, poured the milk in, put the sugar in, stirred it through... TOOK THE SPOON OUT... Tried the coffee... Wasn't sweet enough, \*freaked out about my sister, made an (albeit stupid) executive decision to put the spoon back into the sugar. I hope this explains better. Also, I just want to state that I'm a 28 year old WOMAN, not man (although, I'm not sure how relevant that part is... But it's more just for my sake because I've noticed a lot of people refer to me as a guy).

EDIT 3: I noticed a few people mention my brother in law (her husband) on the day, he completely removed himself from the situation. In mine and my Dad's opinion, he's pretty scared of my sister. She yells at him quite a bit. There was a situation on her birthday where she literally went right off at him in front of pretty much our entire family.",398,554,0.92

For some background, my mother in law has been in America for over 25 years, however has very poor English as she only socializes with people who speak the same language as she does. Her ex husband (my husband’s father) speaks perfect English, as he went out of his way to learn it. The language they speak isn’t super common, and it would be unusual to meet someone in your day to day life that happened to speak it.

Due to this, she calls my husband for really stupid reasons. For example, she called him asking if he could call in a take-out order to a restaurant for her. She’ll speak to him in her first language and then he’ll translate it to me, rather than attempting to speak to me in English. I don’t mind this, but my husband gets irritated.

The other day, she calls my husband and says she got into a fender bender. We go to the scene because she was worried she wouldn’t be able to communicate with the police about what happened. Afterwards, she wouldn’t answer the insurance company’s calls, because she wanted to wait until we were around so that we could speak to them for her.

So she is trying to get me to go with her on a plan to go eat before the reception and crash the wedding. WIBTA if I did this? I’m very hesitant to do this but my mom insists that it would be ok.

TL;DR My mom wants me to eat before a wedding I wasn’t invited too so they wouldn’t have to pay for me, basically crashing the wedding. Should I do it?

1847,Not the A-hole,"I am not a Christian. Neither is my husband.
We have two fantastic daughters.

Our oldest (8 years old) has been asking about Jesus and God. Even though I am not a believer, I want to answer her to the best of my ability. I'm finding it difficult to do so without peppering in my own biases. My husband avoids the conversations with her altogether.

She has a group of friends who attend VBS. They have made her feel left out for not knowing ""the basics."" So, she asked to go to church.

We want our kids to choose for themselves the path that is right for them. I recognise they can't do so without experiencing what the world has to offer.

So, we went to church a few times. It wasn't completely awful, but mostly awful. I did like the community connectivity. And the openness. Everyone was very nice.
I hated pretty much everything else. I found myself counting every moment til we could leave. And rolling my eyes. (When I recognised I was doing that part, I told myself to knock it off- not cool). Though I respect each person's right to worship, I feel like a jerk sitting there in their house NOT believing. 
But, my daughter loves it. And she and I have had some really well thought out discussions stemming from the service. She's a smart kid.

I asked her friend's family (whom i don't really know) if I could leave her with them in the future, then pick her up when the service was over. 
They looked at me like I was a leper. Or like i was selling my daughter to save my soul.
To make it worse, I asked some of my family (that ARE Christian) to take her. I got the same looks. And lectures about which churches are better than where we went.

Am I the @sshole for wanting my kid to be able to participate in something I have zero interest in?",172,399,0.95
1848,Asshole,"Longtime lurker-- I finally have a moral dilemma to post about! Let's see what you all have to say.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I were home today and got a notification from our Ring camera that there was motion at the front door. We were both in the middle of working/studying so we didn't immediately check the video. A minute or so after the alert, my boyfriend checks his phone and says ""Oh my god!"" and starts laughing hysterically. Apparently a kid (10ish years old) was going around the neighborhood with what looked like his dad and younger sister, giving out newsletter-style newspapers for a church in the area that also runs a private school. The newspaper has little articles about their parish but is mostly a big advertisement for their upcoming autumn festival. The kid puts the newspaper in our box and starts making faces at the camera-- silly things like wrinkling his nose and sticking out his tongue. Then he looks cautiously back at his dad, who had continued on to the next house and is now off-camera, and puts his closed fist up near the camera and slowly flips it off. After that the kid continued on his way.

I sent the video to my family just for laughs and my brother and dad both said that we should tweet the video to the school's Twitter account and teach the kid a lesson. I'm conflicted about this; it would be satisfying to know that the kid would probably get in trouble for it, but I don't know if it really warrants a public call-out. It was pretty funny but definitely rude, and I can't help but think that he should know not to do something like that when acting as a sort of representative of this church/school. At the same time, it wasn't a big deal.

&#x200B;

Reddit, what do you think? WIBTA if I publicly (but probably anonymously) post the Ring video to the school's Twitter account and, at the very least, embarrass the kid or perhaps cause him to get in big trouble?",52,63,0.84

Currently, I live in a dormitory at my college and for whatever reason the laundry room's dryers were all packed with hardly any washers being used compared. So I was like, ""Okay, the dryers will definitely free up by time my clothes are washed."" I go back to get my laundry out of the washer and put it in the dryer. Somehow though, the dryers were all still full of stuff despite many of them having been done. I left for \~15 minutes to come back to hope some are free. There were still none free once I came back. I waited there for another 10 minutes, hoping that someone would come to pick up their clothes out of the dryer. At this point, there at least 4 other people there waiting with me as well to just throw their clothes into a dryer. 

I decided to simply move someone's laundry out of the way and place it on top of the dryer because I feel after 30 minutes you should be getting your clothes out of a public laundry room. I found one with the least amount of clothes in it then I started to move those clothes out of the way. This girl, who also happened to be waiting for a dryer, told me that I shouldn't do that, it was invasive and kind of creepy to have someone else touch your laundry. Maybe because this happened to be a girl's laundry? Only noticed after I moved a few things out; I didn't really care who's it was. I shrugged off her comment and just moved mystery girl's crap out of the way to dry mine.

That someone has been my parents since he was born and it will be me when they get too old/pass on. I volunteered and want to, I love him and can’t picture anyone else doing it. Besides, it’s better me than strangers. I am also a single woman, childless. So I can better handle him, with help of other family members when the time comes.

The issue is, recently my parents decided they wanted to move out of state. They’re both retired. Obviously my brother would go with them. However, they expected me to go, they didn’t even ask. They say because they plan to be there until the end-not to be morbid-and my brother needs stability. It would already be a huge transition to move him, but then to have to move him again after they died, would be hell. I agree, but it’s like they didn’t consider me or my job or my current life.

I gave them a few options: we could transition my brother living with me now so he’s in the same area, same doctors, etc. or I move with them, but they cover my expenses during my transition with finding work, settling down, etc.

They think both of those options are unfair. I think it’s unfair to not think of me during this period. The best option, in my opinion, would be for him to transition to living with me. Our parents could visit, but then he wouldn’t have to move, and it’s gonna happen anyway. (My brother is not of sound enough mind to make this choice by the way, so we have to make it.)

My sister (F25) and me (F25) are identical twins. We've been always really close and we love and support each other. Last year she finished her arts degree, while I started my residency as a surgeon.

Yesterday she told me she's having a hard time finding a job and do not want to keep living with our parents, she feels as a financial burden to them, yet our parents are well-off and  love to have us with them. I've just rented a house with my boyfriend and I guess she feels the need to leave home too.

I asked her if she's planning to ask parents to help her financially if she's really going to rent, which they'll do with a smile,  but then is when she told me: she wants to do porn. She's told me nothing have happened yet, but just the thought of it terrifies me and said so.

She thinks I'm being an hypocrite, how can I define myself as a libertarian while being against her freedom to do whatever she pleases with her body. I support that claim, but she's not considering she'll be harming me; as we are identical twins, she being nude and doing porn is just as me doing so.

I do not know if she's doing it to harm me, I tried to help her with money if that's really the problem and she gets really upset and mad with me for that. She says she doesn't want my money, she wants to try it and would love me to support her as she has always done with me.

1862,Not the A-hole,"So, I’m 23F in university, my sister Natalie 28F is also. 

She has quit school and changed her major several times over, and it’s cost my parents a lot as they wanted to pay for it. 

So she returned again to school recently, and they agreed to pay for books/tuition which federal aid isn’t covering for her, but past that they won’t pay for her living expenses as they did when she was younger. 

Natalie’s university is a 40min to an hour away from my parents home. She’s having trouble paying rent, our parents said they would not pay but she can move back in with them (she only has classes 2 days a week, I think it would be doable). 

Our parents do still pay for most of my expenses, I don’t know whether it’s fair or not, she always complains that I get special treatment. They only still pay for her car insurance and phone bill (also bought her the car), as well as small things like Netflix. 

we treat my parents very differently. I speak to them a few times a week and visit quite often. I remember birthdays (my sister forgets and always wants to share the gift i buy) and do favors for them all the time. I brought this up to her because she does none of those things, and outside of calling once every month or so she only visits when she needs money. My parents obviously recognize this and it’s probably part of why she gets less support. 

Well, i’ve saved a decent amount of money from summer jobs and holiday money from grandparents. I’m also pretty frugal and combined with my parents help (rent, food, tuition) I’ve managed to save $8k.

Natalie knows I have money saved and recently asked me for $1,500. I said no - I’ve lent her small amounts before and it’s like twisting an arm to get her to pay it back. She said it’s messed up of me not to help because our parents still support me, and that they play favorites and it’s not fair, so I should really help her out. 

tl;dr my parents support me more than my sister, especially by paying my rent while I’m in school. She’s in a bind with her rent and my parents won’t pay, so she asked to borrow $1,500 from me. When I said no she said it’s not fair that I’m the favorite and get more support, and therefore I really owe her it. I disagree. AITA?",160,1260,0.95

1867,No A-holes here,"To keep it short and sweet, my SO had an informal work gathering this weekend. His boss (not like main, big shot boss — more like slightly above him) was hosting a BBQ at his house and invited us. I was helping my friend with something the morning of the BBQ and I met my boyfriend at the event, so he didn’t see my outfit until we were already at his bosses. As soon as I got out of the car he kinda gave me a weird look and asked if “I was seriously wearing that”. The item in question is a white T-shirt that has a small rainbow and the word equality over the left breast pocket area. Both take up about 5 inches combined, so it’s not like a giant noticeable design. 

To be honest I didn’t even realize what shirt I was wearing. I was helping my friend organize her garage and then going to a BBQ where I knew we’d all be swimming so I was just wearing comfy old clothes. It wasn’t like I did it on purpose — but also, my main point, is that I don’t really see it as a “political statement” like my bf does. Equality is a pretty accepted standard that we want, yes? I understand the rainbow implies LGBTQ+ rights (which I am a huge supporter of) but again it wasn’t a super loud or in your face statement. 

My BFs point is that he doesn’t know how some of his coworkers feel about those topics and wanted to be safe and not ruffle any feathers. He was offended I wasn’t more careful about how I presented myself to his coworkers (who I’ve met plenty of times and get along with) and I was bothered he suggested I go home and change because I didn’t think my shirt was even a political thing in the first place. AITA?

ETA - a minor note, this wasn’t an “official” work event. It was a very casual hangout at his bosses place and there were also a lot of non-coworkers there. I think that’s a big part of the reason why I wasn’t thinking about what I was wearing.

Also I had my yoga bag in my car, so I did change the shirt before going in. I’m asking AITA because it was a weird situation for us, with me not understanding why he reacted so negatively when I know he’s an ally like i am, and him not understanding why I wasn’t being more considerate to his career",943,2359,0.93

Recently, the disease metastasized to her lungs, and the doctors wanted to put her on a new treatment immediately. My parents brought her into the hospital to start her next round, but she didn't want to. She was hysterically crying saying she just wanted to go to Heather's birthday party and be a normal kid. ""No more treatment"" she kept saying. Heather is one of her best friends and her party was a few days away, my sister knew that if she started treatment she wouldn't be able to go to the party, but it was more than that, my sister is tired of it all and just doesn't want to do it anymore.

1872,Not the A-hole,"So, this story has some moving parts.

My grandfather has become incredibly ill, and so my father handles all of his finances.

However, five years ago, this was not the case. My grandfather was well enough to handle his own finances. It also happens that my sister was buying her first home at that time. My grandfather is well-off, and so contributed $15,000 to her down payment, an amazing and generous gift. At that time, my father noted that he should do the same for each of his grandchildren (including myself). This information was shared with each grandchild, so we would know about it when going through the home buying process. 

It is also very important to note that, at the time, my sister was single.

Fast forward five years. My fiancé and I are looking to buy our first home. We are also aware of the $15,000. So, we find the perfect home at the right price. When we go to tell my parents about it, they are excited. That is, until we bring up the $15,000.

They express that my grandfather would not be comfortable with us buying a home together before we are married, and so won’t be able to get us the money until after our wedding. That is in four months, and with the housing market in our area, there is no chance for us to wait.

It is also important to note that my sister, who bought the home five years prior, now has a boyfriend who essentially lives her.

Also, my parents have never been fans of me living with my girlfriend. I felt that this was a way of using my grandfather’s money as a proxy for expressing his own disapproval of how we chose to live (together before marriage).

Finally, we could still buy the home without those funds. However, it was the difference between having to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) or not. It also will affect our interest rate on the loan.

Essentially, it’s going to cost us thousands of dollars by delaying the money a few months. When I brought this financial issue and the inconsistency with my sister up with him, he implied that I was an ungrateful, spoiled ass.

His parents were rude, his sisters were cruel as hell. Despite the coldness I maintained a pleasant a cheerful demeanor and tried to be as nice as I could. The relationships with his family never got better, and I gained more bullies when I met the rest of his family. He's got a couple of aunts in particular who are really nasty towards me. I'm American and from a pretty normal family, dad's a laborer, mom's a teacher, we were never well-off. His family is English, from Devon, and they're well-off. They don't think I'm good enough.

We got engaged a year in and I had hoped it would help in the repair of things. A month before the wedding I moved to England and began the process of becoming an English citizen. I'm not religious but I agreed to become Church of England for him. We have been married about six and a half years and the relationship has only worsened. He knows how badly they treat me and has spoken on my behalf several times. He once even cut his whole family off for me, for about a year. They managed to needle their way back in and things have remained sour. They blame me for the estrangement. Despite this, I remember my upbringing and the manners my parents instilled in me, and I remain civil and polite around them, which thankfully isn't often.

I just had our first children recently, twins. Through out the pregnancy remarks were made about my having got pregnant with the intent to divorce him and get a huge pay day. Remarks were also made about my weight, my family, my job, everything. Time does not always heal, and I'm still not good enough for them. I've reconciled this, but for the sake of my husband and our new babies, I'd never, say, curse at them or try to ruin their lives.

The christening came and the whole event was ruined by his mother. Our son in particular is a very fussy baby. MIL was filming on her cellphone and the baby happened to meltdown as she turned the camera on him and I. I took him away to calm him and she accused me of trying to keep the babies from her. She I wanted to poison the kids against them. She also brought up the fact that I stay our bedroom whenever any of them come to visit the babies, letting my husband take charge of being host. Yes, hiding is childish and silly, but I'm dealing with postpartum emotions and I just can't handle being reminded that I'm still quite heavy, oh yes, and a low-class, baseborn slut who stole their family member.

WIBTA if I just refused to be the bigger person? You know, give it back to them? If one of the aunts calls me fat, I remark upon her abnormally large teeth, or if the other calls me a gold digger I remark on her many, many moles? Oh if his mother accuses me of poisoning the relationships bring up the fact that her son doesn't even like her? Or would all this just be too much?

ETA: I haven't done anything yet and based on the good advice I'm getting, I probably won't stoop to their level. I'll have another talk with my husband. If they refuse to change then I'm telling him I'm not letting our son and daughter around them.

ETA 2: sorry for the lack of response from me, with two babies my time is really spent so I'll do a miniature update because there's nothing new to report. I showed my husband this post and let him read some of the comments. He realizes that his current course of action obviously isn't working and he's willing and ready to do what he needs to do. His parents are due their visit at the start of October and he's going to have a very frank conversation with them that if he doesn't see a change, a real effort, to treat me with a little respect, that they can come to London as often as they want but they will not be seeing us or him at all.

I have a friend who grew up in an actual cult. The kind that pick your spouse when your born and if you have family or friends who don't agree with them you're instructed to cut them from your life forever. Her dad stayed but her mom and her escaped. She now lives with her mom and her mom's wife safely away from that group of people. 

I went to their house with some other friends for a pool party of sorts and officially met her moms for the first time. While we were eating I learned that her birth mom had been sent to the same school I had gone to for my entire kindergarden to high school life. Her mom talked about how it had been strict (definitely is) and she had hated it until she left sometime in the middle of high school. This school is affiliated with my church. 

Her mom started going on about how the school and the church were just another cult and how going through it probably prepared her and that's why she married her ex-husband. A lot of her complaints seemed to be aimed at the religion of the group and not so much at the group as a whole. I didn't say anything. I completely understand that many cults use religion as a tool to get people in and as an excuse to do wild things so I didn't want to act defensive while she was speaking her truth. 

But then she started asking me ""right, that place is full of crazies?"" and ""you know that place is a cult of Bible-thumpers?"" and on and on. I can take name calling and whatever; some religious people have done it enough themselves over the years, but I wouldn't agree with anything because while the school was strict and our affiliated church has had it's fair share of drama I truly don't think it's as cult-like as she was making it out to be. Again, I never told her she was wrong because maybe things were different a long time ago and that's just how she felt, but I never agreed. 

She started getting angry about this and left in a huff saying stuff about how I was brainwashed already. I felt bad about it and my friend said her mom can get heated about things like that sometimes but she would get over it. But I can't help but think that maybe I should have just agreed to appease her. So AITA?",17,37,0.81

1883,Not the A-hole,"Recently, one of my mom’s closest friends passed away. She was a really good family friend and I was closer to her than some of my actual relatives. She acted like an aunt to me. I always spoke with her whenever she would visit (she lived nearby), and sent her messages on special occasions. She was a sweet, older lady who always had a smile one her face. 
She passed away unexpectedly, and it really hit my family hard, especially my mother and I. My life was thrown in chaos and I struggled to grasp the reality. 

We went to her funeral a couple of days ago, and I’m still a mess from it. I was sitting near the front with my family, and I was crying so hard, like wracking sobs. Behind me was another family with two boys, around 7-9. I wasn’t sure whether they knew the lady or what their affiliation was with her, but they were very distracting. They were kicking my seat repeatedly, making inappropriate noises, and talking loudly. My mom would turn around and ask them and their parents to please be quiet, I was too upset to do it myself. Despite doing this multiple times, they would not stop (Note: It was asked for all attendees to refrain bringing children if they couldn’t control them). At one point, one of the little boys let out a loud giggle and I just lost it. I turned around, red eyed and wet, and yelled at them. I shouted that they should be quiet and they were disrespecting my mom’s friend. I also yelled at the parents, asking why they brought they’re kids if they couldn’t control them. Everyone in the room turned at the commotion, the boys froze under my yelling, and the parents mouths were wide open. 

My mom escorted my upset mess of a self, and we sat outside until I calmed down. She told me that she understood I was upset, but I should apologize to the family. A couple of days have gone by and I still refuse to apologize. AITA for yelling and should I apologize for yelling at the family?

EDIT: I just spoke with the family of the lady, and they told me not to worry about it, they don’t blame me. I apologized to them but I haven’t said a word to the family with the children.

EDIT #2: So I asked my mother what the family with children’s relation is, since many of you were wondering, and the mom of that family worked with the lady at the hospital, since she was a nurse.",168,587,0.96

1885,Not the A-hole,"I've been with my gf for about 7 years. I have a strong relationship with her dad, Chuck. We do all sorts of activities together like fishing, drinking, going to firing ranges. Good man.

Many months ago, my gf's parents announced they were divorcing. A few weeks after that, Chuck visited me and made sure I was alone. He asked me for advice on dating since he's only ever been with his wife, and the dating scene has evolved in those two or so decades. I was hesitant at first, but then he said, ""If you don't help, I'll figure this shit out on my own.""

So I was setting him up on some dating apps, but then I remembered a family friend of mine, Molly. Molly's husband died a while back, and I remembered her talking about looking for dates again. I gave Chuck some info on Molly and a pic, he was interested. I called Molly and sent her a pic of Chuck, she was interested. I gave them each other's numbers. They've been together ever since.

That was about 8 or so months ago. The divorce has since been finalized. My gf's sister, Ashley, made an unannounced visit to Chuck's apartment a few days ago and found Molly. Chuck told Ashley how they met and how long. Ashley did the math and realized how soon it was after the divorce announcement. 

Ashley has called me a homewrecker and the grim reaper of her parent's marriage. My gf was predicting a divorce for a while, and said that all I did was expedite the healing process for Chuck. Ashley said she told her mom, and all she said was ""good for your dad"", and couldn't tell if it was sarcasm.

I was an early adopter and self-taught myself how to build computers, networking and web development.  As technology has evolved over the years (vpn, smart phones, smart tv's,  etc..) I try to keep up by watching YouTube videos and reading blog posts.

When my wife has any problems, and I mean ANY problem/challenge/frustration/misunderstanding about or related to technology, she comes to me/complains to me about it.  Since everything now seems to be related to technology somehow, I'm on the hook to explaining how everything works and why it doesn't work the way she thinks it should work.

I will get calls at work, in the evening, basically anytime about her phone, the TV, the Internet, Facebook, Instagram, Outlook, etc...  MOST of the time the answers are available on Google.  I know, because that's how I troubleshoot her issues.  I've suggested in the past that she research and try to figure out her problems before she asks me, but then I'M THE ASSHOLE, because I won't help her.

1889,Not the A-hole,"Tl;Dr: Boss has messed with my pay several times, got angry when I couldn't afford to come in bc of it and took me off the schedule for a week. WIBTA if I left without notice? 


So, I don't think I'm the asshole for quitting, I just need to know if I'm TA for not giving notice. 

I worked for a woman named Linda. She owns her own her store and runs everything from buying product to running payroll. 

I work less then 20 hours a week and make just barely over minimum wage. Because of these factors, I considered this a temporary position and have been keeping an eye out for better postings. 

I was hired on along with 2 others. Within 6 months both had quit because of the nonsense Linda had put them through. 

My issues have always been my pay. There have been several times where my money wasn't correct because the system she uses to track out time broke. It was like pulling teeth trying to get Linda to answer any questions. It'd always take weeks for me to get the money I was owed, and only after constant messaging and asking about it in person. 

Because of this, I sometimes could not afford a bus pass to work.

Linda began getting frustrated with me missing work and offered to give me money for an uber/bus fare that she'd later take out of my paycheck. 

I was not comfortable with this AT ALL, but agreed since everyone else had quit at this point and I had one foot out the door already. 

Well, payday came around and SURPRISE, I still had .91 cents in my account. After contacting Linda and asking what happened, she began pressing me to take a taxi to work with the assumption I'd pay for it out of my check.

Tired of her, I said it wasnt worth paying $30 for a 4 hour shift. I'd walk away making 6 dollars if I went in and I only really wanted to know where my money was. 

Linda didnt respond for a bit, my scheduled time to come in came and went and finally she responded. 

She accused me of jumping to conclusions, suddenly telling me the ""store"" would pay for it since this time it wasnt my fault for not having money. But, she took me off the schedule and told me I'd have my money by Wednesday, and that she'd see me then. 

I checked my hours, saw she'd taken me off the schedule til THURSDAY and ranted at my friend. 

Well my friend pulled some strings and basically garunteed me a job at her work. If the interview on Monday goes well, I could start Wednesday. 

I won't be quitting til I know I have the job obviously, but it seems pretty good that I'll get it. So, my current debate is if I should just message Linda Wednesday that I quit and just mail my keys in. I'm the last employee she has (obviously for good reason). If I leave, she may not be able to have the store open til she finds someone to replace me. 

I'm also the only one who knows how to do certain aspects of my job. And honestly, I feel really guilty leaving like this, but I need the money and hours.

I’m still trying to figure parenting out but I’m trying form habits with my son that my parents continue to undermine despite numerous conversations with them. I tell them to stop buying him toys because he has too many. They continue to buy him toys when they visit. I create boundaries with him in terms of snacks, desserts, TV time, etc, and they will say in front of him that I shouldn’t be so strict. I know that when they see him or watch him alone they continue to do the things I ask them not to. Their response is oh we’re just the grandparents, it’s a different relationship from the parents, or grandparents spoil the grandchild, it’s okay. Or “this is how we did it and you turned out fine.” It’s so frustrating. 

I told them that if they continue to undermine my parenting in front of him that I won’t allow them to see him. I know it’s harsh but I didn’t know where else to go with it because I feel continuously disrespected. I know that a grandparents relationship with a grandchild is special and I don’t want to deprive my son of that but my parents are making it very difficult for me to do my job. I also feel that giving extra candy or toys is not something that should cause our relationship to end but I don’t know what to do when they continue to ignore, undermine, and disrespect me. 

Well they lost it when I told them this. They said things like “How can you threaten us with our grandchild?” and said that they can’t believe I am going to take her away from them over this . I feel terrible about the entire situation. I know I was harsh but am I justified?

1895,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to make this short and concise.

For a little over two years I have worked as a house parent at a group home. I live in a house with 6 kids for a week straight, then a week off. I essentially act as a father/mentor for them. I help my boys with homework, girl problems, video games, jobs, fun activities, extra curricular, cooking, cleaning, etc.  Essentially I am a long term Foster father for kids who are unlikely to leave the system before they turn 18.

I have had all of my current kids for over a year, and half of them for at least two years. I was the first person they met when they came in, and I'm very, very close to them. Anyone who has ever fostered children (and is good at doing so) would likely share the sentiment that these kids our yours. I talk to them when I'm off work, talk about them to friends and family, I don't have kids of my own, but I do feel like these guys are my boys.

Theres a very high turnover rate for my position, so I'm the only house parent that has been with these kids for over a year (most people quit well before a year). They have all directly or indirectly (you know how teenagers are) told me how important I am to them and two of my longest residents call me dad sometimes and are very attached. 

The problem arose a few months ago when my boss asked be to start shadowing in our foster care program (we also have kids off campus in foster homes) because they want more workers there for an expansion. I told my kids about it, and most of them told me not to take it because it would mean I wouldn't be raising/living with them anymore. I told them not to worry because it wouldn't happen for several months to a year.

Well Friday my boss told me the position was open and I needed to apply and interview as a formality, but he was going to hire me for it regardless. I would be making the transition within the month, leaving my kids behind and taking an office job in the administration building.  He told me not to tell my kids until it's finalized, meaning at most I would only have one week with them after telling them.

I know they'll be really upset, and I know I'll probably get wine drunk (off work) and cry about leaving them. But it's a better career track; better pay, more upward mobility, more diverse skillset for my resume should I move, etc. But I just can't shake the feeling that if I take this job I'm basically ditching these kids I love for a raise of 5k a year, like an asshole.

1899,Not the A-hole,"I'm from the UK and am the manager of a restaurant that is part of a really popular chain that rhymes with 'toons'. We have an app that allows people to order food and drinks to their table, all you need is the restaurant name and the table number. Quite often we get one or two stupid orders to a table (like someone ordering a bowl of peas or a meal that's just three servings of the same thing) and we don't really care, because even though this wastes our resources, it brings in money to the restaurant and usually only happens once or twice per table, maybe a few times a week. It's not really a big deal. 

However, we had an issue a couple of days ago where a group of young guys, they were 21-23 according to their IDs, who got over 50 of these dumb orders to their table. It's kind of a thing in the UK for people with an online following to post their table numbers to their followers, asking them to send them shit. On this occasion, we delivered about 15 servings of peas, 10 side salads, 10 mushy peas, a bunch of baconnaise, and some just normal drinks. It was ridiculous, and it was slowing down orders for other tables. We let this go on for about 5 orders before asking them to stop, as sometimes people genuinely do just want a side of mushy peas. Eventually, I went over to the table and asked them to only make serious orders as we are very busy (Friday night) and we don't have time. The guys said they would stop and explained that one of them has a YouTube following and would delete the Snapchat he posted. I don't know if he did or not, but we received, as stated, around 45 more orders.

This obviously brought in a lot of money. It really did. Especially the serious orders of cocktail pitchers, and even one steak meal. After around 20 orders I went over again and asked them to ask their followers to stop, otherwise I would be forced to kick them out. The guy said that he doesn't see the problem as he is obviously making us money. 

I left them alone again after being assured they would tell their fans to stop. The second time I went over, the guy showed me he had nothing on his Snapchat story, so I believed him. They were an otherwise quiet table, not drinking much and eating in  peace. 

So, the orders continued and I sent the two security guards to kick them out. I wasn't about to go and tell them again, and I told the kitchen and bar staff not to do any orders to that table for the rest of the night, and marked it as reserved. The guys were pissed off, as they said they had deleted the post and even if they hadn't, money. 

I stand by what I did, but some of the staff think it was funny and said they didn't really mind as the guys at the table were tipping (which is rare in England in general, but even more so in a restaurant like ours that's known for paying around £9 an hour). AITA?",161,523,0.95

I constantly ask for the music to be significantly lowered or turned off if I'm in the kitchen while the music is playing.

She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. 

She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her.

1911,Not the A-hole,"I’m going to start this off my saying I know lots of people don’t like vegans and enjoy making fun of them. I really don’t care about people making vegan jokes about me as long as they don’t care that I’m going to make comments back. 
It’s all jokes so I’m normally surprised when people get upset but I’m wondering if I was the asshole in this situation 


Someone at this birthday party I was at walks outside holding a plate of chicken wings and to pick one up and asks me 

“Are you suuuure you don’t want any? It’s really good I promise.” 

I just laughed and said I was fine with my grass (salad)

There was a few more jokes after this but I’m sure everyone has heard them all before so just think of stereotypical vegan jokes

After that happened they brought out more food and this time it was a shrimp platter and the same guy holds one up close to my face and is trying to convince me to eat it saying 

“Mmm it’s so good” and “so much better then your salad” 

So I laughed a bit but he didn’t stop so I said 

“Mmmm plastic and ocean dead zones” also while laughing so it was clearly just a joke. 

But apparently my joke wasn’t okay because from then on I was a “buzzkill” and a “preachy vegan” 

I think you shouldn’t make jokes if you can’t handle people making them back but did I go a little to far? My vegan friends said I was giving all vegans a bad name so am I the asshole?",234,1219,0.93

1915,No A-holes here,"Please be gentle with me... I feel like I could potentially be an asshole but would welcome the warm & kind feedback which reddit is renowned for ;p ... 

**Context**

My best friend of 12 years has a child with his wife (a beautiful boy approaching two years old) and I really like the like the lil' dude.

Since the child came along, I very rarely get to see my friend (which is totally to be expected). For context, for years we used to hang out every other day (as well as having lived together in university and out of uni), now we see each other maybe 2-3 times per year (for about 2 hours each time) as he moved to be closer to family after the child was born.

Whenever we hang, he also asks ""Is it ok if I bring Smolgoi along?"". Of course I always say yes... because what kind of asshole would say no? (hence me posting this)

All of our recent hangouts in the last 2 years have involved his son - and I totally get that. He's a father now and his son is his number 1 priority... I respect that and fully support it.

However, when we hang out, my friend is no longer ever able to be present. He's focused on ensuring his son is staying alive (like a good father should)... but it means our time together pretty much revolves around the child and is less than what either of us would hope it to be.

I know this because everytime he apologises for not being present and not being able to concentrate or listen.

I don't want to sound like I'm jealous of the kid or hold any kind of resentment towards the child... I don't at all. 

However, I do miss having a proper conversation, connection and time with my friend. This guy really is my brother from another mother.

My main question is, would I be the asshole if I asked him not to bring his child along sometime?

My gut feeling is that I would be. And that I run the risk of him thinking I don't care for his son (or potentially dislike him - which is not the case at all). As mentioned, I really like the kid but I like my friend more. And while my friend is an awesome dad, he himself even admits that he is a less-than-good friend (his words not mine - as I am the one who tries to accommodate however I can to ensure we can spend some time together - as in I cancel meetings at short notice and travel to see him if he gets an opening for us to grab a coffee, etc). For additional context, both he and his wife have parents within 10 mins of their home who look after Smolgoi all the time so it's not like it's a situation of last resort.

The last thing I would ever want to do is damage our friend... but I really do fear that if this pattern continues, I'll lose him - not in the literal sense, but more the risk of us growing apart as we don't get to share like we once did. Perhaps this is just a natural part of life and I should accept it?

Am I asking too much? Am I an asshole for wanting him to leave his son at home with his wife for the 6 hours per year we now get to hang out?


**EDIT:** 

(UPDATE) Thank you to everyone for ALL the comments (NAHs, NTAs and the YTAs). Some great advice in amongst the mix. 

On reflection, I'm not going to straight come out and say ""leave Smolgoi at home"" (btw Smolgoi is a play on words for people who thought it might be a real name). Instead I'm going to make some effort to suggest and arrange some catchups which are past bedtime and that way can ensure it's just the two of us. That way, I don't have to give off any vibes which might be misconstrued as negative towards Smolgoi (who I do really like - I look forward to the day when he's able to shoot the shit with his Pops and Uncle).

Again, thanks so much everyone for all the input. It really did a lot to test my sensibilities on this matter. Peace and love y'all.",102,476,0.95

1920,No A-holes here,"So my coworker proposed to his longtime girlfriend about a year ago, and the wedding is coming up in two months. A few people who work with us were invited. I informed my boss / the business owner in March that I was invited and plan to attend. He fussed and argued that multiple people who work there were invited and he can’t give everyone the day off. (The people invited are the most reliable / most able to work without boss around. Only 3 people left to run the show if the guests invited all attend.) We have been short staffed and complaining to the boss for months that he may need to hire another worker- which he agrees to, but “hasn’t found the right person”— he’s very openly picky about who he hires, understandably. FF to yesterday when I check the calendar for the wedding date, where ONLY the groom and brother are given the day off, and “no other requests off” is listed. For context: we work at a Paint & Sip, and it’s basically a gig job. Our hours are based on when / if people sign up for classes, and we are all very accommodating to the schedule and sometimes work with short notice.
We have all worked there for 3+ YEARS and have developed close bonds from being artists and all around the same age. And also, the boss will be attending the wedding. 
Yesterday, I told my boss that if he schedules me for work, I will not attend and he can fire me, because I have been planning for MONTHS openly about attending a wedding where a friend has invited me to celebrate one of the most important days of his life.

1923,Not the A-hole,"For context, I live in a “private” residence, they are quite common where I live, you can just put a fence and a gate somewhere in the street and claim it as a “private” residence (there are a little bit of legal things to do but many places just block the streets and call it private), you hire someone to “protect” and that’s it. Even with this, anyone can go through these places because legally they are public and you can’t stop someone just for walking.

Now, yesterday I came home from a party with my friend and when we get to the gates they were closed. Usually when this happens all you have to do is tell the guard where you going and that’s it, well, not this time, this time he decided that he wanted to know everything about me and still not letting me in, when he started to ask for my ID, several minutes later, I show him but he wants to take it and keep it and I refuse to letting him (if later he says he doesn’t have it then I would be unable to ever get it back). 

We try to tell him to check the family list and people who lives here but he say he doesn’t have it and even if he has it he wouldn’t check. During this time, a lot of cars and persons went through the gate without identifying themselves or even telling him where they were going.

I’m one of the few houses who has two entrances to my house, one by the road behind the gate and another walking around the block (I could draw this if needed) so we take the long way, walked into my house, asked my friend to record how we were inside and I could open the doors with my keys and walked back to the guard just to show him we got inside because we live here.

Then he started to accuse us of being thiefs, he claimed we jumped over a wall and he was calling the “Serenos” (not real cops, they don’t have so much authority and are only to deal with small conflicts so cops can take care of the real emergencies)

I admit that I got angrier that I should have, I yelled and went full Karen trying to solve this, but I have never gone through something like this, just walking back home and being treated like I’m dangerous (many people came really drunk, came in big groups and were told nothing) but when I got closed he grabbed his baton and acted like I’m dangerous (I’m hella skinny, I hardly could take someone on my own). 

Sorry if it’s boring, it’s the first time I argue (or whatever the word is) with someone I don’t know.
AITA for getting mad and being such a dick? I should go there and say sorry? I felt like I had the right somehow but shouldn’t have gone so mad.

Edit: I forgot to use paragraphs.

Edit 2: To the people thinking I could have handle this in a better way, you are right. I do believe that through dialogue and reason we can achieve many things, this time I acted in a way I have criticized many times, even when some people understands why I did it.

Edit 3: I’m talking to the committee who hires the guards. They tried to convince me of let it slide since guards don’t have much money and I could ruin a man’s life because of an error.
Fortunately, two ladies who joined the committee recently stood for me, supporting me on the fact that if he can keep anyone away from their houses then no one is assured of not spending the night in the streets.

Also, we remind them that someone is responsible of this, the guard or the committee, if the guard then he loses his job or other solution (if I agree to it), but if I blame the committee then I can sue them and get the gate removed (the other guards would be fired as well, which I wouldn’t like since I don’t believe someone who had nothing to do with this has to pay).",73,533,0.94
1924,Asshole,"This is my first post here so take it easy on me.

At school, I have always been in the top sets in all my classes. I’m not extremely smart but I do work to try to keep up with the others.

This year, the maths class has been pretty overwhelming for me. We received lots of new students that are incredibly talented in maths. Everyone was moving pretty fast and I barely had time to keep up with the others. This has resulted in a few mental breakdowns in the last few weeks. 

Here’s where my friends come into play.

I’ve known the two for the majority of my life and they are practically siblings to me. But ever since we were tiny, they were always quite a few steps in front of me. They are extremely smart as well as hardworking, making them the known top of the year students. Naturally, they are both amazing at maths. The thing is, they are, and have been since the start, competing for who’s smarter. To make matters worse, they are both too humble to actually compete. That’s why friend A and friend B constantly complain to me about each other. But not in a mean way, because that would mean they weren’t humble. 
“Oh, friend a is so smart, she makes me feel sooooo dumb.”
“Oh, friend b is so much smarter than me, I only got 99% and she got 100%”
When they complained to me in the past, sure, it annoyed me, but I never really said anything about it except for sometimes bringing it up in a jokingly manner.

This year, on the other hand, the maths teacher put them together, making them all the more insufferable. So, after every, single, class, they would come up to me and friend a complaining that friend b did more questions did then them, and friend b bouncing back saying friend a got more questions right than they did. Every time they did this, I would be considerable more behind than what the both of them were putting themselves down for. Sure, it was annoying but whatever.

But one day, after one of my more extreme mental breakdowns, friend a and friend b approach me and yet again, start complaining about how hard maths was and how much better the other friend was. This time, I was sick of their shit so I told them, looking at them with my tear stained eyes that I was sick of them complaining to me, who was obviously less academically talented than them, about their ‘hardships’ and how much better the other friend was than them and how dumb they felt around each other. 

It’s been a few days and I don’t feel like I over reacted because I’ve already hinted at being uncomfortable during their ‘humble-offs’ and they already knew I was struggling in maths (this year more than other years) and wasn’t feeling very emotionally stable yet they still spoke to me about it. But I spoke about this to one of my close friends and they told me I did so I came here.


TL;DR: my two smart friends are always complaining about things that I suck at/each other being smart, even though they knew I didn’t like it and I was sort of hysterical so I shouted at them.",22,66,0.83

1926,Not the A-hole,"Background:  I've recently moved back to my mothers house after (all but) completing  my postgraduate degree. My sister (22) also lives here, as does my  mother (funny old world). Every morning either I take my mother a cup of  tea, or she brings me one - it depends on who wakes up/feels like  moving first.

Anecdote:

This  morning, at about 0830, mother brought me a cup of tea (lovely, thanks  mum) and unusually, rather than retreating to her own room with her  beverage, stated, in an ordinary conversational voice, (the kettle had  already woken me up, so I was wide awake by this point) that her  bathroom scales had stopped working in the night.

Annoying.  I got up, checked she wasn't having an early morning brain fart, and  asked her if she'd like me to swap the battery out now (I had a spare in  my desk) or if she could wait until the following day to weigh herself  (she always does it at the same time each day, as one would expect). She  replied ""it can wait.."" and that was that, she heads back to bed.

At this point, my sister comes *charging* out of her room and into the toilet, slamming both her bedroom door and the toilet door in the process - we realise we've been a tad noisy, shrug, and go back to bed. Three hours later, so 11 AM, when mother went  to take some ironing she'd done (she is very kind like that) up to my  sister, I hear my sister yelling about the earliness of the hour in  which she'd been woken up, which has clearly upset mum, if not ruined  her morning. Sister has just left the house, slamming the front door in  the process.

So Reddit - is 0830  an unreasonable time to have a conversation with a family member? Is slamming doors (at the age of 22) a complete over reaction? And is yelling at your mother completely out of order, regardless of what has  happened? Am I (we) the assholes, Is she the asshole? Or should partial  blame be apportioned?

(I've stayed out of the way since first thing - long ago I learned getting involved just ends up with more shouting).

No one in the family works a night shift. If they did, I can understand them being incredibly annoyed at being woken up early. Slamming doors is still unacceptable in my mind though.",35,51,0.92
1927,No A-holes here,"This was years ago when I was at the age of 12 but every time I mention it to my mom now she gets mad and has to try and justify it and then we get into an argument every time. 

So, when my dad died from lung cancer, she was crying all the time and started drinking a bit more than she usually did while I hid in my room and became a shut in. One month after, she started going out with some friends and she never really tried to talk to me or anything. I thought she was still grieving so I didn’t want to bother her but apparently, she was also crushing on a guy while out with her friends.    

Two months in total after my dad’s death and she started bringing this guy to our house. I had to listen to them playing songs that my dad used to sing and listen to while hearing them making out downstairs. It really angered me and that was the first time I resented someone or was even angry at someone. I told her I wasn’t happy or comfortable with her dating another guy so soon after and bringing him to our house two separate times but she came up with the same excuse of,”But I love him. Why wouldn’t you want me to be happy?”

He started coming to our house almost every night and this would go on until he moved in shortly after. I was forced to meet his parents and his parents treated me like their daughter and tried to buy my acceptance with gifts. It goes without saying I was also not happy about this. I was also forced to go on vacation with him and his family to Hawaii and I begged my mom to let me stay at my grandma’s but she wouldn’t let that happen. While at the vacation, she was very hostile towards me and expecting me to be perfect around his family. When I had a really bad panic attack while at an event, she and her boyfriend apparently got into a fight and she said it was my fault and stormed off and left me crying alone on a bench. 

Not even a year later and they buy a new house and talk of marriage. They’re still together till this day. 

I feel like my anger towards her was understandable. I’m not nearly as mad about it anymore as then but I kept a big distance from her for three years after that.

Edit: Thank you so much for all of your sweet comments and rightful opinions. Many people have brought up that she was already grieving before his death so she was able to move on quicker (which I never thought of. As a child I was still very hopeful and had complete faith in his recovery but I acknowledge my mom was being realistic) and that it was her way of getting through the grief (to be honest, I don’t totally understand that but I’m trying to) 

Also thank you to the replies empathizing and sympathizing to my story. It really did feel good to finally talk about it after all this time so thank you to those who read it and responded with such nice things to say 💛 I will try to bring this up to my mother in a calm manner and make sure to tell her I’m not angry with her anymore so she doesn’t have to feel bad.",161,481,0.93

When we have sex my boyfriend obviously prefers to finish inside of me and although I enjoy it as well, the after math just isn’t great. We usually have sex in the mornings before Work which already makes me later and I have to shower after (even though I showered in the evening) so I’m extra rushed getting ready.

1932,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago I had gotten a house for myself and invited two of my better friends, a married couple, to rent the other bedroom.  We've all known each other several years and rented a place together some years ago too until the rent increases became too high and we went our separate ways.  The rent at the apartment they were just living at was only going up and up and was pretty shabby so I offered them a place in my home.

Now the wife-friend, let's call her Susan, has always had a bit of a closet drinking problem but it's never been outright destructive.  While I'm naming people let's call the husband Ken.  Tonight I came home late to Susan drinking with a homeless bag lady in the living room with Ken there watching TV.  No one bothered to say hello or even introduce the surprise guest to me.  After giving Ken a ""let's talk"" head motion and settling my bags down in the kitchen Ken came in to inform me that this lady was ""staying the night and she's a stroke victim.""  At this point I snapped a little and asked ""what the fuck is a crackhead doing in my living room?""

Let me be clear, I am not renting this place and they are not casual roommates.  I made sure we all understand that they are tenants and I am the landlord in the most civil way I could when we entered this arrangement.  They also agreed to no guests in the tenant agreement.  This guest as an 11pm surprise and obviously homeless with a drug problem.  My best guess is that Susan had a few drinks, met a ""friend,"" decided to use the worst judgement possible and brought her into my home.  Ken loves his wife too much to ever say no.

As soon as I had asked ""what is a crackhead doing in my living room?"" both Susan and Ken snapped, trying to get in my face and yell at me.  For some reason their need to defend this stranger they went so far as to call me a ""drug addict.""  I smoke pot, we all do, that's it.  The insults just kept going on so I went to my room and closed the door just to chill out.

Without missing a beat Susan opens the door just to start yelling at me in my bedroom.  At that point I had enough and asked Ken to do something about his wife.  He only gave me a lame shrug so I went outside to call the police to contain this situation.

By the end of it the police had a talk with Susan and warned her they don't want to come back because of this.  The homeless lady also opted to leave finally.  It was at this point I decided to evict them both and told them so when I came in.  I kept the paperwork on hand just in case so they've both already been served their 30 days.  Now they're both staying out of my way.

This whole exchange has been so surreal and bizarre that I can't help wonder if I'm the asshole here or not.  I'm still wondering who the hell the homeless lady was and why they would ever let her inside, much less tell me she's spending the night.",151,903,0.95

For some background, I have never called in sick for this job ever. Currently, it’s 1:15am and I need to be awake by 4am for my shift.

With that little sleep, I know I just will not be able to function properly at work. 

So, I just texted my boss (extremely apologetically) that I have food poisoning and will not be coming into work. I feel extra bad for multiple reasons— 1, I’m not actually sick. 2, the last two Sundays I have worked with this manager, someone ELSE called in sick and I could tell it really annoyed her 3, it’s extremely late notice (she won’t see my text until she wakes up for the same shift). 

I’m justifying the situation by telling myself this: in the same way being sick would affect my ability to work well, my lack of sleep will negatively affect my work in the same way.

I recently (like two days ago) moved into a small apartment complex. This afternoon I heard screaming from a downstairs neighbour that went on for about 20 minutes. The screaming was very loud (and included slamming doors, kicking the ground, etc.) but there only appeared to be one voice. The voice sounded to be from a young male in his 20-30s screaming about cat litter. I decided not to do anything because 1) I just moved in and I have no idea who my neighbours are, 2) I live by myself and am scared of the repercussions of pissing off a neighbour, and 3) I only heard one voice. 

Flash forward to tonight at 2:30am. I was woken up by the same voice screaming about money. The screaming only lasted about 2-3 minutes, but again I heard slamming of doors and just general rage. The noise has now stopped, but I am very rattled and on edge. I don’t want my first thought to be to call the cops (especially since I don’t know this neighbour, where the apartment is located, and what other neighbours have done in the past), but I am genuinely concerned that this person has the ability to hurt themselves or others with the amount of rage I have heard.

Of course a lot of men and also younger boys were interested but I refuse to sell them to anyone under the age of 18 since all of them had max. 7.5 joule which can really hurt if you dont have the right protection gear.

So a young boy comes visibly excited and picks them up, aims and plays a little around (I removed the magizines, any bulles and Gas as Well as the batteries for the Electric ones so nothing could Happen) which was all fine and he asked me politely how much they cost. I told him the price but that he's way too young for them and that I wouldn't sell any to him. So he put them back frustrated and went off.

After a few minutes he returned with his mom and she told me that He wanted The Colt 911 (which is fullmetal so pretty heavy for him in my opinion) for 25€ more than I asked. I dont wanna judge people by their looks, but she didn't seem like the Kind of woman who'd go shooting with friends or anything and I figured she wanted it for her son, so I told her the same thing and that I could even lose my license if I'd sell them to underage people. She got a little annoyed and explained, that she is indeed an adult and that she buys it, not her son.

I refused, telling her that I dont feel comfortable selling it to her, thinking that the boy (which I assume was around the age of 13) would handle it.

After a while of bickering she let it go, took her angry son and went her ways, very pissed off, murmering some curses at me.

AITA for refusing to sell it to her?

Thanks in advance.",13,37,0.87
1940,Not the A-hole,"So I have a relatively new friend that I’ve only met up with a few times. In two weeks, she’s supposed to get married. Since the first time we’ve met, she’s expressed hesitations about it and has mentioned that she wishes she has time to explore being single because she’s always been in relationships. I totally understand those hesitations, and acknowledge that people can develop crushes while in a relationship. However, this weekend was her bachelorette weekend. She invited a guy that she’s been talking to that she’s crushing on. At the end of the night, he went home and she was actually mad that he didn’t end up going home with her. All this time I had figured it was a joke that had gone a bit far, but she was dead serious in that she really wanted to take this guy home and sleep with him.

So my dilemma is, would I be the asshole for telling her fiancé, or his sister who was here this weekend that she intended on cheating, even though it didn’t actually happen? I’ve never met her fiancé, and since nothing actually happened, I feel in ways like it’s not my place to say anything. But on the other hand, as a victim of cheating, I really have zero respect for cheaters and I’m so angry that she’s actually trying to get away with this.",41,49,0.92

1944,Asshole,"Alright so I got tickets to see The1975. During the process of getting the tickets I decided on seating tickets instead of standing because honestly the idea of being shoved around in the standing area for 2 hours just—yeah it wasn't for me. So I ended up getting tickets up in the bleachers in the very last row so that I was looking down at the stage from above. However, the seats were angled in such a way that if someone seated in front of me were to stand up, I wouldn't be able to see shit.

The concert was last night and these two girls in front of me and my friend decided to stand up during the very first song. Nobody else in the seated area of the whole stadium (seriously) was standing but them. Great. Sure I was annoyed because I basically had to break my neck to see what was going on on stage but I let it go because they sat down for the next song. Or at least I thought. Sure enough, halfway through the next song they stood up AGAIN. I noticed that some other people in the seating section who wanted to stand up got up and moved behind the last row (behind me) where they would not be blocking anybody in the seated area. Completely baffled me how inconsiderate these two girls in front of me were.

So I gently tapped one of the girls on shoulder and very POLITELY using my customer service voice (I work part time in a restaurant lol), ""Hi! I'm so sorry but we can't see a thing :(."" Now I'm thinking, if I were her I'd be like, ""My bad!"" and move to the back where the other people who wanted to stand were but nOOOOO. This girl replied in a very snappy manner, ""uHM, can't you guys STAND?"" to which I replied in an equally snappy manner, ""this is a SEATING AREA.""

The girl I spoke to ended up sitting down but when she told her other friend about it her friend just brushed it off and continued standing, causing my friend to have to constantly lean into my lap just to see the stage. They eventually moved to the front of our seating section and stood against the railings to get closer to the band where I'm pretty sure they were blocking the view of the people seated in the front row lol rip.

If they wanted to stand and dance so bad why didn't they get standing tickets? Also I completely understand standing in the seated area if the band was like, ""everybody on ur feet!!!"" or some shit like that (which happened towards the end and everybody did stand up including me) but if literally nobody else in the sitting section is standing and you know the people sitting behind you are not standing, then DUDE, why?

1946,Asshole,"My boyfriend's friend is getting married. Because she's so... unique... she's decided to have a floral/pastel wedding in the middle of a New England autumn. Because she's apparently a control freak, all guests must adhere to the wedding color scheme. I *hate* floral patterns and have been going absolutely nuts trying to find a dress I like (and would preferably wear again). It's been hell.

Well I finally found a dress. It's a nice pastel blue and lacy. I love lace. *Buuuuut*.... it doesn't have sleeves. Remember, this is going to be New England fall. As in it could very easily be very cold. So I went in search of a sweater to go on top. I settled for a simple white cardigan. I figure my ""flower"" aspect can be a necklace or barrette or something.

So I'm showing my outfit to my sister who happens to be the maid of honor. She likes it but mentions that its very similar in concept to the bride's wedding dress. Apparently the bride is wearing a lace white dress with blue under layers. So yes... it's not the exact same but it's similar. My mind immediately jumped to me being ""that woman."" You know the one. The one the bridesmaids talk about, the bride fears, and someone plots to spill red wine on.

I'm pretty sure I'm overthinking this. My sister says it's fine since none of the other guests know about the dress and I shouldn't be expected to either. But I do know because she told me. That would morally put me in the wrong if this is an asshole move. But is it?

EDIT: well good morning Reddit. Let me address a couple things.

First, I’m getting a lot of comments saying I’m arguing back. Maybe it came across that way. I was simply responding to new messages as they popped up before I went to bed. I guess doing that over and over again to the few comments at the time would look like arguing to people who came later. I didn’t meant to come across that way. I was simply clarifying because in my mind, not everybody comes back to posts they comment on if they don’t get a reply. My bad. I’ll stop responding to everybody. 

Second, yes... my first few sentences about the bride are pretty harsh. Again, tone over the Internet is not my friend. My unique comment was about the fact that the bride is both insisting on a spring themed wedding and an autumn date in a part of the country it will be cold and dark. That doesn’t line up to me. If you want a spring wedding have a spring date. As for calling her a control freak, you’re right. I’m a bit salty about the dress code. I’ve never had a bride tell me what to wear outside of a level of formality. I thought it was weird to begin with. I also hate dresses and shopping in general so this was already going to be unpleasant for me. But to top it off, I hate the colors and patterns she picked out. So yeah, I was a bit harsh in my words. But that’s because I’m exasperated at this point and it was late at night after going back and forth about “what do you think of x combination or y combination” with people. I don’t like shopping. I don’t like fashion. This has been hard for me. But you’re right. I’ve always believed a bride has a right to have her wedding the way she wants. I just let my frustration cloud that this time. 

Third, the resounding verdict is that not only would be but I currently am an asshole for even entertaining this thought. I can accept this judgement. The whole reason I made this post is because I have this huge fear of sticking out and/or ruining the night. The whole “bride wearing blue” thing is throwing me off! I know it’s tradition to not wear white but the brides not wearing only white. I am in societal norm hell right now. 

The whole point of this is that I DONT want to make the asshole mistake. I’ve been deeply analyzing every outfit option I find. “Is it on theme enough?” “Will I stick out?” Etc etc. I’ve run each outfit by a lot of people to get a wide range of options. The only one I got a unanimous “yes that works” on is the outfit above. But that didn’t sit right with me. So I came to reddit because you say it like it is. You’ve confirmed my fears, pretty loudly. I will keep looking.",163,288,0.88
1947,Asshole,"Bit of back story: When my partner was younger his dad cheated on his mum, it obviously really tore her up and they ended up getting divorced, and yeah his dad is kinda just a piece of shit. My partner always swore up and down he would never be like his father... guess the apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree.

So this weekend I found out my boyfriend has been doing some pretty fucked up and shady things behind my back, honestly I’m so devastated, I never thought he would be THAT guy and I don’t think I’ve ever felt so betrayed and hurt, he’s stripped me of any self confidence I had left, he’s made me question my sanity and my judgement/gut feelings... I’m basically just really fucked up all this.
I haven’t made a decision about weather I’ll break up with him or not (I know I’m silly) I do still have so much love for him, we have been through so much together. Now, his mum fucking ADORES me, sometimes I think she likes me more than she likes her son, and if she ever found out about what he has done to me she would kill him, I considered telling her myself but I’m starting to think that a good way to teach him a lesson/see if he’s actually serious about continuing on with our relationship (he’s been begging for forgiveness) Is making him tell her himself, I think maybe then he might just feel some of the pain I’ve been feeling... to have to look in your mother’s eyes and explain how much of a piece of shit you are while knowing she raised you better than that.

So WIBTA if I made him tell his mum? Is it a petty move? Is it right to want him to hurt like I do?

EDIT: okay it’s pretty clear I’m the asshole, thankyou guys for making me pull my head out of my ass before I did something really stupid.. really shouldn’t be thinking like that when I’m not in a good frame of mind, lesson learned!",187,798,0.92
1948,Not the A-hole,"  

For context:  We are generally both good students at school and have had similar grades and achievements in the past.

My twin and I both took this exam during the beginning of Sophomore year after studying for it over the summer. Because I concentrated more on studying while my twin spent more time on other things (reading books, playing games, etc.), I scored significantly better than him on the test, though we both scored quite well for a first try. Because my parents wanted my brother to get a higher score, they offered to buy him a new iPhone if he reached a set score. He took it again at the beginning of junior year and got this score, so my parents bought him a new phone worth 1000 dollars. Now, I am planning on taking the test again, and asked my parents if they would give me the same prize if I were to reach the set score for my twin. My parents responded that since I scored higher originally, I had to increase my score by how much my twin did, which is more than what it takes to get a perfect score, so they said I had to get a perfect score to get the prize. While I understand this situation sounds quite privileged, I still feel that my parents should give me and twin the same standards for earning a prize, especially because the initial difference in scores was due to a difference in time studying, which my parents agree with. However, they still say that I must get a perfect score to get the prize that my twin got. To be honest, it feels like I am losing out on a easier opportunity just because I worked harder to prepare the first time. What do you guys think?

p.s. My parents have also offered the same reward with my twin’s second score, but with the added condition that if I don’t meet it (I get the same or worse as my previous score), I have to give them 500 dollars of my own money, which is a condition that was never mentioned when my twin retook it.",127,698,0.97

1954,Asshole,"My boyfriend has had trouble with his skin for a long time. In particular, shaving leaves his skin severely irritated. When I met him, he had a very rough beard, which he said he kept to avoid shaving. About a year ago he started a white-collar job which meant he had to shave it off. Since then shaving has been a pretty bad experience for him. Every morning he goes to work with a very bad red neck and face. He started to shave in the shower at my direction and that helps a little, but it’s still pretty bad. 

A few months ago, his birthday was coming up. I am really bad at buying presents, and was pumped when I thought I had figured out the perfect present. I had done some research and bought him exfoliate, a razor for sensitive skin and some other shaving-relating products to round it all out. I was excited to finally be proud of a present I got for him.

His birthday was last week, and it turns out exfoliating and this new razor doesn’t entirely fix his issues, but helps immensely. He was absolutely ecstatic and said it was the best present he had ever received, and he felt he could finally move past the discomfort and embarrassment of having inflamed skin every day.

While he was thanking me, I told him that I had been holding onto that present for three months and had been dying to give it to him the whole time, and that at times I had almost broken and given it to him early. Upon hearing I had it for months, he suddenly turned.

He has been furious with me the last week and we just can’t agree on who is at fault here – our friends/family are equally split so I’m interested to hear Reddit’s take. 

His perspective is that I have been allowing him to suffer for my own benefit. He seems particularly mad about that fact that every morning he complains about his skin and for three months I’ve had the “option to fix it” and decided not to so I could maximise my own gratification. He thinks it’s the equivalent of if I had, for example, terrible back pains and he stumbled on a pill that would fix it, bought it and then decided to wait three months to give it to me while watching me suffer every day.

I think that’s a pretty big exaggeration. I do see where he is coming from, but I feel like he is being very ungrateful for a well thought out present. I just wanted to bring him happiness on his birthday and didn’t feel like it was so serious that waiting was immoral. He is so difficult to buy presents for, and I had finally figured something out and if I gave it to him early I’d be left at square one and faced with the likelihood of disappointing him.

1957,Asshole,"For context, I own the house I live in. I work from home and I own a business- I am completely able to take care of the animals I adopt by myself. My boyfriend and I started dating 4 years ago and moved in together 2 years ago. I have always been wealthy, but very good with my money. When we started dating I made sure to let him know I have no self-control when it comes to animals in need and I would adopt any and all animals that needed me.

&#x200B;

He lives with me rent-free. He's currently in university studying full time. He does have a job but all expenses go towards paying off his university debt. I pay a maid to come in and clean once a week. The house is completely clean all the time; the animals inside the main house do not make a mess. We have a granny flat outside that I use to keep the rest of my animals.

Recently we had a massive fight because I brought home a new pet. This would be rescue number 23. I got her from an online listing. She's an incredibly underweight female rat (about half the weight she should be) as well as a URI. She's been checked out by my vet and my vet is confident she'll be completely fine. My boyfriend got so angry at me and said he's sick of all these animals and if I didn't stop rescuing them he'd leave me.

I told him he was being unreasonable since it's my house and he doesn't see the animals all that often. He responded saying he hates rodents and he hates that I walk around with them on my shoulder constantly (along with handling other animals). He told me it's not fair to him to not tell him I got a new pet until after I got it and I told him it's none of his business what I do in my house. I told him to get the fuck out of my house until he learned some damn respect. I've done nothing but support him, but I absolutely will not budge about literally saving the lives of animals in distress.

1962,Everyone Sucks,"So yesterday night two friends and I went to see It chapter two. There were a few girls sitting in front of us, and one of them was using her phone during the credits. Okay, that’s fine whatever it’s just the credits, who cares. So anyways the credits end and she is STILL on her phone. At this point I’m getting a little ticked off, especially because her friends are asking her to get off her phone. She complies, but not for long. Every time she got a notification she would go on her phone, mostly Snapchat. Then after texting whoever texted she would go on Instagram for a few more minutes and then a jump scare would happen and she would put it away until the next notification would pop up. Now I’m easily distracted, as I have adhd, and while I’m not using that as an excuse it was really annoying to have the bright glow of the phone in my view constantly. So finally I hit my boiling point where she is on her phone for a prolonged period of time, I lean over and whisper “get the f*ck off your phone.” She gets a bit shocked and stands up in the middle of the movie, turns to me and says “are you talking to me?!?” I look at her, nod my head, and wave. Then I ignore whatever she said next, I honestly don’t remember it, and then go back to watching the movie. She then proceeds to turn her brightness up on her phone while continuing to use her phone. Then her friend (a few seats down from her) takes out her phone and just lifts it above her seat to annoy me. I decide to just focus on the movie and deal with the fact that she wasn’t going to stop it for the rest of the movie, as the original girl continued to use her phone. While that was happening my friend started to get mad at me saying “what you did was so rude, you should apologize” and “I don’t want to hangout with a person who acts like an asshole to random people.” I’m genuinely confused because I didn’t think what I said was bad, and it’s not like I said it like a douchebag or loudly, although that is subjective and I’m inherently biased. I just wanted to know, am I the asshole and should I have apologized?

Edit: so I’ve come to the conclusion that what I said was rude and shouldn’t have been the first thing I did. Although I don’t believe telling a staff member would’ve done anything as I’m pretty sure that the guy on my right (didn’t know him) told a staff member. All the staff member did was walk up and down the aisle and look around to no avail as she put it away. I think the word fuck just lost all meaning to me at this point because of how much my friends and I use it, and I am going to try to remove curse words from my vocabulary. Thank you to everyone for showing me what I could’ve done instead and exactly what I did was wrong.",71,54,0.84

1965,Not the A-hole,"Hey all, got an interesting scenario for you here. 

I (20M) have 3 friends in college (19F, 20F and 21F), that I have been friends with for 3 years. For context, I am white, and my 3 friends are black, Chinese-American and Indian-American. They are really good friends of mine and I love them dearly, as they have listened to my problems and have helped me grow as a person going through a stressful time in college. 

However, they often comment and joke about white people, and it’s usually kinda funny. However, sometimes there is no joke, and it feels like they’re taking a deliberate jab at white people for something. Example: my one friend looked through my fridge in my apartment and basically said that everything I had in there (mostly frozen stuff- I know I don’t eat healthy but I want to learn how to cook now that I have my own place!) was ‘white people food’ and that I should learn how to cook real food instead. They had some comment related to white people for every piece of food in my apartment except for the loaf of bread I keep in there. Sometimes they’ll make straight-faced comments that sound honestly like insults, and then they’ll look at me and say ‘No offense, Ruskie’. I don’t take offense, but sometimes they get to me and make me feel disgusted to be white (not for a long time, but in that moment). 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I said something to them about how their comments make me feel? I’m anticipating many of you to say they’re toxic people but they really aren’t- they are good friends who always have my back but just say things that bug the hell out of me sometimes.",38,30,0.82

1971,Not the A-hole,"Currently I'm the only family member who will have anything to do with my brother and that is because of his past behaviour. Growing up he would bully me and my younger sister, both physically and mentally. He was rude to my older sister and our parents. He would constantly get into trouble and blame mother and father. 

As an adult his behaviour got worse and there was constant friction. Our parents acted as a guarantor so he could rent a flat and put down the deposit. When he left he still owed rent and had caused damage to the property and mother and father ended up having to pay for it. He never paid them back. He only ever contacts anyone when he wants something and when we see him he is always rude and ill mannered. He has caused an unbelievable amount of friction.

I can't go into detail as I'd be here all day. My parents and two sisters don't want anything to do with him. I still have some contact with him as I feel bad that the rest of the family won't, even though it's kind of his fault. I believe that the reason he behaves as he does is because he has narcissistic personality disorder and he genuinely doesn't believe that he has ever behaved badly.

Recently he has been asking why no one wants anything to do with him and I have been fobbing him off with vague answers. He says he doesn't understand as we used to be so close (in reality we never were). He also said that he always did what he could to help the family (false) and that he was always the one who always contacted family and invited them out (also false). He can perform the most amazing mental gymnastics that leave him believing that he is the best.

1972,Everyone Sucks,"For a little bit of context, we're all high school students a few weeks away from graduating. So, we've recently discussed plans to keep in touch and occupy our free time after high school. During class, we as an entire friend group discussed the possibly of a vacation, and we all agreed to take one across Australia. This was discussed with my friend Gan, who has been an extremely close friend to me for six years. During this discussion, Gan joked that I wouldn't be able to take care of myself during this vacation due to my lack of independence (which is a completely baseless assumption, I'm the oldest of all my friends at 18). I replied that he should take care of me during our vacation, which was a JOKE about my Mum requesting that he takes care of me on a camp 6 years ago.

A bit of further context, we attend the same sports centre, and my Mum texts me quite often so when my phone is out of batteries, she instead messages Gan for an update on me, about once every three weeks. He does have issues with this, but I asked him to continue doing this because my Mum cannot contact anyone else - we are the only two together. I do not understand his grievances with this - he receives the message, and passes it to me so I can reply on his phone at no cost.

Now, to two days ago. I leave for the next class. I am told the next day in person by Gan that they have voted me out of the vacation. I asked my other friends what happened, and they told me that Gan lead a vote in order to remove me from the vacation. As a result of his reasons and pushing, the group unanimously voted me out of the vacation. Others in the group are not close friends, so I assume their votes were made with his prodding. His reasons are provided later.

I was furious when I found out. I was ready to cut off our friendship then and there. When I next saw him again, I asked him why he did that, and he began arguing with me, and said that he was worried my Mum was going to be too overbearing and ruin the vacation with her persistence. He provides more reasons later. 

I left in anger. Lunchtime comes around, and he comes back and apologises to me, and says that it was a 'dick move'. However, he provides another reason that when I made that 'joke' earlier, he took it seriously, and thought I really wanted him to take care of me, and thus became angry himself. He then says I can of course attend the vacation.

Yet, despite his apology made, I cannot find it in my heart to forgive him, and am still very angry. I feel betrayed at the fact that my close friend of six years, lead a vote to remove me from a vacation, all because of a concern over my Mum and a simple joke. I find it even more hurtful that he seemed to not understand the ramifications of his actions until I began getting extremely angry with him. I am angry that he did not personally discuss his issues with me, before leading my own friends against me to get rid of me.

It was dark outside, heavily raining and we were on a pebble road and he still acted like I was wrong. AITA?",47,42,0.9

1977,Not the A-hole,"There’s this build-your-own pizza place that I really like in my area (same design/idea as MOD but an independent, local chain). Most of the time I dine in, but for the first time last month, I placed an online order to take home. I ordered my pizza through the online platform; but only about 10 minutes before my order was supposed to have been ready, I got a text from the order online company that my order had been cancelled and refunded.

Their explanation was that the pizza place never responded to my order (which I presume would have been sent via text/call) and when they tried to call the shop repeatedly to get confirmation, there was no answer. This place gets insanely busy around dinner time and the lines can be slow, so I’m assuming they ignored or didn’t notice the calls or notifications.

I didn’t get too worked up over this, and gave the online order another chance on Friday. The exact same thing happened again. I contacted the manager of the pizza place, and told him of the two incidents. I did so not in an angry, complaining way (because I still really like the place); more in a helpful, constructive way, mostly just hoping to remind everyone there to answer the phone when they hear it.

But the manager I spoke to sounded very angry and concerned about it (much more so than I was), and I fear that I’ve likely gotten the employees there in a lot of trouble. Was I an asshole for reporting this?",15,77,0.88
1978,Not the A-hole,"I am currently 17 at the time of this post, this story spans 7 years.

(TL;DR at the end ;) )

7 years ago my parents got into a big fight (They had been having issues for years) and I thought I was to blame.  A few weeks later I was asked to decide to choose who to live with, I decided to live with my father, my sisters went on to live with my mother. I had been struggling with depression ever since.

About 4 years later, me and my sisters (who had moved in with me a year prior) weren't doing well academically, so my father decided to hire a tutor. He told us he got a woman so that she can freely interact with my sisters.

3 years later (these last few months) my father told us that he wants to get married again, we asked who, and he said he wants to marry the tutor, that they had been talking for a while, and it's starting to become a real idea. NGL I was relieved he wasn't bringing in someone new, because over the last few years we created a strong bond with the tutor, so even though I was weirded out a bit I ""consented"" and that was that.

Yesterday, my mother got word of this (not from my father) and came to talk to me privately. She said that she was afraid of the tutor suddenly switch faces once she got with my father. I told her that we trusted the tutor and didn't see that as a likely outcome.

She said that this woman had been talking to my father since before my parents were divorced (over 7 years ago). She was the reason my parents split, not me. My mother then told me that the woman and my father sent a spy (her brother) after my mother to try and catch a moment of her ""flirting with a man."" My father even went as far as planting bugs in my moms room to try and expose her, to no avail. After my mother found out, she left my father within the week, and somehow my father was able to spin off that my mother was seeing other people, that's what he told his parents. 

Upon realizing what happened to my mother, and that their divorce wasn't my fault, I cried for the first time in 7 years. She started crying too, which kind of proves her innocence. I felt like I had ""sided"" with the wrong person, I couldn't believe the pain she went through. She then asked me to keep this to myself (my sisters don't know).

Now Reddit tell me, if I expose this homewrecker bitch, will it be worth it? I don't wont my mom to be caught in the middle, she comes first. I am also SERIOUSLY considering leaving my father to live at my mom's. If they've been holding their breath for that long, they can have each other. I also don't want to break my little sisters' hearts, because we have a good relationship with the tutor, that even evolved into love. Our relationship with our father is astronomical, he is my best friend.

EVERYTHING my dad did for the last 3 years was for this, it as all planned.

TL;DR: A bitch convinced my dad to do some shady shit and leave my mom, and have been waiting for a chance to get together for 7 years",61,337,0.92
1979,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for 3 years, married for almost 2 months. About a year into the relationship he adopted a purebred chihuahua. When we moved in together last May, the dog obviously came with us. The dog is a menace. He barks all hours of the day, pees all over everything, and shits inside the apartment all the time, even after just being taken out. He regularly pees on our bed (he did that just last night actually). He’ll also go under our bed and pee. He barks at nothing and will not be silenced. The other day I was in our office doing work for my classes and trying to eat some lunch and the dog came and shit in the floor right in front of me, about 20 minutes after being taken out. That day, I told my husband I could not stand the anxiety this dog brought anymore. I told him either something has to change in the dog’s behavior, or he will have to choose between me and the dog. He said he’d take him to obedience classes. I agreed to see if the classes would make a difference. My husband has not even looked into getting him into obedience classes yet. Today, we had company over and the dog crawled into one of our friend’s laps and peed. In his lap. Then he jumped off and peed all over his phone and all over the floor under our other friends’ shoes. I have had it with the dog. I doubt obedience classes will work, if my husband even gets around to enrolling the dog in them. I don’t know how much longer I can stand this dog. AITA for wanting him gone?

EDIT: I just wanted to clear a few things up really quickly 
•For those asking, my husband and I have a wonderful marriage besides the issues with the dog. He’s kind, caring, patient, and he does whatever he can to make me happy.
•We also have 2 cats who are very well-behaved. I’m the one who cleans up after them (litter box, etc) 99% of the time 
•My husband does clean up after the dog if an accident occurs while he is home. If he’s at work or at classes and I’m home, the responsibility falls on me. Our roommate also helps some. 
•Yes, the dog is neutered.

EDIT 2: there are so many people telling me it’s my dog too simply because I married my husband. And I disagree. My husband adopted the dog on his own before we were married. Just like I adopted my 2 cats before we were married. I’m responsible for the care of my cats, and he’s responsible for the care of his dog. That’s the arrangement that we’ve always had based on the responsibilities that we each took on. We do help each other with our pet-related duties as needed but I do not consider the dog to be mine. I also do not consider the dog to be family. Since the dog has always behaved this way I was never able to connect with him in that way.",78,28,0.73

1982,Not the A-hole,"My mom died when I was 6, and my dad remarried when I was 9, the women he married had a daughter one year younger than me so she was 8.  At first I loved having a new ""mom"" she wasn't the best and will never replace my real mom but I appreciate her trying to be there for me and I am pretty close with her and my dad.  At first I loved having a ""sister"" and we got along great, I loved having a play mate during vacations and always having a player 2.

The problems really started to amp up when I was 13 and she was 12, it seemed like no matter what I did went unpunished in her eyes and she had to mock me constantly.  Being a hot headed 13 year old usually meant id retaliate and we would have those long screaming matches till either of our parents told us to knock it off or they would send up to different parts of the house to cool off.

I also started playing football when I was 11 and my problem was that I was constantly getting injured.  In 8 years (11-18) I got 7 major sidelined injuries.  On top of all that I was kinda chubby (about 180-210)  She used to make fun of me for my injuries and my weight which were very touchy subjects for me her favorite insult was ""you fat cripple loser!"" or ""maybe if you lost some weight you wouldn't get injured so often."" 

She also loved to embarrass me when friends were over by bringing up dumb stuff I did when I was like 9 or 10 (my friends are great people but we tease each other a lot and would usually remember anything embarrassing we did and bring it up later).  So whatever she said to them would always get back.  I did talk with her if she could just shut up when I have my friends over, and she basically told me to F off and that its her house too.  At this point in my life (16yo) I am super pissed at how shitty she has treated me over the years, I know I caused some if and usually fought back when she got snippy and bratty at me but I rarely started a fight.

I moved out when I was 18 without ever telling her I was moving out or saying goodbye.  the past 5 years of unpleasantness between us made me happy that I didn't have to see her.  A year later she moves out and I still resented her for how we treated each other.  We go almost 2 years without speaking other than on holidays and thats really only dry stuff nothing big.  I am no 22 and she's 21 and I got a text the other night asking why we aren't close like we were when we were kids.  I basically said I don't care to get along with you or get close because of how we treated each other as kids.  She told me to grow up and not even an hour later I get a call from my dad asking why I have so much hate for my ""sister"" years since we have lived together.  I told him ill be cordial and won't cut her out of my life but I don't need or want to be close with her.

1985,Not the A-hole,"I have ASD, and my whole family knows as much. I'm particularly prone to sensory overload, especially from persistent loud noises.

Recently, my sister got married, and I was a bridesmaid. I did everything as I was supposed to during the ceremony, I was there for the official photographs. The reception was where issues arose. Basically, she had a live band, as well as a lot of people crammed into a relatively small space. I managed about 30 minutes of 'mingling' before I really couldn't take it anymore and had a 'shutdown'. For anybody not familiar with autism, this is an involuntary phenomenon, and basically means I couldn't communicate and seemed 'spaced out'. It's like a meltdown, but internalised. I managed to get to the bathroom and was in there for maybe 20 minutes. When I came out, people were sitting down for dinner, and I knew I couldn't hack it. I felt very shaky, and needed some properly quiet time, so I told my mum what was happening, apologised profusely, and left.

My sister is really upset, which is understandable, it was her big day and I do feel bad that I took away from it. She says there are no photos of me at the reception, and she had to move one of our cousins to the head table to avoid having an empty space, but she looks out of place without a bridesmaid's dress. I've apologised to her, but she's not really accepting it, and a few of my family members are backing her up and saying I should have gritted my teeth and stayed at least until after the first dance.

1987,Not the A-hole,"Recently a good friend of mine moved out of state, and her boyfriend was unable to, due to his probation. So i offered up a room in my house to him. What he was payin is waaaay below market, and way cheaper than ive ever rented to anyone, in other words, i did him a favor.

In the few months he was here, he was a clean roomate, and somewhat helpful around the house. However, he would always make these comments “if you dont get a better tv, im moving out” “if you dont get better internet, im moving out”, “i could live at blah blah blah for cheaper”. On top of that, he violated his probation TWICE while living here, putting his chances of being able to move with his GF in jeopardy. I also have reason to believe he may have been doing illegal activities out of my house, but im not certain so i wont go into details. Also, my girlfriend has told me multiple times that she feels like he is trying to pit us against each other. 

End of last month, he comes home with a new 1000 dollar lap top, and has a new Stetson cowboy hat. Then he tells me he will be lte with rent. When the rent is 5 days late, he tells me he needs two more days. I told him he has two days to get me the rent, or he is out. He paid me within 2 hours of the ultimatum. 

It got tense from there on out (telling people i snapped and yelled at him, which i did not) and i eventually told him he can stay the month but then he needs to leave, or if he leaves earlier, i can pro-rate his rent. All of this i think im completely justified for, but in a moment of anger, I basically told him i think he is a manipulative liar, who paints himself as a victim, and made a possibly unnecessarily cruel comment about his probation violations.

1988,Everyone Sucks,"Okay so this is a bit hard to explain, but lets start off from when we met.

Okay so I knew this girl (Lets name her Jessica) since 5th grade and we're both in our senior year at high school. Even since we were in middle school, she's always been a nasty, rude, disrespectful and unfriendly person. She always treats people poorly and manipulates her friends. Now physically speaking, she isn't a very attractive person. She's obese and not very cute. Which is fine, but she always treated her self like a top tier model, what I mean by that is how she's always criticizing how others look and making fun of literally ever boy thats been in our classes. 

For example a boy can walk past her to sharpen his pencil, and she would talk about how ugly he was and how she would never date him and what not. Everyone that's not part of her direct circle hated her snobby personality but nobody every checked her on it, so she carried that same childish personality into high school.

Anway so a few days ago, we were in english class and our teacher began assigning us partners to work with for this movie project worksheet we had to work on. And you guessed it, my partner was non other than Jessica. So I sit a few chairs behind Jessica and her circle and right away I heard her moaning like she was being tortured and even heard her talking about how ugly I was and what not. I'm not a handsome person but I'm far from being ugly. Anyway the teacher told us to get with our partners and he walked out of the room to get some materiel and what not. As I was walking to her, she starts going ""Eww I would never date him. Like I'd rather die than date"", mind you she started the whole discussion about if you'd date me and it got me pretty pissed. So I responded and said ""calm down not like I would wanna date your fatass"". She instantly started crying and saying how I was dick for making fun of her insecurities and what not. Her little posse of friends jumped in and told me to fuck off and what not. The teacher walked and after a while, he said I should apologize or he'll get the administration involved, I'm in a running for some scholarships, so I didn't want to risk that so I apologized. We got it settled, but pretty much every girl in the school hates me, while the boys all support my actions and told me that it needed to be said.",225,1934,0.87

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk.

Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what.

1994,No A-holes here,"I'm in my last year of undergrad and I have made it routine to sell my textbooks from the previous year through my school's used textbook facebook group. I had gotten stuck with this particular textbook for a few years because the class I used it for had been taught by different professors who required different books. This year, the same professor, Dr. H, was teaching this class and required the same textbook that I was in possession of.

I found out through a friend that Dr. H had very suddenly resigned right before the start of term and that the faculty now had to quickly find replacement professors for the classes he was meant to teach. A few days after that, I saw a post in the textbook group from a student looking for the textbook for Dr. H's class. I had a feeling that whoever replaced Dr. H would likely want to use a different book, but decided if this person was asking for the book then they did still, in fact, require it for the class. I replied to the post, we met up, and I sold the student my book. 

A couple of days after the sale, the student messaged me saying that they had indeed been assigned a new professor who required a different book and she asked if I would refund her the money and take back the book. I told her I was not able to do that because the general spirit of facebook marketplace is ""buyer beware"" and it was not my fault that she bought her book early and ended up not needing it. I had something very similar happen to me and I was lucky that I was able to sell the book to someone quickly the next term. She was understandably very angry as the book had cost her $60, but even if I wanted to give her back her money I couldn't because I have already spent it on my books for this year.

My friend who told me about Dr. H's resignation thinks I took advantage of this student to make money and that I should have warned them that their professor was subject to change or offered to wait until after her first scheduled class to make the transaction.

1996,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So I'm sure I already sound like the asshole but here we go...

Background:

I (25) lived on my own for a few years before meeting my husband (25) and I met and basically all of my things became ""ours"" as he moved from living with his parents into my apartment. After a few years of being together we had a daughter and unfortunately she has a variety of health problems and is autistic as well, she needed a lot of attention from me and I had to quit my job and be a full time mom. With this came a lot of financial issues. My husband's father (50s) and brother(30s) lived with his mother and were looking to move out as his parents have been divorced for quite some time and his brother wanted a change of scenery. So we all decided to move in together and because I lived on my own for so long no one had to worry about appliances or dishes/utensils/couches/TVs/my car etc because I had everything. Essentially everything came from my home and was purchased by myself at some point. I have NEVER brought this up or cared that anyone uses my stuff. As far as I'm concerned we are all family and I have no problem sharing. 

The Other Day:

So this brings us to the other day. My daughter has a horrible time sleeping. She always has and sometimes it's worse than other times. Everyone in my home is aware of this. The other day my daughter slept a combined 2 hours and I was up all night with her. Exhausted does not even begin to describe how tired we both were. Anyway, we were sitting on the couch and she was just about to fall asleep when my brother in law comes in the room shouting and cooing at her and picking her up and poking her which resulted in a meltdown, her not sleeping until 11pm that night and just a horrible day all together. I didn't say anything to my BIL at the time as I was mildly annoyed but he didn't do it on purpose (he was happy to see her whatever), but I texted my husband annoyed and that's when my husband texted his brother pissed telling him to fuck off and stop bothering our child. From there my BIL without a word to anyone, changed the WIFI password and told me I was disrespectful and I am not allowed to use HIS wifi until I apologise. We all pay for the wifi. It was in my name literally up until a week ago. I told him I had nothing to apologise for as I was frustrated and I wasn't even the one who yelled at him. He called me disrespectful and said he does more for my daughter than anyone in the family (a whole nother issues he most certainly does not) so I asked him one more time and he refused so I told him he cannot use my fridge/couch/TV/utensils/nothing and he can buy his own. 

My father in law thinks I took it too far by not letting him use anything in the house anymore but I disagree. 

So Reddit, AITA?

1998,No A-holes here,"Life’s been hectic recently so I’m not sure if I’m being emotional or rational at the moment. Thanks for reading. 

So I’m a part of the choir program at my school, and our first concert/recital was last night. I had never sung (professionally) a day in my life before October of last year, so I’m very new to all of this. Every single one of my friends is in said choir program, and they all told me I was joining and have been tutoring me and helping me for the past year. I’m actually pretty good now, I’m on track to be in the highest level (where they all are) next year, so they’ve been doing a good job.

Each of the three levels performs a different night, so theirs is tonight.  I’ve made it super important to me that I go to every single concert of theirs and only missed one freshman year because I was in Utah. (we’re all juniors, btw.) I even bring them flowers or candies or gifts to show I’m proud of them. I know not everyone places meaning on that kind of stuff so that’s why I sat and asked them if they were all able to come see me about two weeks ago when I found out the dates. This is my very first performance EVER and I told them how important it was to me that they tried to please be there.

They all said no. All three of my best friends said they had to work, or had a family thing, or that they couldn’t get a ride so they weren’t able to go. 

So yeah. I was super sad and I like...told them I understood and all that and I was still planning on going to theirs tonight because it isn’t their fault if stuff happens. I’m not gonna lie though, I’ve been a little upset with them at school, and I’ve cried at least every other day because it felt like they didn’t care. They did text me to say good luck before, but it isn’t the same, you know?

So I packed my stuff after the concert and I was walking out to my car when I heard them all yelling “SURPRISE!!!” Super loud. They all got me flowers and baked me cookies and had put confetti over my car in the shape of music notes. It was super cute of them. I asked them what they were doing and they told me they had come to see me, and had lied so they could surprise me and see the smile on my face. And I literally just started crying. They all came over and hugged me and all that, and we were all smiles and happy n shit, but I texted them after when we all got home and said that they really hurt me and made me feel like they didn’t care about me at all and to please next time just tell me they’re coming and surprise me with the cute other things.

They’re now really hurt because I guess it took a lot of planning, and they all thought it would make up for the lying and pretending. They make a good point, cause now I know they’re not just blatantly “fuck you”to things that make me happy but I’m still kinda sad because of it, you know? I spent two weeks sad when I could have been happy and then extra happy.

I dunno what to think and I’m confused and sad. I just don’t know. It’s all sucky. AITA?",23,61,0.94
1999,Not the A-hole,"For some background, my mom and dad fought a lot and last year my mom kicked him out.
