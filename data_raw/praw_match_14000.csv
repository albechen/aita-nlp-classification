0,Asshole,"I'm getting married next spring to my fiancé (30M), who has primary custody of his 5 year old daughter, Chloe. Chloe's bio mom is in and out of the picture, but has only seen her a handful of times this year, and last year was the same. Chloe's mom is now with another man and has two other children (aged 1 and 2). She does not pay child support.

Since we've been engaged, I've been nudging my fiance to get a paternity test for Chloe. He and Chloe's mom broke up because she was cheating on him, and he acknowledges there's a possibility Chloe isn't biologically his. I just want proof she's his before we get married. I'm not sure what I would do if she wasn't his, but I feel like I should be allowed to know the full situation since I'm paying for half her upbringing.

1,Not the A-hole,"I work at an engineering firm, and one of my coworkers is ""Tim""

Tim is the senior engineer on the project I'm working on. There are two guys also on this project with us.

I've felt increasingly weirded out by Tim, it seems like he's been trying to hit on me or get closer to me than is professionally appropriate. I'm not interested, he's a coworker, he's 40 something, he's married, need I go on?

I've told him a couple times to stop asking me personal things like about my dating life, stop being touchy, etc. And he acts kind of butthurt, like denying he did anything wrong, saying he was just being friendly, acting like I'm overreacting.

So, last night, I wrote up an email and I'm not sure if I should send it. It says:

---

Tim,

I do not appreciate how unprofessionally you have been acting towards me since I started at (Company). 

I have asked you several times to stop the your inappropriate behavior. It seems that you are either unwilling or unable to recognize and stop this behavior. So I am writing this email so that there is no further chance for confusion.

This is what I expect from you, in terms of professionalism:

- Do not touch my body again. Do not touch my neck or shoulders or arms or back to get my attention again. Do not put your hands on my hands again. Do not touch any other part of my body or clothing. 

- Do not ask me about my sex life, my dating life, or other personal topics again. Think before you speak, if it is not directly relevant to work, do not say it to me. Not alone nor in a group.

- Do not approach me outside the office again. Not in the parking lot, not in local restaurants or bars, do not come near my home. (Side note to the reader, he has never come to my home yet but he knows where it is, and that freaks me out.)

- Do not shut the door of a meeting room or office if you and I are the only attendees of the meeting. All meetings will be conducted in the public atrium or a meeting room with the door open such that we are in view of the main office.

(My name)

---

So that's what I wrote but I'm feeling kind of hesitant about sending it. It's pretty harsh. It's what I want to say, but I don't know if I'm making a reckless choice out of anger.

This is probably important to say; I don't have a lot of faith that HR will deal with things unless I have one hell of a paper trail first. One of my coworkers who I'm friends with was being harassed for being gay, by a different senior engineer, but since there wasn't any paper trail, HR treated it as a 'he said she said' thing and did next to nothing. Stuff got so bad for my friend that he quit. (Luckily, he's got a new job that he loves now!)

2,Not the A-hole,"In 1993 when I was 16(F) I met my biological mother and during that time,I was advised that her husband, John was my biological father; when I was conceived, my mother was 17/18 and John was married man with a family. 

The reason for the late introduction to my parents was that I was abandoned by my biological mother at the age of 2 &the courts granted custody to another (non-relative) person who raised me from ages 2-16;for 14 years I did not know that my mother was alive. In 92,John reunited with my mother and they got married and had my sister. It was around this time my mother confided John about my existence & they hired a private detective,I met them,&I heard a forbidden love story involving my mother,John and me being the result of such love affair to which I accepted as truth. 

John is very unwell;he &I have grew close as he's a really great guy but I always knew there was something off about our relationship. My mother & I are not close at all as she is utterly insane; I havent spoken to her in almost 6 years & I have no interest in having her in my life.

Fast forward to the present: after years of doubting my parental lineage & various disputes and my need to seek the truth, it was (forcibly) encouraged by my mother to obtain a DNA test as she had no doubt of my paternity. Well, I got one of those Ancestry DNA tests & determined that John is not my biological father; needless to say, I am very confused about this paternity deficiency. I am also very heart broken; everything that I know & have been told is a lie - that fucking stupid love story about me is all bullshit. 

I advised my mother & shared the DNA results have not heard from her (nor will I). I waited 2 weeks to shared the results with John and he responded ""I always knew that this call would happen, it was a matter of time"". A week later when I followed up with John, he advised that he spoke to my mother & they both concluded that my test results were wrong & that I am being dishonest with them; I am speechless about this; I have always insisted with John that nothing will change between us, I am truly appreciative of his presence in my life.

I have tried to share these results with my (half) siblings to be transparent; my half brother told me to ""fuck off"" & my half sister went off on me telling me that I am ungrateful for our parents from saving me from the abuse I lived with, and that ""daddy is so sick"" and for me to do this and ""to put the parents through this shit"" makes me an asshole.  

I have not spoken to anyone about this as I feel dreadful, maybe ashamed too; my therapist advised that it is not my fault and that what I am feeling is normal and justified, but I still cannot shake this feeling: AITA for getting this test and sharing it with my non-biological father?

TLDR: AITA for getting a DNA test and confronting my parents with the results (and one parent is unwell)?",142,659,0.94
3,Not the A-hole,"My younger son (15) is in need of a new phone. He’s into tech and has been eyeing up flagship phones, but me and my husband decided a 15yo doesn’t need one and said his budget was £600 which he accepted. When I told my older son he said that his phone needed upgrading too so when we went to buy his brother one he’d tag along too. 

At this point, the understanding was he’d pay for his own - he’s just started a well paying job and he’s worked throughout uni. He also graduated a month ago, and me and my husband have been deliberating over present for him. In the end, we agreed that we’d contribute £600 towards his purchase too. 

The younger son ended up with an iPhone 8, and my older one bought a Galaxy S10+. He accepted our £600 and paid the rest of the balance himself with his own money. 

My younger one says it’s really unfair how his brother got a vastly better and newer phone. I told him that his brother was an adult and used his own money (partly) and that he wasn’t even allowed a smartphone until he was in Yr12. However, we know that times have changed and the younger one has a had a budget Android (Moto M) for the last 3 years. We said that he’d get a high end model the next time his contract was up when we felt he’d be old enough to be responsible for such a phone.",850,4021,0.94

5,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway:

My (29f) g-parents had 3 kids, my dad was the middle child he passed away when I was 19. I am an only child, there are 6 g-children total. My g-pa died around 2 years ago. My g-ma died around 4 years ago. In the final Will it was stipulated, each g-child gets a set amount, and each child gets a set amount. In this Will, it also states that if their child predeceased them, then their share goes to any children they have. (So I got my share, plus my fathers).

This is not a small amount, but I'm not multimillionaire either. Of the other g-children, I'm considered the ""least successful"" in that I have my associate’s degree and work as a legal assistant. I have a dog, and live independently in an apartment near my job. My other cousins all are very wealthy, with advanced degrees and multiple kids each. I have 1 cousin though, who is successful but lives way beyond his means, and mooches off his parents (my dad's sister & husband) when bill collectors come around. I will 100% admit, he had a rough life, his father left when he was a kid, and his mom remarried a lot and my g-parents basically raised him. So it all came as a shock to him, when he only received the amount of us ""other"" cousins. So much so, that he tried to contest the Will. it took a year and at least 1/3 of his inheritance only for him to be disappointed in the end.

After talking it over with my Mom, and my boss, I've decided to take a leave of absence from work, (I've been there about 5 years, and have a very close relationship with my boss). I'm taking this time to do some travelling, and physically work on myself (losing that pesky 30 lbs that haunts me). Me and THAT cousin live in the same area of town, and go to the same gym. Always have gotten along, but he loves to make those snide comments, I started avoiding him about a year or so ago, but now that I have more free time, I have run into him a few times. He finally approached me with a ""Why are you here during the day??"" I told him that I am between jobs now (instead of admitting I left voluntarily) And once again got a ""Must be nice with all that money lying around"" After 2 years of hearing these comments, I'll admit I finally kind of snapped. Replied: ""Well, lets just remember how I got this money, wanna trade your mom's life for it?"" I'll admit it was a low blow, but at the same time, I only have this money because my father is DEAD. Just because he feels entitled to my grandparents money, doesn't give him the right to constantly remind me that I got a large share of it, I had to pay my own price for it. Anyways, he told me to ""fuck off"" and stormed away. I have not seen him since. When I told my mother, she was quite angry with me, reminding me his own father abandoned him. I still don't think I did anything wrong, but maybe I did...AITA?

Edit: To answer some repeat questions or comments: This cousin was raised from about 2-13 or so by my grandparents, but around 13 decided to go back to his mom and her then husband whom he got along with. Then, when my grandmother died 4 years ago (he was in his mid 30's) he started hanging around my grandpa again. I would not say he's closer than any of the rest of us. We ALL visited my grandpa, and he led a very active life until the end, I'd say other than the out of state cousin, we all saw him once a week or so. He just started acting overly nice and helping him out more, etc.  Also, he used the logic that he was more of a child to the grandparents, and that my fathers share should be split between the two Aunts (which is why the one got dragged in), which would have happened if I didn't exist. As for my mom, her and my dad were married 24 years and were still together when he passed away. I DID try to give the money to my mom, she wouldn't take it, nor was she willing to split it because ""In a few years, Medicaid will come for that money, and I'd rather it be yours"" I have a large chunk (over half) set aside for her so that I can make sure she is taken care of in her later years, but she's 64 and more active/healthy than most 20 year olds I know! She is also going on some of these trips we have planned, all expenses paid. If my cousin hadn't been such a jerk these last 2 years about everything, I would have considered funding a large family trip. But, me and my mother think now that the true colors have been shown, it's best to leave it.",298,4527,0.97

7,Not the A-hole,"For some background, this 11yo is a child of our neighbors who is roaming around the whole street and has a lot of interest in people's life around her. My mother is really friendly and likes to invite over people and knowing that, the 11yo comes in the house when she sees my mother coming back from work. She is nosy and likes to just roam over the whole house and see what we are doing. 

Today, I got up from bed in the afternoon after work when I saw the front door opened. She was inside the TV lounge and just causally opened the TV infront of me. She came in the house as usual when my mother came back from work. As a routine I ignored her and went back to my room to lie on my bed and scroll net. As a side note it really does annoys me when she just opens TV and roams around the house just like that and it's also uncomfortable. 

My mother went to her room to change into casual clothes. While I was scrolling I saw her standing on the door, staring at me. I asked her ""Do you need something?"". She says to me , ""No,Your sister asked me to check where my mother is"". Without waiting for a response from me, she just hopped towards my mother's room where she was changing. My mother never locks her room door. 

I got really annoyed and mad because I knew my sister would never ask her to ' check on my mother', because my mother always goes to change when she comes home. This was like a breaking point for me.

 I said ""Do you know that when you visit someone's place there are certain manners and protocols? How can you just come into someone's home and check what they are doing in their rooms? They could be freaking naked!!"". 

She lied again that my sister asked her to check out where my mother was. 

I called my sister and asked her about this. My sister refused that she said anything like that. I really lost a fuse up there in my head. I called her a 'freaking nosy liar', and someone who needs to get some manners installed in her before she enters someone's home. After my sister refuted her claim, she stopped responding to my questions towards her. She slowly picked up her shoes and left. 

Now my other sister thinks IATA for getting mad like that at a 11yo. My fiancee thinks that it's a breach of privacy for anyone to roam around like that and check on what people are upto in their rooms. 

So AITA?

Edit: I have had on numerous occasions in the previous year asked her to not just enter rooms like that. She knows it is not okay, hence she made a lie related to my mother and sister when I asked her why she was just checking in the room.",156,844,0.95
8,Asshole,"This is my alt acc and I’m on mobile. So my birthday is today, and my gf had planned a trip for us. She and I have been together for 3 years. We are going to go stay in a nice hotel and basically chill for a couple days. She does drink, and I do too, so we wanted to buy alcohol for the night. To be fair, she paid $312 for the hotel and she wanted to pay for my dinner and alcohol. 

Last night, my best friend and I hung out and she got me 10 fireball nips and 2 bottles of vodka. My two favorite drinks. So I texted my gf that I’d gotten us a bottle of vodka for our trip. I never said I’d bought it specifically, I just said I got it. She insisted that she pay for it, so I asked my friend how much she paid and told my gf ($20). Then my gf Venmo’d me $20. 

I told my friend what I was doing and she called me an asshole. She’s literally mad at me for it and told me to get out. I don’t think I did anything wrong because my gf wanted to pay for it and it’s none of my friend’s business, really. AITA?

9,Asshole,"So, my 18 year old son is at a youth conference this week, and he may not have enough money to cover the bill at the end of the week.  I know he expects me to bail him out, but what would happen if I refused?

Some background:  This is his second year attending the conference.  Last year we (his parents) agreed to pay for half the cost and I think he paid for his part through grants with our church and the conference organizers.  This year since he is now ""an adult"" we told him that HE would be responsible for the full amount. And to make it worse, the cost doubled. He’s had a part time job for the past year, and until he got his license recently had no real financial obligations, (he pays for gas and part of the insurance on the car that I own), so he really should have no problem saving enough money.  However, he does not control his spending. He typically spends his paycheck as fast as he gets them, with no thought of future expenses. So, despite knowing that he has to pay for the conference, he has continued his usual spending habits, and will probably not have enough to cover the conference expenses at the end of the week. I’ve told him that I will loan him the money, but I’m having second thoughts on that.  What would happen if when he calls at the end of the week I just tell him that he needs to work it out with the conference organizers?

If I do bail him out, I would take his debit card and probably his car keys (he can ride his bike or walk to work) until he pays me back.  I’m guessing that might last a week until his next paycheck.

14,Everyone Sucks,"Some back story here, my parents are split up and I  lived with my mom after their split. Couple of years later my dad remarries with my step mom. Every summer my mom usually takes me and siblings on a vacation. Well about the same time my dad and step mom do as well and ask if I would like to go, and I usually say no and go with my mom. Well this year I decided to mix it up and go with my dad and see what it was like. They where heading down to North Carolina for a few days and to hang out and explore. My dad told me before we left that we do things like fishing, kayaking, tubing and a bunch of other stuff in that vein. Well were now a few days into the trip and we've done none of those. All we have done is do things like hiking and sightseeing which is fine but not my cup of tea, I just find it boring and samey after a couple of times.

15,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve had the same girlfriend for about 2 and a half years. She’s met my parents and they get along well but I’ve never formally met her parents. Ive seen them around and said hi, but when it comes to actually meeting them, I’ve had the opportunity to, but I decline. 

For context, my girlfriend is Chinese. She grew up in America but her parents didn’t. Her parents are EXTREMELY traditional, to the point where they see their daughter as property, more or less. They barely can speak English. 

From what my girlfriend has told me, her parents don’t like me. They are extremely traditional and hate the idea of a white guy dating their daughter, since they are pure Chinese. They see their daughter as a profit to be made off of marriage, instead of letting her choose who she loves. And from what I can tell, I’m getting in the way of that. 

They’ve tried to force my gf to break up with me before but she always refused. Despite this, they would never acknowledge us dating, and would never refer to me by name. Rather calling me “skinny white boy”. Every month or so they go to my girlfriend asking if she would rather hook up with another Asian boy they found. 

My girlfriend says a lot of this might be resolved if we just talked. But from my experience, they barely speak English at all. That topped with their traditional mindset has always deterred me from wanting to go through with it. I don’t see what would be accomplished if we can barely even get past the language barrier. Plus the racism is also a hard wall to pass. 

My girlfriend says she’s fine with me not wanting to, I can tell she’s a bit upset over the whole situation though. I sort of feel like an ass for just saying no, but I just don’t see it turning out well. Might even turn out worse if I tried to break down these walls.

So, a couple days into the year, a girl comes up to me and explains that actually she had selected that spot when they were being assigned, but instead of handing her the pass that said 163 (the good spot) they gave her 193 in some kind of 6-9 mix up.

At that point, I wasn’t planning on switching unless they forced me to, and immediately when I got up there, the parking coordinator asked if I was ok with the arrangement. I said no, and she said alright, end of discussion. The spot is yours. That was this morning, and the only thing to do now is explain it to the girl in 193.

so a little ""backstory"". I live at home and I've filled the walls with shelves where I keep my collection of rare toys and knick-knacks, I'm very proud of my collection and rarely let others mess with it.

&#x200B;

So to the story, This Sunday we had a lot of family over, in particular, one of my cousins who had brought his kids along (8 & 10) who got bored pretty quickly sitting in the living room doing nothing, so my mom said I should let them in my room and play with my old toys, I agree and show the way to the room and pull out my old toybox and told them ""you're allowed to play with anything in the toy box, but please don't use any of the ones on the shelves"" after that I left them to themselves and joined the rest of the family again.

after a while, we heard a little ruckus upstairs and then the kids called for their dad (my cousin), so he and I went upstairs. When we came upstairs I saw that they had not only taken things off of my shelf but also tried to take stuff from the top shelf. I was already pretty mad at that point and asked them what they were doing, and they said that they wanted to make the lego man on the top shelf (a Bionicle that is still in its closed case) the dad then started taking it down and I grabbed it out of his hand and asked what he was doing, he said ""they're just toys, just let them play"" and I said ""no, there's a reason I keep them on this shelf, I don't want anyone to touch them"", then he said ""stop being such a baby, you're a grown man now, you can't be playing with baby toys"" and I got mad and said ""get the fuck out of my room now"".  

&#x200B;

then he got angry and took his kids downstairs, i stayed and fixed my shelves before going down. when I came downstairs everyone looked at me and asked what was wrong with me and why I wouldn't let the kids play, I simply said that there was nothing to discuss and just stayed quiet. after everyone went home, my mom said I should call my cousin later and apologize for being rude and I said I would do no such thing, then she just said she was disappointed in me and hasn't been willing to talk to me all day.

Although they didn't clarify the dialect, it's safe to assume she at least spoke some mandarin. My friend was about to volunteer me before I stopped him. Although I am white, I grew up in Shanghai and speak Mandarin as well as Shanghainese. I didn't feel like volunteering as I didn't want to get involved in whatever this girl's problems were.

But the problem is she gets nervous on trips, and every year is getting worse. First time her stomach was a little upset for a couple of days, which is normal.

Second time it was upset for half the time we were there

Third time it was pretty much everyday plus headches

The last time we went which was a few weeks ago, she got so sick, her throat was hurting, plus the upset stomach, migraines, it was a total disaster.

The thing is, she’s never sick at home, and every time we go to a different place, so it’s not the place, and it’s not a condition that she has.

When we got back home she already started talking about where she wants to go next year. I told her that I thought for next year we should just got visit our families, that we were spending too much money in these expensive trips and in the end we were not enjoying it

When we go visit family she’s fine, cause it’s a known place, not too far, so nothing happens to her

* Rachel was afraid to tell me. When brought back up she would say she couldn't ever do that to me.
* Jake convinced my family to hide it from me. My parents made sure I was distracted whenever Rachel dropped by.
* My parents bullied my younger siblings into hiding it from me.
* I asked Rachel to keep her distance while I processed this, to which she agreed to stay away, but she ignored it

I was mortified that she would lie to me like this *for months*. And that the two had included my whole family in the deception. And despite me being willing to move past it, she still couldn't respect my wishes and at least keep her distance while I sorted myself out internally. I was furious with her lying about this. I got emotional and went off at her over our messages, which made Jake confront me and that turned into a shouting match.

&#x200B;

My parents joined and took his side and said that I have no right to feel the way I do about their relationship. I tried to explain that it wasn't the relationship itself that made me so upset, it was what they all did to hide it from me. They refused to acknowledge that they did anything wrong and that they did the right thing so I wouldn't stop them (which I wouldn't of). I would of been okay had Rachel simply said ""I know it makes you uncomfortable, but I'm going to continue seeing Jake"" from the start.

&#x200B;

They insist that I'm only angry because of the relationship. I admit things got heated and I said my fair share of mean comments. It's been a couple of days since that argument and I've just shut myself in and cried. I told them that they broke my trust and that they owed me an apology for treating me this way. That I won't speak to them until they at least see this from my perspective. Jake and my parents have called me a bitch and an asshole for treating them ""so horribly"".

&#x200B;

AITA for blowing up at them?

EDIT: There are a few missing points that people have brought up that I need to clarify. I have said nothing to them about the relationship, just their actions. Rachel promised of her own accord, not because I asked her to. Both Rachel and Jake were spoken to. I have not reacted negatively to the relationship, only their actions towards me.

EDIT 2: I will include a comment where I describe how the initial asking took place.

>My intial response when finding out was calm and was done amongst a group of friends. I stated my feelings, Rachel promised not to do that despite me not asking for her word, and was over quickly. As mentioned before the only times it ever came up after were as jokes with our friends.

Someone who knew brought it up and asked how I felt, I said I would prefer if Rachel didn't continue as it made me uncomfortable, and Rachel said she wouldn't. She said they were only talking and nothing had really happened and promised it would stay that way. I brought this up with Jake later as he deserved to be on the same page (his decision too). I didn't go out of my way to enforce this, it just came out among friends and happened fast.",123,73,0.88
24,Not the A-hole,"Every summer towards the end of August or early September, my family will hold a big bonanza for Labor Day Weekend. Coincidentally a lot of our birthdays will line up at about that time, and we take our party fairly seriously. It is not uncommon for 40~ regulars plus a couple dozen guests/flaky individuals to join. We take turns hosting the party.

Up until last year, my older sister would bring her husband Jeff (pseudonym). Jeff is about the sweetest guy I've ever known and my sister was absolutely mad about him. Earlier this year, they were getting ready to adopt a child. They would have preferred to have their own biological child, but Jeff thought he was largely infertile after going through chemotherapy.

Right as they started looking into it, my sister got pregnant. They were elated because Jeff legitimately thought it was thousand-to-one odds that they would ever have children. Once my sister got to the three month stage, she told us all. 

About two months later, without explanation and without contact, Jeff left. He was not the kind of guy to leave a pregnant wife, and it was bizarre to everyone involved. I invited my sister to stay with me while he uprooted, and she agreed, but I didn't want to press the issue because it felt wrong to try and dig details out of her. It was obviously a hard time in her life.

Out of the blue one day, Jeff called me and apologized profusely. He said that he had found circumstantial evidence that she had cheated, and went to a urologist to see if he was able to have children. After busting into a cup and waiting for the results, Jeff went into the clinic only to be told by his doctor told him it was borderline impossible and thousand-to-one odds were generous. Jeff did some further detective work using social media and her friends and found that she had had an affair with a co-worker.

I was livid. He is the nicest guy I could have imagined my sister finding, and *she* was blaming *him* for apparently leaving his child behind. I could not believe she would lie to me like that. After demanding details she fessed up to the affair, but said that she was sure Jeff was the father. 

It just so happens that this year I will be the one to hold the family party, and I have invited everyone but my sister. I informed her that she is not welcome in my house right now. She is crying to me about it and saying what happened between Jeff and her was not about the family, but I can't bring myself to invite her. Worse yet, I can't tell anyone about this because Jeff only confided in me and my boyfriend about this, and the rest of the family doesn't know. They still think Jeff is just a horrible person. I'm in no circumstances going to tell them because it would punish him just as much as her, but I'm at my wit's end and I'm afraid that I'm the asshole here.",251,777,0.97

26,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for bad english, not a native speaker. 

Happened yesterday in the evening. We live in a pretty quiet street - which means, when something happens, everyone will notice!  


An elderly couple was double-parking their car on the street to unload their groceries, when suddenly one of a very few parking lots was about to be available. So the woman went to parking lot to block it for her husband and the husband was about to turn the car around on the street. Right then another car was coming by and wanted to use the free parking lot where the woman was standing, blocking it for her husband.   


There is the problem: The new car was very close to the parking lot, but couldn't park because of the woman standing right at the spot. The husband couldn't park also because the new car blocked his way into the parking lot. They began to argue which took about an hour. They also tried to call the police, but in germany they won't come by for every single parking lot issue, because they mostly have other things to do in bigger cities.   


Most of the neighbors already watched out of their windows and began to make fun of them. Two grown-ups, not being able to find a proper solution.   


So I decided to end it up. My motorcycle usually stands directly at our houses' wall, it's not disturbing anyone there. No need to block a parking lot for cars. TILL THEN!  
I took my motorcycle and drove through a small gap between the peoples cars, and parked my bike right on the spot.   


The driver of the new car was laughing and clapped in his hands, just like most of the neighbors. He startet the engine of his car and searched for a new spot. But some of the neighbors and also the elderly couple seemed to be upset about that.   


What do you think? Am I the asshole for ending this argue?",52,198,0.93
27,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I are both in our early 30's without any kids.


We love having friends over for dinner and an evening of board games.

We've tried having these friends of ours over with their kid (6).  
We thought it would be simple - set him up in a room with a playstation and a big TV and we'll carry on as usual...


Not a chance - this kids has severe ADHD and needs constant supervision and validation.  

He has to sit with us so that he can watch / listen to youtube, play with his toys, play on a laptop ect.

His mom even lets him play some games with us - letting him make decisions (which obviously messes with her game) until he gets bored 5 mins later.

The kid doesn't listen to his parents, eats / messes on the furniture - dirty feet everywhere ect.

We've hinted that they should get a baby sitter and have the night off, but they would arrive the next time and just say, eh, he didn't want to go to the baby sitter.

So for a couple of months we've ended up not inviting them over.
But we would like to hang out with them again.
Would I be the asshole if I insist they can only come over if they don't bring their kid?

Update:
Thanks for the replies guys!
I've sent a invite to them and have mentioned that we've gotten a new game which we would love to play with them - but as it's very complicated (All true), would they mind getting a baby sitter?
They've replied that they would join us and would arrange a baby sitter.",227,1380,0.97
28,Everyone Sucks,"A friend and I moved in to a unit together and signed a lease together. Six months later, I had to move again due to personal issues. I sat her down and we had an in-depth and lengthy discussion of all of our options in regards to me moving out. She gave me the go-ahead and decided she would also look for a new place to stay so we could just break the lease. 

Two weeks or so later, I asked how her house hunt was going, and she says she's changed her mind.

She rejected every single person I put forward who was interested in taking over my lease. She says she'll also help me look for someone so I won't have to keep paying rent.

Two months go by, and I message her explaining that I'm not able to be picky with who I choose to takeover for me anymore, it's costing me more money than I can afford paying rent in 2 places. I give her ample of options, including staying in the spare room of the place I'm actually living in, or helping her house hunt. She denies it all, but she understands and will start paying even $10-$15 more to even out the cost. Spoiler alert: she doesn't ever do that.

Another two months go by. I message her saying that I need to stop paying rent as it's not viable for me to essentially keep paying rent for her, or she needs to find somewhere else so we can break the lease. I've already paid upwards of $4000 for her to live comfortably by herself for four months, and I'd like something back. (Also, she is using all of my furniture, appliances, and homeware. She owns nothing but her bed frame. And I've let her just use all of it.) 

She responds with a bunch of excuses and basically asks me to keep paying rent. Never thanks me for doing this for her, just denies that she ever agreed on doing any of the above, or never wanted to. I tell her that her lack of communication in all of this has caused me a lot of frustration, and put me out of pocket $4000, and I'm not asking for anything more than even just a peace offering, or a token of appreciation. If she didn't want any of this to happen, she should have told me from the get-go so I could figure something else out, rather than agree to a bunch of things she knew she wasn't going to oblige to, and make it a hassle for me later on.

She comes back with her ""legal obligation"" is to the landlord and not me, which I never mentioned jackshit about. I know all of the legalities, which is why I kept paying rent up until this point. So because of that, she has to ""deny my request for some reimbursement"". And is basically threatening me with legal action if I keep asking her for something in return.

Basically, I know I signed a lease with her, so she has the ""contractual"" agreement that I'm still on the lease, which is why I'm still paying rent. 


She mislead me with her lack of communication, and it has cost me a lot of money. All of our mutual friends are on her side, and some have even blocked me. Which is why I'm wondering, AITA?",48,83,0.95

30,Not the A-hole,"On Saturday night my friend and her boyfriend had a joint birthday party. I didn't know they hired dancers until the lights were dimmed and the people were literally walking inside. It's not really my thing these days but I thought it would be rude to leave, so I took a seat and watched as a male and female dancer gave them each a lap dance as they sat back to back. It got pretty rowdy, lots of whistles, yelling, etc. Eventually the dancers began working the room, dancing with other people, going back to my friend and her BF, etc.

  
Out of nowhere the woman dancer came to me, took my hand, pulled me to my friend and basically began involving me in a lap dance. That caught a lot of people's attention and there was a big response (phones out, yelling things, you get the idea). I went along with it for a bit but stuck to light grinding, similar to how I'd dance at a club/party. Then my friend stood up and they pushed me down onto the chair, the dancer put her hands on my knees and forced them apart, which got a bunch of people all riled up again. I shook my head and said, ""no, no, no..."" but I was also laughing which might have sent a mixed message. When the guy joined in I felt things really crossed the line. He put his leg up, foot on the arm of the chair, and was thrusting his groin extremely close to my face. His genitals were covered but very little was left to the imagination (and it was clear he was enjoying himself if you catch my drift). During his ""dance"" the woman was behind me, running her hands over my shoulders, down my chest and grazing my side-boob. Thankfully a sober friend pulled/danced me away and I left the house immediately.

  
Apparently the party died shortly after, they tried dancing with other people and everyone outright refused. The dancers also asked my friend's friend (the person who hired them) to tip them on my behalf (???). The woman dancer also offered a few people cocaine. I heard about this from a friend who checked in on me after she left the party that night.

  
On Sunday I received texts from my friend's friend and a mutual friend both essentially accusing me of being rude and ruining the 'spirit' of the party. My friend's friend even asked why I came if I don't like parties. I was at a loss for words. I've been to lots of parties. I worked in the hospitality/nightlife industry for three years. I've been to strip clubs and bachelor/bachelorette parties with actual strippers; never in my life have I experienced anything like what I did there. Professional entertainers don't behave that way in my experience. I'm not close with my friend's friend (she's an acquaintance at best) but my other friend is a reasonable person, she's a teacher and fairly 'normal' all around. I've always thought highly of her and respected her opinions. Now I'm wondering if what I did was actually asshole behavior?",41,153,0.94

Second time was when it was the last day for my therapist (she left the center I went too). I brought a change of cloths with me however.

34,Asshole,"Recently I was on this interstate that combines two interstates into one, then quickly turns into one lane. I got into the lane that doesn’t run out, and proceeded to watch people zoom down the lane that ends and then jump over. This process continued for about 20 minutes, until I was nearing the fateful spot. As I was moving along, a truck came up and tried to slide in front of me. I didn’t allow any space, so he just rode alongside me, forcing me to ride half in my lane, as he didn’t want to drive in the grass. Now we’re both driving, while side by side sharing a tiny interstate lane. Meanwhile, I’m laying on the horn trying to let this guy know that he will not be getting in front of me. After he eventually slowed down and got behind me, my girlfriend told me that I was such an asshole and that I should have just let the guy go ahead. Any opinions would be appreciated.

EDIT: I’ve recently researched the zipper merge, but fail to see how that applies. My lane of traffic is sitting at a snails crawl, while the ending lane is just zooming on by. From what I see online the zipper method is more for 2 lanes that move at the same speed.

EDIT 2: Sorry for the edits just feel a need to clarify. The merging lane was on my side, I could see everything clearly, and we were probably going a speed of 5-7mph. Also, my little brother just completed drivers ed and said that this “Zipper Merge” wasn’t mentioned at all in the course.

39,No A-holes here,"On mobile so bear with me, please.

I (27F) am getting married next week and my bachelorette party is this weekend. This story involves two bridesmaids, we’ll call them Ashley (27F) and Kate (27F). We’ve been friends for going on 8yrs (Kate and I have been friends for 12+yrs now). 

Some backstory: Ashley got engaged last June after knowing her fiancé for 6mos. Kate and I don’t know the guy super well but they seem happy so we’re happy for her - wedding is set for this Nov. Since Ashley and fiancé have been dating, Ashley has started to pull away from us. She is super flakey, cancels plans, rarely talks to us unless she needs something, despite the amount of effort Kate and I put in. A few weeks ago Ashley tells Kate and I she’s pregnant (via text). We’re surprised but happy for her. Ashley is now very hesitant to come to my bachelorette party - traditional bar crawl - and talks to Kate about this in addition to some offhand comments in the bridesmaids group text. Kate sends me screenshots, Ashley asks Kate if it’s “required to go to”. Kate informs me, and she’s upset on my behalf. We talk and I change the plans of the bachelorette party to a murder mystery dinner then drinks so Ashley might feel more comfortable with an event not completely centered around drinking. Ashley now says she’ll only go if my cousin goes and she will be leaving early - cousin is a week farther along in her own pregnancy than Ashley. Cousin is going and does not care if it would be a bar crawl. Ashley says “fine, I won’t bitch, I’ll go”. At this point, I’m kind of feeling a bit hurt, but it’s settled, everyone’s going. 

Today, Ashley informs Kate and I (via text) that she and fiancé have actually been married for almost a year now. Ashley’s reasoning was for insurance purposes and that they were just keeping it between them but due to the pregnancy they are now telling people. I don’t care why, I’m just really hurt she didn’t tell us. I couldn’t even imagine keeping something like that from the two of them, let alone for this long. Kate and I seem to feel the same way, and text back with congrats but are a bit surprised we weren’t told. Ashley responds saying she “isn’t feeling the love” from us. I’m shocked, I need a bit of time to process but I am happy for her. This just feels like a betrayal as she’s basically lied to us for the last year. We’ve been planning her and my wedding - there’s been plenty of conversations to slip that info into. 

So here lies my potential asshole-ish action. I don’t know that in a few days I’ll be ready to “party” with her as one of my best friends and celebrate a milestone in my life without still feeling betrayed and hurt. Plus, she’s made it clear she doesn’t really want to come anyways. WIBTA if I told her she didn’t have to come to the bachelorette party? I’ll phrase it like that, give her a choice but I’m honestly not stoked on having her there.

Am I overreacting or is this justified?

41,Not the A-hole,"I work at a luxury retail food chain in a mall and we make candies on site. I’ve only been working here for two months (I started in early June) but I have noticed various health-related problems in food prep, including an incident where food that had been sitting in the garbage covered in flies was fished out of the trash and served to customers.

Me and my brother both got sick eating candies from the store, and there are regular sales competitions to sell expired goods to customers to avoid loss of money and lie to customers about why the candies are discounted. The candy-making tools are never cleaned and ingredients are never changed or checked. There are rotting goods hidden throughout the store and our manager will not train us or give us access to the HR department (I have not asked him for this information because he is also somewhat abusive and unapproachable and makes me uncomfortable to talk to; I had to track this information down myself).

Considering many children and elderly people eat at this store and trust that they’re getting safe food (which I expect even from fast food, but we are considered a luxury brand) I felt it necessary to figure out how to contact HR, but when I did, I found out my complaint wasn’t even being filed through my company and could take up to a week to even be processed.

I never bothered to talk to my manager directly since he is the main perpetrator of the problem and tends to talk about people behind their back and accuse them of things they didn’t do. He makes me uncomfortable.

So I called the local health inspector because I felt that if I didn’t, a lot of people could get sick.

However, when my mom found out I did this, she yelled at me and told me I was going to be responsible for multiple people losing their jobs, which I guess I kinda realized that could happen, but I didn’t think of it as worse than people becoming ill. I will potentially also lose my job for this if the store closes or the manager takes retaliatory actions against me.

Even considering a list of other issues working here, I don’t want to seem like a complainer. I’m grateful to have work, but this really bothered me. I would never actually wish financial hardship on another person, no matter how they’ve treated me.

42,Asshole,"Me and my husband and daughter have been arguing earlier, and even though I don't think I am in the wrong it's still 1 vs 2. I find this really stupid but please bear with me. 


So my 11 year old daughter came to us and announced that she wants to be a transgender male and asks for our support. She said she had done research and thinks that she fits the description. She has always been tomboyish, disliking girl toys and clothings and more comfortable playing with boys than girls. She wants to get a male name, being called ""he"" instead of ""she"" and said that the earlier she start transition, the better the result. 


While initially shocked, my husband quickly came to and told her that he would support her decision, and said that he had always think of her as a son(he was closer to her than me, even though I spent more time with her). He then told me that we should set aside some money for her therapists, doctors and medicine etc cost. I however, think that my husband is overreacting and my daughter is NOT becoming a son anytime soon.


The reason is very simple, she is a  f* 11 year old who hasn't even experienced her first period, and lack the mental maturity to decide for herself. I know, because I spent the last 11 summers with her, and I sense bullshit when I see one. It's just one of the things she does in the spur of a moment and forget about it in a month or so. My husband, while not wrong to be supportive, doesn't understand her as well as I do and he himself can be a child at times. Let's just say that while I am a mother figure, he is more like a brother and friend than a father figure.


I do love my daughter, but I am not having her nonsense of making us spend lots of money on her only to change her mind half way(mind you she has done that before). My husband is the other problem. He insisted that I should be more open minded about this, and that's not even the point. I told the 2 of them that she can decide when she is older, but right now nothing is going to happen and she'd better be not be making a fuss over it.


My daughter is still sulking over it and my husband is asking me stop being such a know-it-all. AITA?


Edit: I think I need to clarify a few things.

1. I am not saying I am against it, just that she needs to decide that when she is older and THEN I will take it more seriously. 

2. My husband is known to be the ""fun"" one to spoil her and I enforce discipline and punishments. We kind of balance it out in a way while raising her. I love my husband too and in no way trying to insult him.

3. Like I mentioned this is not the first time she pulls some weird shit out of the blue and try to make us support her, like how she ditch piano lessons after buying her one, skip Japanese lessons after a month and the list goes on.

4. As far as I see, she does not look the least bit scared or confused when she asked to become male, she looked like it was some kind of interesting  game going on and threw a tantrum and sulk when I dismiss it off. Another reason I smell bullshit on this one, but I shall give it a small benefit of doubt.


Update: I just showed this post to my daughter and she was laughing together with her dad. She said serves me right getting ""YTAs"" but she was nowhere as upset as most comments assumed, in fact just as I expected she got distracted after a few hours and a meal and now she doesn't want to be a boy anymore. My husband said he could still call her son though if she ever change her mind. Like I stated at the beginning I find this really stupid, but seems like all is well.


Update 2: Since this post has been locked we feel that it is safe to update it again. Thank you all for your opinions, it actually help us get to know each other a little more as we talked it over. Also, it's been rather entertaining to watch drama unfold here, with the 3 of us refreshing the site every other minute to see new comments.

45,No A-holes here,"I have been in my 14-year-old step-daughter’s life for 6 years now. She lives with us most of the time, goes to her mother’s for two weekends out of the month. We are very close and I am glad she feels she can go to me about stuff. A couple of years ago, she came to me and said she had started her period. I got her situated and gave her the stuff she needed. She asked me to text her mom about it, but asked that I not tell her dad. I asked why and she said it was just weird, she didn’t feel like he needed to know what was going on with “girl stuff”. Honestly, it didn’t seem like a big deal. It wasn’t life or death, and I was telling one of her biological parents. I figured that her mom might tell him anyway. Anecdotally, my mom told my dad even after I asked her not to and I hated that, so admittedly, that did add to my reasoning.

Fast forward to now. My husband found out when he went to borrow something from my step-daughter’s bathroom and found a box of pads. He wasn’t upset with her, but asked if I knew. I said, yeah and explained the situation. He said I should’ve told him. I said I didn’t think it was a big deal and said that her mom knew, which to me covered all the bases for this part of her life. I added at the time, those were all the people she wanted to know. He’s not angry with me like I said, but he just thinks it’s something that a father should be informed about. Now I feel guilty.

AITA for not telling him?",1346,4101,0.95
46,Not the A-hole,"I probably sound like a dick to begin with, I didn't really know how else to phrase the title. 


Back story: in highschool there was a girl who was very 2 faced. I thought we were friends and she was really telling everyone I was going to assault girls in the locker room because I was 15 and being open about being attracted to girls too. She told everyone I was a lesbian and I tried to come onto her (she is not my type, she's pretty but no) she tried to isolate me because of my sexuality and she did an okay job of it. 






Fast forward, we're both 22. She has moved hours away from our hometown and I don't hear much about her anymore. However, this last June, someone mentioned ""oh, MeanGirl is going to Pride"" and I was kind of taken aback, why would she go somewhere like that? She spent a lot of time talking about how men and women are the only way to do things and that the ""parts don't fit together"" in gay relationships, that they're so unbalanced etc.  





I did some sleuthing and found her Instagram, she had a picture of her and her boyfriend at Pride, with a caption along the lines of ""celebrating 3.5 years with the best guy"" and then a bunch of hashtags about acceptance. I googled the boyfriend, and he has a very prominent blog about his transition from female to male. I was kind of shocked, she mocked me so relentlessly, but suddenly trans men are real men to her? She went on tirades about people ""masquerading"" as other genders to assault people or get things, and now she's just done a total flip and has been with a trans guy for years? 





I felt all this rage come up from the mockery and loneliness and depression I endured at her hands, so I commented on the photo something like ""wow, crazy how things change. You used to bully me relentlessly for being LGBT, but I guess it's different now that it's trendy."" I'm willing to admit it was a mean thing to say, but I was so mad. 




She deleted the post and messaged me to say I was ""living in the past"" and needed to ""get over it and move on"" and that I was a huge asshole for doing it on her public fitness page with over 12,000 followers. I'm willing to apologize for the method of confrontation if she's willing to apologize for how she treated me and admits she was cruel, but she is adamant she did nothing wrong and is ""waiting on an apology"" because apparently her boyfriend is talking about moving out and saying he ""doesn't really know her"" because she lied about her teenage lgbt activism. 


I'm prepared for my verdict. Aita?




Update: by ""apologize"" she wants me to publically announce that I made up her bullying. I asked what my reason would be for making it up and she said I must be jealous of her social media presence. In minor digging I've found that she met the guy at a Halloween party and he was in partial drag. She complimented him on his eyeliner to flirt like ""who taught you that"" and he responded that it was a skill from when he used to be a girl, and she launched into a lie about how she's always done activism for lgbt youth and they started dating a few months later, with many of their first dates being protests and lgbt petition stuff. I don't think I'll be publicly announcing I made up her bullying because of jealousy. I'd be willing to apologize to her, but she wants me to tell all her followers I made it up for attention and I'm not here for it.",99,269,0.95
47,Not the A-hole,"My gf has been notoriously bad with phone accessories.  For the longest time she has had only one phone charger, in her bedroom, for charging at night.  I had at one point 5 cables and adaptors.  one for my bedroom for charging at night, one for my computer, one for work travel, one in my car, and one spare.  I decided a while back to leave my spare at her place so I could charge at night when I stay over - she took this as ""her"" spare and took hers to work and now uses mine at night, even when I'm there.  Last weekend we went camping and she borrowed my car cable to charge her phone using her cousins power supply at the fire and forgot to get the cable back, so now I'm down 2.  So I moved my travel one in to my car so now I've got just the 3 I use regularly.

I'm not even a photographer, but it's an interest of mine and I know even a basic photographer could take better photos. I'm not trying to be snobby, but they were all blurry, underexposed, etc. Not really the kind of keepsake you frame, you know what I mean?

I guess my wife took this as a nod to volunteer me to go visit them and take photos. I should mention I'm the only one in our circle of friends who has a great camera setup. In fact, I think I might be the only one with a non-phone camera to begin with. I only found out I was volunteered after my wife's friend thanked me on Facebook for offering. I didn't offer it, so I put two and two together.

We went to go visit her but I refused to bring my camera. This is where I might've been an asshole. It would have taken nothing to just bring it along, take a few snaps, and that's it. But I didn't, I didn't like being sucked into this situation. Everyone was upset at me, especially my wife's friend and her boyfriend.

The thing about volunteering me to take photos is it would then be expected of me to take great photos, edit them, and send them off. This is hours of work, even if I only shoot for 10 minutes. And if they don't turn out well? I look like an idiot in front of my wife for saying their photos looked bad, and I'd be chewed out for ""not doing my job properly"".

50,Not the A-hole,"I'm a manager for a corporate defense contractor, office work. My employee J(father) just had a kid. When his child was born he stopped coming into work for over a week. Radio silence. I knew he was dealing with his stuff, and although inconvenient for our work, I understand the need to take time off after just having a kid so I left him alone. What I'm upset about is I had no idea if he even had the kid yet or how long he was planning on taking off. I found out because he texted a coworker with pictures of the kid. All I needed was a text saying ""baby's here/coming"" or whatever. I had no idea when or even if he was coming back to work. I found out later from one of my other employees that he was planning on coming back in the Monday a week and a half afterwards. Again, not a big deal but J isn't informing me.

Our company provides paternity leave, but it isn't like a bulk 4 weeks. You basically get four weeks of PTO that you can use in four hour blocks over a 12 month period. This allows you to do half days or do partial weeks ( work 3 days a week, etc). However, the guy doesn't keep me inform when hes planning on coming in. We do sensitive work for the military. It doesn't look good when I get asked by my fellow employees or my government client "" will J be in today?"" and I have say hell if I know. I understand that its impossible for the guy to plan when he is coming in, his schedule revolves around his new baby. I just need to be inform so that I can plan accordingly. All I expect is a text or phone call the days hes going to be in late or not at all, just like I require from all of my employees. Our schedules are fairly flexible for what we do, the only requirement is that I am informed.

The main reason I am considering writing him up is mainly because he was the lead author of a huge paper. This thing is like a thesis, we spent over a year doing research. He was given 2 months to write, normally we only have a month. At the end of month 2, he still did not have a draft for me to review. We got a month extension, only problem was that now that was very close to his wife's delivery date. Not great but maybe it will get him on track to finish the paper. HE NEVER FINISHED. He got about 85% there and  then he disappears for almost two weeks. Plus that 85% needed a lot of rewrites. So I'm upset that I have no accountability for the guy. I'm furious that I have no accountability for the guy in the middle of the biggest product of the year and I had to do 36 hours of overtime to do his job for him. We seriously only do 2 of these a year its pretty much all we do, and this one was a double. Its like the lead developer on a huge video game just stopped coming into work with out a phone call.

52,Not the A-hole,"When I was 10 I went on a trip with my nana for a week and a half. When I came back my mom (out so I thought) had painted my room bubble gum pink with hot pink trim and my sister's (age 5) room peach with dark peach trim. I hated my room. I was never a girly girl and I've always haired the color pink. Tbh this paint job probably was a huge reason for me going goth a few years later. My mom claimed she did because she ""knew"" I'd love or when I was a teenager and I needed to grow up. There was a huge fight and I had to live with that hell room until my parents renovated the house when I was 16. From the way my mom always talked about the room it was my punishment for not being a girly girl and not choosing what she wanted. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago I (now 38)was talking to my mom when that paint job came up. I kinda laughed out off and said something about how her plans didn't turn out the way she'd hoped.

She ended up telling me that it was actually my step dad who painted the room. She had gone out for the weekend while I was away and he thought he was doing something nice and painted our rooms to surprise her. She had never had any imput in the colours or that the rooms were being painted at all. She knew we would both hate the paint job but made us pretend to love them (clearly didn't work with me) because he did something nice and she would not have been able to afford to paint the rooms on her own. When we hated them, she just took the blame and made up excuses. 

I was floored learning this. When the painting had happened my mom and stepdad would have only have been dating for a few months and wouldn't start living together for another 3 years. I told my mom that if a partner I had ever did that it would be a huge red flag flag if not a complete deal breaker for me. I would be so pissed off if a person I had only known for less than a year decided he could take that much control over my house and my daughters lives. She got very quite and told me I really hurt her and she had to go. She sent me a text today saying how hurt she is that I would say something like that and that my stepdad had always been good to me. 

It got me thinking about all the times my stepdad had done things that we just had to take because he's ""the man of the house"", even if he didn't ask for input from anyone. And how it had now bleed into my adult life. My stepdad is a great guy and we did have advantages in our lives that we probably would not have of he hadn't been in it. But that over step would have been too much for me in the first few months of dating. 

Am I the asshole for telling my mom that would have been a red flag/ deal breaker for me?

**Edit** people seem to think that the colour is the deal breaker. It's not, as it said in the post my mom framed it that she had picked out the colour to punish me for not being girly. That's why we were taking about it - my son is now 11 and I am thinking about painting his room.

To me the red flag is that if someone I had only been dating for less that a year and only met my kids a handful of times came into my house while I was away and changed something about it without me knowing and without my input I would not be happy about it even if I was perfect.  That's what I had said to my mom.

**edit 2** this post has actually brought up a lot of stuff I am going to have to work through. I am starting to realize how much my mom covered for my step dad. When I said he was a great guy in my post it's because I've pretty much been trained to never say anything bad about him. My childhood was not the perfect life some people have assumed. It was pretty messed up and I have just gained another piece as to why.",461,1490,0.93

I am a manger at a summer camp, and I recently fired a camp counsellor (F15) for repedetedly breaking the dress code. At our camp, female counsellors are required to wear a camp T-Shirt, and khaki shorts / pants, as long as they are longer than mid-thigh. This counsellor has repeatedly worn short-shorts, and has also repeatedly tied her shirts up w/ a rubber band to show a part of her midriff / lower back. I have spoken w/ her a few times and even given formal warnings but she hasn't changed her ways, just started hiding it (wearing a longer skirt on top and removing the rubber band when I was around). Other counsellors decided to start doing so as well as they found out that she was violating dress code repeatedly w/ no apparent consequences. I hesitated to fire her originally  because she was otherwise very competent and well liked but I cannot allow special exceptions for certain people so I let her go. Some parents were not happy with the way she dressed, but liked her as a counsellor and stated that I shouldn't have fired her. Some board members also felt the same way, saying that I should have turned a blind eye to her as she was one of their best like counsellors

54,Everyone Sucks,"Posting this on throwaway because no way am I doing this on main.

So I (28) have been with my girlfriend (26) for a little over 7 months.  4 months into the relationship, my birthday happened and she did nothing.  Literally nothing.  Didn't acknowledge it, didn't say anything.  I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.  I figured maybe she got the day wrong, or maybe she tried to set something up and it didn't happen right.  But time passed and still nothing.  She had either forgotten completely or she hadn't known at all.  It felt like she didn't care enough to remember or look it up.  

I admit I was hurt.  I got petty.  Her birthday was this past Friday.  She messaged me all day asking ""do you have any plans"" in a way that was obviously trying to feel out what I had done for her birthday.  I told her my plans were to go grocery shopping after work, then go home.  Around nine she calls me up and she's furious.  She asks if I know what day it is.  I say it's her birthday.  She demands to know why I haven't done anything to celebrate.  I tell her it's because she did nothing for my birthday.

I understand I'm at least a little of an asshole for this.  You can say maybe she forgot while I made the choice to do nothing.  Fair enough.  But then we started arguing and she genuinely said this:  ""Guys don't care about birthdays the same way girls do.""

55,No A-holes here,Okay so a bit of back story i’m a 23M and my 18 year old sister is now staying with me. About a year ago she got pregnant. Now for personal and religious reasons i’m against abortion after 20 weeks unless for certain circumstances however she had an abortion at 10 weeks. She got pregnant and I told her if she wanted to live with me she would have to have an abortion. This is because she was really irresponsible and I knew that I would be the one who would have to take care of the kid and the guy she was seeing ik for a fact would have bailed first chance. Anyway after that we had a discussion about contraceptives and she has an iud now. For some reason she thought she was infertile after a mistake with a broken condom didn’t lead to a pregnancy. I had to explain to her that humans are actually not that fertile and one act of cumming inside is rare to get pregnant but it can happen. However she now blames me and says I forced her into an abortion. How did I force I just said if she wanted to stay with me rent free she would have to get an abortion I never put a gun to her head. She is also now on a volleyball scholarship at a d1 school. Something she would not have been able to do with a baby. Am I The Asshole?,183,230,0.91
56,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I are having a minor disagreement about what happened today at the grocery store. We were buying some grapes when she reached in, plucked one off the stem, and ate it. 

I was a bit shocked as this seemed completely unsanitary and not only that but it takes away from the overall weight of the bunch which you are paying for. Mind you we had the full intention of buying them, but still it seems wrong to me.

She says the bag is open so that people can try them and she has to test the grapes to make sure they're not too bitter to eat, but my rebuttal is that you don't do the same to an apple or orange (I know, comparing apples and oranges), and instead you trust that the fruit you're buying is of acceptable quality through visual examination and when necessary (peaches, avocados, etc.) through feel.

She even called her mom because that's where she learned it from, and her mom said the same thing and that grapes are expensive so she wants to test them before buying.

I've never experienced buying grapes that are too bitter to eat, so to me it doesn't seem like a common enough problem to justify sampling the fruit.

So AITA for calling out my girlfriend here and making her feel like she was in the wrong? Is this something you do?

57,Asshole," I have a daughter who I love dearly that is 29, she recently came to me and her mother and told us that she was 4 months pregnant. She said she didn’t know who the father was and that she had multiple people who thinks might be the father. From what I could gather, she doesn’t like taking birth control, and instead trust her partners to use protection. She works in one of my companies for which she gets paid competitively for what, I admit, is minimal work. When we talked to her we told her that we would of course support her in whatever she did, and while talking options we made clear to her that if she kept the baby we would support her financially and ensure that she would be able to spend as much time as possible with the child, especially since she might have been a single mother. She mentioned that she was considering getting and abortion, I told her that if she wanted to get an abortion she would have to pay for it herself, the implication being that I would financially support every option but that. She knows that I am personally not supportive of the practice, so I didn't need to make that clear to her again when she is obviously under a lot of stress. In the end I made sure that she understood that whatever she did, it would never affect the amount of love we have for her. I left my wife and my daughter to talk in private, after I talked to my wife and my only question was if it was consensual sex. My wife said she thinks it was, and she did ask. My wife and my daughter are close, she would have told my wife if it wasn't

A couple days after that she called me at an odd hour and when I asked about how she was feeling she told me she wasn’t pregnant anymore. I asked if she had a miscarriage, she said no, I asked if she wanted to talk about it, she said no. I told her to take as much time as she needs off of work, and that I would handle everything with her job

Onto the inheritance, I have told my kids that when I die all of my fortune will go to charity, I actually have set about 35 percent of my inheritance to them and their potential families. I didn’t tell them so they could keep motivation instead of waiting on my inheritance. My daughter was set to receive an inheritance but I'm considering taking her out since she got an abortion. My thought process being that since she did something that I don’t agree with morally, I don’t want to reward her with an inheritance from me. I would do the same for any of my kids if they did something similar

I also have a son and another daughter in high school. Both my son and my daughter work for my companies, and if they are responsible with their money they can be financially independent and retired long before I die.The inheritance goes from 3 million for each of them to about 4.5 million for my son and younger daughter

I apologize for the lengthy post

Edit: I read all the comments and I'd like to clarify a couple things. I am not religious, my daughter still has my emotional and financial support in addition to her job, and by the time I die all my children will be worth much more than what I give them (my children working for me are making well into 6 figures before bonuses, benifits, and stock options).

59,Not the A-hole,"So I'm feeling a bit scummy after I moved back home to live with my parents all of a sudden. Long story short my roommate and I have been sharing an apartment in downtown Toronto for the past year or so. I sublease from him and I didn't sign and official lease. He's considerably older than me (mid to late 30s, to my early to mid 20s). For the first six months he was great. He was very quiet, kept to himself, and was out the vast majority of the time. I, as a grad student, was in my own room for most of the time and totally quiet with my headphones in. I had my girlfriend over from time to time but that's about it and we were very quiet. 

&#x200B;

About 5 months ago he brings home this girl that does not speak a lick of English. Given that we are in Toronto this is not exactly a surprising thing, but he refused to tell me anything about her and who she was and that I suddenly had a second roommate. My portion of the rent did not change. I was very suspicious of her as I would find her frequently darting out of my room when I came home early. I have very sensitive clinical information and extremely expensive hardware for medical information there (relax my thesis supervisor gave me approval to bring info home as long as it was encrypted). He suddenly became unbearable to live with. He and this girl (who I assume is his girlfriend given the extraordinary amount of noise they make at night) started staying up well past 2AM even on weeknights and around 5AM on weekends. We had more or less agreed that quiet hours were around 11PM or so on weeknights and 1AM or so on weekends. This wasn't a firm limit but it was agreed that we should all stfu after that time. My girlfriend stopped coming over because of the noise. I couldn't use the kitchen anymore because he was constantly using it to make these ENORMOUS multi-course meals every night so I either went hungry or ate out. I talked to him about this repeatedly without any noticeable change. I could only get about 3-4 hours of sleep a night and I started to look and feel like garbage. Even earplugs wouldn't help. After months of losing sleep and BEGGING him to quiet down at night, I had had enough. He refused to listen to me after 60+ times of telling him to please stop and respect my need for sleep.

My furniture is still there and will be there until the end of the month as I paid for August.

I honestly don't want to even speak to him or go back to that place unless to pick up my stuff.

They are also each other's first ever  relationship.

This past Saturday  her boyfriend's cousin told them that his mom was openly talking in  front of employees/family members that she thought my daughter wasn't  pretty enough for her son and he should date a Vietnamese girl who would  traditionally take care of him.

63,Asshole,"I'm a manager for a mid-sized tech company and there was this one candidate we interviewed who had a gap (about a year) in her employment history. When questioned about it, she said she was doing 'odd-jobs' to make ends meet while she transitioned from her old, stable job. Fair enough, not everyone can find a permanent position and we all gotta eat. She seemed likeable enough during the interview and there wasn't anything that stood out that was screaming red flags at me, so we put her down as a potential hire along with 3 other people. I ask if we can contact those 'odd-job' places, as part of my due diligence, but she declines to provide references from them, saying they were one-time jobs as commissioned work.

I contact her previous employer from the references she did give (Company A), and they seem to like her, noting down they were sorry to see her go to 'Company B'. I'm pretty sure that was an over-share on her previous manager's part, but I make a note of it because I have a friend who works in 'Company B'.

I contact my friend and he does a verbal double-take and asks if it's so-and-so. I provide a brief physical description and the revelation seemed to blow his mind. He goes on a long-winded rant about how she turned her department upside-down with a legal case regarding allegations of sexual harassment to her former employer. It appears she quit her job (apparently without notice), then came back with a harassment claim that got kicked to their legal team and is currently in arbitration. Her department at Company B is in disarray as people try to cover her sudden departure and the subsequent scandal is tanking office morale. She was also working there for 8-months straight so it appeared she outright lied on her job interview to my face.

I take this information to HR and they say this is not a hiring criteria nor is it a disqualifying one. They strongly suggested I never bring this up again. Then they hinted that I hire the best candidate based on what value they bring to the company and that minimizing liability is part of that value. I took the hint and left.

Even though I personally see it as unfair, if it was a man accusing his previous employers of sexual harassment, or launching a law suit against them for any other reason, I would still view them as a liability. Given how my friend described the poor state of things from her previous job, I see no reason to hire this woman as opposed to the other 3 potential candidates.

65,Not the A-hole,"Just over 3 weeks ago I was at a lookout (popular dumping ground for animals apparently) and found a cat crying in the bush it was super skinny and had rough fur and missing a tail. So I decided I would take it home with me and to the vet the next day to get it checked out to see if it was chipped or reported missing or something like that. The vet said the cat was never microchipped and wasn't in great shape it's back legs were all messed up and couldn't tell if the tail was a deformed tail or if someone had cut it off. At this point I assumed the cat was just a stray. He also told me the cat was about 3 - 4 weeks pregnant and there might be complications with the birth because of her messed up legs. I decided I would get it desexed because I couldn't afford to pay for an emergency birth if she was still in my care when that happened.
I went home and posted pictures of the cat on a missing pets Facebook page for my area.

Fast forward 2 weeks nobody had messaged me about it or anything like that so again I assumed it was just a stray cat nobody owned. So I decided I would give it to a friend of mine who was looking for a pet. She came and collected the cat and took her home.

Well yesterday I get a message from someone claiming that the cat was hers and she would like her back. At this point my friend and I had spent a couple hundred dollars on the cat for things like the general checkup and the desexing and just things like food and a bed so I ask for proof that the cat was hers. She described the cat and sent some photos so I'm pretty sure the cat was her cat. She said she had the cat for 4 years and that someone had cut it's tail off in a door and had somehow been shot and in the photos she has her cats just eating out of a pile of dry food in the corner of the room on concrete not even out of a bowl.

I asked someone I knew if they knew this woman and they told me her family is really rough one of the worst families in my area and drug addicts. So i feel like the injuries that the cat has might be from them.  I know that the cat loves living with my friend and I know it's well taken care of. So I don't want to give the woman her cat back for fear of it going to an abusive family.

Am I in the wrong here?

TLDR Found cat. Woman claims its her cat. Might be abusive to the cat. Don't want to give it back to her.",29,97,0.95

67,Not the A-hole,"So this summer me (17F) and two of my cousins (20F and 17M) decided to go on holiday together. This would be our first trip without parents, so I was very excited. 

Basically, one of my cousins wants to bring our other cousin, a 5 year old girl, with us. It is not her child, it is just a cousin. Personally, I am not comfortable with this because I don’t want the responsibility of looking after a small child as I am not even an adult myself. I also just want to be able to relax on my holiday, and not babysit a small child. 

When I expressed these feelings to my cousin she basically said that she would look after her and there would be no problems etc. But I still just do not want to go if a small child would be joining us... 

I feel like an asshole, because it’s just a kid and I don’t want to seem like some evil person that hates children. But I just cannot handle the responsibility, nor do I want it. 

WIBTA if I said that I just don’t want to go on the holiday if my little cousin will be tagging along? Am I being unreasonable? What is the best way to handle the situation?",130,550,0.97

69,Not the A-hole,"I was on the train the other day, and on our trains we have designated priority seating for those who need it. There are 4 priority seats in each carriage, coloured differently to distinguish them from the rest of the seating.

Occasionally I will sit in one. I have achondroplastic dwarfism, which is a highly visible condition (think Peter Dinklage) but has the problem of not being associated with any conventional 'issues'. A lot of people don't realise that it can cause daily pain, especially after exerting ourselves. I am a young, otherwise healthy-looking guy, so unless people knew this about my condition, they would probably think it just makes me short and nothing more.

Anyway, yesterday I had hiked up a hill, and I was feeling the consequences of it. I knew I wouldn't be able to stand comfortably for the next 30 minutes of the train journey, so I sat in priority seating, even though there were non-priority seats available at the time. The 3 other priority seats were then filled by a group of elderly women who seemed to be friends.

This was fine, until the next stop. A man who looked about 70+ got onto the train and stopped by our seats, he looked at me and said *""Excuse me, I'll need that seat.""* I hesitated for a moment, I'd dreaded this possibility before, but it had never happened, until now. I told myself that I had every right to sit there as he did, and that I would not put myself in pain just out of politeness. So I said *""I'm sorry, but I need to sit down.""* The woman sitting next to me in the isle seat (who was already getting up to let me out) looked at me with a puzzled expression, and the man responded *""Don't be ridiculous, there are other seats you can use. I'm not making these ladies move.""*

To me this wasn't about my comfort anymore. Yes, I could have changed to another seat, and knowing this route very well, I know that I wouldn't have been asked to stand if I had done so. We would both would have gotten what we wanted. But I believed I deserved priority seating. I have a disabilty. And I also was not obligated to disclose the details of it, either.

I just said again *""I'm sorry. I would stand if I could, but I also need a seat.""* The lady looked at me again, then turned and said to the man *""Don't worry, take mine.""* She got up and sat further down in the carriage, seperating her from her friends. The man looked at me with a pretty disapproving expression and sat down next to me, proceeding to ignore me for the rest of the trip. It was really awkward.

Was I just being overly principled? I think in hindsight I should have just moved - it would have been better for everyone - but at the same time, I believe I needed priority seating in that moment, and that I possibly needed it more than all 4 of them (without wanting to make any assumptions about their own abilities). I dislike people just assuming I must be fine if I'm young, and not entertaining the idea that dwarfism can be more than just shortness. AITA?

Edit: Just to be clear, it is very apparent that I have dwarfism, and that I'm not just a very short man. I'm 4ft tall and it is a disproportionate form of dwarfism that's pretty distinctive. Just seen people describe it as an invisible disability, and I wouldn't really call it that.",160,847,0.97
70,No A-holes here,"Providing update but need to remove original writeup due to character count. [Original write up here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cmhsni/aita_for_recording_an_argument_with_my_wife_and/ew2buqw/)

Edit: Thank you everyone for offering your insights. It seems the answers were mostly in two camps: YTA for recording or NTA for protecting yourself against gas lighting.

I am the asshole here.

I felt that my methods had merits because I wanted to discuss the recording before knowing what kind of content could be extracted from it. But I have changed my view on this after some reflection and discussion. I should have let her know my intentions and got an ok before recording. Given our communication track record, there was no reason for me to do this in stealth. This was a projection from my family history. 

Beyond the idea of recording, I was seriously in the wrong in this argument. 

She decided to sit down to listen to the recording with me after a long discussion. As we listened, I became shocked and embarrassed at my conduct. I did not address her concern, lectured her on what I need, and made multiple comments about being interrupted and not listened to during the argument. She was fair, used I feel statements and listened to my concerns, and in return I raised my tone. I felt so strongly about how I remembered it, and misrepresented it during the argument. 

I was clearly in the wrong and couldn't put my shit aside to listen to her. I feel really guilty for putting her through this and losing her trust, but I think going through the recording together and discussing it helped things. 

I am booking an appointment with a therapist to go through these issues. I think once I started cutting off toxic family, my ego boost hyperinflated my conviction of being right to feel how I feel, no matter the situation. And this has lead to me steamrolling the argument in cold manner. 

Thanks again everyone for your input.",406,3675,0.97
71,Not the A-hole,"Wife and I know a guy who is more of an acquaintance than a friend.  He stops over every so often to hang out for 10-15 minutes when he is in town (he is an electrician who has his own business and works in our area) and we have been to his house once.  Not a friend but overall a cool guy and we get along casually and the conversation topics stay light.  I even like the guy.

Its known that this guy is a boob guy.  My wife is rather stacked up top.  I've heard through other friends of ours who know him that he has hundreds of boob photos of women on his phone.  No big deal, I have porn too.  I'm a boob guy too.

Came to my attention that he asked my wife for a pic of her breasts.  My wife laughed it off and refused.  I was told about it later on and honestly I'm pissed.  I feel disrespected and angry.  I wouldn't go and ask another man's wife, girlfriend or SO for a picture of their tits.  I have respect for a man, his woman (whatever their status) and their relationship.  My wife doesn't want me to make a big deal about it but I told her that she can brush it off but can't tell me how I should feel when some guy makes that sort of inappropriate and offensive request.  

Maybe he was just looking for a laugh but its blatantly obvious my wife's breasts are large and combined with his admiration for large breasts, there is a part of me that wonders if this was him making a pass at my wife.  I want to confront him next time he shows up (I dont have his number or else I'd have called him already), even if its weeks later and tell him that I didnt appreciate his comments.  Let him know I'm pissed, disrespected and offended by his talk and if he ever talks to my wife that way again, I'm not going to be so nice about my next response.  

My wife wants me to forget about it but a part of me doesn't give a shit if he never shows up again; not like I'm losing a close friend.  She doesn't want to turn things weird between all of us and my reply was that things are already weird when he opened his mouth and asked for a pic of your tits like you are a stripper, a whore etc...  I'm not so casual how he talks to you so he can add your pic to his spank-bank.   How should I ""be normal"" the next tiem I see him??  I asked her ""what if a female asked me for a picture of my body?"" and she said she wouldnt care as long as I didn't send the pic (I don't 100% believe her position).  Its obvious we feel differently about the comment and I told her that a non-response just paves the way for him to get bolder to make further remarks or actually attempt something; I want to nip this in the bud.  She is afraid I'm going to embarrass us and wants me to keep my mouth shut.  I reassured her that I'm not embarrassed and this embarrassment she describes is a small price to pay to set the record straight.",81,30,0.85
72,Everyone Sucks,"Ok so I know that I’m an idiot but am I also an asshole?

I’ve been working a summer engineering internship for the last 2 months. It’s been great, I love my coworkers and I’ve learned so much. The company did a pre employment drug test which I knew about in advance so I stopped smoking for 3 months in preparation.

Well last weekend I wanted to go to a local festival so I asked my boss if I could have Friday off. She said that’s fine but to run it by the head HR lady who is also part owner of the company. She told me that it’s perfectly fine and to have fun. Great.

Well I return to work Monday and the head HR lady serves me with drug test forms. Her reasoning is that the festival I went to is known for recreational drug use and she wanted to make sure I was clean. 

Well I don’t smoke often but I did that weekend so I knew I was gonna fail and lose my job. I got so aggravated I went on a minor tirade about how drinking excessively is actively encouraged around the office and I know she has come in hung over on multiple occasions. She also held an office party at her house a few weeks ago with alcohol provided where multiple people passed out at her house and the rest drove home intoxicated. I let her know just how hypocritical this is.

My boss even had my back and told her how great of an intern I had been and how she was looking forward to hiring me full time when I graduate. This was to no avail. So I said goodbye to my coworkers and left.

I’m lucky to be so close to my boss who said she would provide me a good recommendation and give me contacts to get a job when I graduate. So damage was mitigated and I’m actually somewhat glad this happened because i don’t want to work for a company with a drug policy as arbitrary and hypocritical as this.

So AITA? Should I have just accepted my punishment and left amicably?

UPDATE

So I realize that I am an idiot for using recreational drugs when I’m trying to start my career. And I have only myself to blame for being fired. I still think the general culture around many companies in the US is hypocritical. Marijuana use is at most on the same level as drinking. Although I was wrong to talk back to my superior, I believe my opinion is valid. 

I will also be careful not to overshare and get too friendly with coworkers, especially superiors, in the future. This was my first professional job, so I’m still learning.

I texted the co-owner apologizing for my rant and thanking her for internship opportunity. She said there’s no hard feelings and she’s not going to put a black eye on my resume. I’ve gained many contacts through this internship working almost 3 months there so I still got tons of value.

tldr; I fucked up badly, lucky it didn’t end worse than it did. Culture around marijuana use is still fucked up.",236,436,0.9
73,Asshole,"My fiancee, 29F, and I, 33M, are getting married. Our wedding planner is helping us create the invitations. My family is a very old school, traditional one, and the weddings of my older siblings have always reflected the traditionality. In all their invitations, married couples were referred to as ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith"", or similar. Unmarried women have ""Miss"" in front of their names.

However, my fiancee wants to break away from this tradition by listing the names of each person separately. E.g. ""Mr. John Smith and Ms. Mary Smith"". I told her that it sounds clunky and weird. Then she brought up the fact that her mother never took on her father's surname (not a thing in her culture), and it would be weird to address her with his full name. She also wants to replace ""Miss"" and ""Mrs."" with ""Ms."" for all women.

I told her that I would advise against doing so. My grandmother, who is very elderly and nearly 100, may take offence because we have used the same invitation template/style since she got married. AITA for suggesting that we keep the tradition intact?

74,Asshole,"Some background:

My girlfriend and I have been going steady for about 2 years now. In that time, our relationship has become long distance because of my decision to work in a city multiple hours away, requiring half a day of driving to get there. As a result, we see eachother maybe once every two weeks to once a month at most. The nature of my work also means that I rarely get take any vacation time, and sometimes when my girlfriend visits I have to work for some of the time she is there.

Normally, this is no issue; we found a way to make it work. This particular time, some cousins of mine with whom I've been close with are here visiting my homecountry for the second time in their lives (10 years since the last time). 

Main story:

This past weekend, my girlfriend has been with us the whole time and coming out with us, so it was no issue. Now, weeks before they came, I planned to take them around my country to visit other cities multiple hours away. I asked my girlfriend to come along and be with us during these travels, but this morning I was asked by my cousins not to bring my girlfriend along because she ""changes the dynamic of the group."" I strongly disagree with this and want her with us, but it is my cousin's vacation so I asked my girlfriend if she would be ok with not coming. Obviously, she is devastated because we rarely get to see eachother and she was really looking forward to the vacation, but now she has lost the opportunity to come with us. She booked time off work for this, though it can be easily reversed and most of the investment has been emotional. 

I'm torn because I want to have her there and I rarely get to see her as it is, but I feel like I owe it to my cousins who are visiting to give them what they want. I also understand their point of view because when I visit them, they put their social life aside for me, though their relationships aren't long distance like mine. They hold no ill will to my girlfriend, but want us to be alone. Before they told me they want to spend time alone, I promised my girlfriend that everyone would get along, that we would all have a good time together and actively encouraged her to come. 

My girlfriend is hurt and upset at them, and is asking for me to somehow make up for the time lost between us before the end of summer by going on a separate other mini-vacation later on. This is really demanding for me as my girlfriend and I went on a 2 week vacation together earlier this summer and now with my cousins I am taking even more time off. A second vacation is going to be costly both financially and to my work. I am asking her to ""let it go"" this time, and to see the other perspective even if it is unfair to her, but she is incredibly upset about the time lost together because she was looking forward to coming and because now she won't  get to see me for another few weeks.

AITA? Are my cousins the asshole? Is my gf the asshole?",23,26,0.84
75,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is African American and I am white (this will be important later on in the story). My son just got his driver’s permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. The other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

I scolded my son and gave a “sorry” wave to the driver. At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son’s face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.

I did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man’s behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

Two months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company’s name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn’t fire him.

The company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn’t fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I’d reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have “no place” and “no future” in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee’s career is now toast.

Was it right of me to “double-report” this guy? I’m sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. Am I an asshole or a “Karen” for not dropping this matter?",2108,18068,0.85
76,Not the A-hole,Gonna try to keep it short without missing any detail. I have always been someone who doesnt like to borrow other peoples money. I make my own money and pay my own bills. Im 21 and I make just enough to cover my own expenses  with a little to save. My family isnt too big on birthdays so we normally go to dinner and thats pretty much it. Normally my parents pay for everyones (5 people) dinner since its usually for something special like a birthday. So like normal my mom lets everyone know where to meet up and gives us a time to be there. I arrive and as we wait to be seated my mom lets me know that I need to pay for my own food because im now old enough. I was a bit taken back but I told her that if I knew I would have to pay I wouldnt have come because this year we went to a decently expensive Brazilian restaurant (about $30 per person before tip). I told her I didnt really have the money to spend and that I wasnt told I would have to pay beforehand. I told them im sorry but im leaving since I cant afford it and they didnt want to pay for my food. I wished my older brother happy birthday and left to go back to my apartment. My parents both told me I was being selfish and that I shouldnt have left and just paid for my food. The more I think about it the more I think im an asshole. So AITA? Also apologizes for the format.

78,Asshole,"My grandma gets a lot of aches. She became Christian born again when she was in her 40s. Before this she smoked and drank but not no more...

About 2 years ago I told her about CBD she said she doesnt want any of that stuff in her system. About a year ago I gave it to my uncle and it had great effects.

I took her to the doctor and he prescribed pretty much just stronger advil and said i could use icy hot.

So what i did was clean and empty out my icy hot container and put cbd cream in it.

My grandma walks a little for fun now and is cooking and just more of a joy since she can be herself again.

EDIT: Judgment accepted. I'm the asshole. I would like to clarify that I have been solely responsible for all of my grandmas medical issues for the past 4 years. She had lung cancer and I was the one who had to make all the decisions because her son and daughter were having nervous breakdowns.  


I have made a lot of decision for her. And I believe she is being stubborn and hard headed. There is an additional type of medicine she can take that will not cause any harm to her. She just has this negative stigma about weed and cbd.  


That being said, I will tell her what I am doing. I've made other decisions for her in the past in regards to her money and I think they have helped her but I need to stop being controlling. I believe I'm still 100% right. But as long as she is in perfect mental health I can't keep doing this.

80,Not the A-hole,"I've had a Nintendo Switch since it launched, primarily to play Breath of the Wild.  It's a great console and I don't regret paying $300 for it, even though that's no small amount of money.

My sister has been on summer break these past few months, and she's been using the Switch a lot.  I never really thought much about it because we live in the same house, so I can just ask for it back when I want to use it.  I haven't wanted to use it in a while, which is why I didn't notice when it went missing about three weeks ago.

A new game came out and I wanted to play it (the new Fire Emblem).  I asked her where it was, and she told me that she didn't know.  I asked her repeatedly to find it, and she responds with ""I don't know"" or ""why don't you look for it?"", which I find completely inappropriate since she's the last one who had it and has now lost it.

I am only her older sister (25), so I know I am in no position to impose any kind of punishment on my sister.  I approached our father and asked what I could do about the situation.  I suggested pulling her allowance to pay for a new Switch, since she is only 15 and has no job/source of income.  My father is now angry at me because I want to take her money over 'a video game', which he has always heavily disapproved of.  I tried to explain to him that it wasn't about losing a game, it was about her being careless with my $300 property.  He refuses to let me take her allowance because it is something he gives her and I have no right to it.

I guess I can see how it's petty to want compensation from a 15 year old, but I also think that she needs to learn to be careful with things that don't belong to her.  She has a horrific track record of losing her things.  She lost an iPad Air and our father just bought her another one for her birthday a month later.

82,Not the A-hole,"TLDR; SIL questioned me why I didnt want alcohol coming home after my baby shower (reasons include alcoholism in my home and my young kids being present) but since I didnt answer she kept pushing me. I said I was ""about to lose my shit"" and walked away. MIL then said I was an ass and owed her an apology.

My baby shower went really well until clean up. I picked up a beer box and said ""I dont want this coming home, someone else can take it."" SIL says ""are you sure?"" I tell her yes, I dont want it at my house. She says ""Why cant it come with you?"" I say ""BC I dont want it there."" Again she asks ""Well why cant (my husband) just have 2 beers?"" I said ""I'm about to lose my shit. I already said I dont want it."" I walked away. 

Outside, MIL approaches to say ""you shouldnt talk to SIL like that. There are other ways to handle situations."" I said ""I told her nicely 2 separate times I wasnt taking this home. Its not up to her to decide what happens in my home."" She argues and I say ""honestly, youre upsetting me too. Just stop."" Walked away, went home.

At home, told DH. When MIL calls, he tells her hesdisappointedH in them, that i have a right to defend myself when someone is coming at me. She says ""the only person being an ass tonight was (me) and I should be able to tell her that. Why should i have to walk on eggshells?"" Then says ""you know how your sister is. she shouldnt have spoken like that when your sister could react violently."" He says ""you feel you shouldnt walk on egg shells with wife but she should walk on them with my sister?"" It escalates to his mom showing up and them arguing for HOURS. Then his sister texting him to ""tell that MF to watch her mouth"" and ""being pregnant is no excuse to be a bitch."" He hasnt spoken to either since. 

I dont want them fighting over this. I also feel I was right to stand up for myself. ""why cant he have 2 beers?"" The answer should have been ""you are not entitled to that information. I said no."" I had nasty thoughts on my tongue so i opted to warn her I may snap by saying ""im about to lose my shit"" instead.

Reasons why no beer at house:

-DH has a drinking problem with moderation and becomes confrontational. He and i have an agreement HE came up with. He limits intake to no more than 6 beers/day, no more than 3 days /week, never around kids.

-That night, special occasion, he had 13 beers. I didnt want to bring the rest home as he was likely to continue and had work the next day.

-Kids spent the summer out of state, got back that morning. Didnt want beer in fridge or them to see him drinking at home. 

-Their dad's an alcoholic. After split, I made a point to keep an alcohol free home for them to feel safe. I want my house to be a place of stability for them. 

I dont think SIL was entitled to an explanation. I said no so why AITA for not giving into explaining? I feel like she was wrong for demanding an answer rather than just accepting the free beer.

83,Asshole,"I started seeing a woman from Tinder. We've been talking for a few weeks. She's pretty and smart. First date went really well but it was on a Saturday afternoon. I'd had a wild night the night before so I had a a hangover and a headache. I told her I'm not normally so brain dead and she seemed to understand. We got on really well and agreed to see each other again. 

Our second date was the week after, on Sunday. I had a wild Saturday night out which ended at 5am so I was hungover again and quiet. We agreed to see each other that day at 330. Because I've been working alot and partying a lot, I wanted to go to the gym to make sure I stay in shape. I felt alot of pressure because she has a really hot body. The gym was going to shut at 8 - I was on a time limit which meant I needed to leave at 530/6.

She seemed pretty weird when I told her I needed to leave so I could hit the gym. As we parted ways, I said I was sorry and said she could come with me to the gym. She said no. She was quiet and drumming her fingers and I could feel she was maybe annoyed. I apologised by text as soon as we left each other and suggested we cook dinner together at my place on a day when I'm not hungover. 

She just texted me and said she's not interested in seeing me again.

AITA for these dates, reddit? I'm on a schedule and I want to let my hair down when I'm not working and I want to work out too.

Update (and edits for clarity) : so everyone is saying I'm TA for this and I'm getting personally criticised for my post history and the previous interaction with my ex.

He seemed like he had everything on track, and was really doing well... up until a recent relationship change about a year ago. When his relationship fell apart, everything else did as well. He was kicked out of their apartment, had no money or family to lean on, and spent every waking moment complaining about his ex. I felt awful for him, and offered to have him crash at mine while he got back on his feet. Not long after, a distant cousin offered to let him move (rent free) into a shared house with relatives. He decided that it wasn't good enough (for petty reasons, ie the house was ""too hot"") and for whatever reason chose to live in his car instead. I protested for his health and safety, but offered him a hot shower, a smoke, a square meal & a couch to crash on when he needed it until he found a new arrangement.

Except it's been 8 months now, and he's literally always showing up dirty, hungry and broke. He's forever hinting or outright asking for food and gas money.... except he works a reasonable, 9-5 office job and he always seems to has money to buy ciggies, pot and perks. Same with new clothes and shoes. But in the next breath, he's complaining that he won't be able to afford his hormones this month.

I love him, but he's driving me crazy. I'm tired of helping him when he won't help himself. I know that he's still dealing with his breakup and his life being flipped upside down, as well as the discrimination and turmoil he already faces being trans. But he's draining me (and my bank account).

Am I the asshole here?",165,2254,0.96
85,Asshole,"Edit: Even with some different judgements almost all these responses are telling me the same thing: I'm giving into my fear and I shouldn't. I kinda knew that inside, but I definitely needed to hear it from others. Thanks guys. 

So a close friend invited me to an event that's at the end of this week free of charge. I was down to go, but it's in a huge, closed arena where there will be a couple thousand people and I'm not going to lie, I'm having second thoughts due to what's gone on here in the U.S. this past week.

Now I *know* logically that it's still statistically unlikely plus clearly these things can happen quite literally anywhere anyways, but I still can't help feeling very, very anxious and paranoid about it. Especially because of how many it's been in such a short period of time. She asked me before the El Paso and Dayton shootings, but after the Garlic Festival one and I said yes then. I didn't even think about it, but with the other two now it's changed things for me and I'm quite a bit scared to go tbh. Not to mention this event is in a big city where one of the most dangerous shootings in U.S. history took place a few years ago.

They know how I am with this stuff. I'm always getting us to sit near exits during movies or in crowded places. There was even one time where I was so sketched out by this person in a really packed theater that I moved down to a seat near an exit by myself because nobody else in our group wanted to move (they did eventually though because they thought the person was pretty sketch too.)

The part that makes me feel really bad about cancelling is because we actually already had a big mix up with this plan where we were on completely different pages about when it was so I made other plans, we argued, I cancelled my other plans and told them I would still go. I also don't think they'd go if I cancelled ~~(worth noting though this isn't something super important to them, they wouldn't go if they weren't getting in for free)~~. So now I just feel like I'm jerking them around, but when I get really worried like I was at that movie it's super hard for me to enjoy anything. I spent half the movie having an anxiety attack until I finally chilled out and even then I was on edge.

Soooo WIBTA if I cancelled?

Sneak edit: I realised I kinda added my own bias because I actually don't know for a *fact* this isn't super important to them. But I do know they didn't seek it out. Someone just offered them the tickets for free and they asked me if I would want to come along, so I'm assuming, but not sure.",25,31,0.86
86,Not the A-hole,"I was at the bar Saturday night and I was sitting at a booth drinking and watching a band. A dude who is completely shithoused walked up to throw his cup away in the trash can, reached in his pocket, grabbed some money, inspected it (thoroughly looked at it and had to have confirmed it was money), tapped his buddy on the shoulder to get him to watch, and threw it in the garbage can with the cup and started laughing and walked away.

I walked over and grabbed it out of the trash, a $20 bill and a $1, $21 total. I looked around for the dude and couldn’t find it him so I put it in my pocket. Later on that night I used it to buy beer for me and my group, free beer in my head, dude looked at it and even got his buddy to watch him throw cash away. When I got back to the table I told the group the story and that’s how I paid for the beer, 3/6 people with me told me I should have hunted the dude down and given it back, it wasn’t my money, or I should have turned it into the bar tender. Then they said they’ll buy their own because “they aren’t drinking stolen beer”.

87,Asshole,"When we were around 8-13 me (22f) and my brother (24m) would always fight over who got to play on the computer, with certain toys, and other stuff. At the time I thought he was a jerk and he thought I was an absolute bitch. I knew how to get on my mothers nerves so she would side with me. I wasn't their favourite, I was their most annoying child. This gave me much more computer time than my brother, and at the time it was important for both of us. We both had a ton of online friends and I basically took time away from him to talk to mine. 

A few months ago we were at a restaurant and the subject of embarrassing/funny stories from childhoods came up. My sister started about how funny my tantrums were, and my brother instantly became very sour and said that I always got everything I wanted because of it, and he never got his full computer time. 

I didn't think he still cared that much, as we treat eachother much more civilized now, and refused to apologize for something I did as a kid a decade ago. I said if anyone should apologize it's our mother for giving in to my tantrums instead of actually raising me to act like a human being. The topic was swiftly changed after that.

My mother thinks I should just apologize to my brother the next time I see him (I live 2 hours away) and I hate the principle of it. A lot of kids/teens do hurtful stuff, even my brother did some things to me that I think he should apologize for if we're gonna start doing that. 

AITA for not apologizing to my brother and blaming my mother?


Edit: Yes I know I was an asshole as a kid, no need to comment that as I already admitted it in my own post. It's just stating the obvious. Please only tell me if I'm an asshole NOW.

89,Not the A-hole,"I'm taking some steps to hide our identities, including slight tweaks to the ages listed and using a throwaway. The reason why will be obvious shortly.

I live with my husband in the suburbs. It's a neighborhood where everyone is expected to show up to gatherings, attend birthday parties, occasionally host the neighbor kids after school... etc. Some families have nannies to help facilitate this, others have SAHMs. Im a SAHM; my husband is in engineering. We have two daughters, one who's 12 and one who's 10.

A politician lives near here. If I said his name, you wouldn't know who I was talking about, but he has made national headlines a few times for objectively reprehensible statements. It's not just the fact that he's a part of one political party - he's also an outspoken, public person who holds views antithetical to our core values.

I've met him a few times in passing, but most of my contact is with his wife, who we'll call Sarah, and his daughter, who we'll call Chrissy. Sarah is very involved in local school events, volunteering, etc. We're not friends, but I would say we work together at least twice a month on some kind of local project. 

Chrissy is friends with both of my daughters. She's a bright, friendly, funny girl and I've never had any reason to discipline her. Chrissy comes to our home, and our daughters go to her home. They've done camp, sleepovers, birthday parties, movie nights, pizza parties, etc. I can't find any fault with Chrissy as a friend to our daughters or a guest in our household.

Last night, my husband asked to speak to me. He said it was time that ""the people"" stopped enabling certain politicians. He said that our most powerful tool, outside of voting, would to be to apply social pressure to people who hold certain harmful viewpoints. He said he does not want our family to interact with this politican's family at all, on any level - we should freeze them out. My husband said that if it were up to him, he would be actively starting a conflict with this politician in any way he could, but he will respect our daughters' friendship with Chrissy and just keep it at shunning.

I don't think he's wrong that activism is very important ... but I don't think our daughters need to give up a friend. Also, I don't want to burn the bridge with someone else in the neighborhood. 

My husband thinks that's a cop out, and it's important to do the right thing. He also said he's afraid one day our daughters will come home and say something inappropriate from spending time at the politician's home.

My husband is at work but we'll discuss this again tonight. Before I sit down again with him, I have to ask - am I the asshole for wanting to continue my family's relationship with a bigoted man's wife and daughter?",36,49,0.82

91,Not the A-hole,"My(33M) wife (26F) and I moved away from our home towns.  I am approximately 8 hours away and she is 14 hours away.  For years we have struggled to schedule our parents visitations but have done our best.  About three years ago, we had our first child (Mort).  Mort is the first grandchild all around.  My parents are split up, hers are together, so ultimately we are managing three different parties of visitors.  For the first two years it was chaotic trying to manage the parental visits.  The would each want to come up and stay with us for multiple days at time.  We would spend a great deal of time checking with eachother's schedules, making sure there was availability, trying to find fun things to do, and making sure we had enough food in the house.  It got to the point where I would dread picking up their phone calls because the conversation always ended with them asking when the next time they could come up (or us come down).  Then, there was the apparent disparity between how much one set visited over the other.  Jealousy all around.  I mean, we're not that great, but I get it, Mort is pretty great.

To manage this, we informed our families that we were going to assign each a set of months that they could visit.  My in-laws were assigned 3 specific months, my mother 3 months, and my father 3 months.  They could only come on their own month.  

While both my wife and I love our parents and are grateful for their care and sacrifices but, it's still a disruption to have them up.  Maybe some of you will understand this.  

My mother, who was against this whole system to begin with, immediately began trying to disrupt it.  Her months were March, August, and December.  She decided to schedule a trip in the beginning of July and we said fine to be accommodating but reminded her that this was going to count as her August trip.  Just yesterday, she asks when she can come up agian and I told her we'd see her for the holidays in December.  Well she just blew up accusing me of not loving her as much and how she can't believe we would ""ration"" her time with us and her grandchild.  Apparently, the 5 month gap was appalling. You must understand as well, that we come from an immigrant family where there were 4 generations in one house at one point.  Lots of cousins/aunts/uncles living close by having dinner together regularly.  It's a very close family and I was the first one to move away.

96,Not the A-hole,"Hey gang, I’m 19 for reference, on summer break

Ever since I can remember, I’ve been a very introverted person. My brother(21) on the other hand is the opposite, he can’t enjoy time by himself and is always out doing things with his friends. As we grew up, my parents seemed to have developed expectations for me based on my brother. Wondering why and questioning why I wouldn’t hang out with people. Truth is, I don’t have many friends , and being social doesn’t interest me that much. 

Over the years this has led to many conflicts between me and my parents, usually about me “being a shut in” or “you need to leave your room”. Currently, I work a full time job 7-3 every weekday. Whenever I get home I will usually go into my room to play videogames or talk on discord, come down for dinner, watch tv/play videogames, then go to bed. My parents didn’t like this routine, once again calling me things like a hermit and that it’s unhealthy.

I got really sick and tired of this, so a few times a week I would tell my parents I was meeting a friend for food, they seemed surprised but happy. In reality, I’d either go for long drives (something I love doing), or just go eat by myself. I did this for about 6 weeks.

However, the other day my dad apparently had gone out to get takeout and just so happened to be at the exact same McDonald’s as me. He saw me and was surprised but immediately became angry. He walked up to me and said in that angry dad whisper “go home now so we can talk”, and I did.

When I got home my parents were livid, clearly connecting the dots of the situation. They told me that I have some sort of mental issue for lying to them and that never wanting to interact is more proof of this, and that I need to go see a therapist. As I’ve done so many times before , I tried explaining that I’m happy spending time by myself and the only reason they want me to be social is because I’m not living up to what my brother does. 

This was yesterday, and They’re still pissed at me. Currently looking at counseling for me to go to, but there’s no way in hell im going to go to anything like that.

So yeah, that’s that. AITA?

TLDR; I’m introverted, and to get my parents off my back about it I lie about meeting friends and just go somewhere by myself. They found out, think I’m mentally ill and are demanding I see a therapist",72,229,0.96

98,Not the A-hole,"Feel it important to mention this didn’t happen recently but a few months ago.

I work at a 24 hour vet office. On the ‘graveyard shift’, the vet goes home and there is only two vet techs and a receptionist. At around 3 in the morning, a family rushes in with a fawn in a plastic tub. There is a father and three children, ages 6-13 if I really had to guess.

For those of you that aren’t aware, fawns are nearly impossible to raise in captivity without a mother. They’re prone to starving themselves to death out of fear. Immediately, I feel sick to my stomach and ask what the problem is. Long conversation short, they found a baby deer abandoned during a family camping trip and were bringing it in because it seemed lethargic/wasn’t accepting any food or water.

I explained to them that baby deer are rarely truly abandoned by their mothers, but are instead just left in a safe place to help avoid predators. The children were doing most of the talking, the eldest insisting that he knew it was abandoned. They all began yelling, at which point I loudly (but not angrily) informed the family that legally and morally, I could not allow them to continue to keep the fawn and that they needed to leave, as their voices were upsetting the fawn and other animals (who had begun barking)

When the father became irate and said I was being bitter, I told him that I would not be returning the deer to the family but would be calling local wildlife authorities to deal with it. One of the children asked if Bambi was going to die. I told her I wasn’t sure, but it was very likely that she would need to be put down, and this is why they needed to leave these things alone. All of the children began crying and although they insisted on trying to wait for someone to come pick up the deer, the father eventually took them home. I do not know what happened to Bambi after I was relieved from my shift.

I feel this is fairly obviously TA at a glance, but I would like to add that we live in a state with heavy woodland area. I was afraid that if I simply took the deer and thanked them, they would undoubtedly try again. The father accused me of stealing their pet, so I wanted to drive home this was a wild animal and not something that could be kept in a backyard.",206,2317,0.97
99,Not the A-hole,"One year ago my ex cheated on me, I found out, and I kicked her out of our shared apartment. It all ended pretty quickly, and as such there were a lot of things that weren't completely finalized at first. She did update her mailing address to her new place after a couple of weeks, but for a while I was still receiving her mail. And even after she updated it, there were some things that still came to me (and I still get at least one thing a week addressed to her, usually junk mail now). I remained friends with her sister, and once a month or so we'd get dinner, catch up, and I'd pass my ex's mail along, just in case there was anything important. I wanted to throw it all out, but resisted the urge and tried to be mature about it.

When she moved out, she had an older but functional vehicle, which was parked on our street, and a 2nd car, which was her daily driver (no we're not rich, just happened to have access to a 2nd vehicle). She left the first car parked there for a couple months after she left, simply because she never used it and had no need to come get it. After a few months had passed, I happened to notice a big yellow paper on her car's windshield, and recognized it as a tow notice (city would impound her vehicle if not moved in a certain amount of time, usually accompanied by a fee). I ignored it, as I ignored everything having to do with her, but when I met up with her sister a few weeks later, I did relay the info. Sister passed the information along to ex, and the next day the car was finally moved. This was 8-9 months ago. 

Fast forward to yesterday. My ex emails me, first time we've had any contact in 6 months, to say she's particularly broke right now and our state's Department of Revenue is about to garnish her wages due to the parking ticket she'd received on that car last year. She implied that I'm at least partially to blame for not telling her about the parking violating notice immediately/as soon as I noticed it, and indirectly asked me for financial assistance to pay the fine. She still has a couple of my things that I made clear I want back, and in her email she suggested I could buy these items off of her for a small fee -- that is conveniently, of course, the same amount as her parking fine. It's only $500, but still seems like minor extortion to me.

WIBTA if I refuse to help her pay this off? Was I wrong by not telling her about the parking fine on her car right away? I was still devastated by her cheating on me back when this happened, and she was lazy/irresponsible in the first place for not moving her car for months.

I knew the meme is sometimes used in a toxic way but mainly remember it from being all over YouTube comments many years ago around the time that a lot of silly furry-related stuff went viral so it seemed harmless to me.

It was my idea to include it and the whole game is kinda full of memes and is very tongue-in-cheek so I didn't think it would be interpreted as hostile. I was not invested in the meme being in the game and didn’t mind changing it unless this is overly politically correct and not the right thing to do…

So I decided to make a post in r/games saying mostly the same things as I’m saying this post and asking if I should change it. Because there have been instances where a game changes things to cater to those who take offense, only to then face even more criticism because it turned out that it wasn't really that offensive. 

While some of the responses were insightful and helpful, a surprisingly high amount of em insisted I was obviously propagating a meme that they claim was always transphobic and I ended up getting tons of personal messages that did not show much understanding, to say the least.

102,Not the A-hole,"To start - My (F20) boyfriend’s cousin (M18) has unspeakably horrible hygiene habits. We have had to make him take a shower the last few times he’s come over because he smells like, quite frankly, sour ass taco seasoning. This usually happens on the weekends when my boyfriend is home, but he and two other boys stayed over last night. Two couches and a guest bed—enough to cover each boy.

My boyfriend’s mom calls and explains she needed to borrow a charger from our room and asks why his cousin is asleep in our bed half naked. I’m already fuming before I arrive at home, but when I walk in the house I see the other two boys still asleep on the couches. Sure enough, he’s still in our bed, asleep, but now clothed. I furiously beat on the wall and, very loudly, told him to get the fuck up. He groggily stumbles out of bed, and I ask him why he decided to sleep in our bed and not the empty guest bed. He said he thought someone was in there, but he failed to check. The door has been wide open and the bed freshly made since yesterday.

I tossed our sheets in the living room and was going to have him wash them, but I decided to do them myself so he didn’t break the washer. I was looking forward to a nap when I got home because I get up every morning at 3:30am to get ready for work.

My boyfriend says that his cousin has always slept in his bed since they were kids and that I’m being too harsh and should apologize. I could’ve been nicer, but I feel like I’m entitled to SOME privacy and respect because it’s my room and bed too.

104,Asshole,"Just to note... We were at a party. Everyone was at least a little bit drunk. That's why this type of a conversation even took place.

It was one of my friend's birthday party, which he was holding at his step-brother's bar.

The bartender who was working a shift that night is gay and apparently he's got a new boyfriend, who came over at one point to drop off a bag.

This bartender is a typical masculine guy, everyone thinks he's straight when they first meet him. However both his new boyfriend and the last one that I know of are feminine dudes. If you closed your eyes while listening to their voice, you'd think it was a woman talking.

After the boyfriend left, people asked him questions about how they met etc. I joked how he's obviously got a type, given his past relationships and he laughed along. So I asked if he'd ever date a woman, since he obviously appreciates femininity.

That's when I felt bad because tbh in my mind it was innocent drunken curiosity, but he just sort of rolled his eyes and said ""that's not how it works"".

I felt he became a bit hostile towards me compared to other people in the group, so I apologized but it took him a second to even get what I was talking about. He said not to worry about it. Maybe it wasn't such a big deal?

105,Not the A-hole,"**Update:** Thanks all for the input. For those interested in a follow up, she demanded that she go or she was going to call the school herself and make a scene, at least that was the threat. I relented for my daughter, all while being told that I'm a selfish asshole. The meeting went fine and of the nearly hour talk, about 5 minutes of it had to do with finances. So I walked out of there feeling like I made a big deal about nothing but I guess you can't know what you don't know and I didn't know the meeting would be so much chat and so little shop talk. The good news: it looks like my daughter is going to school. I'm elated for that.

In 2018 my ex decided to bug out on our marriage and her kids after years of mis-treated and self-diagnosed mental issues. During much of this time she had nearly no contact with our children and I was left to play single dad, run my company with two kids in tow and pay my ex wife's expenses (including an apartment) until this last May when I gave her a lump sum of money to finalize our divorce and give her a kick start financially so she could get a car, get a place big enough to have the kids, etc. It was the only way she would be able to take our kids and so I viewed it as money well spent. I had to take out a loan to do this and the amount I paid her was substantially more than I would have owed her in alimony because she immediately cohabited with her boyfriend and they intend to get married.

I have been dating a girl for 7 months now. It is serious but we're taking it slow for obvious reasons. She is a teacher and her school has a summer program. I mentioned this to my mom in passing and she immediately contacted my other siblings and they all paid for my daughter to go to that program. In doing so I've gotten to know the teachers and administrators at the school. My ex wife has also re-appeared in the children's life on a regular basis and is making a genuine attempt to right her wrongs.

Summer camp ends this week. Last week I wrote the administrator of the school an email asking if they might consider my daughter for their full school year program and explained that I don't have a lot of money and there would need to be financial aid even if the answer was yes but that seeing my daughter thrive in this environment was worth me writing a cringe-worthy email asking for help. The school reached out and asked if I'd meet with them today. I told my ex about this meeting and she is absolutely livid that I am excluding her from it.

The way I view it is that I have rapport with these people and my ex does not. I am the one that will be paying for this. I am not comfortable going into this meeting discussing my personal finances with her there and much of the reason I can't afford to pay full price for the school is because of money that I've given her over the last year. She still has no job and no real prospects for a job. She is living off the money I gave her in the settlement, splitting expenses with her boyfriend and plans to go on disability for her mental problems once our divorce is finalized. I love that she's trying to re-appear in her kid's lives and attempting to be a parent but I have very little respect for the human being she chooses to be and very much don't want to sit in that meeting with her. I am just trying to maximize the odds of having a succesful meeting and very much feel that her not being there helps me achieve that. AITA?

Extra Info 2: Seems to be some confusion on me including my ex in the decision making process. To be clear, she is fine with our daughter going to the school. I would not send her without her blessing. This meeting is about finances and I am the one that will be paying. Not my ex.",84,329,0.94
106,Asshole,"Pretty tame compared to other things people post on here but I’m still wondering if I overreacted a little. In case you’re not familiar with “number neighbors,” it’s this stupid Twitter trend where you text the next phone number up or down from yours on the off chance you get a funny response or become best friends or whatever. It’s basically bothering a stranger to get a reaction and a screenshot to post. 

I had only heard of it briefly from the occasional memes they produce but I was contacted by one of mine last night. As a little context, I’m an incredibly light sleeper and falling/staying asleep is at least an hour+ ordeal. I usually keep my phone on silent at night but I had forgotten to silence it before bed (this has happened before and it was never an issue because the late night text phase of my life is essentially over). 

I get woken up by my phone going off a little after 1 o’clock this morning. I check the notification and don’t recognize the number, I didn’t even draw the connection that it was basically my number with a digit changed because I was half asleep. All the text said was “Hi ! I’m your number neighbor.”

I was super annoyed but I put the phone down and tried to go back to sleep (which took several hours as per usual). I saw it again this morning when I got up and got re-irritated all over again. I decided to reply:

NN: Hi ! I’m your number neighbor 

Me: did you really need to do this at one in the morning 

Me: did your need for attention/something cute to post on social media justify waking up a complete stranger

Me: here’s hoping 0328 (my other NN) is more considerate than you are *gif of Tyrion Lannister giving a very unenthusiastic cheers*

Needless to say I haven’t heard back. My husband said I should have just left it alone because it was probably just some dumb kid. Did I overreact/AITA?

EDIT: literally as soon as I hit post they texted back saying “I’m very sorry, have a good day” and now I feel kind of bad

EDIT 2: woooow there are some salty ass kids in this post, reading some of these replies was a total trip. A few commenters mentioned it’s probably a generational thing and I completely agree. I also agree that I generally overreacted in my reply and was responding based off crabbiness and lack of sleep. Will set up a DND in the event that NN 2 comes knocking 😂.

107,Not the A-hole,"I live in an apartment complex and I just so happen to live in the apartment that shares the same number as the building's street number ie. my address is 67 Maple Street, Apartment 67.

We have a buzzer system at the front door that has apartment number but no names listed next to the buzzer. You have to press and hold the button in order to speak with the apartment itself, which is too complicated for most people. We do not have a concierge and someone has to come down and open the door to let you in, we cannot open it from the apartment.

Every day, at least once, my neighbors' guests buzz my apartment or they forget to put an apartment number so the delivery person buzzes me. This is annoying, because the buzzer is loud (and causes my dogs to bark) and nearly every time even if I talk to them through the intercom they don't get the hint and keep buzzing me and not the right apartment.

I don't know everyone in the building so I can't always redirect them and it's a pain in the ass to have to come downstairs multiple times a night sometimes to be like ""you've got the wrong apartment.""

I want to type and print a polite note telling people to tell their guests the correct apartment number and tape it to the door. 

My wife disagrees, she thinks that's passive aggressive and an asshole move since the neighbors aren't the ones at fault here, but I just had someone buzz us 15 times in 25 minutes until I had to go downstairs and tell them to fuck off.

111,Everyone Sucks,"I'm from Arizona and my roommate is from Minnesota.  We are sharing an apartment in Texas while we go to grad school.

When I sleep during the summer, I wear only boxers and sleep with a thin sheet on.  He, however, sleeps with pajama pants, socks, and a shirt on with a medium-weight blanket.  The problem is that he's ""hot"" at night and wants to blast our air conditioner all night so he doesn't get too hot in bed.  We got into a big argument about it where he claimed he couldn't sleep the way I do because it ""doesn't feel right"" and ""isn't as cozy.""  He just ""wants to be comfortable.""

I, however, straight up get cold at night and don't want to spend the money cooling the apartment when at night it's cool enough and we could just crack the windows open or something.  

Besides this issue, I like him a lot as a roommate and as a dude.  But he has straight up refused to even try sleeping like I do, only in boxers and a sheet.  AITA for demanding that he change his life-long habits?  I even suggested that he get a fan or something but that went nowhere.

112,Not the A-hole,"I collect mid-century furniture. I have a set of chairs and a table that I love and which are also quite expensive to repair and replace. Since they are old (about 60-70 years old) and from a different era, I don’t expect them to hold a significantly above average amount of weight. 

I had my family over, along with their guests, to celebrate a special occasion. One of the guests was my sister’s boyfriend, a man who is maybe 5’10 and easily 300 pounds. I set out a more contemporary chair for him. Not exactly a folding chair, but an IKEA chair which I trusted to hold more weight. He went to go sit in one of the mid century chairs at the table. I tapped his shoulder and asked him very quietly to sit in the other chair, since I didn’t think that the much older chair would be able to hold his weight well.

He immediately blew up at me. He turned to my sister and said very loudly that I was trying to make him feel bad about his weight and that I thought that a chair would break under him. She starts getting mad at me too, saying that she’s overweight too and did I have a special “fat chair” for her as well? I tried to defuse the situation and said that these chairs were just old and prized, and I wanted to make sure that they wouldn’t break. A lot of people in my family were giving me nasty looks and saying that singling him out was unfair, and I should have just had the same chairs for everyone to avoid singling him out. I wanted my chairs out for people to admire and use them and they’re sturdy, for the most part, for an average person’s weight, so I don’t see why I should have just bought all new chairs for this occasion. The argument reached such a point that my sister and her boyfriend left and so did some of my family.

I wasn’t trying to fat shame anyone, it was really just about the chair, and I thought maybe I could prevent him from feeling the embarrassment of breaking a chair as well. Should I just have bought different chairs for the party? AITA?",689,2867,0.96
113,No A-holes here,"   I’m on mobile and I don’t know how to format so sorry, first and foremost.

   So I’m not really sure where to start but here we go. My(21M) teeth have started to hurt very badly. My wisdom teeth came in years ago but I guess not all the way yet, as they’ve started coming in more, shifting my other teeth and even chipping a molar because of the lack of mouth real estate available. Either way, I now need to get them pulled and get braces and maybe a filling or two for badly chipped/broken teeth. I can not afford this, I’m barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck. So I asked my parents for help paying for it, as I knew that I hadn’t been to the dentist for a while living with them (I’ve been moved out for a little over a year now.)

   They basically told me that it was my problem. They also said that I hadn’t been to the dentist since 6th grade in MIDDLE SCHOOL, which was almost a decade ago for me! I got extremely pissed and tore into them for not caring for my personal hygiene as a child/teenager. I still feel as if they are responsible for covering even PART of the bill. AITA for feeling like they should cover some of the costs towards the bills?

EDIT: I feel that it is necessary to point out that my dental hygiene is perfectly fine. I brush and floss twice daily and always have. When my wisdoms came in my freshman year I was crying and begging to see someone and my mother hit me with the “it’s just growing pains”. Eventually the pain stopped and I never questioned it, but I did ask constantly to get my mouth looked at. My wisdom teeth were fully and obviously visible after that year. My teeth continued to cause me pain a few times a year still, though not as bad, and I still asked over the years to see a dentist. They have now decided to come in the rest of the way and shift even more teeth.",74,52,0.88
114,Not the A-hole,"My name is Thomas, and I was named after my father. There are times I am called “Tom”. My parents never wanted me to be called “Tommy”, because my father had that nicknamed ruined after my maternal grandmother called him it patronizingly so many times throughout their dating relationship (she didn’t approve of them dating). It got to the point that they and my older sisters would correct anyone who would call me “Tommy” in front of them.

I didn’t care, really, because no one ever called me it patronizingly. I had friends that would at school and it continued, into high school especially. It didn’t really happen in front of my parents or sisters, I was mostly just “Tom” or “Thomas”. Then when I went out of state for college, I had a nickname based on “Tommy” and I embraced being “Tommy” with them. I was still my full name with my family and didn’t care what anyone called me, so long as they were respectful and didn’t tell them about this. I eventually met my now fiancé and she calls me Tommy. As of right now, I go by Thomas professionally and with my family, but Tommy with my friends and fiance.

My fiancé and I moved back to my hometown for work. She does call me Tommy in front of my family since she calls me that all the time and it bothers them. She doesn’t address my father as that (she calls him “Mr. (My Last Name)”), but they say it’s just not what they ever wanted me being called and it reminds them of that time. I say that was a long time ago and I should be able to choose what I go by now that I’m an adult. They say out of respect, she shouldn’t call me that in front of them.

117,No A-holes here,"I know it sounds bad.  And I think I'm probably the asshole.  But here's a bit more information:

My wife, when I met her, was a great, fun person. However, a few years ago, she started to suffer chronic migraines.

I should say that do care about it.  I sympathize with her greatly.  I wish, more than anything, that she didn't suffer from them, and she could live a normal life.  But she doesn't.  Instead, she texts me to come home from work so I could take care of our toddler, or she sleeps in, so she can get the rest she needs. We spend a fortune on doctor co-pays as she tries a different specialist, or medication.  It's at the point where I am unable to go out alone, in fear that I'll be leaving our child home with an unqualified care-taker because of her condition.

Part of me resents her for the additional work her condition has put on me.  The part of me feels awful for even thinking that - obviously her physical pain is more than what I'm going through.  I have friends and family who can all leave for a weekend and leave kids home alone with the wife/husband.  But it's not something I can do.  If I were to go away, I'd need a baby sitter, because my wife wouldn't be able to be alone with the child for that long.

Her chronic pain has become more than a part of her.  It's become who 'we' are.  Her life revolves around it, and as a result, mine does as well.  Everything I do from the food we cook, to our plans, our vacations, or even just if I could wake up early to go to the gym, or stay late at work, has to stop and think 'will the wife be okay without me if I do it?'

What I really want to know is: AITA for not really caring anymore?  She will say 'I'm in too much pain for......' or 'I just need to go lie down because....' and it all just goes in one ear and out the other.  All I can think is '........ of course that's what you're going to do.......  so this is my life?'

9 times out of 10, I like to think i'm compassionate, and I show her the responses she is looking for.  but then there's that 1 out of 10 times where it turns into a fight.  Where I end up blaming her for things that I know are not her fault.

I was going to therapy for almost 2 years to try to figure this out, but I stopped - I thought it was doing more harm than good, when I would go there, and complain about her for an hour every week.  I would come out and I'd just resent her more than before I started the session.  As weird as it sounds, I didn't like going because my therapist sided with me too often.  He would tell me 'go out for the night' or 'make plans for the weekend' and then tell me to turn off my phone, and commit to the act of enjoying my time away.  And I don't think I could ever, in a million years, be able to do that.

EDIT 1: I don't like to edit things on Reddit, but so many comments had the same questions.  Unfortunately, I was limited to only a 3,000 character post, so I had to keep it as straight to-the-point as possible.  So to answer some of the common questions: 

1) I would not leave her.  And I probably miss-spoke.  I don't resent HER, I resent the situation. 

2) her condition is Hemicrania Continua:  [https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Hemicrania-Continua-Information-Page](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Hemicrania-Continua-Information-Page) 

3) She gets all the treatment she can.  She's seen countless professionals, and has tried everything from Botox, to Indomethacin, to Marijuana, to even clinical trials on microdosing with psychological drugs. She sees a neurologist at least 1x a week, and an out-of-state specialist 1x a month (she likes them the best). 

4) Even though my title says 'I don't care about her pain', I really mean 'I don't care at the level she wants me to'.  It's not like I look at her and think 'there's my burden' or 'there's the sofa accent that looks like a person'.  I still think of her as my wife whom I love very much and wish she was not sick. 

5)  I thought I made it very clear in my post that I know my own issues with the condition pale in comparison to what she's going through.  But, as someone below in the comments said ""Just because someone is sick, doesn't mean someone else can't feel burnt out from taking care of them'.  The 2 things are not mutually exclusive.",530,3768,0.96
118,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend is recovering from deppression, and to try and cheer him up (and also because I admittedly forgot that the day before had been our anniversary) I took him out for dinner. We went to a local restaurant that's typically really chill, and when we were seated, the waitress started out very kind. She seemed like she was in her 30's, and talked about her upcoming marriage, and was pretty nice. 

When she brought our drinks she started asking questions about us and when I told her we were celebrating our anniversary, she thought that I meant as friends (as in like since the first day we became friends), and after a quick correction she started having a fit about how ""it's disgusting that America has a system to let kids like us believe that a mental illness makes us special"" (paraphrasing a tad bit, she used a slur) and needless to say, the rest of the night wasn't very fun. I had to shout at the waitress about getting her manager so we could enjoy ourselves and after that, we had to deal with passive aggressive, rude, and ignorant behavior.

 When we were paying, I left a dollar for the tip, where it Should have been in the range of 8-9. I told my parents about it, and they thought that I was being an ass because this lady had her opinion and could be entitled to it. AITA?

119,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. English is not my native langauge, so please be considerate. 

My son will soon finish law school and we live in a country where depending on your grades and work experience from law school, you can get accepted as a law clerk at a court, wich is very prestigious. I myself am a lawyer and have worked as a lawyer for almost 30 years now. During my career I have built up a very large network wich I have used to give my son summer internship and such experiences on very well known law firms. My son has good grades and will be accepted to a Court as law clerk, but probably not the most prestigious one. 

During his first year in law school he worked at my law firm for 6 weeks, wich of course gave him a work certificate. Last week he asked me and told me if i could give him a work certificate wich said that he would have worked 12 weeks, when he actually did not do it. I told him that i would think about it. He told me that he fully understand if I would not want to give it to him and that I already have helped him so much, which he is very grateful for. The thing is, if I would give him this certificate, his chances of getting into the most presitigous court increase and he would have a good shot on getting accepted, wich would look very good on his resumé. 

I myself am pretty torn about this. I didnt have any help when I started my career and I worked my ass off, so basically it is the younger me hes competing against if you understand what i mean. I Think that it is very unfair toward people who had a similar backround like mine, who comes from a poor family. 

On the other hand, he is my son and of course I wish him all the best in his career.

121,Asshole,"This past weekend my wife and I went to a country concert and invited my friend and his girlfriend. Since it was an hour and a half drive to the venue I offered to drive. I paid for my tickets, gas, and all tolls. He only paid for his tickets. He asked we get there early to hang out with his cousin cause he set up a huge tailgate. I made it work to leave earlier even though he knew I had a lot going on that morning.

We get there and tailgate.. the show started around 7 so we all head in and the show was a blast. Before the headliner came on (who my wife has been dying to see, and the reason we got the tickets..). I get a phone call that his girl started throwing up and started crying because her father is ill. He demanded we leave the concert. I tried to buy time so my wife can see the artist.

She was able to see a few songs but she said that the concert was ruined for her.. we got to the car and the poor girl was out cold. I kept suggesting to let her relax and make sure she throws it all up before she gets in the car for an hour and a half... he kept insisting she did and she has nothing in her.

10 minutes into the ride she threw up all over the backseat of my car. She then threw up out the window.. but it got into the window track.

Now the artist is playing at MSG and my wife wants to go.. but tickets are 3x more expensive than the last concert (not my fault, the venue is more expensive and its the only other venue he's playing at in the area). Would it be messed up if I asked him to cough up the dough? My wife and I are really tight on the cash and saved up to get those tickets in the first place.. so I'm bummed.

TLDR: Went to a concert with a friend and his gf. She got drunk, started throwing up, friend demanded to leave because she was sad.

Edit: There may be some confusion: girl got sick from drinking too much. Her father was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with cancer.  She drank too much and got upset about the diagnosis.

123,Everyone Sucks,"A little bit of a background. I live in a high rise and pay $160 per month for 2 parking spots in the connected parking garage. I have adjoining spots which is incredibly rare in my building. I live by myself currently, and I have a wide truck that I currently park centered over the line on my double spot to leave room for the people's doors next to me.

The parking spot next to me is on the end of the row on a corner, which admittedly can get quite tight at times. They usually park close to the line on my side to give the drivers in the garage more room. Up until now I've been fine with giving them a little leeway, however we have never spoken.

Previously they have done little things that make me think they're a bit pretentious: They have left items in my spot that I have had to move out of the way in order to park. The drive the wrong way in the parking garage to get to their spot 5 seconds quicker. This past week It looks like they disabled the light above their spot due to the spider issue in our garage, and they put the cover pieces in my spot. Again, nothing too bothersome, just weird to me someone does stuff like that that.

Well last night this person apparently decides my spot is now their spot, and they park with more than 60% of their car over the dividing line between our two spots. It is so egregiously over the line, there is no way this is a simple mistake. It just so happens that last night I was planning on using both of my spots for the first time in quite a while. I get building security involved, and they contact the owner to get the car moved. It is now the next day and the car has not been moved yet.

I wanted to nip this in the bud, because I don't want anyone else to feel entitled to my spot. About an hour after I was told the owner had been contacted, I went down to move my car, and found the car still there. I was angry and feeling petty so I parked my car about 8 inches from their driver's side mirror, but I am still well within my own parking spots. I posted a picture of the car with the license plate obscured to our building's very active NextDoor page effectively saying ""whoever uses spot X please move your car, you are in my spot"".

If for some reason this continues past this evening I want to escalate. My building, per our bylaws, has to the right to impose fines to residents who do not abide by the rules, and I want to ask them to charge the offender the cost of my rent for the parking spot per day they have used it. It works out to about $2.50 per day. I have also been told that towing the offending car is an option as well, but I'll only use that as a last resort.

Once the car is moved, I will also start parking entirely in my spot directly next to them, regardless of if I will be parking two cars or not. I feel I need to set boundaries now, but AITA for taking it this far?",552,5259,0.97
124,Not the A-hole,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

128,Not the A-hole,"I have this American Girl doll from childhood, along with some furniture and clothing from the collection. (American Girl is a series of books featuring girls from different periods in American history, the dolls and accessories come from the books.) It’s been packed up in the back of a closet in the house I grew up in for years and I haven’t thought much about it. 

My sister has a 6 year old daughter who is into dolls and has several. She came across my boxes and decided the stuff was perfect for her daughter, and gave it all to her. She mentioned this to me after the fact, saying how much my niece loves it and thank you. 

I was pissed. For sure it’s not ok for my sister to give away my stuff, even if it’s been at our parents’ house for years. But beyond that, I don’t think I would have given the stuff to the kid if she had asked. That’s where I wonder if I’m being an asshole. 

These dolls were fairly expensive. I have a complete set of the accessories, as well as a boxed set of the books. This is one of the originals of a series that eventually got much bigger (Samantha). Aside from sentimental value, this stuff, which is in near mint condition, is worth several hundred dollars or more. 

ETA: these doll collections have sold for over $1,000 multiple times in the past 5 years. Some collections sold for $4,000. 

My niece, who already has several other kinds of  dolls with furniture and stuff of their own, is sure to break parts and lose pieces of my collection, just as she has with her own stuff. She’s not interested in the books. 

I will never have children of my own, which my mother brought up when I complained to her about the situation. I guess if there was a chance I’d pass the doll down to my own daughter my mother would feel differently. As it is, mom thinks sister was justified in taking the doll for niece. 

I am furious with my sister and mother. They both completely disregard my anger and now think I’m being an asshole because I won’t let it go. (This happened last week.) My sister said, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” but did not apologize for taking my stuff. 

I wasn’t going to ask for the things back, that would be unnecessarily unkind to the kid, but as the adults are acting like it’s no big deal and I’m a jerk, I’m feeling like maybe I should. 

Would I be a huge asshole if I took the stuff back now?     Am I an ass for being unwilling to give it away even if I’d been asked?


Edit To Add:  common points being brought up

This was a collector’s item for me when I received it in 1988, I didn’t play with it the way many would have. I was a fastidious child and preserved it well. I never brushed or unbraided the hair. 

My issue is not about the money, I bring that up only to emphasize that it’s not a toy meant for a child who will be rough with it. To have something so expensive was a big deal for me then. My gran bought these things for me knowing I could be trusted to care for them well. 

Also, thank you to AG owners and other collectors who understand why this is a big deal to me.  I appreciate your support.",303,772,0.96

130,No A-holes here,"My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this fall and has already starting looking at scholarships and planning out her admission essays. She has a Google Doc shared with me with potential scholarships and ideas for her essays. One of the essay prompts is the classic ""What's a challenge you faced in your life and how did you overcome it?"" For that her idea is to write about her deaf father, me.  

I've been deaf since birth. I have a cochlear implant that allows me to hear, but when I don't have my hearing aid (swimming, showering, any thing with water basically) or when the battery dies then I'm essentially completely deaf. I've had the C.I. for my daughter's whole life. Without it I can still read lips pretty well and know ASL. My daughter knows enough ASL to get by (basic words and the alphabet in case she needs to spell something she doesn't know the sign for)

132,No A-holes here,"I currently have a total beater of a car, a 90s station wagon, and I have my heart set on a two seater convertible as my next car.

I want it for a few reasons:

- I mainly parallel park, and a smaller car would be so much easier

- I get badly motion sick, but fresh air and wind help a lot, I don't get sick very easily driving convertibles

- I need something more reliable than my station wagon

- I miss driving stick, that's what I learned on and I find it more fun

- I've saved up for it for a very long time and I am finally ready to buy it, paid in full. So this isn't just a whim, I really had time to think this through

But my boyfriend doesn't like the idea. He has no car and for years I'd been sharing the station wagon with him. We have an agreement that we split the costs of the car (gas, maintenance, insurance) evenly. The car itself is paid off, and has been for a long time, so the day-to-day costs are low.

But he doesn't want me to change my car, and change the arrangement. He doesn't like driving stick, would rather drive a larger more comfortable car than a small sporty convertible, thinks it would be a pain to do road trips with less space in the car, etc.

He even offered to go halfsies on purchasing a gently used SUV or hatch back to share, and I didn't really want to because that's not the type of car I want to spend money on.

I know he's not ok with chipping in money for the new car and I'm fine with that, is something I've saved for myself and I have the savings to pay for it in full right now. 

But WIBTA for buting the car?

TLDR - I want to replace my 90s Subaru station wagon with a new Mazda convertible. My boyfriend and I share my Subaru and he is opposed to it.

----

Edit : Since a lot of you asked if I could give him the Subaru, I ought to explain why not..

- It's on its last legs and maintaining it is probably gonna get unreasonably expensive in the next few years

- BF and I share an apartment, with it we get one free street parking spot. To park a second car, we'd need to buy a spot in a garage or lot, and those go for 100-200 dollars a month around here

- BF would have to fully cover insurance / maintenance / registration / checkup costs, and that's out of his budget",45,31,0.91

Even when our whole friend group is going to the public pool that costs $5 to enter, RM says he can’t afford it, and and if asked if he really can’t spare $5, RM guilts everyone by saying something along the lines of ‘I’m sorry I don’t have the expendable income you all do’. 

But then suddenly last week he decides to spend $800 on a last minute trip to California to see a girl he met off tinder, to get laid. I know This, because he is, at the same time, seeing a few other women. RM even got one to drop him off at the airport!!

Their are smaller examples of similar behavior, but this the most he has just spent out of the blue.

Now he is saying that the places we are renting from and looking to rent, he can’t afford, and I keep biting my tongue on what he’s doing, but i feel like as a friend, I should be calling him on his BS so he hopefully sees it.

Next week, we are planning to attend a friend’s destination wedding. She is coming as my plus one. I booked us a room with 2 beds in the reserved block of the hotel. I thought since there were 2 separate beds it would be alright.

However, when I told her, she got upset with me and accused me of trying to get her to sleep with me. I said that’s not my intention at all. She said I should book another room for her or she is not going. She offered to pay for the extra room.

Unfortunately, the wedding planner told me that we would not be able to reserve more than 1 room in the block. Therefore my girlfriend has to book a more expensive room in the hotel.

I get 3 weeks vacation, they get 5 weeks, so that's an extra 160 hours a year, meaning I give all of my vacation back to the company and then some, so I refused to give that much time, explained that I already had limited time with my family, and they dropped it.

Then I got a new boss. She brought this back up, as well as staying over 3 times a week so I could make morning meetings that start at 9 and run until 10. That's an extra 3 hours a shift, 3 times a week, and I refused. She kept bringing it up, and said that it was necessary for me to talk about what happened on my shift. I said no, flat out.

The only person who knows about my financial situation is my father because honestly he's the only person I'm comfortable with him knowing. 

On our anniversary celebration, the subject of money somehow came up and my wife asked me how much was my monthly salary. I told her that nobody actually knows except my father and I wasn't really comfortable telling anyone else. I asked her if she needed something? she told me that she was just curious but she was upset that I told my dad and not her. 

The only reason I wouldn't really tell her is because that she's the kind of person who like to spend money on vacations and parties.

When this happened my girlfriend thought it was kinda creepy but took it as sort of a compliment. I on the other hand was kinda weirded out.

145,Not the A-hole,"Following is a rant about my problems with dad.
I want to apologize for my bad grammar i just dont care really lol.

So im a dude whos 20 now. When I was younger We always went traveling to new plces and countries every 2 or 3 years cuz my dad’s work. So i feel like that is part of why Ive felt like kind of a social outcast during my school years because of constantly being the ”new kid”, yeah ive had friends usually a close group. And my dad is a huge person, he looks very intimidating and is really strong, and I’ve never been physically hurt by him, but my childhood has been a constant walk on eggshells. So ive never really been a nuisance so much so that I constantly stressed about not being too loud, not being annoying as a kid, you know when you’re supposed to be loud and have fun. Let me tell you some some stories that I think sum it up pretty well, I was doing some math homework with him and obviously i was so stressed out that I couldn’t think, and he lost his temper and yelled at me because I couldn’t solve something like 26-7, I was in 3rd grade I think. Id be afraid of having friends over when my dad was home because obviously they wouldn’t have the same “walk on eggshells” worries in their head, making it much more likely he would lose his cool, and it happened a few times and he’d lash out at me cuz I was too loud. And the feeling when he would get home from work, hearing him enter the house was actually uncomfortable physically for my ear, and the whole vibe would sink and I’d feel like my freedom to move and do what i want disappeared. There’s a bunch more i would like to say but I’ve already said a lot.

So fast forward to today, he isn’t as adrenaline run as before and he’s trying to change. I went to another country with my family and he was still working for a few years, now he’s done and moved to the same country. He wants to hang out and have a father son relationship because he kinda realizes he’s been preoccupied with his career and I just don’t enjoy being around him, i get stressed and nervous, so am I the asshole for not wanting to spend time with him? Whenever he’s around he always has this attitude that he’s lonely and he loves us, yeah he always loved us and he claims he worked hard for us economically, but I just think that I don’t deserve to feel guilt or shame because it’s not my fault that I don’t enjoy spending time with him, its exhausting. I have the point of view that he has had the opportunity to have an impact on me mentally more than anyone else, besides my mom, and my feelings surrounding him are a result of that.
Just yesterday we watched a movie about sons avoiding their mothers and he said he is well accustomed to that in a half serious half joking manner. And the thing is I don’t want to talk to him about this stuff cuz I still fear him and I don’t want to make him feel like shit.

Yes I am very biased but I feel like I have the right to be because the majority of my relationship with him I’ve been a kid.",49,51,0.84

I assured her I was not going to, and that it was a 50/50 draw and not a 100/0 draw. I felt pretty Larry David about the whole thing, and may have laughed a little at her. Admittedly I shouldn’t have laughed at her and make a joke but I was quite taken aback and have a bad habit of laughing in uncomfortable situations.

In one of the most disgusting displays of gluttony I have ever seen a very morbidly obese woman filled 2 plates of food both stacked 12 inches high. It wasn’t healthy food either, she had pizzas cakes steaks and she even dipped potato wedges in the chocolate fountain. She must have had 2000 calories worth of food. She ate about 2/3 of it before running to the bathroom sharting herself as she ran. You could see the shit fall out of her shorts and onto the floor it was beyond disgusting. 

One of the customers threw up which created an even bigger mess we had to clean up. She cane out of the bathroom after a few minutes with a massive shit stain on her ass and sat back down and continued eating like nothing happened. I was beyond pissed off. I understand accidents happened but she showed no remorse or guilt over it and was sitting back down while we cleaned up her shit.

We've known eachother for almost 10 years now and now that we finally have a job, we can finally afford it. So I told my boyfriend about my plans. I even invited him on the trip, but he declined.

I was okay with it until she then about half a year later just sold them herself. That has happened a lot of times. She gets the toys I don't want, never actually plays with them since she's most of the times too old for them as well and then just sells them herself and gets the money.

I've talked to her and asked if we could split the money she makes with the toys but she said no. Her argument was that I gave it to her and that I didn't buy most of the toys myself but got them from my mom when I was younger. So with her logic she's not taking money from me but from my mom.

He packed up his things and left. This was because I had a job in town, and he was a seasonal worker and unemployed at the time and kind of a rolling stone in general. He went to stay with family.

Since then we have had to text a couple of times to iron out details on things. Bill paying and transferring services. He has tended to be curt and borderline rude. In my opinion this may be a part of him feeling hurt, or it may be part of him being a bit of an asshole in general. In any case, I don’t really want to interact with him.

I sucked it up last week and texted him, explaining I had found it and if he wanted me to mail it somewhere I’d be happy to. I told him that I hoped he was doing well.

She explained the female stalls are always full at lunch and she had to go.

As a result she was let go since people had made complaints against her in the past (not toilet related, presumably).

Basically, I've come out as non-binary to my family and friends, which has really rocked the boat, especially with my grandmother. Ever since then, she's been using my dead name to an almost insane degree. In my family, we rarely use our names, it's usually pet names (love, dear, pet, dove, etc) but now my grandmother is using my name with every single sentence she speaks in relation to me or at me. She knows that I now do not go by that name, but was willing to give people an adjustment period. My parents are telling me that changing my name is going a step too far, let alone my pronouns being changed. They say that they will support me through out whatever, but I will always be their daughter and that includes using my dead name. Out of all my immediate family, my brother and his girlfriend are the only ones who have made an effort to change and so far have an impeccable record of not messing up. Another issue is that my friend has started using my new name and pronouns, and when she told her mother about it, her mother (who really, really hates my guts) told her that basically I was lying and that I could still be referred as my dead name and by she/her pronouns. In fact, she encouraged it and told her that I would never be who I want to be because that's not what God wants for my soul.

I started the process of changing my name legally but now I'm beginning to doubt myself. I've started now not responding to my dead name, period. I ignore them until they use my new name. In relation to my friend, I now don't hang out with her when her mother's around because I can't stand her at all. I'm just not sure if I should stop the process and just say that using my dead name and dead pronouns is ok just to make things easier for everyone else or if I should just continue telling em that my dead name is not my name anymore, please use my actual name.

EDIT: I came out to my parents maybe 6 months ago, by telling them that now I go by my name.

I've been told I'm more like my grandad (75M, my dad's dad). Physically, I look more like my grandad, but personality wise, I guess I'm a bit more impulsive and hot headed and not as intelligent as my dad, but I get things done. Perhaps I'm more ''traditional masculine'' than my dad. Its like I should be in the older generation, and he should be from the newer one.

When I heard my Dad's business idea, I was amazed, but I didn't truly believe my Dad could pull it off. He doesn't get things done. He's always been full of great ideas, but ideas not put to use are useless. 

So I took the idea and ran with it. I got IP rights and started the business with it 2 years ago. Since then, its been a massive success. Not millions or anything, but into the six figures and the potential to make millions is there perhaps in the next half decade if things keep going well.

Her reasoning is that she wants to be able to talk to me and doesn’t like me being antisocial and that otherwise she always needs to knock (she won’t let me lock my door). I will admit, I usually would have my door closed most of the time but when I get home from school I just want to relax. I have trouble with my mental health (my mum knows about this, I go to therapy so she also knows I used to cut but she never did anything about it when she found out so it wouldn’t be about safety) and sometimes I just want to cry it out or even just lie by myself. Every time I lock it she gets mad and tells me to open it for some reason or another. This also means my 20yo brother comes wandering into my room touching my shit to annoy me and just stands there doing things to get on my nerves. Every time I get mad at him my mum says I can’t just be antisocial.

160,No A-holes here,"Context: I'm getting married in two weeks. My fiance has worked extremely hard planning this wedding. She is planning the majority of it, as well as paying for most of it as our families are not well off, and she's the breadwinner. It's a very important day for us. I understand something will always go wrong at a wedding, and it'll never be ""perfect"", but as long as it's with her I'll be happy. 

She gave me one task for the whole wedding: Make sure my groomsmen are matching. Simple enough. I found some slacks online for 40 bucks and told my groomsmen they could wear whatever they want for a shirt, but the pants must all be the same color. I sent the link to them for the pants 5 months ago and it seemed everything was in order.

I just got a message from one of them saying he blew it, and he ""wished"" he'd  had an excuse, and he needs the link for the pants again. That's fine, but then he messages again saying he already has pants of that color anyways and he'll just wear those. I tell him as long as they're the EXACT same color, and to check with another one of the groomsmen who lives near him to see if they match. He responds jokingly, and now I'm concerned that he's gonna show up to the wedding in completely off-colored pants. If that is the case, I don't even want him up there. He was already extremely difficult during the bachelor party, and generally had a bad attitude because I didn't want to order strippers. He is my longest childhood friend, and it'd suck for him not to be up there with me, but his selfish behavior has only gotten worse as we grow older. I didn't think asking him to be a groomsman would be a tall order, in fact I thought it'd be an honor, but maybe I'm being ridiculous.

162,Not the A-hole,"So I have been away for like a week. And I’m about to get back to my house with my 6 month old baby.

Bit of back story so you can maybe see where my mind is at when I decided to message about it. 
We have been living together since April. 
In February I asked them both to get their flu shot so they can live in the same house as a baby . 
They agreed but she “hasn’t found the time” because she’s afraid of needles but didn’t tell me that until 27th of June. 
So I feel like she doesn’t give two craps about if my baby or anyone else gets sick. 
I don’t expect her to feel like she has responsibilities for if everyone gets sick or not but the doctors ask that anyone who is living with a baby should help out by getting the flu shot up to date so that the baby doesn’t get sick. I even said I would pay for it since I’m pretty sure it’s not covered in Medicare or whatever. 
So anyway.. 

Now she has gastro so I was like okay she’s probably touched everything before she realised she was sick? and So i messaged and asked if she could stay at her parents house (where she spends most of her week anyway because she hates my parents and I) until she gets better, (probably an asshole for that one but I’m so worried about my baby and this is my first child so I don’t know if I’m being too cautious or not all I am thinking about it gastro for baby could easily mean death.)
Or if she can get my brother to wipe over all the handles that could have been touched and spray glen20 around to make it easier for me, in trying to make sure my baby doesn’t get sick. 
(I don’t think this is an asshole one)

If you don’t know, if babies (or anyone) get gastro they can get easily dehydrated and for a baby that can be fatal so fast.

So I had also said to them that I’m sorry if I seem like a bitch, I’m just worried, I’m not trying to be rude

164,Not the A-hole,"Background here, I am a stay at home mother of 3 kids, 8F, 6F and 2M, we have 2 cats too. I take care of the kids, cats and the house while my husband works. Despite the number of members our home environment is quite peaceful and neat. 


My kids are very well behaved. My eldest daughter helps me out with simple chores and looks after my youngest son when I am not looking. My middle daughter is very bubbly and loves sharing with her toys and she tidy her things up after playing. My youngest son seldom make a fuss and gets along well with his sisters. Our relatives and friends always praise how well behaved the kids are and I am very proud of them.


There came a day a while ago when a friend asked me out to talk about my secret for raising such wonderful children, as she is pregnant with her first child.


Honestly, I had no idea what to say. I mean, it was actually pretty straightforward and smooth for me, there was no ""secret"" nor much hardship, really. I don't even feel it, despite many would say raising children can be a new type of hell. Maybe I am just blessed with good children. 


Then I thought about my cats and then tried to explain to my friend that raising kids is similar to having pets. You feed them, you clean them, you spend time with them, you train them etc. And they will learn to respect and love you. And when they do, your life becomes much easier. It really isn't that complicated.


It sounded rather silly, I know, but that was all I could come up with at that moment. To my surprise, my friend became angry and said that what I said was demeaning to children, that they are not pets and I should never raise them like pets.


My friend forgave me after I apologised, but I only did because she was upset and I didn't want to lose my friend. She wanted to know how I raised my kids, I told her how. I wasn't trying to insult my own kids but that's how I raised them in all honesty, and it turned out well. AITA though?",457,1905,0.94

He is currently attending an abuser/batterer intervention program on his own accord and I am maintaining a watchful eye from a distance. The program is supposedly run very strictly and he's been regularly attending. They are supposed to call me weekly on progress but only did the first day, first red flag. I saw a couple others when he seemed to be enjoying going and seemed to be in a better mood afterwards. He also mentioned talking to the coordinator and she even gave him the number of her personal therapist. That did NOT sound right at all to me. The first two sessions he told me everything that happened, but started hiding things and got defensive when I started questioning.

Today after a fairly non-eventful day, we were talking about home improvements and a project we were considering. He then said nonchalantly that there was a guy in his program that was a contractor and basically suggested that we hire him. I've never heard of this guy previously.

I felt like I got punched in the gut. He saw my face and added some BS about how he really needs a job and is having car trouble so he can't get one or whatever but I didn't really hear much.

I just sat in shocked silence for a good while before telling him to leave. He didn't seem to get it and had this patronizing tone of voice. I need to know if IATA here for getting so upset. I think I'm angry because 1) how inappropriate to try to make personal friendships within the program and I'm pretty sure that's not allowed, 2) he wants to get to know people like this in his personal life??? and bring them into our home and around me, like what the fuck??? he's told me things about how these guys are mostly court-ordered and done terrible things so again, what the fuck???? and 3) I feel somehow like he's sided with them and not me, like this is somehow enabling him even more, and I feel like I was right about him hiding something.

They arrived at 6:30, brother says happy birthday I say thanks how are you guys doing, he answers and she doesn’t say anything and gets her phone out snd holds it in front of her face. 

We’re sitting out on the patio, BBQ going and dogs playing until they notice new guests so they come over to say hi, my dogs are extremely friendly & love people so they will come over to new people and stand near them looking up to be patted and said hello to, so my brother always gives them a pat and they’re satisfied and get back to playing but his GF pushes them away! 

So OK maybe she’s just washed her hands or something but to push them away was a little hard since they aren’t demanding they’re just standing near her. So we get back on with chatting and she’s still on her phone and the dogs come over every so often and stand near her and she continues pushing them away and it’s becoming more & more aggressive in manner so I stood up and took them inside to give them some treats. 

I Went back outside took my seat again and watched, my oldest girl 8 year old Border Collie went and stood next to brothers GF again but this time she was looking at my brother when suddenly I saw his GFs arm stretch out and push my dogs muzzle aggressively even wrapping her hand around her muzzle and pushing so I stood up & told her to never touch my dogs in that manner ever again, she got in a mood and left expecting my brother to run after her like she was a toddler running off, and the idiot did. 

It brought everyone’s mood down a bit but everyone agreed I was right, my other brothers GF who is painfully shy even spoke up saying that she saw her do it too so we checked our CCTV because I wanted t make sure I wasn’t over reacting and clear as day exactly as I described.

169,Not the A-hole,"I'll save the sob story, but basically my dad left before I was even born, so he was only briefly in my brother's life as he was a baby. Neither of us really knew him. My bio-mom quickly descended into drug abuse and me and my brother were taken into state custody at 3 and 4. She died not too long after. 

I was lucky, and was taken in (and eventually adopted) by an amazingly supportive family. I  had an amazing childhood. We weren't particularly wealthy or anything extraordinary in that regard, but I was well loved and very much cared for. I eventually went to my dream school and go an amazing job that I love and I live a pretty good life. Still, I am in therapy and have some residual issues that I am actively working on. However, I am mostly always incredibly grateful for the life I get to live, all things considered. 

My brother was taken in by a family I know little about, but from what I have gathered, they were some pretty vile people.   I kinda knew this growing up because they barred me from seeing my brother, no matter how much my parents begged for me to have a relationship them. 

He recently found me and reached out on social media. I have no clue how he did this-- I have a generic name and I changed my last name once to my family's (generic) last name when I was adopted and then again recently to my now husband's last name (which happens to also be generic). I cannot figured out how he did it... which wouldn't strike me as immediately creepy, but it does now considering his behavior. 

Anyway... we lived about four hours apart and I thought it would be nice to reconnect and catch up. Within five minutes of meeting him, he had said the n-word loudly at a table as a ""joke,"" insulted my husband as a ""joke,"" and stared at our waitresses breasts in a very obvious and uncomfortable way. He's just awful. The whole night he talked only about himself and how terrible everything is in his life (which i would understand if he showed any sort of self-reflexivity) and how horrible everyone else is. 

Since our meeting all he has done is ask me for $4k or to live in my guest bedroom, help him get a job at my company (he has no degree or experience in the field), and continue to say inappropriate things to me and my husband. He's also friended lots of my close friends and family indicating that he is my brother (and only real ""BLOOD"" relative) and his facebook is quite frankly a disaster. It's clear he is mentally unstable, but that is no excuse for his behavior. He tells me he needs me in his life as he has nothing. I do not want to be at all. I don't like him. He's cruel. I also feel like he is using me...

Would I be the asshole if I cut him off and did not continue to rebuild the relationship? He said his family never technically adopted him and so when he turned 18 he was pretty much on his own. I would feel really bad abandoning him, but he is making my life increasingly difficult.",30,50,0.93
170,Asshole,"In the moment, I already knew it wasn't an appropriate reaction, but I'm starting to worry it might properly be an assholish reaction.

&#x200B;

So, yesterday, I was on an hour-long flight, as the final part of a day-long journey. And on this flight, a person died. I won't say I ""discovered"" him, but I was the one to figure out that he'd passed on.

About twenty minutes into the flight, I noticed a hunched-over old guy (eighties, maybe) heading to the bathroom; his hand opposite to me wasn't fully visible, but I think he was holding his hand against his chest or something. Definitely something to notice, but it was a half-distracted glance before resuming what I was doing.

I needed to use the bathroom, so I kept an eye on it to see when he'd come out. There was another bathroom on the plane, but it was on the other end and much more of a hassle than waiting a few minutes for him to finish up.

After something like ten minutes elapsed, I started to get a bad feeling. I quietly got the attention of a flight attendant and explained seeing an elder gentlemen who seemed to be holding his heart had gone into the bathroom ten minutes ago and hadn't come out.

I didn't see all of what happened, as the second flight attendant was (perhaps deliberately) blocking the view to the bathroom, but there was a page for medical personnel and the bathroom remained out of order for the rest of the flight. And the guy never resumed his seat, made all the more obvious by the fact this was a fully-filled flight with a now-empty aisle seat.

And as horrible as it is, I admittedly became angry at his death. It's so utterly stupid, but I kind of felt like he screwed all of us. Had he told a flight attendant as *soon* as he felt unwell, we could have turned around and maybe had a thirty minute delay and given him the medical attention needed. Instead, there was this eerie realization that someone had died filling the plane. All of us on this flight had to deal with his death. Just because he couldn't be bothered to take care of his health issues.

And it's fucking stupid and dumb I know. It was probably inevitable and he probably didn't even realize the gravity of the situation. But I'm still angry.

Maybe it's because I've lived in an area where people commonly use public transit to off themselves that I'm feeling this. Maybe it's my thing against preventably inconvenient deaths developed by this trend. I don't know.

I don't know if I'm the asshole here, and it's eating me up because I don't even want to talk about this until I figure out how people will read my reaction.

So, reddit, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit for clarification, since it has been brought up: I've never expressed any of this to anyone, nor did I speak to anyone on the plane about the way I was feeling. The only people who know about my thoughts regarding this are myself and the people who have read this post.

Edit 2: I hope this doesn't count as not accepting my judgement, but I want to make it clear I've heard all of you guys who have said I'm the asshole. And I understand it. I'm currently in the process of seeking out a therapist to work through the way I reacted/felt; I've come to realize it's anger at myself that I'm unfairly directing at the deceased. 

And since it's pretty clear that this will ultimately end with a YTA mark, I want to ask people to just upvote the top comment instead of reiterating how much of a terrible person I am. It'll probably prove that I'm a horrible, selfish person, but some of the comments are a bit extreme and now that the emotions are mellowing from the experience, it's honestly fucking with me to get a inbox full of insults and unfair assumptions. My brain chose the wrong emotion and I fucked up; I get it.",104,153,0.81
171,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a pool manager at a local pool. Basically all I do is make schedules, do maintenance, and make sure the pool is at the right chemical balance it should be. Many of my lifeguards are my close friends, which leads to the issue. The pool we work at has a small pond out in the back that I’ve never seen but the two friends I was working with are both fishing hobbyists and wanted to go check it out. The pool was getting slower so I told them they could go check it out on their break. Later, I saw them go back to their car and grab fishing poles and then disappear for about a half hour fishing at the pond. They didn’t ask me if they could go fishing, I only gave them permission to check it out and then they went to their car and went fishing without talking to me. Eventually, they were gone for long enough to be late for their return to work and so I clocked them out, called the higher ups, and they told me to send them home. They actually wanted to fire them on the spot but I told them not to. So they were written up and sent home for the night. After work all of our mutual friends who don’t work at the pool began private messaging me and blowing me up in our group chat harassing me for sending them home, to the point where I had to leave our group chat and turn off notifications. There’s a large festival going on locally right now that I didn’t go to because they were saying that they didn’t want to see me there, so now I’m out the approximate $150 for the ticket. I just want to know if I’m in the right here.

EDIT: I would like to add that this wasn’t the first time they’d been fucking off all day.

172,Asshole,"Long story short my Girlfriend is a very proud woman and prides herself on not ""relying on no man"" she was raised by a single mother who went through their share of struggles and she still sometimes supports her mom though hard times. My girlfriend is a teacher, and makes about $35k a year. So not much, and money gets tight for her sometimes and that's ok.

I do decently well for myself I typically make $95k-$105k in a fairly low COL area) so I'm not super rich, but I can afford to do stuff here and there.

My girlfriend has $5 in her bank account as of Friday, her fridge is empty, and she has 10 days till payday (only gets paid once a month) so I offered her some money, I said look I don't mind giving you money to get you through till payday. She said she didn't want no hand outs. I said fine, lets call it a loan, she said ""I don't want to go into debt"" I said ""I don't really care if you ever pay me back...like ever but I don't want my girlfriend starving herself because she's broke and doesn't have enough money to feed herself when I got plenty"" she said ""Stop it I'll survive""

Fine, so we went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. And on the toilet seat I came up with a brilliant idea. I'd stuff whatever I had in my wallet into her purse. In the morning she'll find it and I'll just play stupid if she accuses me of putting the money in there.

So I had $80 in my wallet, I stuffed the $80 in her purse and went to bed. Wake up to go to work, got ready, kissed her good bye, and said I love you and left. She had the day off, about 4 hours later I get a call from her asking me if I know how the $80 got into her purse.

So cue part 2 of my plan, I play stupid and say ""nope, no idea today must be your lucky day, maybe you forget about it?"" well she's not an idiot, and accused me of putting the money in her purse. I stuck to my story, but eventually caved and told her I did, and she should use that $80 to take care of herself, make sure she can eat, and any other thing she needed and if she needed more I'd be willing to help.

So this resulted in her getting really mad at me, and calling me an asshole for taking away her independence. In my honest opinion, couples should support each other. She supports me, I support her. This is how relationships work right? Sometimes that support is emotional, sometimes its physical, sometimes that support is financial. In this case, that support was financial.

So am I the asshole for stuffing $80 in my girlfriend purse after being told not to give her any money

174,Everyone Sucks,"So before I even get into it, I wanna preface this by saying I have always considered myself TA in this situation. However, I recently remembered this event and thought I’d get a second opinion. 

Also sorry for formatting, and English isn’t my first language. 

This happened about 3 years ago so I was 16F at the time. My mom had been friends with our neighbor Ann for a couple of years, and since she lived a couple houses down she would visit frequently. Before this event I had a couple encounters with Ann, and she always made me uncomfortable because she was constantly talking about weight loss and dieting. 

Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to lose weight. However, Ann would always be talking about 30 day cleanses where she would do nothing but drink water with lemon and Kayan pepper. Essentially starving herself. When she wasn’t on her cleanse she was mostly eating unhealthy foods so her weight would constantly fluctuate. She would swear by this method, and would also brag about how she had been doing this for 15+ years. 

She was also always trying to convince my mom and I to try this ‘diet’. I particularly remember one time when I was 14 she took me out to dinner, and told me that I should attempt this diet(because like most girls at that age I was self conscious of my body and wanted to lose weight). She described it to me in great detail, and bragged about how she had been skinnier than most girls(with the implication that she was skinner than me at my age) while she was in school. 

This actually led to me trying to restrict what I was eating, but I’ve always loved food so I wasn’t super successful(luckily). Fast forward 2 years, I had started working out and actually improving my body in a healthy way. So one evening my mom invites her over for dinner, and once again she’s going on and on about her cleanse. So I told her that her method was extremely unhealthy, and would mostly lead to loss of muscle and water weight. I explained that eating healthier and working out would be a lot more beneficial in the long run. 

She started getting pretty angry at what I was saying, and began to argue that she was healthy and her diet has worked her whole life. This is the part where I’m most likely TA. I started getting pretty worked up, and in the heat of the moment I reached over and squeezed her arm fat between my fingers. This was a gentle squeeze, but it pretty much highlighted the point I was making about loss of muscle. She got extremely upset, and I ended up leaving dinner early. 

I know I’m probably TA in this situation, and I’ve always felt bad about how I handled things. I would never do something like this now, but I thought I’d put this out there and get some outside opinions.",94,469,0.92

So this summer I drive home inorder to bring my dog to college, otherwise I would have flown. When I get home my dad told me I could not have my dog. He claims that the dog would be upset with out the other dogs and even said that the dog would probably be dead in 6 months. He even said if I try to take the dog without his permission, he will call the police.

I argue that the dog was my 14th birthday present and I'm not just taking him to take him, but because he was the only thing that helped me through highschool and I feel he will help me at college. My dad agrees to think about letting me have the dog.

Two days before I'm supposed to leave I asked if I could have the dog, my dad said no. I got all upset and told my mom that I was going to leave a day early, because I felt as though my dad cared more about keeping the dog than about me.

I still ended up leaving a day early because my dad is known for changing his mind very quick, and I didn't want to give him the chance.

179,Asshole,"Alright, so the party was yesterday.

He works for a tech startup, it's doing well and has around 80 employees. It's a very informal place, they've got beer on tap in the office, it's got a lot of female employees. Very liberal place.

So the party was also a very informal event, they wanted a big bash for raising their Series B funding, so they hired a DJ, rented out an awsome venue, lots and lots of alcohol.

They were also told to bring friends, as many as they liked.

&#x200B;

Anyway, from everything they described, it seemed like it was going to be wild. So I asked my husband, if I could sort of wear a similar outfit to what I usually wear at festivals.

It's a very cheeky bikini bottom, bikini top, fishnet jeweled top, hat, colored sunglasses, stockings. Very cool and not too inappropriate since I figured a big party that's expecting \~500 people under 35,with one of the biggest DJ's, would have many women dressed like this.

&#x200B;

Apparently, though the dress code stated beachwear, most people were in casual clothes and I was one of maybe 30-50 women baring midriff, and the only one showing booty. My husband didn't mind and was proud, introduced to me to everyone, including his boss etc.

&#x200B;

However, today he got an email from lady in HR saying, while they applaud my confidence, they'd rather I tone it down at a company-sponsored event where the media and investors were.

What probably made it worse for him and well me, was that my husband is best friends with the company's CTO and we hung out with him all evening and night. However, many many investors and other important folks came to meet with him and would have seen me hanging out in their group.

&#x200B;

My husband, isn't feeling bad, he's handling it well. He replied, saying that his wife (me) is accustomed to wearing this attire at pool parties and was sort of led to believe (by him) that was going to be a big summer bash given the DJ, venue and hype. He apologized and said he'd rather she tell him upfront so that I could have gone home to change or cover up with something so that it would have limited any embarrassment.

&#x200B;

It was my choice to wear this, and I do feel awful, but I don't think I was wrong or an asshole to wear what I did. They told everyone bring friends, it's going to wet and wild etc. It's a startup not a Fortune 500 company.

Earlier this week she invited the neighbor's daughter to go camping with her, then rushed over to complain how she didn't want to take her with. I told her just tell the girl they'd have to do it another time. Aunt didn't listen.

Well tonight my dad rented a movie we've both been wanting to see, we put it on and sit down to our usual late dinner, low and behold aunt shows up at our door. She immediately starts in about the neighbor giving her trouble and her voice keeps rising. I asked dad to pause the movie, and she is still getting louder.

I had enough. I put my hand up and she stopped and said ""I know I'm loud.""
I said ""Aunt I'm gonna stop you there. We just sat down to dinner and the movie.""

181,Asshole,"Basically our class has a bunch of seniors nominated for awards and from now to the 10th, we essentially vote who we think would win. It’s stupid and at any given time, every student knows who’s in first and it’s basically a glorified popularity contest. 

Well there’s this one girl, Beth. We were great friends in 6th grade and I trusted her with all of my secrets. In 7th, she found this new clique who didn’t like me (I’m the only black kid in my white surburban upper-middle class white school), so she essentially traded me for them. 

I have so many stories about how big of a POS she turned out to be, but the two that comes to my mind is that we planned to go to this school dance, and she told me the night of that “she’s not feeling well” before 4 hours later, I saw pictures of her on Instagram at the party. The final straw came when I confronted her with her flakiness via text and she said “nobody likes you, not even your dad. That’s why he left, now leave me alone” for no other reason but to hurt me, because she knew that’s why I was going through a bad depression at the time. She’s the reason why I have trust issues to this day. 

Since then, I wanted nothing to do with her. In 10 grade, she tried to apologize but essentially told her to get fucked. Now, I see her name as the clear winner right now and I want so badly to know that she’s not the saint that everyone thinks she is, and post screenshots of the shit she said to me on Twitter.

184,Asshole,"So I mostly have two friend groups, both of which don’t really know each other. I go out with both a lot, including drinking and general hanging out.

Friend group A always asks each other if they want a ride home, whenever we are going the same direction or even if we know someone else doesn’t have a car or can’t drive. This happens if there was a party or not.

A while ago I hung out with friend group B, and after a night of catching up/drinking after not seeing each other for months, both I (F, 21) and the rest of my friends except for my closest friend at this party (Lets call her Becky, also 21) were drinking. Becky was driving 25+ minutes to this party, and since she was the only one living outside of walking distance she decided to stay sober. When the party was over she, another friend, and I all walked out of the party together. The second friend lived in the direction of Becky’s car while I lived in the opposite direction. I asked if I walked with them to Becky’s car could Becky drive me home. Keep in mind that this area has a high homeless population and we get texts from the police department often about stabbings/mugging at gunpoint. I also lived about a 5 min drive from her car and 5 min from the freeway entrance that she needed to take anyways.

Obviously, Becky refused to drive me. This wasn’t the first time she didn’t want to walk home together or showed a lack of concern about how I’d get home. I fully get it’s her car and Uber is an option, but since the distance was so short I felt resentment towards her flippant attitude.

Am I the asshole for feeling this way? Was I just spoiled from Friend Group A’s constant making sure that everyone got home safe? I haven’t said anything to Becky because I feel like I am the asshole here (especially since it’s not her fault that she can’t be drinking while the rest of us can) but there’s still a little part of me that’s unhappy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for showing me a different perspective. I didn’t really see things from her point of view, and I should have asked her far in advance and looked up bus schedules back before I left.

To the people saying I must have angered her in some way to make her refuse, I am fairly sure this isn’t the case. We’ve known each other for 8 years now (very good friends for 4), was roommates for a year, and in fact hanging out again in a few days. When she refused she also didn’t say flat out no or give a reason, but hemmed and hawed until I could feel that she really wanted to say no. 

If this was a person I didn’t know so well I wouldn’t have felt hurt, or probably have asked for a ride at all, but because I consider us close I guess I left my manners behind and didn’t stop and think things through. It was late and she was probably just as tired, plus probably a little unhappy that she had to be the sober one while the rest of us drank. Next time I’ll definitely ask beforehand or just leave the party earlier.",39,84,0.89

187,No A-holes here,"Good Evening Reddit,

I'll keep this relatively short but here's a little backstory... My wife's brother died extremely suddenly at the young age of 23 from a brain aneurysm. My wife and her brother were very close and this event still brings tears to her eyes any time she remembers it, even now, almost 5 years later.
The only silver lining (however horrible it is to say) is that the brother had a life insurance policy taken out on him by his mother who happened to be an insurance agent. 
After his death, they received roughly 300k and paid for the funeral expenses and a few hospital bills.
They also bought new cars for themselves, paid off their school loans, and paid off their house. None of which is necessarily nefarious. 
They also paid off my wife's high interest school loans which were around 15k. Which they now expect to be paid back to them.
Now I do understand that it was ""their"" money, but I was quite upset that they expected us to pay this back. We too are quite young and just getting started with our lives. This keeps bringing about arguments any time we talk about it. I get that we would have had to pay this back anyway but I feel that this wouldn't have been what her brother wanted?
I'll also add that they blew through all the money in less than a year, nothing went to investments, retirement, etc.
So am I just a dick? WYT?

EDIT: Since so many people are now asking, no there were no ""specific terms"" on it being paid back. It was all done very early on. Lots of tears and drama so to speak. I feel that they want it paid back now because they blew through everything so quickly. Or at least that's how I see it :/

EDIT 2: Also, we have been paying it back. About 3k so far, I just disagree with it every time it's brought up. So it's not like I'm REFUSING or anything.",37,32,0.98

190,Not the A-hole,"We had some people over for a movie night. I had ordered pizzas and the total came out to $30. I was running around doing a bunch of stuff, so I asked one of my friends to answer the door and give the money to a delivery driver. I handed her a $50 and said to give a tip, but to get change back. While I was getting the movie and drinks ready, the doorbell rang. I didn’t hear all of what was going on. I went to go get the pizzas and asked the friend I gave my money to, “Where’s the change?”

She replied, “Oh, your son wanted to answer it, so I let him.”

Now, my son is 8. I asked him and he said that he had just given the money my friend had given him. I asked about change, he looked confused. Okay, so that pizza guy just got a huge tip. I called the pizza place and explained the situation. I asked if the guy could come back so I could get the proper change. The pizza guy returned, I apologized and explained. He was okay with it and understood, he said he thought it was weird himself getting a $20 tip on that order. I did give him 20% on the order and he was fine with that, leaving.

My friend said that I should’ve just let it go and that it was a dick move to have him come back like that, the mistake was her fault and not his. She said he was probably excited to get such a big tip and I stole it away.

191,No A-holes here,"So my friends and are are headed on a seven hour road trip to visit another friend of ours who moved away after graduation. We’ve decided on taking my car because out of the four of us only two of us don’t borrow cars from our parents and my friend recently popped her tire and can’t afford to fix it yet. 

This is no big deal, sure my car is second hand but i keep it up as well as i can, recently got it fixed up plus i have road side assistance. 

Let’s call this next person friend A

Friend A random sends a message to our group chat today interrogating me about my tires asking how good are they and “if it rains will we hydroplane?” and like “can we hit potholes” and i reply, no, common sense would be to avoid potholes but it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we hit one or two on the way. Yet, she continues to make comments which leads to send a long message explain that my tires are fine if they weren’t i wouldn’t have offered my car and that if she had a problem she can help us pull another car out of my ass. (paraphrasing) 

Next i ask what time we wanted to leave it being a seven hour drive i imagined leaving in the morning but not too early because said friend we are visiting is working the day we drive up and doesn’t get off until 9:30pm so we’d be on our own until then. Friend A suggests 7am so we can get there for roughly 3pm. now, we have no schedule our friend is working til 9:30pm why the hell would we leave at the ass crack of dawn to drive for seven hours. 

I tell friend A that that is quite early, how about 9? well make it there for supper. She complains saying that we’ll have more time to explore and avoid traffic if we leave at seven but we will still have time to “explore” if we get there at 5 and even if traffic is so bad we not there till later than that we probably won’t want “to explore” well probably want “to nap”. I say we’re in no rush so i don’t mind hitting some traffic and she proceeds to say things like “yeah i can tell” and “whatever”. 

Am i really such an asshole for wanting to sleep in a couple hours before a 7 hour road trip? i don’t want to be cranky and want to be able to be rested enough to properly drive plus it’s my car and our friend will be working when we arrive.

EDIT: I’ve been working on a some what apologetic message to send to her but i was wondering if i could get some advice, i’ve edited the first half out because it has locations and names 

I don’t want to start anything, that was never my intention. however i will admit although it feels childish i’m actually hurt by the way you talked to me about the leaving time. I understand wanting to leave early and have time to look around once we get there but exploring is what we’re doing the whole weekend we’re there and we are literally on no schedule, our friend is working until 9:30pm and we aren’t even stopping that often because apparently it’s not actually a sightseeing road trip. from my point of view i would have to be leaving earlier than everyone anyways because in my mind i was picking people up and such. even if we did hit traffic which we most likely wouldn’t because we’re not going into the city it wouldn’t be the end of the world because we aren’t on any schedule. I guess i’m just not clear on what the big rush is and i’m sorry i don’t understand.",36,40,0.83

My wife and I have two young kids, both younger than 3 years old. I work Monday through Friday and often Saturday as well, and she manages a bar and works weekends, including Sundays.

At this point I'll say that I love to watch football (NFL). It's what I look forward to every week and it's been that way for years.  I am heavily involved in fantasy football with a league that's been around for a decade, and it can get very competitive and intense. It is a paid league, so there is money on the line.

We recently got into an argument. I can't do the one thing I look forward to every week (for only a few months per year) because she works literally every Sunday and I'm in charge of the kids all day through the evening. I suggested that she should hire somebody so she can take Sundays off, but she doesn't agree.

AITA for asking her to shift her schedule around just for a few months during the year so I can enjoy the games?

My wife is 26, we've been married for 5 years and have a great and fun marriage. Her ""free pass"" has always been John Krasinski  which I always thought was kind of a fun little joke between but after the way she's been acting since yesterday I'm starting to think she might be serious. 

So here's how it went down. We were out and I ran into JK (just because I don't want to type Krasinksi out again) outside a men's room. It was one of those ""wow"" moments because it was really him. I sort of gave him a nod and turned around to make sure it was him and another woman came up to him and asked for a picture and he told her bluntly but politely that he was there with his wife and had promised her he was like 100% hers that day. The girl was like ""oh my god that's so sweet, nice to meet you anyways."" So when I got back to where we were sitting I told my wife ""you aren't going to believe this but JK is here."" She was totally hung over but she like instantly had a shot of coke and perked up. She spotted where he was and was like ""oh my god it's really him, of course he's with the hottest woman ever."" I was like ""yeah babe, they've been married for like 20 years."" She replied with ""I know, stupid."" I was like wow...  She grabbed her phone and tried to run over and grab a pic with him. 

I was like no, no, no I just heard him say that he didn't want to take any pictures. She said she didn't care. I grabbed the back of her dress and sort of guided her back to sitting down. I told her what he had just said by the bathroom. She didn't want to believe me and then accused me of asking for the picture and ""ruining it for her."" I told her that actually no a more rational and sane woman had asked for the picture and JK had politely shut her down. My wife snapped at me and told me  ""that bitch obviously wasn't a big a fan I am."" I begged her to at least calm down and we'll wait until JK and his wife are outside and we'll try to politely catch them on the street. My wife got all pouty and put her sunglasses on as I guess her hangover had caught back up to her. Our server came over and asked for our order and in that time JK and his wife had left. Wife went sprinting out of the restaurant with her phone but came back sulking so I guess she didn't find him. 

My wife is pissed, like sulking like a 4 year old and while I thought maybe it was like a ""fun"" thing...it's not. She's legitimately mad. I'm sure she'll eventually get past it but right now is the most awkward time I've ever spent with her.

SIL1 said that my daughter had to get used to doing what other people wanted. I said yeah, but she did that today, can’t we compromise? Eventually, SIL1 said she felt “ganged up on” and agreed that we could do a couple of museums for my daughter. Now, she’s pissed. 

SIL1, for the record, has no kids and is childfree.

Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

My wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.

First off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. With her medical problems, Sarah will probably be infertile herself, which I think puts her on par on that point. Secondly, Sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. I don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem.

Apparently, they didn't have whole wheat crust at my local PizzaPizza, and they called my phone.  My phone was on silent, and I didn't hear the call. They left a message describing the whole wheat crust. I called their phone number and was on hold for about five minutes between speaking with someone in a call office, who told me that he couldn't even get into contact with my local shop, but would inform them that I was willing to accept regular crust.   At this point, I looked at the time and it had been nearly 35 minutes since I placed my order.

After about 4 or 5 minutes, he came back on the line and said the order would be free, and mumbled something in broken English about tipping the driver.

Pizza didn't arrive until 5:11PM.  When I opened the door, the delivery driver asked me how I would like to pay, and tried to hand me his POS terminal to swipe a card.

1. when I ordered I explicitly stated I would be paying in cash.
2. I was told I wasn't going to be paying.

I explained to him that I had spoken to a guy on the phone who told me the order was free.  The delivery guy tried to explain to me that the order was reset when I called back, but I said that I have an order confirmation that says 3:54PM and it should be free.  I then told him he's still getting his tip, and he handed over the pizza for free. I told him to tell his people that they wouldn't be getting my service again, because I was furious that I had to wait and hour and fifteen minutes for dinner. 

And to top it all off, they fucked up my order and gave me the wrong soda.

206,Everyone Sucks,"My brother is one year older than me, and has recently started making aggressive comments about the way I dress (saying I wear ""skimpy"" clothing or straight up calling me a hoe) for little to no reason. I have no idea what caused this recent uptick in these type of remarks and there's often no provocation on my end, he just gets triggered randomly when I'm wearing short shorts or a more revealing top. Today I came back from a shopping trip with my mom and as I'm walking upstairs to my room, he just starts again, calling me another ""basic girl"" and questioning what I'm wearing. I don't know what it was about today but I just snapped, telling him off and mentioning his micropenis and asking him what he would feel if I called him ""shrimpy."" The argument escalated, and it just devolved into back and forth insults from there. Now he acts as if I'd dealt him some sort of death blow and has been fuming all day. In retrospect, this was a bit harsh and may of seemed like it came out of nowhere, but the abuse from his side has literally been happening for MONTHS. Shouldn't it be acceptable that he be able to take insults as much as he can dish them out? Does the nature of the insult not really matter as long as it's deserved?",366,1292,0.93
207,Not the A-hole,"For a few month now, I've been staying with my Uncle because of this crappy living situation Me, my mom, and my brother are having. Everything was fine at first. Despite the fact that he was very strict with how things were run in his house, and that's fine. It's his house, even if these rules sometimes feel unnecessary or annoying.

But lately, he's been a real asshole. He insults me at random times for no reason, threatens physical harm to me whenever I do something he doesnt like, and degrades me a lot. He has even physically harmed me a few times. And he has been reminding me of my abusive father who put us in this situation.

Now, my entire family has this really shitty rule (that's how I feel about it at least) that no matter how badly an adult treats you, you can't disrespect or talk back to an adult unless you yourself are an adult.

But I can't hold back anymore. He reminds me so much of my father that I just can't help but get furious everytime I look at him. I've tried to respect him. I've tried to follow his rules. And I'm done trying. 

These are all the things he's done so far:

Everyday, no matter what I'm doing, ever time he comes near me he says one of these phrases.

""Hey lazy!""

*in a fake robotic voice* ""I am a robot, my phone is my life""

""You're a nobody/worthless""

""If you had half a brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'm still trying to figure out what that insult even means.) 

Etc.

He tries to control everything I do. For example, he tries to tell me how to shower, he has tried to tell me on how to pour a drink, he even tries to tell me how to SLEEP. As if I have concious conrtol of my body while I'm passed out.

He has unlocked the bathroom door with a key and barged in 3 different times while I was using the bathroom because I was taking too long. Which was because of a medical problem that I have. But he did it just to ""scare"" me.

He has physically assaulted me three times. Two of the times, he gripped on my shoulder and shook me against the wall or the bed. And after the situation finished, he played it off with ""I wasn't trying to hurt you. I was just holding you down so you could listen."" Which I instantly knew was bullshit.

The third time he literally grabbed my hand, but it into a fist, and started crushing my fingers to the point where they were starting to break. And that's when I lost all respect for him.

Yesterday, him and I got into another stupid argument. And as usual, he told me that I'm a nobody, and that I'm worthless. And then he told me how ""he is an adult and I have to respect him."" And that's when I told him that I don't respect him and I never will.  And the last thing I heard from him befote I ignored him was ""you better get your act together before I forget that this is the 21st century and I knock your teeth in."" 

I know it's HIS house, but AITA for telling him that I have no respect for him? I've tried to handle things calmly, but I'm just passed that point. I'm willing to fill in any info needed.",52,29,0.85

They talk trash about her behind her back (mostly like the stuff I mentioned above) and have openly attacked her through messages, telling her to stop hanging out with us.

I'm the kind of person who tries really hard to not insult others or back stab them. However, I find it kinda hard when the whole group is against Subject. My dad's even told me that he believes I should ""be a bro"" and tell her to shower.

Today while I was sitting inside my home I watched as my female neighbor and her young (4-5 year old) daughter went to get into their vehicle. While the mother was bringing things out to her car the daughter was picking weeds and things out from where their trash cans and recycling bins sit. I wasn’t paying much attention until I heard the girl let out a scream and the mother went to investigate. 

I watched as the mother grabbed something dead from the ground and tossed it into my
lawn. I told my girlfriend something like “I can’t believe what I just saw her do. She just threw a dead animal in our yard.” While they continued to pack up the car I sat and thought about what I should do. We don’t have kids but we do have two small dogs who would absolutely love to chew on a dead rodent so I didn’t want to leave it there. I went outside with gloves on and placed the dead rat/mouse on their porch. 

When I came back inside my girlfriend kind of lit into me. Asking why I would stoop that low? Why wouldn’t I just throw it out? Etc etc.

213,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend Anna who is 22 and dating a man Jesse who's in his thirties. I'm honestly not a huge fan of their relationship, they seem to be in different stages of life. Like he is acting kind of baby crazy which makes Anna uncomfortable because she's not even sure she wants kids but she feels pressured by Jesse. 

I also just don't find him that enjoyable to be around. He seems obsessed with work, and also is like the stereotype of a guy with a midlife crisis.

Anyway, I went on a weekend vacation with 6 of my friends and their SOs. Anna and Jesse were there.

One night we were all hanging out and drinking by the pool and Jesse was asking me about work. We're both programmers fyi. I'm not the type of person who likes to think or talk about my work off the clock, so I made the same joke I make to everyone who dwells on work too much ""I don't talk code unless I'm getting paid, my consulting rates are $50 an hour.""

To my surprise, Jesse picked up his wallet and started counting out cash. I couldn't tell if he was making a joke but I wasn't about to take his money if he was serious. Anna came up and stopped him before I said anything.

She got upset with me for flirting with her man, which seemed ridiculous to me. Because I wasn't. I'm not into him at all.

I said as much, and she seemed accusatory and doubtful, saying I was definitely flirting, so I started telling her why I wasn't. I probably spoke too much because I was too tipsy to be tactful. 

I told her he was too old for me. I'd had shit experiences with older men and I had grown past looking for the approval of crusty old bastards. I wanted someone my age so the relationship would be equal rather than imbalanced.

I also wasn't into anyone who wanted to put a baby in me, I can't deal with kids and if a guy doesn't respect that, he's not for me. 

I also just don't have any attraction to someone who doesn't match my level of fitness, I care a lot about fitness and I could tell Jesse didn't.

After saying this, Anna was mad at me for being so insulting to her boyfriend. I felt like stuff was getting too heated so I left the conversation then. But I feel like she's still mad, the next day she ignored me all day.

214,Asshole,"I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",7036,26252,0.85
215,Not the A-hole,"I want to give a little back story to this. My Brother & SIL recently moved across the country to be closer to family, by doing this he sacrificed a significant pay cut, which meant my SIL had to go back to work. I have a set of twins that are college age. I have a completely empty nest so I was very wiling to help. I was going to watch my 8YO nephew for 1 full month (June-July). My brother had asked me if I would be willing to watch my nephew for the month of August, up until school starts.  I told him no. I have guilt for this decision, but there were several incidents that happened. My husband thinks I'm not in the wrong for this, my adult children also agree, but I feel guilty.

1. He was extremely abusive to my 16 year old cat. There were multiple occasions I witnessed him abusing my cat verbally, and physically. This cat is old, real old. She sometimes makes weird noises, he would yell at her to ""SHUT UP"" He would call her an ""Asshole"" ""Idiot"" ""Pest"" He would go sit on the couch she sits on and try to knock her off of her perch. I saw him grab her by the fur multiple times. I cannot handle this. This cat is a huge part of our family. I tried to shut all of this down immediately, he got mad and threw multiple fits. One day I nicely asked him to please leave the cat alone, I explained to him how old she is and because of her age she sometimes does weird things. he got extremely upset but finally calmed down a little. I assumed he was playing on his iPad. When one of the doors are open I get an alarm on my phone, my phone was going off saying the back door was opened. I look out my windows and I see my nephew running into the woods. I called out for him multiple times but he wouldn't turn around. This was extremely scary.I called my brother,  told him what happened, his response was that when he (my nephew) gets upset he sometimes walks out. What? I had two 8 year old's at one time in my life, so no, this is not normal behavior.
2. I drove to meet up with one of my children for lunch. I had my brothers permission to take my nephew with me as he thought it would be fun. This child is addicted to the iPad. We left in the morning to start the drive, the iPad was going the whole time. We met up with my daughter for lunch and the iPad died. My nephew got extremely anxious, he kept asking to go to the car to charge it. I explained to him that we would be able to charge it after we got done eating but he wasn't having it. We ended up having to get the food in containers and we ate it in the car while he charged his iPad. I was upset as this was the only time I would have with my daughter in person for almost 2 months.

Am I wrong for not wanting to watch my nephew? he will probably have to be put him in some type of daycare since I was the only family member who was able to watch him. I feel guilty for this, but at the same time it's stressful. I'm completely defeated at the end of the day.",76,473,0.96
216,Not the A-hole,"We will go to a party/get together and my boyfriend will get annoyed with me for making jokes(I guess he feels embarrassed), a lot of people think I have a fun sense of humor, I just make random jokes about stuff just for fun. He will tell me stop or try and ruin the joke I am making and be like ""thats not true"" when I am clearly making a joke and just trying to have fun, not hurting anyones feelings. I agreed to stop doing this since I understand it makes him uncomfortable.But then if one of the people there makes a similar joke of some sort he will laugh at them, which I assume is to fit in. I have already agreed to him that I would take it down a few notches since I know not everyone might get my sense of humor, but literally nothing overwhelming, just having fun.But I basically told him he is going to have to get over it since he seems to think its cool to laugh at the same shit from a different person, but then get annoyed with me when I say the same thing. If he wanted me to chill out I would have no problem as long as he wasn't being a hypocrite. I don't make these jokes anymore because he asked me not to, but I still feel the same way I do about it.

219,Asshole,"We're all 25, my girlfriend Erin and I have been together for 5 years. It's important to note that when my girlfriend and I started dating her entire circle of friends was **toxic.** She didn't realize it until after she met my group of friends and saw how good friends actually act. As a result, she cut them out of her life and quickly grew close with my circle of friends, becoming our circle of friends. She would consider my best friend James to be one of her closest friends now.


In our group of friends there's 4 of us that go way back. Myself, James, Lilly, and Samantha. We've all known each other since we were \~5, and all became really close and would frequently hang out around the age of 12. We've all moved away from each other, however still keep in touch (myself and James the most, we drive up and spend alternating weekends at each other's houses once or twice a month).



Now that you have context I'll move on to the story. The 4 of us were group-texting and decided it's been way too long since the 4 of us were able to catch up, hit some bars / clubs, and let loose just the 4 of us. The last time we could remember was back in college. So we ended up making plans to share a hotel in the city, catch up while getting drunk and hit up some of the local nightlife. We decided on no significant others, not because we don't get along with everyone's partner (James' boyfriend is like family now, too) but because again it's been too long since just the 4 of us have been able to get together. 



When I told Erin she looked visibly hurt by not being invited. She's not the type to openly express her anger or when she's hurt, but by the look on her face I could tell she was sad. I reassured her that it was just because we're all childhood friends and haven't been able to see each other in ages.

I’m an employer in an industry where the employees are very hands on in terms of customer involvement and have a lot of conversations with customers to secure deals and generally make money.

I have a female employer who is very very qualified and is probably one of the best employees I have. That is, apart from her mood swings. Twice every month, she becomes very irritable and unsociable for two to three days. She tries to act professional but she has occasional outbursts and ocassional prolonged periods of silence in annoyance. She acts this way to customers, her co-employees, and even to me. When I called her in to talk about it, she explained it this way,""I have a lot of things going on in my life right now and whenever I get my period my emotions just bring all my problems and slam them in my face and it gets to me"". I told her I understood and that i would encourage she see a professional. That was that, I thought.

A few weeks ago, in one of those outbursts she behaved very rudely to a customer that would have brought in a bucket load of revenue. I called her in angrily and told her she should have known how important that customer was. She snapped at me rudely and then started crying. I told her she could have the rest of the day off.

Now comes the decision. I'm thinking of firing her. I know I told her I understood her predicament but her last blunder really affected the business and she should have known about how we needed him. WIBTA if I fired her?

Also a bit of added information, the person that would take her current position(albeit temporarily while we search for an actual replacement) is a guy. She knows she is more qualified than this guy but he is just more consistent. I'm afraid if I put this guy there after I fire her she could twist it to a lawsuit for sexism or something like that even though that is clearly not the case. There are other women that could fill the position but the guy is the most qualified after her. Just felt to add this last bit.",266,805,0.93

She asked me for a reusable grocery bag and I when I asked why (because the item was small and easy to carry without one) she said that I was being to controlling and shouldn’t question her. She then walked home (we live in a city) and I finished up grocery shopping. 

I do feel bad, I know I have a tendency to be controlling and have people do what I think makes sense to me. I’ve been working on it. In this specific instance was I in the wrong?

Edit: To clarify we already own these reusable grocery bags. It wasn’t about her buying one, I asked why she needed one to carry the single item. If she told me, in case she saw other things we might want or need I wouldn’t have a problem. Instead she just walked home.",73,159,0.93

228,Not the A-hole,"I feel like an asshole because I’ve got friends and family railing on me for this decision. But I thought I’d ask you, more-or-less objective redditors, what you think. 

I am getting married next month. It’s a fairly large wedding, but low-key— BBQ picnic dinner for the reception with lots of dancing, lawn games, maybe a bouncy castle for the kids... good stuff. But no booze. I like to drink, for sure, but it isn’t for me, it’s for my sister. Let me preface by saying that I love my sister. But... She’s an alcoholic in denial. She drinks like it’s going out of style and when she gets drunk she gets ugly and loud and sexual and she has even been known to drive drunk (she’s crashed a few cars). I don’t want to have to deal with that on my wedding day, but people are upset and saying I should just keep an eye on her and keep her away from booze. But she’ll get it somehow, she always does. If it’s available, she’ll find a way to have it. She literally cannot help herself (again, alcoholic, it’s an addiction she can’t really control right now!) And I just don’t want to deal with the level of drama my drunk sister can produce. There will be lots to drink that’s non-alcoholic (soda, lemonade, horchata) but is that not enough?

230,Not the A-hole,"So a little bit of background. After me (17) and my girlfriend (16) spent the entire day with her family, we got a call that her grandma's boyfriend of 8+ years (so basically her grandpa) was admitted into the hospital and likely won't make it. During this same time, my family was celebrating my dad's birthday, which isn't actually for another 2 days, and is only one out of several parties that we have planned. I explained to my mom that I needed to go to the hospital rather than go to my dad's birthday party. Granted I didn't know her 'grandpa', as we have been dating for a relatively short amount of time, but she certainly did and I felt the need to be there for her and to support her. After being there for about an hour and a half (the time now being 11:15) my mom told me I needed to come home right away to spend time with my dad, and it was non-negotiable. Am I in the wrong for being upset that I couldn't stay and comfort my girlfriend?",32,63,0.91
231,Not the A-hole,"Oh boy. This is a very long story, and there are two parts. I need to know if I'm an asshole on both.

Part 1: Kayleigh, my daughter, is fourteen. Now, at this point, she has come out as bisexual. She had plenty of friends and hung out with them outside of school plenty of times. Her friend group had both guys and girls and she was very close with all of them. One day she asked if her friend Anna could sleepover. Why not? Anna came over, she had a great time, no problem here. So... when she asked if her friend Nick could sleepover, I saw no problem with it. And just like with Anna, they had a great time. Nick's parents also didn't seem to have an issue with this, so I thought nothing of it. OH BOY was I wrong. All of the parents in our community (it's a small town we all know each other) were ridiculing me and telling me I was a foolish parent for letting this happen. Now, at this point I was in contact with all these people, we weren't really friends but I still knew them all. I didn't understand because... she's bi? And also she had a female friend sleepover and nobody cared? So what the hell was the problem? After this, I decided to cut ties with most of these people. I just don't see the issue with it and these other parents were being EXTREMELY rude about my choice to let my daughter have guys over. So, people of Reddit, AITA for cutting these people off for being rude to me about my choice to let my daughter have guys sleepover?

Part 2: I've never been a strict parent. My daughter was pretty much allowed to do whatever as long as it wasn't illegal. I have always faced ridicule for being a single dad, there seems to be a stigma that I just won't do a good job. But Kayleigh herself believes I have. So I learned to tune out the idiots. But, when she turned 18, it was starting to weigh on me. Then came graduation. I was there when I overheard the other parents talking about how several kids had been arrested for being in possession of marijuana. Now, when I walked over and asked about it, the main parent talking about it turned to me and no joke said, ""Why do you want to know? You're probably the one supplying the kids with marijuana considering the fact that you are ok with your kid having sex at 14."" I was in shock, I had seen this woman before, she was married and didn't have to raise her kid alone. This made it all come boiling out. Everything else I've said in this post, everything I'd had to deal with over the years of being insulted for being a single dad. I told her I wasn't a stuck up bitch and didn't care what my daughter did in her spare time as long as it wasn't illegal. My daughter left with her girlfriend after the graduation was done, and I drove home. I knew they would be out all night, and when I got home, I started crying. I just couldn't handle it anymore. Kayleigh says she understands and doesn't care that I yelled at that woman for what she said. But, she's always been on my side. So, people of Reddit, AITA for yelling at that woman?

Edit: Thank you all for the support, it has been nice knowing I was in the right, and I do agree I shouldn't have lost my cool the way I did. I should also mention I actually adopted Kayleigh, she isn't my biological daughter. I think I'll post about my experiences with adopting a child in the future.

Edit 2: Ok I just realized I messed up in my post. I need to make it clear that my daughter WAS NOT having sex at 14. She was just having a sleepover with a guy, that doesn't mean they are having sex.

Edit 3: So it seems that some people got the wrong idea. Again, I will reiterate that my daughter wasn't having sex at 14 years old. She was actually dating a girl at the time when she had Nick sleepover.",58,109,0.9

My family and maybe two or three others were the only people coming from out of town and there was only one decent hotel in the area so my aunt automatically booked us all into the hotel and we paid her back later on. 

My aunt presumed that me and my brother would share a room (which had a king size bed) me and my brother had no problem with this at all, whenever we visit my aunt and uncle we share a blowup mattress while our parents take the guest room so its completely understandable that our aunt booked it for us. literally no one cared about it at all.

Except for my boyfriend. We have been together for 4 months and he found out afterwards when I had my brothers shirt in my suitcase.

I've been best friends with this girl for over a decade and I love her to death, but one thing that has ALWAYS bothered me about my gal is when we go to restaurants. Without fail she will either order something that's not on the menu, or order something that is and ask to have it customized to the point where it barely resembles the menu version. For an example of the latter, we went to a chocolate cafe and she ordered the thin crepe with strawberries and English creme, but would ask to have blueberries or raspberries instead and replace the creme with a caramel and chocolate drizzle she saw on another item, and if possible make the crepe a pancake. It often annoys the staff, and she'll get a little upset when they can't cater to her every whim. 

Recently when we went out for my birthday, I admittedly got pretty annoyed and told her off for doing this, after the third time of asking multiple waitresses for something they didn't have (we were restaurant hopping looking for new and exciting places in the city). I've worked in the food service industry for all but two of my jobs, so I know this isn't an acceptable thing to do socially (at least where I live) and the waitresses were starting to get a little annoyed with us. She snapped at me (which she's never done before) and said ""Can't I ask?? Stop being so rude!""

I grew up in the midwest with my mom, I had a great job making good money and only paid 500 for rent. 2 years ago my mom got sick and I had to quit my job and give up my car to move in and take care of her. After her passing in 2018 when I was 25 my Dad reached out to me and asked me to move to California to start a new life with him and my Stepmom. They said I could live in a much better place rent free, save up for a bit while trying to play the corporate game and work my way back up to a good job in a new industry. They knew I spent every penny of savings I had taking care of my mom for that time. It's been about a year, I finally got a new car I'm happy with but I'm still making less than I did in the midwest. I'm bringing in about 2200 a month and now my Dad and Stepmom want to charge me $1000 a month for renting this tiny 14x14 bedroom that the AC doesn't even work properly in. I have no problem helping them financially and I try to help them with anything they ask but almost 50% of my monthly income is going to make it impossible for me to save and move out. I didn't even want to move out to California where the rent is insane, I just have no other family and didn't want to be alone, now I feel trapped and alone.

238,Not the A-hole,"My friend Shelly is getting married next month. Shelly and I met when we were probably 10 years old (28 now). We were close through high school, grew apart in college and now we rarely talk but can usually pick up where we left off easily. 

Expanding a little on my background, I grew up in a conservative Christian family and was told at a young age that homosexuality is a sin and a “lifestyle choice” like alcoholism, stealing, etc. This made it really hard for me to accept myself once I realized I was gay. I’m still dealing with this internalized homophobia now as an adult.

Shelly and I never had a straightforward friendship. She was infatuated with me the vast majority of the time in high school (her words, not mine) but I was never interested. I didn’t know I was gay until I went to college - regardless, she was okay with staying friends. 

After the failure of my first relationship, she was one of the first people I came out to. She knew all about what my parents said growing up. She knew about how my boyfriend outed me, too (that’s a whole other story). She promised me she wouldn’t tell anyone and I could tell her anything. That was five years ago. 

Fast forward again to a few weeks ago. I ran into Shelly and we were catching up. She was talking about her wedding, I shared with her that I’m dating an amazing man now and am really happy. Naturally she says “OMG you have to bring him to my wedding”. I told her that I’m still working on myself and getting comfortable with being out publicly and bringing my partner to a wedding would be a huge, stressful step and that I’d have to think about it. 

She says “oh, honey. Everybody knows”. 

I was devastated. She pretty casually said “yeah I told my parents like two weeks after you told me.” 

She said that she thought I knew that and she was so sorry. 

She then told me that nobody in her fiancées family (or the fiancée himself) wanted me there because they knew about how she obsessed over me in high school. But it didn’t matter because SHE wanted me there. And that she was going against their wishes of not having me there because I mean so much to her. She also noted that the fiancées family didn’t care I was gay - it was our “history” they didn’t like. 

I collected myself and left. 

I’ve been thinking about this a lot and I just received the RSVP to her wedding. I feel like I would essentially be saying I’m okay with what she did by attending. 

On the other hand, she is my childhood best friend and I feel bad for not going. 

TL;DR: childhood friend outs me without my permission two weeks after she promised me she wouldn’t. She now wants me to go to her wedding where the grooms family all do not like me and I’m not completely comfortable being out publicly yet. I feel betrayed and hurt but she’s also my childhood friend. WIBTA for not attending on the grounds that (I think) what she did was fucked up?",120,617,0.94

Now our daughter is getting married and I thought it would be a good time to pass her gran's  ring. My wife is extremely upset at me because I didn't use that ring to propose to her. I wasn't aware that my grandmother had also told my wife about the ring. When I didn't use the ring to propose my wife assumed that gran didn't actually pass me the ring. She thinks the ring should have been used for its intended purpose which is proposing to her. 

My paternal grandfather also gave me a gold ring with the family initial on it to pass to any son I might have. I passed on that ring to our son when he got married so I thought it would only be fair to pass gran's ring to our daughter as well. Our daughter ended up loving the ring. 

My wife is upset at me but I do not think I've done anything wrong. At the end of the day the ring was inherited by me and I chose to give it to our daughter instead of my wife. When I proposed I bought a beautiful engagement ring that she loves and wears everyday.

I had never met my cousin before in my life, to the point of just having downright no clue who she was when she walked into the house until I went outside and saw my great aunt. After that, we all get sat down, introduce the dogs, etc. I had been playing video games but came out to be polite and greet them and see what my dog was freaking out over.

This is where the issue arises.

My cousin then says she wants a Starbucks and asks where it is. I start describing where our local Safeway is, which has the Starbucks. I also live in a VERY small town. Mid-description she cuts me off and says, ""no, you're not going to tell me where it is. You're going to take me and get it for me."" To which I just stare at her in disbelief. I've never met this women before and she comes into MY house and demands that I drive and buy her Starbucks with the little money I have within 5 minutes of meeting me. After I stared at her I just left.

Fast forward about 15 min and my grandmother comes into my room, asking again that I take her to Starbucks so she'll shut up since she obviously doesn't like her either. I said no because she was extremely rude and demanding, and that I would've had no problem taking her if she would've just asked politely (and didn't demand that I pay for it.) My grandma then says that I'm being just as rude and leaves. 

I told my mom and she had the same reaction that I did but later said I should've taken her when my grandma asked, despite my cousin being extremely busy. Am I the asshole for not taking my cousin to Starbucks when my grandma asked?

In between all the fun times we had, the older folks kept randomly bringing up the topic of younger people. Things like, millennials don't know the value of money and only keep their clothes for an average of three months, young people can't handle different opinions, young people are so focused on individuality, the young'uns are so easily offended, and other smaller topics. And when I say randomly, I mean that we would all just be sitting there and someone would bring up these topics.

So in my view, I felt that it was very ride for them to disparage my age group so often and without cause. In their talks about younger people I would keep silent and they would say something about me being one of the ""good ones"". Even so, they were still being unfairly judgemental I thought. 

So here is where I might be TA. Everytime the group would complain about some guy's long hair or someone's tattoos I would call them out on being so easily offended and how they can't handle different opinions or viewpoints.

I started noticing the same car (a brown Kia soul) was always parking in the only handicapped spot in my buildings parking lot.  The car has never had a handicapped sign hanging from the mirror to identify the driver as handicapped.

Eventually, I saw who was driving the car.  It is a young man and woman who are most likely in their late 20's or early 30's with two young children.  None of them are handicapped.  

More recently I have noticed that this family will park in the handicapped spot when there are multiple normal spots available.  I have personally watched them drive past open spots and go directly into the handicapped spot.

While there isn't anyone in my building who is handicapped I find it rather inconsiderate to be parking in a handicapped spot without being handicapped.  What if someobe who is handicapped comes to visit someone in the building?

It is also frustrating to see them park in this spot because there are not always enough open spots for everyone who live in the building to park there.  In this case, there is a guest parking lot where people who don't get a spot will park.  While this lot is only across the street and not a far walk, I don't see why other people should have to do this while they don't.

My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. We get into and he's like I'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


I ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


I told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said I was a ""karen""

253,Asshole,"I’ll jump right into it. I was watching my gfs place while she was away for an extended trip, watering flowers, collecting mail etc. Nothing difficult like caring for a pet or anything. Anyways she gets back soon and yesterday I was cleaning her place. I went to dust her tv and I put the faintest amount of pressure on it (literally just enough to wipe dust away) and the entire tv came crashing down and smashed on the floor. It was a 40 inch Samsung. I inspected the stand because it was odd the tv would just topple over from a light graze , and I realized when the tv was put into the stand, no one bothered to put the screws into it, so this 40 inch tv was being held in place my a tab of plastic maybe 2 mm thick. Now I went and purchased a new tv. They didn’t have the same one and I ended up having to get a 55 inch Samsung (some people are weird about their electronics and I wanted to match the brand and obviously not replace it with a smaller one). She gets back today and is aware of what’s happened. Basically my question is, AITA for expecting my gf to give me SOME money for the expense of the new tv, which was A LOT (probably at least double the old one) I’m not expecting half of the new TVs value, but maybe the cost of the old tv? Or half the cost of the old tv? I figure yes I was the one who broke it but it literally could have happened to anyone as the tv was never even remotely installed properly. I feel she is also responsible  for this because she never bothered to put the screws in it and instead decided to leave it precariously perched on top of a flimsy tab of plastic. I can also appreciate it had been fine until I came along and started dusting things, I just wanted her place to be clean for her return! I realize I replaced it with a nicer tv and that was my decision, but I’m not expecting a lot in return just something to offset the cost? I just don’t feel this is entirely my fault. Anyways some guidance would be helpful and I’m not sure if i should even mention it to her, or just eat the loss and chalk it up to bad luck and a sunk cost ? AITA for expecting some enumeration for the TV I bought in replacement for the old one that was basically set up like a booby trap?

EDIT: I’m not nor ever was EXPECTING money in return, that was a poor choice of words. I’m wondering if it makes me an asshole to gently ask if she would be willing to cover a marginal amount of the cost of the new tv. It was placed on a stand as to look like it was installed when in reality it was just lightly balanced on the stand and not fastened.


UPDATE: First off thank you to everyone for your opinions, even the ones that were tough to hear. To finish the story, one of the very first things she did when we got back from the airport yesterday was take out her cheque book, (I never said a word) at which point I strongly refused. You guys helped show me the way, and probably saved me some uncomfortableness in the relationship. When she offered that satisfied everything and I realized I didn’t even want the money, it was the gesture alone that did it for me.

254,No A-holes here,"My friend has, since she started dating her boyfriend a few months ago, started trying to become a social media influencer. Her new boyfriend had a Youtube channel already that he made lots of short films on. They've started sharing the channel and posting unboxings of subscription boxes, vlogs, and music videos. While I'm happy that she's using it as a creative outlet, I'm just reserved about supporting her because I know what influencer culture is like. She's already made a sponsored post on Instagram even. I just don't want her to gain a following and then change into what other people have become. Cancel culture and the beauty community are so inherently toxic.

On a recent dinner with friends, Keith asked me and another friend what I get from gaming. He's never been into video or online games, so I told him that it's our form of entertainment and we get a lot of personal satisfaction when we do well in and win a game, like how he gets a lot of personal satisfaction when people praise his pastries (he's an amateur baker). 

He said he respectfully disagrees that our gaming is like baking, because he gets something concrete, particularly money, out of baking when people pay him to bake them desserts. He had a point there, so I just said that gaming is fun for us that's why we do it.

He asked again what we get out of gaming because according to him, at 27, we should start to think about the things we spend our time and money on. He asked what our goal in life is and if gaming is going to help us get there. 

I replied that no, I don't really know where I want to be in five years, and I don't think that's such a bad thing. I also don't want to be the kind of person who just does things that will help get me to my 'goal', I have always been one of those who stop just to smell the flowers. 

He said yes, that's alright, but at our age we need to realize that we only have a limited amount of time and we need to maximize it. He said that he himself doesn't binge watch TV shows and movies anymore because he realized that there are so many more productive things he can do with his time, like honing his baking skills. He said we might be missing the opportunity to do something good for ourselves because we're spending our time on fleeting entertainment.

I was just bewildered about where all of that was coming from, because while I'm not a millionaire at 28, I think I'm doing pretty well for myself. I have a good paying job in finance, I support myself and I am able to help my parents financially. I get that he might have meant well, but it just felt like he was looking down at us because he thought that his hobby was so much better than ours. 

So I told him that it's great that he's figured his life out and all that, but he should mind his own business when it comes to other people's hobbies. He went red in the face and didn't say anything else until one of our other friends tried to diffuse the situation by changing the subject. The two of us have not talked since then.

I have a step sister and we used to hang out pretty often.
Back then, we were both kids and we didn't do much. But now we are adults. We have money, car and too many options now. That's when things started to get annoying.

My sister is 21 and she's pretty pretentious. Instagram is important to her and she MUST go to somewhere nice so that she can post. And I don't do Instagram so I kinda don't understand why is this important. 

And this just happened yesterday. So the night before, she said she wants to go somewhere nice. We agreed to get ready and leave our house by (tomorrow) 1pm. At 1pm, when both of us were ready, I told her ""hey so these are the places I looked up last night. Do you wanna go here?"" And she said she doesn't want to go there (anywhere I've found) and told me she will to look up now. (By the way, we were planning to go to a district(?) with many cute cafes and she couldn't decide which one to go in that area)


And she took AT LEAST 40 mins to decide where she wants to go. Guess what. It was one of the places I showed her at first. During the 40 mins, I was begging her just to pick anywhere. Then I told her that I'm not in a mood and she can go by herself.
She's so mad because I ruined her plan and says ""I should've told her earlier if I were to call it off"".

My other Instagram-famous friend thinks it's just because I don't understand her and the Instagram life. She says she also takes hours to decide where to go and what to wear.

258,Not the A-hole,"Here's a fun, low-stakes post for you guys regarding work potluck etiquette. So, nurses *love* potlucks. Especially night shift, which is what I work.

My brownies were famous at my old hospital. Some of my co-workers would throw fits if they weren't working when I brought them, so I'd have to stash a couple in their mailboxes. There were never any left over. I'm talking super fudgy, coffee-coconut-cayenne brownies with a layer of chocolate chip cookie underneath.

So I'm at a new hospital and we had a potluck for a coworker who's leaving. I brought my signature brownies, some people brought savory foods and some people brought store bought desserts. I noticed that the homemade stuff (cheese dip, mac n cheese, etc) was pretty bland/unseasoned. Not bad, just the stereotypical white person amount of seasoning (I am also white, before anyone gets worked up). A few people tried my brownies and seemed to like them, but most people seemed hesitant to try them once I mentioned what was in them. Nobody had food allergies, and I tried one and they turned out great.

By morning half of my brownies were still there, but all of the store bought cookies (several dozen) had been eaten. I considered leaving my precious brownies for day shift to enjoy, but I didn't want them to be thrown out if the day shift staff had similar taste preferences to night shift. So I took my beloved brownies home and will probably use them in homemade ice cream. I live by myself and will probably struggle to finish them all.

AITA for not giving my brownies to the next shift and keeping them for myself? The other homemade dishes were taken home but they were in crock-pots and perishable. My brownies were in a disposable pan and could've sat on the table all day without issue. Nobody said anything about it as I was leaving, I just felt kinda weird about it.

First time poster here...

Last weekend my future MIL was staying with my fiancé and me to help iron, do chores, etc. She is very friendly and talkative whereas I am very introverted and like my space. When my fiancé is around I find her more tolerable because I have him as moral support and he also knows her better. MIL stayed for a longer weekend this time and while my fiancé was at work I decided to just stay out of the way in my room. MIL kept coming in and asking if I needed anything, if I wanted to go anywhere, to which I always responded, ""No, I'm fine."" As an introvert the constant bothering was driving me crazy. 

By the time my fiancé was home I was at my wits end and when we had dinner together I was being a little snarky. What sets her off is me giving my fiancé the last of my dinner and MIL telling me she won't let me because my fiancé is not my bin. I had had enough so I left and went to my room. She then starts yelling about how ungrateful I am, how I am making my fiancé fat, and how she knows lots of girls that he could date instead. All this two days after we had bought an expensive engagement ring together. 

She leaves and I start to cry while my fiancé tries to comfort me. She comes back and yells again, leaves again, and then comes back to yell again. I cry for a few more minutes and then leave the house to get away from her. When I come back my fiancé and MIL are talking loudly in a foreign language. My fiancé comes back a while later and explains she didn't mean it etc. and we go to bed.

The next morning I leave the house immediately and don't return until my fiancé picks me up after he is done with work. He thinks I was extremely rude and told me to apologise to his mom. I did apologise but I really can't look at her the same after she yelled at me like that. AITA for not wanting to send time with her and include her in planning my wedding?",75,69,0.91

265,Not the A-hole,"Firstly, I want to apologize for formatting since I am on mobile and I only felt comfortable posting this on my anonymous account due to the information I am about to give. 

I guess I will start it off by giving some back story. I had a rocky childhood... mostly in part to my mother. She and my father divorced when I was eight and the day she left my father for the last time she already had a boyfriend. This started a revolving door a boyfriends. My mother has horrible taste in men and is one of those women that adapts to like whatever they like. With the first boyfriend, Steve, that was drinking and smoking crack. Steve lasted a few months and then she was on the the next guy. We were never stable... I had 3 siblings and we moved 9 times in 3 years. She even had an affair with her married Cousin at one point. Which was made clear since they would have sex very loudly in her room every morning and I would have to turn the cartoons up for my siblings not to hear. Eventually the partying caught up with her and we got evicted from our apartment... she packed all of mine and my siblings things into trash bags and pleaded with my father to take us which he did. My father became tired of her shenanigans and knew it was in our best interest to try to get full custody of us. When my mother found out she kidnapped us and we hid from the police for a few days before they found us. After my father got us back, my mom quickly found a boyfriend and moved in with him. My dad always let us see my mom for visitation but one night we went over there and my mom said she was moving to Florida and she left the next day...

Cue 3 years of almost no contact from my mother. She maybe called a handful of times... and one of those was so we could hear her marry the loser she went down there with. 

Eventually she moved back near us kids and married step dad number 2...

Now she is getting divorced from step dad number 2 and the day they separated she was already fooling around with a meth head she has known since before I was born... well he got to be too rowdy so now she is with his best friend and they have decided to move back to Florida.

I usually tell people I don’t love my mom... I don’t even like her. But my siblings all still have strong relationships with her and even went to live with her after she came back... I was the only one to stay with my dad.  I have kept the relationship I have with her going for them. 

I have a child... I have worked SO hard to build my life up from my “trailer park” history. Most people when they realize my background are shocked because I don’t seem like “that type of girl”. My husband and I provide a very stable and comfortable life for my kiddo but that means I have had to drop people from my life that would have endangered that. Whether that be old friends or family, it doesn’t matter.

267,Not the A-hole,"My mom and I have a very difficult relationship and have had all my life. She was physically abusive when I was a child and then that later switched to mostly verbal and emotional abuse as I reached adulthood. I used to tell myself that, you know, she's my mother and I'm supposed to love her and she's allowed to treat me like this, blah blah blah, which is why I continued living with her.

Anyway. Living with her was a nightmare and she would regularly just lose it completely and start picking on the most insignificant things to start a full blown argument. When I would defend myself she would scream at me to leave if I don't like it, knowing I had nowhere else to go, and tell me to get out of her house. I would just leave the room and let her cool down and then in a couple hours she'd basically have forgotten everything she said and did and be back to trying to be best friends with me again.

During our most recent argument she told me, once again, to get out of her house and I'm not sure why, but it really just hit me this time that I can't keep living like this and that it's terrible for my mental health and that she's just not a good person, lol. So I left and didn't come back.

Fast forward a few months and I haven't spoken to her or seen her since, but I have heard that she's been talking about me to family members and so on basically complaining that I left and that apparently I'm the one who blew a tiny argument out of proportion for no reason. So I told the person who told me this that I didn't blow anything out of proportion and that *she* kicked me out! The person then went back to my mom and told her that I've been telling people she kicked me out and now my mom is furious and won't stop sending me angry messages accusing me of lying about her because, according to her, she never kicked me out.

I don't regret leaving or anything, but idk if I'm in the wrong for telling people she kicked me out. Her argument is that she obviously didn't mean it because she never means it, and I just decided to leave on my own? IDK...tensions are high on both sides and I'd appreciate a neutral party here. Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you for all your advice, sympathy and other help. I will also stop talking to the family member who keeps going between me and my mother.

A few people mentioned that this is a one-sided post and I apologise for that. I can't explain much about what the argument was about because it was very specific and will be very obvious to anyone who knows about the situation that it was I who wrote this post. The most I can say is that I was defending a younger sibling and my mother did not like that I was ""critiquing her parenting"" and it ending up blowing up. (The younger sibling has also been removed from the home now, so I didn't leave any children in an abusive environment, don't worry!)

Thanks again for your help, I really do appreciate it!

268,Asshole,"A friend (28M) I (28M) have had since middle school was engaged to a woman (24) for five years who cheated on him multiple times and was emotionally abusive. It started when they decided to have a open relationship two years in. But, she started having sex with people before asking him and would just tell him afterwards, like that made it alright. She helped set him up with someone and when he had sex with them, she blew up on him. They agreed to close the relationship, but she opened it again without his consent. She tried to separate him from his best friend because she didn’t like him. And she abused him throughout all this: insults, gaslighting, denying, etc. He was able to check every single box of an “abusive partner” checklist given to him by his therapist (save for physical abuse). She hasn’t apologized for any of it and does not think she did anything wrong. This all left him traumatized and in therapy. I have never seen him so devastated. She sounds like a monster.

Yet she’s been my best friend for three years now. She’s supportive, kind, smart, and funny. I can tell her anything at all and she never judges me. We have similar interests and love spending time together and even just talking. She’s patient and understanding with me and is always there if I need to talk, offering advice and empathy alike. She’s helped me immensely in developing my self-esteem and because of her I have gained the courage and confidence to pursue the life I want. She is a great source of support and strength for me and I owe her so much. Besides her abuse of my friend, I’ve seen no sign of toxic behavior.

Despite how much she means to me, I can not condone her actions and am disgusted and enraged by it all. My abused friend and I talked things over and were on good terms for a while. He didn’t like that I was still friends with her, but said different people have different mileage with others and he couldn’t invalidate my friendship with her. However, in January he deleted me on Facebook and has been ghosting me ever since. I have reason to believe he changed his mind and decided that my friendship with her hurts him too much.

My friendship with him may be over, but I want to salvage it. But honestly, after all she did, I can’t really blame him for seeing my friendship with her as a betrayal. And as great as our friendship is, I feel resentment for her and guilty for staying her friend. At the same time, I would also feel guilty putting an end to a perfectly healthy friendship over things that didn’t involve me at all. Everyone I’ve asked about this says I have a right to be friends with anyone I want, but that's the only defense I have.

Do I owe it to my abused friend to cut ties with my best friend for what she did to him? If he ends our friendship, should I still cut her out of my life just out of principle? Or do I owe it more to myself to stay in a friendship that brings me so much happiness and strength?",271,340,0.86

On this wiki, it's common practice to ban anyone with a username that's deemed offensive/inappropriate. When I saw a user by the name ""Poopoopee"", I thought it was a troll. Their edits appeared to be in good faith, however.

I banned him, as per the rules, the ban message read ""Unacceptable Username: Wiki rules, sorry.""

He asked how his username wasn't acceptable. I explained that it was immature toilet humor, something only a small child would find amusing. I also said that he would be unbanned if he changed his username.

He then posted the following:

""I was born in the small village of Wabxo, Somalia. Poopoopee was the only name my parents gave me. I was the son of Oblingopee, the leader of the Gizignxo tribe.

He followed-up with: 

""I hope to never have to be ashamed of my birth name again. My name gives me pride and to have to strip that from me is a disgrace to my family name and tribe.

271,Not the A-hole,"So, context.

I posted on mother's day, tagging and thanking my step mother for being an amazing mother to me; no mention of birth mother. My birth mother hasn't been in my life (her own decision). She and my father divorced when I was 8, birth mother got custody, and weeks later gave my brother and I to my father. From what I've heard, no clue if it's true or not (wouldn't put it past the guy) she gave us up to our father because the guy she was cheating on my dad with, already raised his kids and didn't want to raise someone else's kids. Hardly ever saw her after. Got cards and money every holiday out of it (I suspect she sent money out of guilt), but that was it. 

Once my brother and I got our own cell phone, we would call her. But, she would never call us in return. Her excuse, she was afraid my father would answer the phone. Okay, sure, whatever. Durring this time, my dad met, fell in love, and married my step mother. She took up the role of mother. She was young, 22, so she was going in pretty much blindly, but she accepted, cared, and helped raise my brother and I. 

As we got older, I eventually got my own cell phone, paying for it myself, which meant my father had no reason to touch it. One day, I asked my blood mother once again, why she never called me. She gave me the same answer. She was afraid my dad would answer the phone. I explain that he would never even touch my phone because I paid for it and that that was no excuse. Soon after, the phone calls became less and less until I stopped calling all together with the mind set of; ""If she wants to talk to me, she can make the effort. I'm tired of being the only person working for this relationship."" 

Now, aside from the one brother and myself, she has 2 more children, both older males. All three brothers begin pestering me about calling her because she misses me. I tell them that I'm not gonna be the only one trying. The 2 oldest brothers chew me out and stop talking to me. Okay. Fine. Whatever. 

Fast forward about 5 years, barely any contact with her aside from some comments on FB, I post a Happy Mother's day post to my step mother and thank her for raising us. My blood mother sad reacts to it. She doesn't include me in any posts regurding her children, only my 3 brothers. My older brother, the only one who still speaks to me, sees the post and asks why I didn't include her in the post, then proceeds calls me TA for not wishing her a Happy Mother's Day as well, since she is, in fact, still my mother.

AITA for not including her in these kind of posts? 

TLDR; Blood mother abandons children, refuses to reach out and contact, then gets upset when not included in posts while excluding me from hers.

273,Everyone Sucks,"I met the love of my life. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I’m proposing in about a month. 

My friends and I are big fans of parties, they occasionally (read: all the time) feature excessive drinking and some illegal drug use. There’s always people putting moments from the parties on social media. 

My gf has a job where if she’s even seen *near* people who are using illegal drugs she could be fired for cause. She isn’t anti-drug or anything, she just likes her job. 

I had stopped attending these parties or throwing them myself out of respect for her situation. But knowing I now have long term plans with her and not wanting to isolate myself from my friends I tried to find a happy medium. 

I corralled my core group (7-10 guys I go back with) and said I wanted to throw a party but it would either have to be a completely sober activity or we’d have to have a party with a phone check. They voted and opted for phone check. 

Gf didn’t love this idea but I promised her she could trust my friends. 

Long story short the party is in full swing (I’m sober - important later) and I see one of the guys has a phone out. I tell him loud and clear to put it in the phone check like we’d agreed. My friends admonish him too since talked about this at length. 

Ten minutes later a friend clues me in that this guy is actively posting to his Snapchat story with gf clearly visible. 

I couldn’t believe someone I’ve known for so long who knows what this girl means to me would jeopardize her like that after I stuck my neck out saying he was trustworthy. I told him to leave. He made some disparaging comments about my being sober that night and how it reflected on my manhood. 

I dropped his phone in a pitcher of beer and sent him packing. 

He’s (understandably) irate at the damage his phone allegedly sustained. Usually I’d be on his side, but I feel like we’re even considering the risk he put my gf at after several clear warnings. 

I know the party was a bad idea and I have to re-evaluate my circle of friends — but aita over wrecking his phone specifically? 

*Tl;dr I had a party where guests agreed to not bring cameras or phones in. One of the guests ignored the agreement. I gave him a warning. He persisted. His actions put my girlfriend at risk.

A bit of backstory:: I have 2 cats and the younger one is rambunctious, but I will ALWAYS clean up after them and pay if they damage something, which is rare. My roommate doesnt let them in her room if she isn't there, understandably. But once a month or so I come home and little cat has been locked in her room. Never for very long but I still constantly ask her to be more aware and not lock him in there.



So I came home today at 2 a.m. after being gone since noon, and roommate left the house around 1 or 2p.m. I fed the cats and the little one didn't come out to eat. I looked for him and realized he was in roommate's room. Meaning he was the for 12 or so hours. And in this time he tore up the carpet, I don't know much about carpet but it definitely needs to be fixed somehow. I don't feel like I should have to pay for it because I have repeatedly asked roommate to be more careful about locking him in her room, but she never listens. 
So WIBTA if I refuse to pay for the carpet my cat tore up after roommate locked him in her room?

Edit: I just want to make it clear that I know he can hide and he isn't her responsibility to watch. But she invites him in her room to hang out and forgets him when she leaves. That's what I have asked her to stop doing.",52,40,0.93

This person next to me was playing a word game on their phone. They were really struggling for a good 30-35 minutes with just one word. One word that would complete this level and get them to the next one. So I helped them out. 

They got super defensive and said I should ""stop being nosy"" and  ""mind my own business"". In the moment I got a bit defensive because my heart was in the right place. However, now that time has passed I'm having doubts on my action.

I'm sorry this is tamer than the ones where someone sniffed their mom's panties or fucked a dead moose but I need to know if I should be helpful if I see someone needs help and I can provide it or just wait for them until they explicitly ask.",16,29,0.8
277,Not the A-hole,"Backstory, between the ages of about 14-22 (I’m 25 now) I was a huge troll. Usually, in my mind, I did it to people deserving. This is important though, because I feel then and now, I still couldn’t see what I was doing was wrong. And this is why I question if I am TA. 

So I was downtown, had freshly come out of the closet and was going on my first ever public date with a man. It was going well and we decided to go on a walk while holding hands. Not 200 feet from the restaurant, a loud group of cars passes by us and someone screams “FAGGOTS!!!” From one of the cars. Only one car in the group has his window down. It’s a Dodge Dart and I immediately take note of the stickers on the back window. 


I am suddenly enraged by this. Unfortunately for this person, I am also pretty involved in the car community, and fairly well known. My date tells me to calm down about it and just drop it. I told him I dropped it and it was no big deal. 


But I get home and jump on Facebook and make a post about it in the local car page. The local dodge club admits to being downtown, and finds out the person who did it. They forced the kid to message me and apologize. He does send a half assed apology and that was it. But over the next few days, he was also enraged by my post. Still spewing hatred against me being gay via private chats that people sent to me. Hoping I would get AIDS (lol skip right past HIV and just get full blown AIDS) and saying comments like gays “diddle kids” and so on. 


So I tapped into my old troll habits, and had some friends keep tabs on the kid. Basically screen grabbing everything he said that was any bit sexist, racist, homophobic. We did this for about 7 months. I learned he was in the military and worked a security officer job. I had a friend that was in his squadron who was able to get me his commanders email. 


We took all of these screenshots, him admitting the faggot incident, and did a mass media dump to his security company and to his commander. 


His security company fired him pretty soon after, and sent out an amendment to their social media policy, which someone sent to me. And I found out later that he received an LOR from his squadron. Which is a pretty serious thing in the military. I’m not sure what his punishment was, but I’m not sure he is in the military anymore. 


The guy on the date with me didn’t work out, but we are still friends, I finally told him what I did as revenge. And he told me I was crazy going that far and that I was a huge asshole for messing with his livelihood. 


I think it’s important that people that think or act this way should not have the shred of authority, nor should they represent our country, if even in a minor roll.

My sister has always been very strict with him. I mean she literally tracks his position at all times through a phone app and constantly calls him when he makes a change or anything. She has a thing where she requires all of his friends parents phone numbers so that she can make sure his friends are 'okay people' to hang out with... judging by their parents. She just generally is extremely overprotective and sheltering, she is like the definition of a helicopter mom. I've always had this issue with her in terms of how she raises him. She has somewhat loosened up, but she is still way too overprotective over him. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I was walking my dog in the park when I came along Ethan in the park nearby. There was some big concert (there are always concerts in summer in prospect park) and he was just hanging out with his friends in the crowd. Then I saw, in his hands, a bag that pretty clearly had a six pack of beer in it. You could see the outline. I said hello to him, and he looked pretty obviously shocked, and I just told him he should not drink the entire thing at once, and make sure he eats food beforehand. Again, he looked shocked. I just told him I wasn't gonna tell his mom, but that he should be careful.

Why didn't I tell his mom? She is overprotective, as I said before, and she is really big on punishments.

Now I know that genetics are a weird thing, and the baby might come out looking Hispanic, but I think it’s more likely to come out light, will likely freckle, may have light brown/red hair.  I understand that there are white-Latinos but here’s the deal. We live in cow/agriculture country. Not a lot of diversity. Our child will be raised here and I can already see a lot of “why are you named Antonio, you’re white!” “Why are you named Javier, you’re white!”  

I posted in a baby name group looking for names with a Hispanic nod, that way there is a way to honor that side without it being something he has to defend/explain.

284,Not the A-hole,"I know the title may seem horrible already, but bare with me here. I’m also using a throw away account, because I know my cousin knows my Reddit account. 

So, me and my now fiancé just got engaged in December. I was beyond happy and excited! I know he’s the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. And of course, me being the typical girl. I wanted to tell all of my family and friends about the exciting news! I made a Facebook post with a picture of my ring with some cheesy caption like “I said Yes!!” 

So many comments flooded in with love and support! But, then my cousin commented. Now, let me tell you a bit about my cousin. She’s about 5 years older than me and all our lives as children, she got the nicer things. This is because my parents were relatively poor for most of my childhood and her parents were very well to do. So, she always liked to consider herself one step a head of me. Always shoving her nicer things in my face. When we were children it was toys. When we were middle schoolers it was her better grades. High school it was her new car. Etc Etc. 

Well, my cousin commented on my Facebook post saying, “I would’ve asked for a bigger rock, just sayin. Congrats tho!” This was a very backhanded comment, given that I know how my cousin is. When I read this I was beyond furious. My ring is on the smaller side, but I like that! I don’t like huge rings. I think they’re tacky (in my opinion) and smaller rings look better on my finger. I even told my fiancé this as hints before the proposal! 

I quickly removed her comment and just tried to ignore it. But she then MESSAGED ME asking me why I took down her comment. I told her that it was rude. I loved my ring. And she said, “I guess you’ve always liked cheaper looking things lol”. I had had it at this point. She had pushed me around so much my whole life. I was going to explode. 

I remember texting her and saying. “At least my boyfriend proposed to me at all.” This was a jab at the fact that she was with a guy for 6 years and he never proposed to her. And when she gave them the choice of marriage or breaking up with her... he chose breaking up. Sure maybe the wound was fresh, (this break up happened 8 months ago) but I was infuriated! 

She read the message and didn’t respond. A few minutes later, I get a call from my aunt screaming at me to apologize because my cousin was crying. Saying I “hurt her feelings.” My cousin is 28 and is having her mother call me to tell her I’m sorry. I calmly responded with. “Sure. I’ll happily apologize if she apologizes for making fun of my ring and calling me cheap.” This made my aunt even angrier. She hung up the phone. I had family members texting me saying that “I’m rude” and that I should apologize!

She lost custody of me and older brother when I was 6. Back in the early 1980's... The last straw I think was when my brother and I walked home after midnight asking for a ride home. I think this is when police first became  involved.

My dad's brother and his wife have one daughter also, Susan, who is 16 years old.

Our two families would like to travel to France together next summer, and my parents have offered to pay for my entire trip on the condition that I room with my cousin Susan.

Susan and I are not close.  We barely know each other.  Mostly because I have a career on the other side of the country that keeps me busy and we have an age difference of about 30 years.  I've tried to bond with her during Christmases, etc., but she is difficult.  She has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is emotional and immature both.  I try to handle with care and keep it simple; talk about boys and school and her friends.  But we just haven't been fast friends.

I refused my parents' offer to pay if I share a room with Susan.  I can pay for my own trip and get my own room.  I'm introverted and shy and I need personal private space to retreat to.  Because I'm an adult.

At this, my dad became unhinged and told me that I am an asshole for refusing to let Susan stay in my room, and that I would have to explain it to the whole family; he is not going to have my back.  He made it sound like they had all cooked up this plan together to get some privacy of their own and a free room for their kid.  In reality, I think this is all my dad's idea as he has been on my case about taking on a parental role with this cousin before.

287,Asshole,"This will be a long one. 

Me and my ex husband divorced about sixteen years ago due to him cheating. We had one son, let's call him Sam. (Age 17). He wants to be a paramedic.

Sam's biological father has never paid child support, and for about the last ten years he hasn't been in my kid's life. He would send birthday and Christmas gifts. Yes, he is my son's father, but if he doesn't want to initiate a relationship by actually talking to him why should I let him have one?

About sophomore year in highschool, Sam's grades began to drop. He went from As and Bs to Cs. He started to play Fortnite more. He began to win some tournaments, told me about sponsorships, but I disliked him playing so much. I made it known that I did not approve of his ""hobby"", (I see it as borderline addiction) and that it would never be a sustainable source of income. He understood that.

This is about when summer started and Sam began taking college classes. (Just to get ahead). He just finished. In one of his classes, he did very well. (Psychology, with an A). But in the other, he did very bad. (Sociology with a D). 

About the time that this ""fortnite world cup"" stuff started (early June?) Sam began playing an unhealthy amount. He said that he had a chance to do something cool, but I just saw it as feeding his addiction. This was also the time that is sociology grade begin to slip. As a consequence we took away his gaming stuff and in turn ""prevented him from competing in a once in a lifetime opportunity"". I said if his poor grades continued then I would have to keep him from volunteering as well. (He loves volunteering, but it was getting in the way of grades almost as much as gaming). That would leave him with nothing to do but getting good grades and helping around the house.

In the last week, he told me that he would finish high school and then move to Texas to start his life. (to live with his bio. father until he could get his own place). His reasoning was that it much cheaper to find housing and to live there overall. It would be easier to find jobs. All these random points that hide his true reasoning for moving away.

We got into a very heated argument which I encountered the first time he ever raised his voice at me. He said that I wasn't being supportive of him. He said that my standards of him were too high. His said that I was taking away anything I could that he cared about. He said that I was too controlling and that I wouldn't listen to what he had to say. He went to his room. I was left crying out of confusion and disappointment. He doesn't understand how hard I have worked to give him the childhood that I never got. (Raised in Oakland slums by parents who were always on drugs.) I went to school for for eight years to get my masters degree. All for him to pick a career that he doesn't have to go to college for. He is lazy, and that's the bottom line.

They are a young couple with 4 kids (ages 7 to 2). We didn’t really have issues with them until someone called CPS and we got interviewed. I mean, yes the kids were a bit dirty but they’re kids and they played outside a lot. We could tell they were struggling cause sometimes they’d ask for a ride to the store. One time, their water got shut off and the mom asked if she could use our water hose to get water. We said yes, I mean, poor kids ya know?

Well, a few months ago, I was leaving my house and the mom was sitting outside looking sad. I asked if she was okay. She asked if I would call the police (non emergency) to her house. I did. I later found out that dad abused mom and he was in jail. Mom is now on her own with the 4 kids. The kids are cute. But I work from home and they would ring my doorbell and knock.. a lot.

Until very recently, I had been fully committed to going to this law school, as I would be graduating debt-free and we would be able to attend school together. 

However, I recently got off the waitlist at a better law school and the offer is hard to turn down. It is regarded as one of the best in the country and my parents are absolutely ecstatic. However, my boyfriend is pretty pissed. 

He says that I would be putting us in a lot of debt (the school offers no scholarships, just need-based financial aid, which I DO qualify for) and that we would now be separated for three years. He also said I was TA for telling my parents, when I knew that they would be pressuring me to attend law school there. 

I really want to go to this law school. It is better aligned with what I want to do in life, and I want to make my parents happy. This sense of obligation is something that my boyfriend will not understand, because his parents basically left him to fend for himself after he turned 18, but my parents have contributed a significant amount to my undergraduate tuition, which, combined with scholarships and part time work, has allowed me to graduate debt-free. This means a lot to me as my parents are significantly less well-off than his, but they put their everything into making sure I had a good start in life. This is also a cultural thing. (I am Chinese-American.) 

Also, doing the math, combined with my savings, financial aid, and some living expenses help from my parents, I would be graduating law school with the same amount of debt as my boyfriend. In addition to this, he has around 30k in undergraduate debt that I do not have. I also let him know that should we get married, I would take on full responsibility for my student loans. 

I think I am going to accept the offer, but WIBTA if I did so? From my boyfriend’s perspective, I am putting our relationship and financial security in jeopardy, even though I have the option to avoid doing so. He also thinks I am being a kissass to my overbearing parents, but this is something that I want too, not just them.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the replies! I really wasn’t sure who was in the wrong here; I immigrated here when I was a child so I do think I am heavily influenced by China, and I wasn’t sure if my reasoning would be unacceptable by American standards. Also, just because there seems to be some confusion about the amount of debt I’d be taking on, it would not be the same amount as my boyfriend’s undergraduate loans (30k).

My sister and her daughter (my niece who is 14) and my mom were visiting over to my apartment so that we could see the baby and chat. 

Situation: Everyone were sitting on the couch and suddenly Nephew spit his food back up and started to make a mess. We cleaned him up quickly and laughed a little. I told niece to check my bedroom drawers to see if I had extra wipes and to grab the gift I got for the baby. I left to the bathroom for a while. Come back and I see Nephew wearing an orange babyoutfit with yellow stars on it while playing with a seahorse spin rattle. The exact same ones my son once had. I quickly walk to my room and see my closet opened along with the box. I stormed back to the living-room couch and asked my Niece why she opened my closet and the box. My Niece gets upset and my sister realizes where the clothes were from. She started to apologize and started to fold the clothes again. 

I let my Nephew keep the clothes he already had on, and the toy he was currently playing with, but everything else went back inside the box. I was upset but kept calm.I told Niece that what she did was wrong and owed me an apology. Niece gets mad and so does my Sister. Sister says I have no right to ask Niece to apologize since it was a mistake. I told her that  Niece had NO permission to look inside my closet.

For example, when she was driving to our house she got lost, despite having a GPS so she called for help. Every time we tried to give her directions she would talk over us, complaining loudly about technology, other drivers, how tired she was, etc. She spent so much time talking over us, she ended up missing several turns and it took me repeating ""I can't help you if you won't listen"" several times before she stopped talking long enough to get instructions.

My son (11) has been frustrated with her tendency to talk over him. He has ADHD and struggles to get sentences out and when he gets interrupted it is hard for him to pick up what he was saying. However, he wants to be heard just like anyone else.

He used to just go silent when she would talk over him, but he got annoyed enough that he started asserting himself. Now when she does it he says ""Please stop interrupting me."" and ""I was still talking, please let me finish.""

He does say please, and he doesn't raise his voice, but he definitely has an angry tone when he says it. Every time he does this she huffs and looks at me like ""you need to do something.""

My knee-jerk response is to scold him for using that tone with his grandmother, but at the same time, I think he's justified in demanding a little courtesy. I haven't scolded him.

AITA?

Edit: Based on the advice here I had a talk with my son. I told him I was proud of him for standing up for himself and that it is ok for him to ask to not be interrupted. I also said that it is possible to be kind and firm at the same time, and as long as he continued to use polite words and tried to use a kinder tone I would support him.

I didn't put it in my original post, but when she was interrupting him, it wasn't when he was trying to talk to her. We were in a car and he was trying to tell me something and she kept talking over him to say something unrelated. So, I also had a conversation with my MIL when my son was not around. I explained how his ADHD makes it harder for him to pick up the thread of a thought than it is for other people and that I want to hear what he has to say since he already has such a hard time expressing himself.

She responded by saying that he shouldn't interrupt an adult and he needs to learn to be more respectful. It's the same litany that was hammered into my head when I was a kid, hence my knee-jerk instinct to scold. But, despite my indoctrination I actually think that everyone should be treated with consideration, regardless of age. I said as much to her. It did not go over well.

It's probably a good thing she lives out of state and will be going home soon.",404,4456,0.97

296,Not the A-hole,"so this happened earlier today and here’s a little backstory. the kid in question is my cousin but we see each other maybe 2 times a year, so not the closest. LETS CALL HIM JIM. jim has sort of a rich kid personality, meaning that’s he feels that he should just win everything and life should be super easy for him. jim also has a pretty nasty attitude. 

he’s maybe 5’2 or 5’3, so he’s about 7-8 inches shorter than me and he’s  pretty athletic. he plays basketball and i don’t ever really play it outside of the random pickup game. 

so we were playing basketball and the game called H.O.R.S.E. for a little bit. at first, i was letting him win since he was younger than me, but then he started talking trash that would make most people who talk trash look weak in that sense. so i stopped letting jim win and he was not happy about that. he started to throw the ball as hard as he could at me whenever it was my turn to shoot. i was letting him slide on that for a bit, until he actually starts to yell at me to let him win and some other stuff along the lines of that. 

jim then suggests that we play a 2 on 2, me and my dad vs him and his dad. this is where the AITA is. 

jim hasn’t cooled down since the game of H.O.R.S.E. and he just stays that way for the rest of the night. as i said earlier, i’m 3 years older and a little over half a foot taller than him. he starts to body me hard, as in playing super aggressive and trying to shove me. this goes on for about 5-6 minutes before i start to body him back. and before i did this, i told him, “ if you keep playing like this, i’m going to play like that “ , so he knows what will happen if he doesn’t stop playing hyper aggressive. 

i take it from the top and start to dribble backwards towards the goal, protecting the ball form jim. he eventually hits his face onto my elbow and shoves me forward. i again, let it slide. i keep telling him to stop playing so aggressive and he doesnt stop. so i uphold my promise and start to play like him. 

i sprint down the court and run right into his left shoulder, moving him away. he gets all mad, but he’s not hurt. so the next time i have the ball and he’s playing right up on me, i basically jump into him, knocking him right into his back. the games ends shortly after that and on the car ride home, my dad tells me that i was a dick for doing that but i tell him that he was trying to act like a big boy who could play like that and that i wasn’t the a-hole for that. 

now i will admit, maybe that wasn’t the best thing to do, but as stated in the title, i wasn’t just gonna let him walk over me like that. 

so AITA for doing that?

TL;DR: cousin of mine was acting all tough and tried to play aggressive against me, i ended up putting him on his back.",22,38,0.9
297,Not the A-hole,"I had an older brother who passed away when I was too young to really remember him. I am saddened by this and have dealt with my grief in my own way. I also know that this effects a parent in ways that one cannot imagine and I have so much empathy for my mother. That being said, it really took a toll in how she raised me. She always talked about my brother, compared me to him, etc. I always felt like I lived in his shadow and that has been hard. I know she doesn’t meant to do this and I have tried talking to her about it, but she says it’s not intentional, so all I can do is get therapy for myself on the subject.

I don’t mind talking about my brother or even when my mom does. The main issue lies in that she’ll bring him up at times that aren’t the best. She will talk about it at holidays or family gatherings, starting to cry and really bring down the mood. Someone will always have to come comfort her, as she talks about how he should be there. And again, I do feel for her. She’s been in and out of therapy for years about this and I know it’s hard.

It only got worse as I got older and started going through the milestones. At my wedding, she stood up and started to give a nice speech to myself and my husband, but it soon veered into how she wished my brother was there, then how he’ll never marry and soon she was crying. It didn’t ruin my wedding, but it was sad after that for a while. Similar things happened when I graduated from both high school and college.

Recently, I had my first child. I posted a picture of her on Facebook doing something cute and my mom posted a long paragraph saying that she wished my brother was there to meet his niece, that he was watching over her from Heaven and how she couldn’t wait to tell my daughter everything about my brother. She added that she wished that my brother had been as blessed as me to have kids. The post then stopped being about my daughter and turned into prayers and well wishes to my mom.

Maybe it was just a mix of living in my brother’s shadow as a child and what she did at our wedding, plus not getting a lot of sleep because I have a 1 month old, but I got mad. I called my mom and told her to stop derailing my posts. I said if I post about my brother (which I occasionally do and my daughter was partially named after him), then yes, by all means talk about him. But I said I’m tired of everything always going back to him and for once can we talk about something else? She got really upset and said this was hard. I said I know, but she had two kids and maybe she could focus on me. 

Later, my dad called. He said what she did wasn’t right either, but that I didn’t get what it was like to lose a kid and hopefully I never did. I feel like shit now, but I don’t know. My whole life, I felt like I couldn’t do anything, without hearing “I wonder what it would be like if Tommy got to do that.”

299,Not the A-hole,"My husband and his siblings have a very distant relationship to their mother. My husband has told me a little about why and it is too long to go into much detail but the short version is that she is manipulative and highly dramatic and has caused a lot of problems for her children. Recently my husband has been diagnosed with Leukemia which has devastated us. He has had a few rounds of chemo so far and has been stable. A few weeks ago my MIL contacts me and is very civil and nice over the phone and asks if she can come stay with us for a few weeks to help us. We have 2 kids (7 and 9) and I work full time. My husband was absolutely against it at first but his brother calls and tells him that their mother has seemed to change the past 10 years and we thought that maybe she had finally learned her lesson. So my husband says she can come for 2 weeks to babysit the kid while he does chemo. 

She arrives, everything seems to be perfect she cooks, cleans and takes care of the kids while my husband recovers. She was even pleasant to be around. However one night, my husband is really sick after a round of chemo and my MIL is in the room with him, I come back from work and I can tell my husband really wants her to leave so he can sleep. I tell her that we should let him rest and we can make dinner. We both go into the kitchen and its like a switch flips. She starts screaming at me, telling me not to get between her and her son. She tells me that im a shit wife and mother because I am working while he is sick and I have abandoned the kids. I calmly go up stairs while she is still screaming at me from the kitchen, I pack up her suitcase and handbag and then go downstairs and put her bag outside. She sees what I am doing and asks wtf I am doing. I tell her to get the fuck out of my house. She screams at me again and I tell her I will call the police and she finally leaves. 

The fallout from this is now my BIL is telling me how I used her to take care of my kids and how she was just as stressed as me because her son has cancer. The extended family is now messaging me telling me how selfish and rude I am and now I feel like I overreacted. AITA for kicking her out after she helped us?",26,101,0.98
300,Asshole,"My sister has always been a mess. She's never really been able to stick to anything. She flits from country to country, state to state. Even her three year uni degree took 5 years due to her switching majors and subjects. On the other hand I married at 23. Unfortunately, we've had difficulty conceiving. I've tried three rounds of IVF but as I also have PCOS it has been a lot harder and have had two miscarriages in that time we've been trying to conceive.

When my sister flew into town last week she confided in me that she is only in town because abortion is legal here. I immediately offered to adopt but she completely flipped out on me. She screamed that I always wanted what she had. Her toys, clothes, and that even my husband was her ex and that this completely crossed a line. AITA?

301,Everyone Sucks,"This happened last Saturday. I want to start by giving some background.

I am a 20 year old male. I am living with three women and one man in a four bedroom house. We split the rent four ways and live in moderate walking distance of the university all but one of us attend. I am from Alabama originally, and they are all from California (LA to be specific). 

The lease is up early next year, and I am planning on ditching them on that day. They are fucking intolerable people. I am woken up, as a minimum, four days a week to somebody shouting about something somebody else did. The girl and her boyfriend have frequent meltdowns, which they occasionally take onto our front lawn, causing the neighbors in the surrounding houses to come out and stare. It is humiliating being the guy who lives in the house with the people who get into shouting matches regularly. Whenever they start, I go up to my room, close the door, put on headphones, and ignore them.

The neighbors have had it up to here with their crap and I don't blame them. Naturally I am often deemed guilty by association.

Last Saturday, at around 11 in the morning, they began having one of their arguments again. I was playing WoW happily in my room, but it was so loud this time I couldn't even concentrate. The woman shouted that she was leaving, and did her usual pretending to pack her shit into the car. Her boyfriend followed her out and they started their typical shouting match on our front lawn.

At this point I had just had it with their shit and frankly could not give less of a fuck. I put on my most raggedy pair of boxers, a wife beater that fully accentuated my gut and chest hair, grabbed a beer from the fridge, and went out sipping it and watching them. I went within five feet of them and started shouting things like ""who hit you in your face"" and ""dangit girl I'm telling you the boy ain't right."" In this middle-upper class suburbia, basically all of the neighbors were watching me put on the heavy Southern drawl while the two of them redirected their anger at me and it ended up becoming a three person shouting match with me playing the part of a drunk. 30 minutes later they had made up completely and now think I'm a huge dickhead.

I knew they would hate me for this, but the other members of our house have teamed up and now they're looking for someone to take over my part of the lease. I honestly don't give a single crap, but I'm wondering if I may be the asshole in this situation.",99,655,0.94
302,No A-holes here,"So one of my(27F) friends is getting married, and she has a VERY small guest list (30-35 people tops). She was a bridesmaid in my wedding, so we’re pretty close.

At the beginning, she told me my husband would be invited - which was nice of her - we did hang out together and they know each other (taken vacations together, Friends Christmas’ every year, etc), but it’s a tiny guest list and I definitely understand if she couldn’t swing it. About a month ago, I caught up with her, and she began complaining about how she couldn’t get away with disinviting certain people from the guest list. Having experienced guest list drama myself, I told her to just let me know if she needed my partner’s spot and it’d be totally cool. She doesn’t take me up on it - so all was cool I guess.

Until...we get the invitation. It was a lovely piece of mail and elated, I tell my husband to book the tickets. After he did, I texted her all excited and told her that we got tickets to her wedding and we’re very excited. That’s when she texts back and asks if my husband was coming too (as if she was surprised by it) and how she is hoping someone backs out of the wedding so she can open up a spot for him. I get SUPER confused because up until now she hasn’t said anything about him not coming - so to confirm I look at the envelope of the invitation and lo and behold - it was only addressed to ME.

I’m hurt. Not so much that he can’t come, but more that she didn’t have the decency to just call me and tell me about it. Especially since I already told her I was cool with it prior. I texted her to not worry about it and told her we would cancel our tickets and that I would just rebook to fly solo.

I don’t want to be THAT person who makes someone’s wedding about me...but WIBTA if I told my friend that I was hurt that she didn’t call and tell me instead of using the invitation to tell me that my husband can’t come?",71,125,0.96

304,Asshole,"(Using an old account since my family knows my current account)

My 20 year old younger sister (YS) is a recreational pot smoker in a state that has not decriminalized it. She’s been smoking for a number of years, but the family has adopted a “don’t talk about it” policy. My 26 year old older sister (OS) told her a year ago if she kept smoking pot, she would forbid YS from seeing OSs’ children, as she doesn’t want that influence in their lives. YS quit smoking because she takes being their aunt as the biggest thing in her life. She would do just about anything g for the three of these kids. After quitting, YS picked back up later and just about everyone except my older sister and her husband know. 

My wife and I have reached a breaking point with YS’s behavior after a visit gone wrong. We’ve tried everything in our power to get through to her and help her see that her demeanor and general attitude can’t continue. We got, in short, a “fuck you” before she drove home. After talking, my wife and I are considering coming clean to OS about YS’s marijuana use to finally get YS to see the consequences of her actions having a real world influence. But we’re worried that the family at large would be pissed because we’re breaking the “leave it alone” policy. WIBTA if I told OS about all this?

EDIT- I’m getting a lot of YTA and I totally get that. But I want to clarify idgaf if she smokes. It’s the fact that OS has said she doesn’t want it around the kids and YS is still doing it. And at the end of the day, everyone else is acting like it isn’t happening. I’d be doing the same thing for alcohol or tobacco use or whatever the fuck, it’s just the fact that OS set these rules and YS is actively going against them.",70,27,0.8

307,Not the A-hole,"Just to keep this as short as possible, I had a crappy childhood surrounded by crappy people, and my biological mother played a big role in that. She was a deadbeat alcoholic that spent the little money she got on alcohol instead of food for her children. Fast foward to now and she's gotten much better – doesn't drink as much, holds a (somewhat) stable job and lives in an apartment with her boyfriend. Her much younger boyfriend.  Just to help you get the picture, he's five years younger than me.

She's a 42-year-old woman prancing around with a 19-year-old. At first I found it kind of predatory and weird, but I learned to cope with it. They've been in a relationship for 1 year and today she announced that she was pregnant with his baby. I was baffled. Even though she seems like she has her life together, she's in no position to raise another child, and I'm speaking from experience.

Her boyfriend's not even sure if it's his. When I asked him, he just replied with a confused, ""I don't know, she sometimes says we're not really on an exclusive level yet so I'm not sure."" This is a 19-year-old, who may or may not be the father of a 42-year-old woman's child. Some 19-year-olds are mature enough to raise kids. My mother's boyfriend isn't one of them, and despite being in her forties, I'm pretty sure she isn't mature enough to raise any kids, either. 

You cannot raise a child in a small studio apartment doing cocaine after a night of drinking, and that's a fact. She's clearly so not ready for a baby and doesn't want to admit it. I don't want this unborn child to suffer like I did, so I eventually confronted her about it. ""Hey, don't you think that your boyfriend and you aren't ready for a baby in your lives yet?"" was enough for her to go absolutely berserk on me.

She was ballistic, crying, telling me how she felt betrayed that I didn't trust her and wasn't supportive of her decision to raise a kid with... another kid, essentially. And with that, she stormed off, refused to answer my calls and probably fed her boyfriend some bullshit about how I was the narcissistic son keeping her from being happy in life.

308,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for anonymity.

My parents passed away recently from a car crash (they were quite elderly). My sister and I are in our 30s, and the costs of two funerals is quite a lot of money for us. Because of such, our family lawyer friend who wrote our parents' will, is trying to expedite the execution of their will to pay for the funeral.


It turns out my parents left everything to my sister (around $2m), and gave me $50k cash. This is likely due to them not approving of who I married (she's a different race), but I was still shocked to hear how little they cared about me anymore, especially since when they were alive, they treated my sister and I as if we were equally loved. The worst part of it is, from what I know about law, they only left me the 50k so that I wouldn't be able to sue to my sister for half of the assets. The fact that they thought I'd even do that is what hurts more than anything. 

The will hasn't been executed yet and it may take a while, so my sister wants to plan the funeral without the money and pay off the debts later. She's asked to come over so we could plan the funeral and costs, and I told her no. I don't want to have anything to do with my parents funeral, whether it's helping pay for it or helping plan it. My sister seems very stressed, and I feel had about not helping, but every time I think of my parents now I get angry and upset.

316,Everyone Sucks,"A school friend is getting married and his wedding ceremony starts at 1:30 and goes until 5pm, then the reception starts at 5:30. I am not in the wedding.

320,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much what the title says. I am a 26 yo guy who lost my virginity to a prostitute when I was 24 and saw her a few more times thereafter. I realized that it didn't really make me feel any happier and it was also a very expensive habit so I stopped. 

I met my gf emma last summer (after more than 10 months after my last encounter). She is my first gf since high school (I wasn't sexually intimate with my high school gf). We have had an amazing relationship so far. We have same interests and political views and I thought she was probably the one I'll end up marrying. She is starting her Masters in fall and she told me she was thinking about doing research on sex worker rights and so we started talking about that issue. She is very much pro sex workers and so am I, so I told her my past sexual relationship with a sex worker. She first thought I was trolling her like I usually do and laughed it off. When I told her I was being serious, she LOST her shit. After a bunch of angry yelling and crying, she said she can't stand being around me and went to stay with her friend. 

She broke up with me shortly thereafter reiterating her main reasons (1) I lied to her about my sexual history (2) she can't respect someone who buys sex. I never lied to her about my history, it just never came up. As for not respecting me, I find this highly hypocritical given she feels so strongly about sex worker rights and wants to write a thesis on it. Anyway she told her friends why she broke up (which annoyed the hell out of me but whatever) and the consensus pretty much was that I was a loser asshole or I was an idiot.

321,Asshole,"Throwaway...

This year for my bday, I planned a group trip from LA to Las Vegas for the weekend. I invited 2 groups of friends and my little brother for a total of 12 people. The first group (A) are people that I went to college with so I'm very close with them. The second group (B) of friends are people that I met through my new job and at my church. I met them a couple of years after I moved so I'm a little less close with them. My little brother lives in the midwest but we are pretty close so he agreed to come for the weekend and hang out in vegas.

We agreed that we would split the cost of the airbnb and also the rental car for the people that needed a ride.

The first day goes well and everyone got along well. For the second and last day, we had a previously agreed on classic ""Vegas night out"" with a steakhouse dinner, gambling and a club. It was gonna be awesome.

Dinner time finally arrives and we get to the steakhouse. The service starts off a little slow and tbh, I was getting annoyed by the service. There were some gaps between courses but I got it since it was prime dinner time.

We eventually got our food and the meal was very good. We also got a free bday dessert which I shared with the group.

When dinner was winding down, the server handed me the check. I gave the check to my friend, Anna, from group B so she could charge the bill on her credit card and Venmo everyone's share before leaving. Sidenote: we usually do this versus throwing in our own credit cards so one person gets the credit card points. Also, everyone always pays their share through so we don't have a problem with people not paying.

Anna does the math and it's $83 a person. I asked Anna if she included or excluded me in the charge and she says she included me.

I then told Anna that usually when we do bday dinners with friend group A, we pay for the bday person. Anna seemed to be caught off-guard and awkward. She said she wouldn't charge me. Also, no one from friend group A decided to vouch or speak up.

After she said that, I insisted that she include me and that I just wanted to let her know since this is the first bday dinner we're celebrating together. In the end, she didn't include me in the charge and everyone ended up paying around $93, a $10 difference.

After dinner, I noticed that Anna and the rest of my church / work friends were being a bit aloof. I started feeling weird about it so I bought them drinks at the club ($100 dollars total for 5 drinks) and apologized for bringing up the paying for the birthday girl thing at dinner.

I'm starting a new job with Anna (she hired me as her replacement since she got promoted) and she will be training me for the next few weeks. Before I start a professional relationship with her, I just want to clear the air if there's an issue.

So, am I the asshole for asking that everyone split my share of my birthday dinner across all of them?",56,177,0.94
322,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago I was in a grocery store with my mom and my younger brother. He was going through a phase where he would film constantly and post his random videos on Instagram for his ten followers. I was pretty insecure about how I looked at the time, so I never wanted to be in the videos. I had very long, bushy hair that I usually kept tied back, which is important to know for the actual conflict. 

In the store, my mom was busy unloading her cart in the checkout line, and my brother had started filming on his phone. On that particular day I had reluctantly left my hair down. My brother picked up on that, and started following me around the store with his camera, calling me “Bigfoot,” which was definitely not a nickname I wanted to be associated with. I asked him to stop several times and kept turning away to avoid him, but he continued to follow me and stick the camera in my face.

By this time my mom was paying for the groceries. I didn’t know what else to do short of wrenching the phone out of his hand, so I turned to face the camera and said my brother’s full name and our home address into the camera, sabotaging the video so he couldn’t post it (he didn’t know how to edit things out at the time). 

My brother flipped out. He shut the video off and started screaming at me, which eventually led to our mom intervening and trying to make me apologize for ruining the video, which I refused to do on principle, then making him apologize for calling me “Bigfoot.” They both shunned me for the rest of the day for refusing to say I was sorry.

325,Not the A-hole,"This is a long story so I’m going to try and condense it way down so as not to bore anybody. 

My wife was black. I am white. She passed away 6 years ago after a drunk driver ran a stoplight. 

When we were together, her father cut her out of his life because she married me. He called me names, but the real problem was the names he called her, incredibly hurtful and demeaning and reduced her to nothing in his mind but a slave master loving traitor. 

He made it clear she was no longer his child. When our daughter was born, he sent an angry flurry of Facebook messages to my wife and called our daughter names I don’t want to repeat and only calmed down after he received an extreme backlash from his community when his posts gained notoriety. 

When she died, he didn’t even bother showing up to the funeral despite me reaching out via various platforms to try and reach him. 

My beautiful daughter is 11 years old now. My wife always made it clear how important it was that my daughter had a sense of black identity, and I have done everything I can do instil that in her. I am incredibly, incredibly close to my mother in law and she has many black and biracial grandchildren that my daughter has grown up with. Without her support I think I would have long succumbed to my grief by now. She has never known, or asked about her grandfather as my MIL and FIL had split up some 30 years prior. 

My wife’s father recently sent me a curt abrupt message telling me that he would like to meet my daughter as he misses my wife. I am filled with a variety of emotions, mostly returned grief over my wife, but I know this much- I don’t want to reconnect with this evil man, nor do I want him to see my daughter.

328,Not the A-hole,"I’m a chef, and am responsible for the cooks, servers and dishwashers in my kitchen. One server, Liz, is in her mid-20’s and has been with us for about 3 months. One day, she didn’t show up to work (with no prior warning/calling out), leaving us with only one server to cover that shift. We provided as much support to our lone server as I could, but could only do so much during the busy period and it was quite a hellish night for her.

I called and texted Liz again and again, trying to get in touch with her, and she ignored every message and call. Nobody at the restaurant has contact with her outside of the job or is connected with her on social media, so I didn’t have much of a way to find out what was going on.

Many days passed, and I came to the conclusion she’d abandoned her job. Sadly that’s been all too common in our restaurant (and the food service business in general); there are simply a lot of people who decide to quit for one reason or another or find another job, and don’t want to go to the trouble of finishing out their last two weeks.

Six days went by, and I crossed Liz off of the schedule, and in planning out the following week’s schedule, made it without her. We’d hired a new server recently just to get an extra set of hands, and with this new server, we actually were quite decently staffed even without Liz. We put her last paycheck in the mail and assumed that was the last we’d heard from her.

The next day (seven days after her disappearance) I received a call from Liz. She told me that her brother (who lives in town) had died in a car accident the morning of her “disappearance”. She told me that she’s doing better and that she’s ready to start back as soon as needed. She didn’t provide any apology/recognition of the long AWOL period, even anything small like, “Sorry, it’s been so long,”; pretty much just, “When can I start back?” I offered my deep condolences; but afterwards, had to tell her that we’d terminated her, scheduled someone else for her shifts the coming week, and said that I don’t think I can allow her back after this long disappearance.

Regardless of the circumstances, going an entire week without contacting your employer isn’t acceptable. I allow my employees to text message me, so it could have been as simple as shooting me a short text explaining things. Had she done this, I would have been happy to give her as much time off as necessary. And I could understand, due to the shock, someone taking maybe a few days to make contact. I wouldn’t have punished for this; I know that contacting your job isn’t your top priority when grieving. But a **full week** of absolutely no attempt to contact her employer?

I wasn't the most popular kid in middle/high school and he knows it. 

Recently, he has been bragging his popularity to me,as being more popular than most Seniors (he's only a Junior). After a week of this, this got me to worry about my brother's future. I didn't want this to get to his head, that this is how his life will be. The popular kids during my high school time certainly had that mindset, and now they are college dropouts working for fast food restaurants (of course a few of them are successful, I'm just generalizing). 

So yesterday, I texted my brother about this, giving him advice for his future. The main part being: his high school popularity won't mean anything in his future. My brother got mad at me, saying I was jealous and a bad brother. I shot back saying I couldn't care less about his popularity, and I'm just trying to help him out.

Some of these campers took up saying the phrase “humpty dumpty” commonly. They would use it to not particularly mean anything, the most meaning I could ascribe to it would be one particular use where they would use it as a frustrated interjection (“I can’t do that? Really? *Hump*ty *Dump*ty!”), but it had a lot of other seemingly meaningless uses as well. I have had problems in the past with repetitive phrases becoming annoying to the point of being mildly triggering (I don’t know if it’s related but I’m on the autism spectrum, relatively high functioning). The only way I can explain it is getting an unpleasant “ping” in my head whenever it’s said, kind of like hearing your parent say your name when you know you’re in trouble.

So since I was 11 I was friends with this girl(A.) We were inseperable for years and often could only rely on each other since we both had bad home lifes (she more so than I). She also was there for me after a car accident that I had when I was 18. She basically spent 6 hours everyday at my place for several weeks because I needed help getting dressed, going to the toilet and preparing food for myself.

About a year ago she got wasted at a party and ended up getting behind the wheel of a car and causing a small accident in that same street. Nothing happened but she got busted for DUI, which ended up costing her a job oppertunity that was really important to her. After this she was very sad and also mad at me because I didn't watch out for her enough that night (which is true) I tried to be there for her but she kept acting very cold towards me and badmouthed me in front of others, which caused our friendship to fall apart.

Now about a week ago, my boyfriend (of 6 months) told me that his older brother is going to be in a city near us for a day. This is a big deal because his brother is traveling 9 months a year for work and they rarely see each other. My BF was very excited to introduce us and we were going to meet in a bar thursday night.

That night about an hour before we gotta leave I get a call and it's A (the first time I heard from her in almost a year). She's crying and asks if I can pick her up from some place that's like 45 minutes away. I ask her what's wrong and if she can't just call an uber but she says she can't and won't tell me whats up.

She can't go home because she's living at his place; so she asks me to drive her where her car is; so she could sleep in there. I absolutely refused to let her sleep in the car after what just happened to her so I gave her my sweatshirt and drove her to her grandmas house.

I texted my BF inbetween but he didn't respond and when I got home it was almost midnight.

338,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for eight years, married for two, and had a baby almost four months ago. Our relationship was above average up until the late part of my pregnancy and since the birth. I know having a baby puts a major strain on relationships, but my husband has been calling me an asshole nearly every day for the last few months, and I want to know if he's right.

The thing that sparks conflict is when I ask him for help doing things. Eight months ago, I made a list of about ten things that I wanted to get done before the baby came. For example, hanging a picture in the nursery, fixing a toilet paper holder in the bathroom, replacing some light bulbs, etc. Small stuff, and it didn't get done. He had three months off of work after the birth, and he just returned to work two weeks ago. The stuff on the list still isn't done. 

I do all the shopping, cooking, laundry, bill paying, 95% of the cleaning, and 90% of taking care of the baby. When I ask him to help with cleaning, it's often a few days worth of nagging before it actually gets done. For example, last week, I asked him to change the cat litter box. He didn't do it for four more days, and the cat peed and pooped in the basement.

When I ask him for small favors, like refilling my water bottle while I'm breastfeeding, he rolls his eyes and says things like ""I'm not your servant"" and ""Why don't you ever remember to fill it before you sit down?"" 

I will admit, when a few days have passed and things STILL aren't done, I get pissed off and tell him he is lazy and being shitty. I try to be patient, but when dishes are piling up because the dishwasher isn't empty, and it's been several days since I asked, I lose my patience with him. 

Another thing is sleep. Right after our baby was born, he helped out by taking the night shift for a while. Now, we do bedtime routine, and I'm with her the entire night. My husband sleeps in the guest room. I've had trouble sleeping my entire life, I physically can't nap, and I usually take heavy hitting sleep meds for it, but I can't now since I'm breastfeeding. When I get frustrated, my husband blames my lack of sleep. When he went back to work, he got a straight afternoon position, so I told him it would be nice for him to be up a little earlier to spend time with us, since our baby goes to bed right after he gets home. He agreed, but when I wake him up at 10am, he complains that I'm waking him up too early. Because of sleeping in the guest room, his sleep is uninterrupted. Our baby is still up every 2-3 hours, yet he said my being tired was entirely my fault, and I shouldn't complain so much because that's all I ever do.

When I ask for help with the baby, he will help, usually without much complaining. He will watch her so I can go shopping or visit a friend, and he is pretty good with her. It's literally every other thing I ask for help with, he turns into a defiant, unmotivated POS.

I told her she has Mexican heritage and her race might be Hispanic, but she’s not Mexican, at least not culturally speaking. She got offended immediately and said I didn’t get to decided who’s Mexican and who’s not. I told her I agree with that but neither did she and asked her if she’s ever been to Mexico to which she got a little embarrassed because she hasn’t. She then said that I was being insensitive and racist and I answered that if she ever were to go to Mexico she would be considered a foreign by any and every measure, (language, clothing, customs, nationality, etc) and that there was nothing wrong with not being Mexican. She tried to argue more but I disengage because I knew it was not going anywhere.

Was I the Asshole?

Edit: First of all, thanks for yall’s responses, it helped me understand different points of views. My intention was never to offend her and it was more of a shock for me that someone would claim a nationality of a place she’s never been to or even speak the language of, now I understand she is claiming her ethnicity not her culture or nationality, that’s not a thing for many countries in the world. I just want to clarify a few points I saw come frequently:
-She never said Mexican-American to my knowledge , she just said Mexican.
-I never denied her heritage, I literally said she has Mexican heritage.
-Being Mexican or not being is not something to feel superior of, and it’s the same for every nationality.
-It also didn’t help that my cousins are in a very similar situation (American born and raised but they speak a little bit of Spanish and have been multiple times to Mexico) and they don’t claim they’re Mexican, they just say their parents are and they have Mexican heritage.
-If y’all could read the Spanish responses y’all could see they agree with me.",1199,1070,0.87

Before my boss made this months schedule, she asked me to try to only make my school schedule for two days a week which is a bit ridiculous and hard for me because I’m going to school for dentistry. I told her I will try and that next month before she makes the schedule I will need off for three Saturdays because I’m taking bartending classes (I want experience to potentially bartend at night). I even offered to take up another day during those weeks if someone would switch with me.

My boss then threatened to fire me. She said I was taking advantage of her by taking classes on weekends. That I know that the other employees can’t handle weekends on their own and that it was rude of me to schedule classes for those days. That since I’ve been working here for five years, this job should be my priority. I told her I was unable to do it any other day due to my school schedule and I want to do the class. She told me that I’m lucky she hasn’t fired me by now because I show up fifteen minutes late and it sets a bad example for other employees. She then said that everyone talks behind my back and tells her to fire me because of this. She then said the only reason she hasn’t is because I’m great with customers, constantly get positive reviews, and I’m the fastest with stock. 

I then said to her I wasn’t doing it to take advantage of her and that this job isn’t my main priority. She then called me lazy saying I never vacuum or clean while the other girls do. I told her I never saw anyone clean and you never told me to. She then told me they do it days I don’t work and she shouldn’t need to tell me I should just notice. Then said I have a lot going on and looking at a floor doesn’t always cross my mind, that I would appreciate if she told me things she wanted to do. She then told me I may need help at my other “lowlife jobs” (which I make more money at) and that’s not the way it works at a high class place like this. She then told me I’m falling behind other employees in raises because I don’t respect the business like them.

347,No A-holes here,"My brother started a business with a few financial partners and I was employed there from day one and helped build the company. 

After 3 successful years the partners voted to fire my brother as CEO, without cause, and forced him to sell his equity in the company at a severe discount. I could go into detail how this all happened but not sure it’s relevant. What’s important is my entire family (and countless impartial people that we explained what happened, including my best friend) all believe my brother was wronged by already crazy wealthy people trying to get even wealthier. 

I quit my job there even after I was given a raise as the remaining partners wanted me to continue working there. I can’t work work for people that are that dishonest and wronged my brother. 6 months go by and my best friend tells me he has an offer to work at my old company. (One of the financial partners previously employed my friend at another company years before). My friend asks if it would be ok as he doesn’t want to jeopardize our friendship, I explain that I won’t stand in the way of a good opportunity but he should know I have a real hatred for that company and the people who run it so I won’t be happy if he succeeds at work, I’d like to see that company go bankrupt. I asked what his role would be and he said something similar to what I was doing, operations manager, but still working out the details. 

I told him he could take the job and I’d be ok with it. 

My best friend takes the job and I later find out that he is the new CEO and was given equity in the company. Everything that was taken from my brother. 

Admittedly it hurts me way more than I thought it would and I know I told him he could take the job, but I don’t think he was honest with me about his offer to be CEO and I think that changes things.

350,Not the A-hole,"I have a very conservative Muslim coworker who emigrated from the Middle East to Canada and while she is a very nice woman (and great at her job) she can definitely rub people the wrong way at times with her inclination to make demands on them to behave in ways that correspond to her cultural views. 

Recently we were conversing and in the middle of it she stopped me and said ""could you not swear"" (I had inadvertently said  ""shit"" in the middle of telling a story). Now, I grew up in an environment in which swearing was like breathing so while I have worked very hard to curb it over the years things do slip out from time to time. With her, I make even more of a concerted effort to reign it in as I don't want to make her uncomfortable (given her staunchly conservative values/upbringing and my inclination to try and have a good rapport with people, especially ones I respect). 

Having said that, I also don't like being told what to do and the way she said it was much more telling than it was asking. Given this, and the fact that I *already* try to keep this in mind when I am around her, *and* given the fact that it's not an issue with anyone else at work (they also all swear around me) *and* (last one) she has a history of trying to get people to acquiesce to her whims but is not flexible in return, I was a bit annoyed. 

So in response I said ""okay, I can definitely try even harder to curb it if it makes you uncomfortable, but I have a question for you: If I should avoid making you uncomfortable I assume you believe it is only fair that you do the same for me, right?"" ""Well, what if I told you it makes me uncomfortable when people try to control my behavior? Would you then not ask me to modify my language to suit you?""

This was a hypothetical, said totally neutrally (no anger at all) and inquisitively, to raise a point and perhaps an alternate perspective. I wasn't abrasive or rude in the slightest and her and I have a good working relationship so I thought this might launch an interesting discussion between us. Well......WOW did she not take that well. She immediately said ""if you talk to me like that again I will take this to management"" and then proceeded to give me the silent treatment and has now done so for the last two shifts we have worked together. 

I don't understand her reaction and think it's patently absurd but people do tend to get upset when questioned it seems so I leave it to you: Is she being an asshole or am I missing something?

Today we were talking about the the refugee problem in Europe. I am a big supporter of helping people from active war zones find proper asylum in safe countries. She agreed for the most part but said that the people should be helped locally. And that they should be sent back if they misbehaved in the country they asked asylum at. She also said that there are too many Muslim immigrants here in Europe and that they can't behave themselves. Lastly she had the view that Europe would just let anyone enter which is in my eyes not the case. 

I said I found those views worrying and that I expected more compassion from her, especially because she's an immigrant as well. Her parents are very well off though, she's here for studies. She is planning to stay in the netherlands to work after she's done studying.

As I was ordering my shot, the bartender asked if I'd only like one. I made some lame ass joke about how I didnt think I could do two solo. It was a quiet night, and the only other person at the bar was a girl who made a joke about how she'd happily help. My exact words were ""fuck it, why not?"" And we did a shot. Had a short chat, I shook her hand, then said I had to go. Her face kinda froze, but I thought nothing of it and headed out. 

On the way home gf asked if I knew her, and seemed annoyed. I told her exactly what happened, and that I thought I'd make somebody's night by buying them a drink, and didn't think much of it. I mentioned that I've done the same thing for guys as well, and that I acted exactly how I would with a Male. 

That led to an argument later. I've been trying super hard to be more sociable and confident, and it felt kinda like I'd been slapped in the face for trying to be outgoing. Not the first time my gf has made me feel like that either, although I don't know of she's aware of the first time. 

Anyway, my female friend mentioned that she knows I was completely oblivious, but that its possible the girl at the bar was flirting with me. And she also mentioned that my gf might have felt like I was trying to flirt back.

Obligatory not me but my friend (33M) who's sitting next to me and needs to know if he's TA. 
I am typing as he speaks:

Background, I am a single, 33 y/o man. I have literally zero life experience with anything that has to do with babies and/or post pregnancy needs. 
I work in a normal sized office cubicle in a fairly large US city.  I share a cubicle with a woman in her mid 30s. We have worked together in the same cubicle for over 5 years, the environment has consistently been deafeningly quiet. Cubicles are set up back to back, our backs are facing each other. If I reached my arm back, I could almost tap her shoulder. We have a friendly relationship and get along well. 

She had twins a few months ago and just recently returned from maternity leave. Our office has a wellness room and she has been pumping breast milk there privately since she returned. This afternoon was the first time she was pumping at her desk behind me. 

The breast pump she was using was (from my research) a well known electronic machine. She was actively working at her desk while pumping. (Go working moms!) The bag of breast milk was in my peripheral vision, if I'm being completely honest it made me slightly uncomfortable but I can deal with it. I totally get it, you have to do what you have to do. That's fair. And she was covered. But if I'm being even more honest, I had one problem with it.

The noise. The repetitive noise. I am in no way shunning her to the wellness room to pump, but I feel conflicted as another repetitive noise in the workplace would be as distracting and not agreeable. Is there a way to navigate this?

360,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I turn 16 and can take my driving test in November. My parents have said I will be responsible for paying for EVERYTHING (gas, repairs, insurance, the car itself) that comes with having my own car. They haven’t offered anything to help financially with it, and I’m on my own, as well as finding employment to help pay for it. As well as that I have to pay $100 to park at the school each semester, so $200 for the whole year. On top of all of this, my parents want me to drive my 12 year old sister to school everyday. She goes to the middle school, which is about 5 minutes away from the high school. Also, the high school starts at 8:15, the middle school starts at 8:40, and my mom and dad have said if I drop her off an hour early and leave her there to go to the high school, they’ll take away my car, which I’m still confused on. I don’t want to have to be late to school each morning just to drop her off because she doesn’t want to ride the bus. Also, my parents said that I will have to pick her up everyday after school too. I ran track and field last year, and play golf in the fall, so if I have to pick up my sister after school everyday, I can’t do these activities. The high school gets out at 3:00 PM and the middle school gets out at 3:10 PM. My parents have said “chronic truancy” to pick up my sister will also result in me losing my car. I have tried to reason with them to no avail, as it usually ends in them telling me to “calm down” and “take a walk; stop having a heart attack about it.” Lastly, this whole thing is a nuisance to me because I have enrolled in AP biology, and a lot of times that class has projects or field trips in which I need to get to the school earlier than the start time. If I have to take my sister to school, and can’t leave her there early, then I will be in a deep hole with my parents, so that means I’ll have to opt out of all field trips and extracurricular activities in order to fill the demands of being the driver for my sister everyday.

My GA did not handle her death with any amount of grace. In the summer prior to her death, she stopped paying for any kind of maintenance of my GGM's house. She left the air conditioning not working and the plumbing was shot. When my GGM was finally put in hospice, my GA immediately started the process of gutting her house of all of her belongings behind our backs, selling her precious items and family heirlooms. She also took all of our family photos, and then strangely about five years ago or so sent them back anonymously to my uncle's house. She started arguments with family (about what, I can't say - I was a kid and my parents hate talking about it so I don't press) and she called my mom ""that thing you \[my dad\] married,"" making her cry. A lot of this was done in front of my GGM, who was incapacitated by her illness and unresponsive but still able to hear and understand everything. We ended up having to leave early because of one of these arguments, and while we were gone, my GGM died. None of us besides my great-aunt were able to be there for her.

Yesterday, I saw a notification on Facebook that my GA had sent me a friend request. I have no idea how she found me because my name on Facebook isn't my legal name, and as far as I know she hasn't sent requests to anyone else. I texted my mom about it because I wasn't sure what to do, and her initial response was, ""Ignore it."" But a few minutes later, she said, ""You're an adult now and I can't tell you what to do. If you're curious, go ahead and accept it. I'll support you either way.""

I think what makes this so confusing for me is that I really did love my GA deeply, and being cut off from her with no explanation or any real closure made my GGM's death harder to cope with. I felt like I lost two family members, and I've spent my life since then wondering where she is, why she did what she did, and why her actions were so unlike what I experienced with her as a child. I don't know what to do because I don't want to hurt or upset my family by contacting her, but I feel like doing so will bring me some type of closure, and I want to work on making amends if I can.

379,No A-holes here,"I work at a hospital as a nurse. A couple weeks ago I was talking to one of the nursing assistants who I was friendly with but never hung out with outside of work. She told me about her hopes about going to nursing school one day, and I asked her age and she replied that she was 19, and I encouraged her and told her she had more than enough time to start college and get her degree.

Three weeks later, I went to a bar downtown by myself for one of my rare nights off on a weekend. This bar is pretty popular in my town, they have live music almost every day and it’s always packed. They always have security posted outside and inside. I go there fairly often enough to the point where now I’m learning the names of the security staff and have made acquaintances with them. So obviously I was pretty torn when I saw the nursing assistant there with her friends, holding a drink. 

I quickly slipped away so that she didn’t see me. I debated for a while but eventually one of the security staff approached me to say hi and I ended up telling him that she was underage and I knew for a fact she was 19 because she had just told me 3 weeks ago. He immediately kicked her and her friends out. I’m not sure if he took her fake. 

I feel bad because I probably ruined the rest of her summer sneaking into bars. But I feel justified knowing that she could’ve gotten in a lot more trouble later and that could’ve compromised her getting into nursing school, or even getting trouble with our employer.

A few weeks ago I was talking with a friend/co worker who is in the same boat, and she mentioned going to an open house.  She showed me the listing, and I was quite impressed.  It basically has everything I am looking for in a home, and in a great location to boot!  The reason I never saw it before was the price was a little higher than the range I was searching in, but not to the point of being unaffordable. Nonetheless, friend seemed really interested so I just sat back and kind of smoldered in jealousy.

For some background I've always wanted to be a doctor. Both my parents are doctors, my wife is a nurse and I really enjoy the medical field. But I love, love, love, MMA. It's my passion, in fact I'd hoped to backdoor my way into an MMA career through medicine. I wrestled in high school, am a purple belt in JiuJitsu, train Muy Thai and am 2-0 in amateur MMA.  My MMA coach thinks I have a legit shot at turning pro of I can lose 30lbs and go into the flyweight division.

The deferment offer seemed like a message from heaven. This is my chance to really focus on MMA, maybe pick up my pro card and see where it goes. For sure before I pick up all the school debt and am forced to be in medicine for the next 30 years. I will never get this shot again.

The last time my sisters boyfriend was over, my niece saw me and him go outside and watched us out the window. When I came back in, she called my mom and told her I was outside smoking with a proud smug look on her face. Nothing happened to me or anything, but smoking is a serious tension point in my family and my mom has even threatened to take away my college education because of it. After this I told her that telling on people for something they could get in trouble for is not cool and remembered her how many times she’s messed up or broke something and I covered for her. She seemed remorseful somewhat.

391,Asshole,"Using a throwaway. There's a lot going on in this, but it mostly focuses on three women: my ex-wife, my current wife, and a female cousin. My ex and I have two children, neither of whom are biologically mine, which was discovered very recently and doesn't affect my love for them.

My wife is currently pregnant with our first child together. This started issues with my ex, who used it to basically reveal that our two children aren't biologically mine. Unfortunately, this means that a lot of her pregnancy has been dominated by legal issues with my ex. I've had to miss doctor's appointments to deal with going to court.

One of my cousins got pregnant around the same time. She's on her first marriage, and is having the first grandchild of both sets of parents, as well as her friend group. So naturally she is getting a TON of attention and pampering. Now, while this cousin is highly regarded NOW, this was not always the case and some of the favor is just the family trying to make up for the past. 

My cousin, while 36(?) weeks pregnant ended up in a car accident with her husband while out of state and ended up in the hospital needing major medical care. She has lost the baby. I don't actually know many details, but the accident wasn't their fault (drunk driver). Naturally, most of the women in our small family have gone off to help her.

My wife's baby shower is today and as of 8 am today, none of the women from my family will be attending. The two still in state aren't going out of ""being sensitive"" to [cousin]. To me this isn't a big deal as baby showers aren't a huge thing in my family. 

My wife blew up about this. She went on this whole rant about how nobody cares about her pregnancy, even though she was having my ""first"" child, how everything was about ex and cousin and she was always forced to but someone else first, no matter WHO they might be. 

Then there was a whole part about cousin and ex getting lavished with attention and whole showers while her baby was treated like a bastard. She then said that next we'd be asking her to surrogate for cousin because CLEARLY her worth was what she could do for everyone else. Which, no.

There's a LOT my wife doesn't know. I don't know if my cousin had a baby shower. That's not something men are typically involved in. My ex had showers because her family did them, and she technically had the first children, which biology or not, are my children.

My cousin was NOT always favoured. Some of this good treatment is to make up for her childhood. Also, this cousin had her child DIE. She's just having a reduced crowd. I'm sorry, but a baby shower doesn't outrank someone in the ICU. A healthy pregnancy doesn't outrank me losing my existing children. I told her all of this and now she's upstairs crying.

AITA?.

Mild update: 
Cousin is stable, and they hope to have her out of the ICU in a day or two and out of the hospital in ""a few weeks"". There will be a funeral for the baby after she is out. That's not usually done in my family but an exception because this must be her only child. Yes, this lines up almost perfectly with our child's due date, so they're going to hold the funeral sometime after. My wife has been asked to stay home for this.

392,Not enough info,"Every weekend we have this argument, and it always results in name calling and fighting.

I(26m) work 5 days a week doing physically demanding carpentry work. Constant running around in full sun, lifting heavy shit all day, moving around multiple big stacks of lumber, very tiring work. 

My gf(24f) is a stay at hone mom caring for our 15 month old. It too is exhausting because you have to constantly keep an eye on her and keep her from getting into things. And keeping a 15 month old entertained is no easy task. 

Gf wakes up at 7 on average every morning with child and I wake up 7:45 for work. 

When Saturday comes around, my first day off work, I feel so exhausted in the morning that I always want to have a day to sleep in. My girlfriend thinks she should get to sleep in on Saturday and we always get into an annoying bickering fight about it until we both end up waking up.

I know caring for a child is a full time too, I’m not trying to discredit her. I just feel like the comparison from being able to block off a room every day, and watch a kid play for hours while sitting on the couch, doesn’t feel as exhausting as doing extremely physically demanding work for 40 hours a week.

395,Not the A-hole,"So some background before we get to it; 

These cousins we will call Maya and Ayesha. Maya[40F] and Ayesha[40F] are my[20M] wife’s[20F] cousin’s who said we should plan a camping trip having it be their original idea. With planning, they do not coordinate in the group chat with any type of planning such as food, materials, and keep in mind they bring their S/O’s entire family without any prior heads up and didnt even up for the campsite. My wife’s mom did. So basically they went at somebody else’s expense making up more than half the camping roster with people we didn’t really know too well knowing it was supposed to be a close family thing only. They also go into the group chat shaming others for not being able to go which is super petty of them knowing some of us couldn’t get it off work. 

Anyways, I digress. First day my wife, her sisters, mom and I arrive at around 2PM so we set up and hit the lake. First ones there. Campsite has a no open flame policy bc it’s super dry during the season and only allow propane/gas fires. So we’re thinking shit there goes a waste of firewood and charcoal we bought, so we call both Ayesha and Maya to ask if they can get a grill that runs on propane since they haven’t done anything at all for us up to this point. We’ve spent over 500 dollars on food alone and we just need a grill to cook it. Being super cheap, both cousins say no to the grill because it was “too expensive” although there were cheaper options than what they were looking at and decide to get Chinese food instead so one of the wife’s sisters asks her friend to get the grill instead out of frustration. Ayesha, Maya, and all the people they invited show up and start munching on the food we bought cooked with the grill we bought as well. We start munching on the Chinese food too and next thing you know everybody’s done eating and they leave a fuck ton of leftover Chinese food for us to clean up. 

Coming over to the first night, the wife and I turn out at around 11PM along with her sisters and mom. The cousins are still awake with their people which is fine but there’s a 10PM-8AM quiet hour policy which they ignore. I wake up at 3:30AM to them blasting Michael Jackson and shortly after my wife wakes as well. We bought 2 campsites so that the cousins could be in their own site across with their people and we could still hear them. They’re talking so loud we think that they’re in our site still. It’s embarrassing actually because a random person nearby shouted out at 4AM “YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING LOUD” finally prompting them to lower the music but not their voices for the next hour and a half still. 

Fast forward next day we’re all ready with life vests, river tubes, etc. and they don’t come with anything at all asking us for our stuff.

   A few days ago I was sat in a vet’s waiting room with my sick cat on my lap in his carrier, waiting for him to be admitted for his x-ray.  While we were waiting, a mother and her child (about 6 or 7) entered the room with their dog and approached the receptionist to pay for something. The child noticed my cat and walked over to the carrier to look at him. 
   It started off innocently enough with him saying hello to him and saying he was beautiful but then he wouldn’t leave. He put his face right up to the carrier and started talking louder. My cat was quite agitated at this point and the child had obviously mistaken his meows as a sign of affection. He started jumping on the floor to try to get his attention and then started clapping his hands. I repeatedly hinted that my cat was sick and needed some peace and quiet but he didn’t listen. At one point I thought he was leaving but was actually attempting to get his dog from his mother to bring him over ‘to say hello to my cat’. 
 I finally snapped and told him, “Will you go away, my cat isn’t well!” He looked horrified and quickly retreated to his mother who gave me a death stare but said nothing. They eventually left.

399,Asshole,"First time poster, not native in English language, and using mobile. 

This might be long so here goes.

Backstory: I stayed in Australia for a few years to study and work (from November 2010 - March 2014). Worked after I studied and saved money so when I go back to my country, I'll have a bit of money to spend or to invest. Also, I have the income tax return, backpay from previous work, and other funds coming in from different sources. This all came in a few months after I came back and checked within the year (2014).

On to the story.

That money that came in, roughly around AU$4000, is considered as my emergency funds. Figuring that a student account does not close or have any inactivity fees assessed, I left my account alone for awhile since I still have a bit of money left I got from work. I thought that it would grow interest or at least be safe that I would not spend it on unimportant stuff.

After a few years, I thought of checking my Australian bank account to see if it has grown and if I can transfer funds from it to myself here in another country. I called up their hotline or customer service line and got my credentials reset so I could log in my account online (I forgot my credentials and could not reset my password online, probably due to security reasons).  It was successful and I got in to my account.

As soon as I logged in to my account, I noticed that I only had AU$9.xx in it. I asked the customer service representative (CSR)  if my account went dormant and if money was taken out because of it, the CSR told me that it is dormant and that there was a transaction made in 2014 that transferred to an account. It had a note in it in which made it clear who transferred the money. I thanked the CSR and ended the call.

The note in the transaction is my father's nickname. He transferred money to his account because he has a gambling problem before and was jobless at the time.  Still, it surprised me because not only that he did not ask me for money, but he stole it or transferred it to his bank account.

I messaged him and asked him if he remembered any transactions or if he took any money from my account. He denies it. I took screenshots of the transaction and he still denies it and tries to pass it off as my account being hacked. I deflected his theory and was asking him if he did it. He still denies it and is actually trying to come up with other reasons as to why there is a transaction like it.

Just to let you guys know, when we came to Australia, we came in as students. Our father helped us in opening a bank account so they can send us money for expenses. He had our accounts linked. I forgot all about this and thought that he would not take money from me. He did it to mum, though but that's a different story.

I blocked him in my social media and I am planning unveil what he did to mum when they go for a visit here next year. Would I be the asshole if I try to ruin his vacation by telling mum what he did?

EDIT: Thanks for all your comments. Given my situation, the most convenient approach to this initially is to have a talk with mum, then the bank. I'll give mum a call tomorrow (in hopes she's free) and give the bank a call on Monday.

EDIT 2: Just so everyone knows, my parents are currently living in Australia and so as my bank. I am in Asia right now (just wanted to keep the country a bit of a mystery or rather it might not be as relevant to the story) and the means of getting assistance/help from the police is going to be a dilemma.",84,472,0.96
400,Not the A-hole,"So this has been giving me anxiety recently. I don’t know what to think 

I’m a 23 year old (m) and I was on a night out with my friends all above 23 y.o. 

We were on the dance floor in an over 21s club and I made eye contact with a girl, we’ll call her Sarah. I went over and talked to Sarah. She seemed young so I asked her age - she said 22. I was surprised and ‘jokingly’ asked to see her ID which confirmed she was 22 and that her name was Sarah. 

We kissed and danced for a couple of minutes before her older sister came over (we’ll call her Katie). Katie asked me my age and I had a feeling what was happening. She told me her sister was 17, and called me a pervert. All the while, Sarah is just looking at her shoes out of embarrassment. I told her that we’re in an over 21s club, she told me she was 22 and showed me her ID. She explained that this was not good enough and I should have been able to tell she was underage. She also told me her name isn’t Sarah and is Lucy. 

We had a back-and-forth argument about this in which I apologized about the situation but I did not back down on the fact that I did all I could to clarify that she was indeed the age she said she was. She also looked a lot older than 17. 

A bouncer ended up coming over and saw Katie, who had started to cry at this point, and asked me to leave. Thankfully I did not react and I just turned and left. My friends followed after they seen this. 

They all found this story hilarious yet I have been left shaken by the idea that I so easily believed that an underage girl was 22 and that the bouncers were so quick to side with the girls. 

Had this have went further, i.e. we had slept together, and the police had gotten involved, I imagine it would have ended in a similar way. I would have been at fault

The guy whispered back, ""I'm texting my grandma""

This was absolutely baffling to me and I whispered, ""I don't care, put the phone away.""

He says again, ""Dude I'm texting my grandma""

I whisper again, aggressively, ""I don't care, put your fucking phone away.""

After the movie was over he came over and asked me, ""I didn't hear what you said earlier. What did you say to me?""

To which I replied, ""I said 'put your fucking phone away'""

I don't think he expected me to actually say anything back to him and he started saying something and just left.

Am I an asshole for confronting someone texting during a movie or should I left the movie to get a manager? I try to do the latter, but I hate missing parts of the movie because some jackass is texting.",146,341,0.89

404,Everyone Sucks,"Obligatory ""new redditor"" disclaimer. 

This is basically just what the title says. My parents moved to the UK from Italy in the 80s because my dad got offered a better paying job over here. I was born and raised in England, but we've visited Italy at least once a year since I was born and I'm very much connected to that part of my heritage. Both of my parents speak very good English (my dad to full fluency, mum to near full fluency), however they spoke almost exclusively  Italian around the house and raised my siblings and I to be bilingual. 

Because of this, oftentimes if I'm talking to my parents or a sibling I'll do it in Italian out of habit. This has never really been an issue until recently. I'm currently staying with my older sister because my housing situation got fucked (long story which basically boils down to landlords are evil lmao) and will often chat to her in Italian. Sometimes she repsonds in Italian, sometimes she responds in English, in which case I'll switch. My sister's wife, however, is kind of not okay with me doing this. She often accuses me of trying to exclude her from conversations and trying to talk about her when she's in the room. I've explained repeatedly that this is not my intention and it really is just force of habit, but she still seems upset. At first I tried filling her in on what was said (i.e. I'd start talking Italian, realise she was in the room, and go ""oh sorry SIL I was just saying to sister _________""), and then she began accusing me of being condescending and passive aggressive. I feel really shit because they're really doing me a massive favour letting me stay and I don't want her to feel left out or anything, but I'm kinda struggling to see that I'm really doing anything wrong. AITA for this habit? Is it as super rude as she says, or is she overreacting a bit?

EDIT: perhaps this is pertinent, and apologies for not including it, but my sister did suggest when they met that her now wife should learn a bit of Italian in order to communicate with our relatives who don't speak English. SiL refused on the principle that we live in England so she only needs English. She speaks a tiny bit that she learned in highschool, but flat refuses to learn any more.",183,363,0.94

406,Asshole,"I met a woman online a few months ago and we hit it off- in part because of a shared background of abuse. She's had it *significantly* worse and has major PTSD and also seems stunted in a few ways that resemble a layman's perception of autism. But she seems to really like me and says I'm one of the few people she can open up to about her past and her current anxieties. I like her company, and I could see myself becoming serious with her.

While we're both professionals of the same age, she's got an incredibly high paying job and is moving to a new, bigger apartment around the same time that I've been thinking of moving out of my own. She's seriously suggesting I move in with her after only like a half a year of dating, and part of me feels that's because she's becoming very attached to me due to some of her past trauma. I know she's in therapy and I trust that her therapist is making sure she is growing as a person and dealing with her demons. I told my partner that I don't want to move in with her unless I can meet with her therapist and be told that said therapist thinks this is a healthy course of action for her.

My partner was hurt, began sobbing, saying I didn't trust her. To a degree that may be true, and I feel I'm walking a knife edge between infantilizing this woman and looking out for both her wellbeing in the face of past trauma and my own stability. Some of the people I've told about this seem shocked that I'd ask to meet with her therapist, saying that's an immense intrusion into her life. As someone who's been in and out of therapy my life, while no one has ever asked me to see my therapist, I would have no issues with that and was never really told it was a huge faux-pas: clearly due to doctor patient confidentiality, the therapist couldn't tell me anything my partner wasn't comfortable with me hearing.

TLDR: AITA? I want the opinion of a mental health professional to make sure my partner isn't rushing us into cohabitating due to past trauma and psychological issues. Some say asking to see her therapist is an intrusion and breach of trust.

EDIT: In case I didn't make it clear, I'd want to see the therapist with her. I wouldn't set up a private meeting.",121,224,0.91
407,Not the A-hole,"My(28M) SO's(26M) father can no longer afford to live in his home due to financial reasons and to due to uninhabitable reasons. My SO's siblings have done nothing to help their father move out of this bad situation. It has been over a year since their father has asked the older siblings for help and as a last resort 4 months ago asked us for help. My SO only has 6k in his savings as he decided to splurge on dental work and luxury items after the New Year. SO and I are not married and do not share the same bank accounts. SO asked if I would lend money to help his father out. I refused to lend money straight out.

After talking to my former boss who turned Real Estate Agent, he advised me that the neighborhood was in a very desirable area and would sell for more if we fixed it up. SO does not have the money to fix it up nor do his brothers want to fix it up.

I then suggested to my SO that I should buy the home and then fix it up and sell it at a profit. That is what I did with the help of my former boss. Used all my savings to put down a down payment. Bought the house with the same highest offer another buyer offered, payed SO's fathers back taxes. Got a loan and fixed the home up and sold it for nice profit.

SO's father has now said I cheated him. That the profit I made from selling his former home should be his. Now SO's older brothers and sister are involved and are threatening to sue me as I took advantage of the situation and swindle their father out of his rightful money.

I told them to go F\*\*\* themselves.

Am I the Assholes in this situation?

  

Edit:

Wow, woke up to so many comments. More info on my situation. SO and I are a same-sex couple and have been together for 8 years. We do not have a real relationship with his side of the family; due to them no accepting us as a real couple. They have already disowned him. The only relationship he has with them is the occasional pleasantries and the holiday cards that we send them. That is why it took his father so long to ask for help as we were the last resort as no one else in the family wanted to do anything.

SO’s family was well aware of my intentions. SO’s father was present at every meeting I had with our real estate agent and my plan to take a loan out to fix the home up and re-sell it. SO and I made sure to contact the older siblings to make them aware and have the first option of doing what I was planning to do. Their reply was “We don’t have the time or the money to do that. Just sell the damn house!”

408,Not the A-hole,"I was invited to a dinner party at a friendly acquaintance’s house. This host is not as financially well off as me and we both know it (but they are by no means destitute, they are doing fine). The invite said they will have all foods and drinks and implied not to worry about bringing anything, but that you were free to bring something if you really wanted. I showed up with a bottle of wine. At the end of the dinner, the host announces that everyone will be getting billed for the cost of the dinner. That's the first time money has ever been mentioned. 

Next day, I get a message asking for the money. WIBTA if I ignored the request because I find it rude and inappropriate? Or, should I just pay, since the host has less money than I do and it would be a kind gesture despite their obnoxious social faux pas?

UPDATE:
Thank you very much for all your comments. An update, since some people asked:

I don't feel like making this easy on the host, so I have not responded to the message. Also, as far as I can tell, other guests have not paid either. However, I have decided that if the host contacts me again to ask for it, they must really care about this money, in which case I will pay and then cut off future interactions. I'm naturally more of a petty and vindictive than forgiving person, but I would like to do better, so this is my compromise. If I don't post any more updates after this, you can safely assume I was not contacted again.

Also, someone asked how much the host asked for. I don't want to give a specific number, in case they find this post (on the other hand, maybe it would be hilarious if they did), but let's just say it is roughly how much you'd expect to pay (tax and tip included) if you went to a casual sit down restaurant in New York and got one beer and one entree. It's a reasonable amount, *IF* it was mentioned upfront.

SECOND UPDATE: If anyone is still following this thread, I have some hilarious news to report: this host has messaged me again, not to ask for the money, but to ask me to recommend future dinner guests and also to invite me to their next party.",182,1034,0.96
409,Not the A-hole,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

410,Not the A-hole,"So a while back I used to date this guy for a bit but then I broke it off. After a couples months I began talking to him again and we were on the verge of dating again but he wanted to do it in person. My “best friend” really wanted him to come to her new house cause she was bored and I said yes even though I didn’t want to cause I just wanted to be alone with him.

So he comes over and I start to notice he’s acting weird and I catch on fast that he likes her. After a few hours he leaves and I tell her that I think he likes her. She told me she had 0 interest in him and that she wants him with me. After a couple days he stops texting me and then I realize that she has been sending him nudes (telling me they were having a nude pic “battle”) and that she still had 0 interest in him. Some drama happens and he ends up sleeping at her house for a week (which she told me to stay with them the entire time.) While we were all staying at her house they would act like a couple and he even started fingering her when I was around. She knew I was upset about this (I have told her many times and even cried over this) and when I got mad she said she didn’t even know if she liked him or not. She even would invite me over and then third wheel me or put plans that we made behind just to be with him. I decided to unfriend her and we had a fall out then made up months later.

Then she recently got a new boyfriend, but sadly did the same stuff with putting him over me like always.

Anyways, so my birthday is approaching and I got invited to their New York trip (her, her bf, and two of his friends). I have told her she better not third wheel me like she did in her previous relationship (which she said it was the guys fault cause he was the one who initiated the third-wheeling) So the day comes where we are driving to New York and everything is fine. Then the second day she rarely talks to me, is constantly stuck by her boyfriends side, and whenever someone wants to do something she would control the situation. Then later she went on top of her boyfriend and started making out with him in front of everyone. I told her “hey can you not do that in front of everyone. Its awkward” and she got mad and locked herself in one of the rooms. I tried talking to her and saying how I barely got to talk to her and I just hate PDA and she just replied with “Oh im sorry you are jealous of my loving relationship.” Then the next day (which was my birthday) she ignored me the entire day and only talked to me if her boyfriend wasn’t around. There was even a point where me and the other two guys were left outside in the rain waiting for them cause they went god knows where and kept saying they were coming out soon but never did. 

After I came back from the trip I decided to unfriend her cause she never cares about our friendship and picks her boyfriend over me every time. My friends called me an asshole cause what she’s doing is normal. So am I the asshole?",19,59,0.88

412,Not the A-hole,"Some background, I (22m) always had a pretty good relationship with my dad, but ever since my parents got divorced and he moved out when I was 11 we've struggled with distance. Neither of us are good at texting or calling first. He lives far away, in another state actually, and comes to my area for his work (general contractor). So we talk on the phone maybe once every couple weeks and see each other maybe once or twice every few months. 

When I do get to see him, he'll usually bring my half-brother, I'll call him Henry, with him. My step-mom is a stay-at-home mom but my dad says he wants Henry to come along with him to work sometimes like he used to do with me. I think that's fair, as I have really good memories of  going to work with my dad when I was little. 

My dad's birthday is in a couple of weeks, and I told him I'd treat him to a beach visit and steakhouse dinner when he was next in town. I had one request, though, that he for once leave Henry at home with his mom. I like Henry, but he's an 8 yr old as well as autistic and can be very disruptive and demanding. i.e. Sometimes when me and my dad are talking he'll start screaming until we stop because we aren't paying attention to him. I thought it would be nice to, for once, have a little father-son time just me and my dad, so we could talk and catch up and hang out since I haven't seen him in a few months and I miss him. 

My dad didn't like that at all. He asked if I didn't like Henry (I haven't spent a whole lot of time with him, relatively) and I said no, I love him like he's my brother because he is, but he's also a loud little kid which makes it hard for my dad and me to talk one-on-one. Dad got real stern and said that Henry is a part of my family too and that I shouldn't try to exclude him.

I said well, I don't really want to pay for an expensive steakhouse dinner if Henry is going to be there wailing and screaming the whole time (he's horrible in restaurants, maybe a sensory thing?) and my dad hung up. 

I texted him this morning and asked if he was still planning on coming over in a couple weeks and he hasn't responded. AITA?

Well. A few months ago we agreed for my SIL to move in, and it's driving me insane. 

These two are codependent to the extreme. They stalk each other on a tracking app, my wife constantly texts SIL during dates to remind her to use protection, they work out OUR finances together, and SIL is like a cliche nagging wife who actually tries to forbid my wife from things. My wife showed interest in a rugby club (rugby is a passion of mine) SIL told her no, insisted that my wife will get injured and forever ruin her military career. We have a motorcycle, SIL keeps voicing disapproval and has requested my wife stop riding. She even tried saying that even though our state permits lane splitting, it's illegal federally so wife can't do it. Uh...last I checked pot is illegal federally, and you've done that.

We're gay and saving up for Dinah Shore because it's a bucket list event for us, SIL started lecturing my wife that we shouldn't be spending money on that and should be financially responsible....she leased a brand new car and doesn't have a job. We're already paying rent, utilities, and the phone bill, and she said she might need our help soon if her savings run out before she gets a job. Who needs to be financially responsible?

What gets me the most is they do EVERYTHING together. Gym, errands, SIL controls the TV, cooking, dieting, NAPS. I don't even get to nap with my wife without having SIL right next to us! I keep asking my wife when the hell I'll stop being the third wheel, and she just gets angry and tells me that they're twins and I don't understand the relationship.

She got back late tonight (as usual) and I asked her if she could pick me up from work tomorrow as I won’t have a car. She said she couldn’t because she was going hiking with her boyfriend and his family. 

Hurt at the obvious irony, I said angrily, “So you won’t pick ME up tomorrow because you’re hanging out with his kids, yet you left me today to pick THEM up?”

419,Not the A-hole,"Long story short and vague as possible.

I work at an office, three other people work there as interns, while two are full time employees, the gist of it is interns don't get paid directly by our boss but rather by the state. We are only allowed to work part time with wage/ hour caps.

Our boss is super nice and flexible, seriously this woman is the nicest person on the planet, I'm sure she has her flaws but she's the best boss I've legit ever had. Anyway, its a very close work environment and I genuinely love and respect my coworkers, they're all great people.

The way that we get paid through the program is that we have weekly timesheets that our boss has to sign off on. I noticed one of my coworkers filled up a timesheet for a week that she didn't come to work. Like she straight up didn't come in for one day but wrote she was there for the full week.

I decided to tell my boss about it, I figured the girl either didn't tell the boss she would make up the hours for that week or she just straight up lied.

I asked my boss if the coworker had discussed making up hours with her and she said no. She then told me to call my coworker and ask her about the discrepancy in the papers. Essentially, to tell my coworker that she would either have to make up the hours or not get paid for them.

I told her that I wasn't comfortable with doing that, she told me she doesn't have the energy or time to take care of the issue.

My daughter has one child already. I handled the news of the first pregnancy fine. It was unexpected, but we all adjusted and we were doing well. After that, she was very firm on not having more kids. That’s why I never expected this. About a year ago, she had a kidney infection and it’s genetic. Recently, she’s had to go to the ER constantly due to excessive nausea and fainting. My wife takes her and I have to stay behind with our younger kids, and my granddaughter. My wife and daughter would tell me that it was because of her kidneys and that she had issues with hydration. This happened several times in a one-month span. I was getting very nervous and would offer to go with them to the ER, but my wife insisted it just be them.

Finally, my daughter sat me down and owned up to the fact that she was pregnant. She said it wasn’t planned, that she was disappointed in herself and that the real reason she had been going to the ER so much, was that it was a complicated pregnancy. I wasn’t upset about the pregnancy in the slightest. I congratulated her and said that we would find a way to make it work, asked questions about the condition of the pregnancy.

However, I was upset that she had been lying to me about what was going on. Her kidney infection was serious and threw us all for a loop. I thought we were going through it again. I didn’t say this when she announced it, but waited a few days before sitting her and my wife down, saying they should have told me. They explained they were worried about my reaction. I asked why, considering I was fine last time. They said, because the “timing is bad”. I said even if they didn’t want to tell me, lying about her kidneys was a jerk move.

At 9:30 right before Korn comes out and 3 hours after the pit was open, someone in a wheelchair essentially shoves their way all the way up to the fence and told us to move for her. Nobody did. She could have got there sooner, and there's designated platforms for the disabled so they can see the show clearly. Some woman started berating us on the wheelchair lady's behalf and recording us, and eventually she bullied her way to a spot where she *stood.*

I don't think she wasn't handicapped, but she was able to bear it for the next hour or so. The woman that took her side also got real frustrated when the mosh pit opened up behind her at a metal concert and weren't mindful of the disabled person.

In my opinion, if she wanted to be up front on the fence, she should have came sooner. If she had issues with being moshed, she shouldn't be in the front row of a metal concert. But I also see how I can be the asshole here. I could see over her chair and she can't without being in the very front, but I wasn't exactly taking up as much space as she would have needed anyhow.

426,Not the A-hole,"My ex-wife (EW) and I have been separated for going on two years now, divorced for one and let me tell you it was not pretty. In the end we agreed to shared parenting so 50/50. And up until this point other than the obvious things about EWs parenting style that I didnt agree with, there have not been any major issues. 

Until now. 
 
EW and I have one daughter, she also has three older children from a previous marriage. She lives in a two bedroom apt with her boyfriend and on frequent occasion a friend will stay for an extended time. So that's four children under 8yo plus two maybe three adults. It's not a big place guys.. 

So here's the issue. I recieved a message from EW the other day along with this picture of this younger girl, telling me that she had a ""foster kid"" who was staying with her now. Well ok, that's random, but ok. I then started to think about it. All through the divorce I worked with CPS in seeing if they thought I had grounds to get my daughter completely. The living conditions in the apartment are abysmal. Every room trashed, trash cans overflowing, the back porch piled with trash bags. Beer cans everywhere, you can smell the weed from out in the driveway. You cant see the floor in the kids rooms because of the toys. (And these aren't nice toys. She would bring home bags and bags of toys from yard sales, I begged her to go through and toss at least a couple, to no avail)

Its not just living conditions. Countless times I have l
Picked my daughter up dirty, not having eaten a proper meal all day and it's well into the afternoon. EW will sleep, alot......  leaving her boyfriend to tend to the kids. Not saying that's wrong necessarily, but the amount she does it is an issue. I never nap while I have my daughter. Own up to your parental duties. Because your setting a bad example. 
 
And let's just get this clear, the girl is 12. I would never just ask to have her kicked out. But hey I got ya to read this far! 

WIBTA if I asked for her to maybe consider the option of finding the girl another place to go, or some other option. Because I'm trying to think I of this girl, and how staying in this environment would not be the best thing for her. I will basically be calling EW out on her parenting abilities. Which at this point we have obviously discussed. Kids are stressful. I already know EW cannot handle the stress that is currently present because I hear stories from the kids. And if add another kid to the mix it just gets worse. What do you guys think... and I just being an over protective dad?... or is this assholeish..

We all have a good laugh and after which we are still looking at the persons whose turn it is for clarification. I chime in and say you obviously mean ""oriental"" so you don't have to drink. I get a glare for my coworkers friend who is ""Asian/Oriental"" and she says ""you're not allowed to say that"". To which I responded ""why not?"". She said ""you just can't, it's racist"". After again asking for clarification she couldn't explain why it's offensive. Finally I said okay then let's say never have I ever slept with someone whose background was Chinese, Japanese, south Korean and listed as many ""Oriental"" countries as I could think of.

433,Not the A-hole,"I invited my friend, K and my boyfriend to my birthday party. This was planned months beforehand and we all agreed on the timing and that we would all pay for ourselves.

K showed up an hour late and had us wait while she took another hour to do the appointment she was late for. She was glued on her phone the whole day, was uninterested in making conversation and did not pay for herself. My boyfriend and I paid for all of her food and drinks despite us all agreeing to pay for ourselves. This happened because once we got the bill, she acted like she didn't know what was going on and was on her phone and wasn't ""ready"" to pay.

At the bar after dinner, she kept telling me to shut up as she was starting to find me annoying.

Afterwards, she overstayed her welcome at our place. She had one alcoholic drink and I offered her to stay for an hour or two to sober up and even offered her a cab or uber back home. She denied and stayed over 4 hours until 12AM when she decided to call her brother to drive her home.

Before she left, I tried to order food and she ripped my phone out of my hand and did not return it for the rest of the night as she deemed I wasn't ""allowed"".

I am fine with her staying over until she felt sober enough to drive. I would rather she chose to be smart and safe than endanger herself or others. I didn't mind paying for her either though I was annoyed that she didn't pay for a single thing.

A few days after, I mentioned to her that I felt it was unfair that she showed up late, had my boyfriend and I pay for her, and overstayed her welcome. I felt like she was there out of obligation and not because she wanted to.

She apologized, ""I'm sorry your boyfriend didn't like paying for me and I'm sorry you didn't like my energy. I forgot to get you a present and card.""

I felt hurt at the way she apologized and acted and communicated this with her. She has since ignored me and any attempts to connect with her. I felt bad like I stepped out of the line for being upset. But I also don't want to be friends with someone who takes advantage of us like that.

434,No A-holes here,"I know that title sounds bad but hear me out.

So me and my brother are 19 now, when we were 12 we sadly lost our father to cancer. It hit all of us really hard, but my brother never really recovered from the “side effects” of it all. As a family we became somewhat introverted for a bit after his loss and started eating more fast food. Eventually after our grieving, life got going again and we found motivation . My brother on the other hand became lazy, he just wanted to stay in his room, watch YouTube and eat what he wants. He has remained this way. We naturally stopped being close because our life styles became so different. Things have continually gotten worse since we turned 15. I believe it’s at that point he became self conscious because or our differences and started to dislike me for them. He’s blatantly overweight and I’m in good shape,He’s introverted and i have friends etc. I met a girl when I was 17 and we quickly became best friends. It was pretty easy to tell my bro had a huge crush on her but I never put much thought to it. Last year Me and her became boyfriend girlfriend and it’s been great...until a month ago.  When I told my bro I was dating her he seemed to shrug it off like everything else so I just excepted that that was that. I was planning a big date for our 1 year anniversary and telling him and mom about it, my brother seemed like he was angry but trying not to show it. When I went to his room to ask if he was alright later it went like this. He straight up started yelling at me and claimed that I’m dating her just to spite him and that I ruin everything he likes (whatever that’s supposed mean) he said I have no right to rub my “perfect life” in his face. It was like he was having a panic attack I didn’t expect any of this, it was like he was trying to release years of pent up hate he held for me all at once. At that point I was furious and told him he had no right to blame his shit life on me when it was all his fault. And the one thing I regret saying was “dad didn’t die so you could use his death as a damn crutch” honestly I think my brother has though. Whenever we’d make a huge effort to get him to make friends, get healthier, or get a job “suddenly” he’d get really sad about dad and say he “just needs more time”. I left after what I said and we haven’t talked to each other in a month. Our poor mother doesn’t know what to do anymore. She doesn’t blame me for saying what I did but wishes I didn’t. My girlfriend has helped me a lot with this and is completely on my side.Am I in the wrong here? Should I have tried harder to help him? I will never regret falling for my girlfriend and if I get my way I’ll marry her soon, but should I have talked to him about it first before dating her? Anyways I’m sorry for this rambling mess so I’ll leave it hear. Am I the asshole?

439,Not the A-hole,"Recently my daughter (7) made friends with two sisters, (5 or 6/pre-teen) in the neighborhood. Now, this isn’t the greatest of neighborhoods, but isn’t the worst. I'd let them inside for dinner, I'd send them home with snacks, all that jazz. I could tell that they were starting to take advantage of me more though..asking for more and more, stealing snacks behind my back, just generally pushing boundaries. And when they'd ask my daughter to play, sometimes she wouldn't want to and they'd basically bully her into playing with them. Eventually my daughter got fed up and started just saying no and slamming the door in their face.

Around 1pm they asked to play. She said no. They left. Around 3pm they tried again, my husband answered the door and told them to stay off the porch. Around 5:30 he left for work, and I took a nap because I wasn't feeling well.

Around 6:30pm I get several facebook messages from my neighbor informing me that I forgot to lock my door and her husband caught them with a ton of my daughter's toys that she leaves downstairs trying to exit my house. They kept screaming ""But the door was unlocked!"" I forgot to lock it when I took a nap. Mistake, but not an excuse. 

So I did what any logical parent would do, I went to have a talk with their mom. They were outside and I informed them I knew what they did. And they were denying it. Even changed stories a few times saying ""Well the door was unlocked!"" to ""We havent even been over there since her dad left!"" Brother answered the door to ask what was going on. He seemed genuinely concerned and got his mom. Mom came to door. Now I’ve seen crackheads in person, this was a crackhead clear as day. She kind of struggled to fully comprehend what happened, but she understood her two girls just tried to rob me. Whether they actually understood what they were doing was wrong is up for debate, but she did say she'd keep her two girls away from my house. The girls seemed more concerned that they were going to get in trouble.

Now I'm kind of torn on if I should leave it be, or call someone? When these two girls would come over for snacks, they'd act like they hadn't eaten for days and were blown away by my pantry. My pantry really isn't all that...we have some snacks but we're by no means well off. At one point in time the youngest sister came over specifically asking for dinner because they weren't having dinner that night. But now I'm also starting to wonder if they were even being honest about that or if they just preferred what were serving.

My gut is telling me things probably aren't great over there, but should I report? Especially since I've already told the mom what happened? I don't want to start shit or make a potentially already bad situation over there worse. It already feels kinda tense. If I call she's going to know it was me.

She comes back through minutes later, I’m outside on the front steps using the phone, my dog is laying feet from me on the stone walkway. This time she says “you don’t get it, my dog will literally rip your dog apart.” Calmly I said “lady if your dog isn’t trained you shouldn’t be walking it around the neighborhood where it will be attacking other dogs given the chance.” She said “the dog is in training, but we can’t just train it overnight, it’s going to rip your dog apart.” 

I did my best to keep calm, but I failed. I love dogs, but I said “if your fucking dog comes near mine trying to attack it, I’m going to shoot it before it gets the chance. Don’t bring the dog around here until it is trained.”

441,Not the A-hole,"Usual apologies for mobile format.

Recently my parents looked after my son for the weekend while I was away, and they invited my elder sister, his Aunt over to the house so he could spend time with her. 

A bit of backstory - me and my elder sister do not speak. She stole alot of money from me, and took a large loan out in my name without my permission and left me in alot of debt.

I've cut all ties with my sister, she doesn't have contact with me, my son or his mother and its been like this for a while now. 

When I picked my son up this evening from his mums house, I asked him if he had a good time last weekend, what he was up to, and he told me he seen Auntie X. He is 4, and obviously doesn't understand the politics behind it. 

I phoned his gran and asked if she invited her over, and if so why? I told them straight up if they're going to invite her around to spend time with my son when I'm not around, then they won't look after him again. I was upset at the time and it may have came across a bit irate or annoyed and now they're upset with me because of ""how I approached"" this situation. 

My frustration came from them inviting her over and also not telling me about it, but they think I'm over-reacting and I should now forgive auntie X for her mistakes and play happy families again, that my son had a great time with her and he's missing out on alot. 

At this point I told them if that's how they feel, I will be cutting ties with them too since she stole from me and they are now sympathising with her and taking her side on the whole ordeal, I can't trust them either.

My dad got involved and is now threatening to make me pay back all the debt (he helped me out financially when this origionally happened) if I don't start speaking to my sister. I hung up the phone and don't plan on contacting them again. 

AITA? I cannot see any way where I'm in the wrong for not wanting to build bridges with my sister, or be okay with my parents going being my back with my son.

448,Not the A-hole,"I struggle with narcolepsy and depression. It is something I do not openly discuss at work because it's really nobody's business but my own. But as a result, I get burned out/stressed/overwhelmed/exhausted seemingly more often than the average person. Instead of ""sick days"", my workplace has paid ""personal days"" which are generally used for colds/flu by most people. But the idea is that you can *also* use them for mental health and wellness days. I generally have a good immune system, so I use my personal days when I am very tired or depressed.

During an especially stressful season at work, I took personal days two Saturdays in a row. It's retail so those are peak busy days, and the store is high-volume. That is exactly why I felt I wasn't capable of facing the day and doing a good job.  I was a low-level manager and there were 2 other managers working, so I knew they could survive without me. The second Saturday I was in such a dark depressive state I did not even realize I had taken a personal day just the last week. I was so burnt out, it felt like it had been weeks since I'd had any time to relax. Again, my role is not critical. I'm sure it was harder on the team with one less supervisor, but it really shouldn't have been a big deal.

To be fully transparent, I should mention that I never told my coworkers or boss that these personal days were for mental health issues and not a cold/flu. I personally don't think it's lying that I said I was 'sick', but I do recognize that it was misleading. 

Cut to a month later, and it's employee review time. It's mostly pretty basic until my boss criticizes me for not being a 'team player'. I'm flabbergasted. In spite of my neurological condition and depression, I always work really hard, I take initiative, and I make less mistakes than some of my peers. I ask for an example. She immediately brings up how I took two Saturdays off in a row the previous month. I was so taken aback all I could say was, ""Well yeah, I was sick."" She talked about 'planning alternative solutions' or something and how I should 'consider the team'. I was incredibly hurt by her comments and was quiet the whole rest of the review.

In retrospect, I kinda get it. From her perspective: I took two Saturdays off in a row and I didn't seem to be visibly ill. Easy for her to assume I was just taking the day off to fuck around while the store struggled through a busy day with one less manager. From my perspective: I am not obligated to reveal personal health issues and/or deal with the social repercussions of calling in 'depressed' or 'tired' instead of 'sick'.

This situation really bothered me because I felt like I was justified, but I also felt really shitty/guilty about putting extra work on the team for what *to them* seemed like no reason.

TLDR: I called in 'sick' on two busy retail days when I was depressed and exhausted. Store has difficulty with one less supervisor. Boss brings it up, implying I did something wrong.

At the start of the year one of the girls in my group, Chloe, informed me that one of her friends was interested in me. Her name is Hannah and she is a medical student, and top of her year. My lot met up with her and her girl friends in the park. I saw Hannah and thought she was gorgeous, but after talking to her properly I really didn't want to go out with her. She was shallow, snobby and up herself. She kept bragging about how her parents were in the property business and had paid for all her studying expenses, so she didn't have to work while studying or pay back a student loan. She also talked about how some ''stupid'' people in her class should be working in mcdonalds and also how ''ugly'' some of the girls in her class were. I told Chloe I was not interested in dating her friend and she got annoyed. A week later I was told I'd made Hannah cry when Chloe told her. 

In march I met a girl called Zara. She's lovely and is studying computer science while working in a coffee shop part time. Really pretty and smart, but also a really friendly and nice person and we've been dating since then. 

Unfortunately a lot of the girls and some of the guys in my friendship group are strongly convinced that Hannah is the right girl for me. She's pretty, smart, comes from a well off family and has a glittering career ahead of her. She's also a spoiled bully, who has caused problems for quite a few people at uni. My friends have met Zara and are convinced that it's just a ''fling'' and that I'll choose Hannah eventually. 

Zara and Hannah met on a night out, and Hannah was blatantly on drugs and started going on at me about how I picked a ''fat tramp'' over her. Me and Zara left soon after.  

After uni finished we all made plans to meet soon, but I was told ''you can't bring your girlfriend'' as Hannah was coming and ''it's not fair to her''. This was too much for me and I left the group chat. A fair few of them tried to call me but I ignored the calls. 

They were good friends, but frankly if they refuse to accept my relationship with a truly lovely person then I don't want them to be friends with me. Zara thinks I should reach out to them but I think it's pointless.

I got married on Saturday. It was amazing, but for an argument with my mom. Before our ceremony, my wife and I scheduled family pictures. While the photographer was setting up her camera, I noticed my mom wearing one of those ""awareness bands"" that shows support for a cause. The band was white/green and definitely stuck out against what she was wearing and her other, non-rubber jewelry.

I said ""you're gonna take that bracelet off for photos, right?"" She looked at me as if I'd said something insulting and shook her head. It was so bizarre I thought she was joking, so I said, ""seriously you're not going to wear that, right?""

She dramatically said: ""Do you know why I wear this?"" I said no, so she said again, ""But do you know why I wear this?"" I had no idea, so I asked why. She said she's worn it every day for the past 4 years after promising her neighbor across the street who had cancer she'd never take it off.

Let me be clear, I have no idea who this guy is. I have no idea if he lost his fight. I couldn't tell you his name nor give details and my mom only referred to him as ""the man across the street."" I know all of my parents' friends and neighbors. I haven't heard a thing about someone with cancer who gave her this band. I've seen my mom wearing it, but I figured she got it at work.

I gave up and gathered the rest of the family. When I got back, I noticed she took it off. She left it off for photos, which took 10 mins, then immediately put it back on. I thanked her for being a team player. Our wedding was a blast, but mom seemed off at the reception.

Turns out, she's still upset over it a week later. She claims I ""bullied"" her into it and said she'll never take it off again, and never give into me like that again. She also complained about it to other members of my family. I can't understand why she felt bullied. I didn't ask in a mean way, and I was so flabbergasted about her attachment I couldn't believe we were even having the convo. I was more incredulous than anything.

She says I never should have asked as it wouldn't have been visible, but we hired a good photographer with nice cameras. The photos are all high-res, and we didn't want a bright band in them. No one else had any problems; our siblings took off their sunglasses when we asked. We've seen a few previews, and they look so good! You definitely would have seen the band had she not taken it off. I can't believe she was so upset that it hurt her enjoyment, and I'm shocked and hurt that she's still upset over it and thinks I'm a bully.

We made few demands on our parents on our wedding day - just these photos and quick toasts at dinner. Is it too much to give into a request to take off the band for a few minutes? How do I even address this with my mom because she is surprisingly sore over it?",89,59,0.87
458,Everyone Sucks,"So over the summer I’ve been babysitting two of my nephews and one niece. Without using their names I’ll call them A, B, and C. A and C are brothers, A is 6, B is 4, and C is 2. 

So essentially we had just eaten and I was putting C to sleep in the bedroom. The other two were in the other bedroom watching a movie and I happened to fall asleep while rocking C. A took advantage of this by sneaking into the living room and playing the Xbox set up there with B. (by sneaking I mean closing the door to the room I was in and turning the volume on the TV all the way down.)

B’s father comes home and didn’t have a key for some reason (It’s his house) so he rang the bell and the two kids opened the door. B’s father yells at me and really digs deep to make me feel awful. He says how anyone could have been at the door and I held back tears. 

B’s father says he’s no longer letting me babysit  his daughter and isn’t paying me for this week. I feel awful and take blame but it’s not entirely me at fault. Who doesn’t have a key to their home? Who doesn’t ingrain the concept of stranger danger to their kids? 

So AITA here?

EDIT/UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who responded with advice and judgement! I decided to put it to use and call and apologize to B’s father. He accepted my apology but still sounded pretty mad and he’s still not paying me for the week. My other uncles and aunts collectively decided to give me a week off so I can fix my sleeping schedule. I still get the feeling B’s dad doesn’t like me but he didn’t like me before so no harm no foul. Thank you everyone!",75,76,0.91

The girls however were waiting and queuing and started snarky talking about jumping the queue. I ignored them as, well if you are too stupid to know how to get a drink at a pub I have no sympathy

One of the girls comes over and starts telling me off about queue jumping, saying I’m rude and I should have more respect 

I reply that it’s a pub and if you don’t know what to do then it’s not my problem. I tell her that queuing in a pub is stupid and if I got served first it’s their fault. 

She calls me an arsehole and walks off. Shame cos she is rather pretty. Ducked up there!

462,Not the A-hole,"First, trigger warning, this question deals with pregnancy loss.

When I was about 9 weeks pregnant, my H and I went to my in laws house for a visit. At the time, their lab was about 9 months old and about 70 lbs. I'm 5'6 and 110 lbs for reference.

Their dog is highly untrained. He jumps, scratches, does not listen to commands. His entire life is his backyard so he doesnt know how to interact properly with people.

Anyway, during the visit, this dog jumps on me repeatedly. Including pushing hard against my stomach. It hurt but I didnt think of it as anything beyond pain expected when a large dog jumps at you.

Without getting into too much detail, I ended up losing the baby that night. I dont know if it was because of the dog. I dont know if I would have miscarried even without the dog. I dont know.

I don't have facts or science to prove anything. But I blame that dog and my in laws for not controlling him better.

At the time, my in laws did not know I was pregnant. But we told them later. And they never apologized or showed sympathy. My MIL even said ""it is for the best. There was obviously something wrong with it"".

Fast forward to today, I am pregnant again but I can not forgive or forget. I want nothing to do with them and I dont want my baby to go over to their house ever. Their dog is even larger now and still untrained.

I just pulled into the parking lot at work and I’m driving down the aisle and come up behind a van parked in the middle of the aisle. This isn’t uncommon as people wait for their spouses or whatever to come out. Usually they move to the side or just circle around. Well this woman was blocking the whole aisle and wasn’t moving. For the rest of this story you need to know I have an exhaust on my car that makes it crackle and pop at certain engine loads. So I give the throttle a blip, no response. Another slightly louder blip, no response. She then gets out of her car and walks around the front to the other side where she proceeds to pull her phone out and take a picture of he side of the building. During this she sees me sitting there and does that little wave/sorry face. She then proceeds to take a couple pictures and examine them. Meanwhile I have the throttle held about halfway down so I’m making noise. 

Satisfied she goes to get back in her car and gives me another little wave. Once in her car she proceeds to sit there and I can see her plugging phone in or messing with something so I start flooring the throttle causing lots of noise and big backfires. She gets out and asks me what my problem is to which I respond “Get out of the way. There are two empty parking spots right next to you. You’re taking up the whole aisle!” She flips me off and gets back in her car and drives away. I park and start typing this. 

For the record whether I am the asshole or not I feel no remorse for this. But Reddit I ask you, AITA?

465,Asshole,"Hi Everyone,

I was newly (external) hired as a site manger of an adventure / theme park. The park has several sites some adjacent and some disconnected. I was hired as one these site managers.

So when I cam on board, I decided to speak w/ the staff to learn the business and see if they have any suggestions. Several of the male staff complained that they couldn't wear shorts while their female colleagues could.

All staff had to wear a company polo or T-Shirt. For pants, men had to wear ankle-length khakis or corduroy pants (no jeans). They also, as mentioned couldn't wear shorts. Women had more options, being also allowed navy blue or black jeans, capris, yoga pants (if behind was covered), and shorts (khaki / walking/hiking style), up to 3"" above the knee. Women are also allowed to wear skirts, but other than some staff from certain religious sects, no employee wears it due to impracticality.

Now, I am not allowed to be lax on the dress code (if a customer complains, I'll get in trouble), but I am allowed to be more strict if I feel the circumstances warrant it. Being equitable I feel is a valid reason to be more strict and not allow female employees to wear shorts. Ideally, I would lax the dress code for male staff but I am not allowed to.

Well the female staff were not happy and are not co-operating. Female shift supervisors refuse to enforce the dress code on women and 70% of female staff started wearing short-shorts in protest. I cannot obviously send all of them home as the park wouldn't function otherwise. They also complained to my manager, and apparently they are referring to me as a ""misogynistic slut-shamer"" and that I should stop trying to police what women wear. This is ridiculous, as I am simply making the rules equitable. My manager is planning on meeting me next week to discuss all of this. But until that, I want to know, do you think IATA?",311,401,0.9

469,Not the A-hole,"I have an uncle (\~50yrs old) whom I ***hate***.  IMO he’s the most garbage human being I’ve ever met.  He’s *NEVER* been truly independent – he has always been supported in some way or another by someone else, usually my grandparents, and has lived with them all but \~6yrs of his entire life. He can’t manage to maintain a job for more than a year a most, and for the last 5-7yrs has made his spending money doing odd jobs or selling pot. He’s rude, greedy, and when he doesn’t get his way he bitches, yells, becomes verbally abusive, or straight up explodes in gibbering rage.  His abhorrent behavior is why my grandparents have enabled his mooching for decades; he goes nuclear over the pettiest of shit, so in the short term giving in is much easier for them, but they have suffered through decades of him living in their home.  They simply don’t have the will or emotional energy to kick him out.

Facing increasing medical expenses on a fixed income, they struggle to make ends meet on a regular basis. My brother and I came into a not-insignificant amount of money via inheritance and are discussing what we can do to help our grandparents out. We decided that if possible and with their blessing, we’d like to buy their house from them and not assume physical possession until they both pass (eliminating their mortgage/insurance/taxes, allowing them to live rent free, and paying to have things around the house fixed up that they can’t afford themselves). Once they do pass, we could rent the house out or sell it, and in this way make a sort of win-win situation (we get to help them out financially while also making an investment with our inheritance money).

The assholery comes in regarding our uncle.  If we own the house, **I want him gone**.  If my grandparents care more about keeping peace (and continuing to enable him) while they are still alive, we will respect their wishes.  But once it is solely ours, he has 30 days to find somewhere else to live. **I will not rent to him.  I will not support him financially in any way.** I don't know where he'll go and ***I don't care***.

I *know* that PoS is assuming he will inherit the house when they pass, but it’s based solely on a squatting mentality; he hasn’t contributed to the utilities, home maintenance, or mortgage in any substantial capacity, ***EVER***. He doesn’t even buy his own groceries. Legally I know we might have to fight him out, but I’m more than willing to do that. My aunts (his sisters) are telling us that if we force him out just because we can and we want to, we’re being assholes because he’s close to retirement age and “can’t” support himself, but we argue that the time is long, long, long past for someone to give him the boot and a serious reality check.  It's important to add that he's not disabled in any way. He's just a lazy asshole.

One of the bridesmaids has a chronic illness that flares at random moments, so she could be fine at the rehearsal but too sick to be in the actual wedding.

I've only met the cousin once and we barely spoke. She only asked me because she thinks I would fit into the sick bridesmaid's dress. I don't want to do this, I think it's weird and inappropriate, especially since my boyfriend and I aren't married or been together that long, so I'm not family.

We have our weeks on a calendar and make arrangements to trade weeks if someone is busy or out of the office.

There are 3 co workers who either ""forget"" to do their week or do a half-ass job and the other 3 fix for them. 

Last week one of the ""forgetful"" ones didn't clean the office on Friday. I thought of leaving it but the bathrooms were bad and the garbag bins were stinky. I took care of it and left her a note letting her know she missed her week and asked if she could take a week for me when I would be away from work. She agreed to the switch and said she was sorry she missed her week.

Well today is Friday and I am currently the only one in the office. It's a long weekend here so half of then took the day off and the other two worked a half day. The person in charge of this week left at 12 and said ""see ya Tuesday!""

The bathrooms are gross and the garbage bins are full. I don't think it's fair that I have to clean it again just because I'm the only one here. But I also think it's not fair to leave it to the next person as that person always does a great job and it shouldn't be on them to do double.

I also don't really use it that often as I have a well paying job and only use it for ""essentials"". He is very on top of the credit card statements and can see exactly what I buy. Recently my friend from college came to visit. I wanted to treat her with a nice lunch. This month I had a lot of bills/expenses so I put the lunch on the credit card he gave me. For the 2 of us it was $60. The credit card's allowance resets every month and I had only used it for gas ($50 bucks). Yesterday my dad blew up at me over text about why I have the right to spend his money on what I want. He has some anger management issues so sometimes he gets a little heated over small things which I understand for the most part. I just let him cool down and approach the situation later. I said I am sorry but he gives me an allowance and he wasn't specific on what I can/can't spend it on. Also that I had barely touched it this month, besides my friend is in town and I wanted to treat her. He told me that he was going cancel the card and then degraded me for being 21 years old with an allowance(he is the one who gave me the card). He then told me to get my ""own damn credit card"". My mom later confronted him over text for treating his own daughter like that. The conversation went like this: M(my mom). D(my dad).

M: Why did you cancel the credit card you gave her?

D: She spent $60 dollars on lunch, that's too much. She is old enough to be responsible for paying for things herself. I am cutting her off.

M: Wow... i can't imagine if they\[my sister and me\] lived with you and you had to pay the water bill/electric, along with taking them to lunch or dinner. You don't get it because you chose not to live with them. To put in perspective, you don't take them out even once a week... They\[my sister and me\] made a comment that they would have loved to vacation with you but you'd rather take your girlfriend. $60 one time is a lot less than $300 a week in groceries.

D: \*no response\*

Since that conversation my dad has refused to talk to me or my mom and has canceled my card. AITA for being upset at him?",47,40,0.85

491,Not the A-hole,"My daughter seems to be the age where a lot of what I do has started to embarrasses her. I've been wearing speedos (or swim briefs) for a very long time and I still look pretty good in them and I keep myself in shape. I always wear them while swimming laps, most of the time while on vacations, and sometimes at a waterpark or beach at home. I feel comfortable in them. If I'm paying for a vacation, I want to feel the most comfortable I can. 

My family and I will soon be going on a Disney cruise. We are going with some family friends and their kids too (but we're all making our own way there, so in some regards it's not a trip with them). My in laws are also going.

My daughter has recently told her mother (my wife) that she doesn't want me to wear my speedos while on vacation because it's embarrassing and because ""no one else will be wearing them"". My wife has always preferred it when I wear them (or so she says). My wife is on the fence about it and she has said it might not be completely acceptable due to the setting of a Disney cruise and who we're travelling with. I disagree. My wife and her mother talk a lot and quite a few things come out. This has also somehow come out to her. My mother in law thinks I should not be wearing them, especially on a Disney cruise with a lot of kids around. But speedos or swim briefs are not obscene in the least. They perform a proper function and they're comfortable. Everything is properly covered.

492,Everyone Sucks,"TL;DR: Bestie treated me like shit when I got engaged before she did. We work together but I don't talk to her and don't feel the need to explain why. 

""Ruby"" and I were friends from 5th to 7th grade. Ruby didn't talk to me for 9 years, then sent me a message out of the blue. She introduced me to her boyfriend ""Jake"" and his best friend ""Nick."" Nick and I started dating soon after. 

Ruby comes from a *very* rich family. Ruby is a very obnoxious person, and has always been self-centered, but she can be generous and a lot of fun. 

Nick and I got engaged. When we got back from our trip where we got engaged, Ruby wanted to go out to lunch. At lunch, Ruby complained that Jake hadn't proposed to her yet even though they'd been together longer. 

Ruby made Jake propose to her. Their wedding was September, Nick's and mine in December. Ruby asked me to be her Maid of Honor. I felt pressured to ask her to be my MoH, so I did what most people with the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair would do, and asked her to be my MoH. 

Ruby and I went shopping for her bridal shower, which her parents had offered to pay for, but at the end of her shopping spree she told me I was paying. I had about $150 to my name at that time and spent most of it on her.

The day of her wedding she was awful. I just kept my distance and did my job as MoH. 

A few days after her wedding, I told Ruby I applied for a CNA job at the hospital where she works. I am in nursing school. She is a new RN. There aren't many hospital CNA jobs in our area. She told me she hoped I got the job.

I got the job. Ruby was polite but distant. After a while, I asked why, and Ruby said ""I just don't want to be seen as playing favorites with the CNAs."" That hurt a lot. A lot of CNAs and RNs hang out outside of work on our unit, so it's not like it'd be weird. After that, I mostly stopped talking to her. 

I didn't ask her to do anything for my bridal shower. 

The day before my wedding she kept texting and calling. I was stressed and busy so I ignored her.

Later that day Ruby confronted me. She wanted to talk about her MoH speech. I finally put my foot down and told her she wouldn't be having a speech. Ruby is always sneaking in a cutdown and I didn't want to hear that at my wedding.

The day of my wedding, I had an allergic reaction in one eye. Ruby told my makeup artist to do me last and keep my brushes separate because I had something contagious. 

A month after the wedding, she sent me a snapchat and said ""things have been awkward since the wedding, I'm ready to talk when you are"" and I didn't reply. I don't feel like I owe her an explanation.

Nick thinks I should just talk to her and be friends again, since he and Jake are still pretty good friends, but I don't even *want* to be friends anymore. 

Some people are shocked that I don't talk to Ruby anymore, and some people think I should've dumped her years ago. I don't even know if I'm in the right anymore. So, tell me, Reddit, AITA?",72,97,0.93

502,Not the A-hole,"My now-husband wanted a particular minister to perform our wedding ceremony. He's an old family friend (his family, not mine), and apparently one who is sorta famous and well-respected in his community. I am a staunch atheist and did not want a religious ceremony. Husband and I met with the minister, who said he could totally perform a non-religious ceremony if we wanted one, and reassured me that he would not use any explicitly religious language.

So we have the wedding rehearsal and his overview of the ceremony is totally fine, nothing religious or otherwise objectionable on my part. He gave us a detailed preview of his speech, which was also fine. I relaxed.

Then at the ACTUAL wedding ... he not only peppers his speech with stuff about Jesus and God's love and ""this blessed holy union,"" but also ends with ""let us pray"" and recites the Lord's Prayer. I was turning purple with rage, but didn't say anything because I was in front of all of our guests and didn't want to turn our wedding into a fiasco.

Several months after the wedding, I still wasn't over it and decided to write an email to the minister. The email read along the lines of: I asked you not to do a religious ceremony, you said you could accommodate my wishes, and you didn't. You misled me during rehearsal and made me think you would be able to perform a secular ceremony, but switched gears when I was in a situation where I couldn't protest. I deserve an apology from you. (I also said that husband's family had nothing to do with the email and so I hoped this wouldn't affect his relationship with them, but that I personally felt \[xyz\].)

My family thinks I am the asshole because I unreasonably expected a minister to deliver a non-religious ceremony. I think my husband is at least upset at losing his relationship with his childhood minister. He also seemed a bit incredulous when I said I was emailing the dude and asking for an apology. 

Your thoughts?

**\*Edit here so as not to repeat myself: I am not just atheist, I am anti-religious institutions because I was abused as a child in church (yes by ministers, youth ministers, Sunday school teachers, etc.). I told this minister all about my experiences and told him that was why I really really reeeeally could not deal with a religious ceremony. He said he understood, and said he would not even mention anything religious. Not saying this to garner pity votes, but it might be important INFO for some**

508,No A-holes here,"Hello everyone. Just trying to gain some perspective on my situation, and hoping I'm not too big of an asshole.

Some backstory: My husband and I have been together for about 5 years, and we just got married this year. He has a 9 year old son from a previous hookup.

My husband's son is great, but I have always been ""dad's girlfriend"", not  ""stepmom"". I met him when he was about 6, and  we have fun together in our house, but I don't do much parenting. His mom is very involved, and honestly a great co-parent for my husband. His son switches houses every week and it's been this way for about the last year or two with tweaks.

Lately, his mom has noticed how this schedule might be negatively affecting him. He's been using it as an excuse to not turn in homework. We had an incident recently where he forgot that his dad picks him up on his weeks, and he rode the bus home to his mom's. Obviously this isn't a huge deal, but there was a 30 minute panic when no one knew where he was. Increasingly, we'll have to drive to his mom's to pick up things, or he's not ready for practice, things like this. He has also started trying to pick and choose each week where he'll go, which of course we have shut down, but it's getting frustrating for all of us. His mom wants to switch from the current schedule to one that is more during the week he stays with one parent, and weekends, holidays, etc are with the other parent. She's open to negotiation and said she wants to make sure that the amount of days is still equal. She also wants to sit down with both of us to work something out and discuss.

I will also admit, I somewhat selfishly want this schedule, as the week on, week off schedule is also difficult for me. It's sometimes weirdly inflexible and holidays are always contentious. But I honestly think it'll be better for him as well.

I also suspect that I am pregnant. We've been trying, and I'm about 95% sure, but will confirm next week. My husband's son has expressed firm interest in NOT wanting a sibling, and when we've talked to him about starting to try he asked why he wasn't apart of the decision. He also almost didn't come to our wedding because he thought it wasn't fair that his dad never married his mom. So I really just think living in a household half of the time where he has to see ""his dad's new family"" will be hard on him, especially when the baby is getting most of the attention.

When I brought all this up with my husband and told him I'd be telling his son's mom that I agree, he got very angry, and told me that the only opinion I should have regarding his son should be in support of what HE thinks is best for his son. He calmed down and apologized for that, but that general mood is still there...That I should have his back, and that I just don't want his son around so we can start our own family which just isn't the case. So, AITA?

**EDIT:** To clear up some confusion, the details of the new agreement aren't what we disagree on. That is just what his son's mother proposed, and we're supposed to come back with what we think and would like to change. The real problem is that in that discussion, I'd like to be at least able to agree that we should change something, but my husband thinks I should just agree with him and refuse. I disagree with that because I was invited to the conversation and I honestly believe that some change is necessary for the sake of everyone involved, but especially his son. I think we should at least discuss it with her, or see what the options are, but he's unwilling to change at all and says that in that discussion with her, I should also refuse to shut it down.",105,207,0.97

511,Everyone Sucks,"Before I get into the specifics, I need to lay some background.

My gf and I share a closet that we both go into every morning to get dressed for work. The closet uses a sliding door that means that only one half of the closet can be accessed at a time (I have half, she has half).

The issue is that she often leaves her shoes in the line of the sliding door instead of pushing them all the way into the closet or just putting then elsewhere. I never bother to move her shoes and simply slide the door over them because I just want to get ready and don't want to move them. This obviously scuffs the shoes where the door hit them and she got mad at me for ruining some of her shoes. I however take the stance that it is a natural consequence of leaving things directly in the path of the sliding door that she knows will have to move through there every day and it is instead her fault for placing her shoes there (I always make sure my stuff is out of the way).",38,44,0.89

513,No A-holes here,"This is my first post here and I know it's mediocre but I'd love some opinions from strangers that aren't biased.

My fiance and I are getting married next year and we have a lot of individual friends we're inviting. Some of them are in relationships and we know their plus one will be their partner, while others are single but often date around, and some are just single in general but would probably bring a friend if allowed a plus one. 

To cut costs and avoid having a bunch of random people at our wedding, we are thinking of letting some people have plus ones while inviting others without the option of a plus one. 

This would literally be the difference of about 35 potential extra people (weddings are expensive af). 

Is this an asshole thing to do? To give some people the option of a plus one and not others? Some of my friends (also getting married) think it's perfectly normal and you ""have to be selfish for your wedding"" while others (my coworkers) think it's a rude thing to do and people being invited as one aren't going to want to attend alone. 

Would we be assholes if we don't give some people plus ones? Should we just offer every individual person a plus one? 

It's always been really important to us that our guests have an amazing time; we chose a venue with weekend ceremony and reception at the same venue, comfy chairs, great food, free parking, etc... But I don't want anybody to feel uncomfortable attending our wedding and then get upset that someone else got a plus one and they didn't?

I’m a student so I have all summer off, I had a week off work last week and my cousin was going away, she asked if I would look after her two kids (age 7 twins) for 4 days. I happily obliged as they’re great kids and I hadn’t seen them in a while.

So my cousin is a hardcore vegan, she’s almost militant in her ways. Her kids have never eaten any animal produce. I totally support veganism and was vegetarian for years but I feel that the effect this is having on her kids is harmful, growing children need nutrients. The kids are very frail, pale and they’re constantly getting sick, they lack the energy and enthusiasm that most 7 year olds have. 

The first day they stayed I made all vegan food for myself and the kids, as their mother instructed. The kids were becoming curious about the food I had in the house, even normal everyday things like eggs and cheese. They asked if they could have some. For breakfast the next day I made them eggs and toast with butter and they LOVED it. They had never eaten it before and it lit up their little faces, I just couldn’t say no to them for the rest of the week. I didn’t give them that much meat because I know their digestive systems wouldn’t be used to it but we tried a small bit of fish and chicken. 

They were totally different kids for the time they stayed with me. They had so much energy and got really involved in every activity I planned, I had never seen them like that before and neither had the rest of my family.

Their mom picked them up on Wednesday afternoon and within half an hour I received a very angry phone call from her. She told me that I had no right to feed her kids “poison” and that they will never be seeing me again.

CPS has been called on her before. They did an inspection and didn’t deem her unfit to parent. I’ve been through the care system before and honestly have very little belief in them because they allowed me to stay in an abusive environment when it was obvious what was going on.

To get rid of the discussions we've made an agreement: on the trip towards something one person can put on their kind of music, and on the way back the other person can put on theirs.

Now here's where it gets tricky. I don't mind listening to pop music, but I prefer metal. She does mind listening to metal because she really doesn't like it.

So when she puts on her music, i'll sometimes sing along with songs as well and when I put on my music, she's sitting there like she wants to get out of the car and walk.

Lately I've been putting on rock, which is somewhat a middle ground, whenever we listen to 'my' music which she prefers way over metal. But still I don't feel like I should have to listen to rock to please her, because of the agreement that we would listen to my music (which is metal).

Would I be the asshole / or am i the asshole if I were to put on metal whenever we listen to 'my' music?",72,50,0.89

528,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a year ago, and my best friend and I haven't talked since. To give a break down of what happened it first needs some back story. My friend, who we'll call Dan because it's easy to type, met a girl on a trip to another country when we were both in about 9th grade. They had talked sporadically through the years and officially became a couple around the time we were both about 22. Through this time I had never met her and had only heard stories because, you know, she lived in another country. My friend and I have always had a very crass sense of humor, always making fun of each other for one thing or another and in the end having an extremely strong friendship because of it. Dan and I hadn't talked a whole lot leading up to this mainly because I had joined the military and went off while he stayed in the states and eventually got engaged to that girl. I was in California at the time he texted me and asked me to be a groomsman at his wedding, of course I was happy for him and told him I absolutely would. This leads to the text conversation that I guess you could say ruined our friendship and I'll try my best to transcribe it from memory since I've changed phones since that time.

Dan: Yeah so the wedding will be around X time, we're having a dinner to get all the goomsmen together and hash out the specific details of what we're doing and what we'll be wearing.

Me: Sounds good, do I need to do anything before then?

Dan: Get a girlfriend maybe, you ugly turd

Me: Well at least I didn't have to get a mail order bride ;)

Dan: [sends gif of Borat doing the ""my wife"" line]

Me: [Sends picture of kids playing soccer in 3rd world country] Is this where she's from?

Dan: haha not far off

So anyways, fast forward about a month. Dan and I had been texting a little bit about some details and all seemed well. Then I got a text one morning from Dan that read something like this:

Dan: Hey man, ""fiance"" saw your text, and she didn't appreciate it. I can't say I blame her. She says you're uninvited from the wedding. Hope we can hang out sometime though.

I immediately apologized and told him to tell her I didn't mean to offend or for her to take it as a personal attack. From the best of my knowledge she probably goes through his phone or something which is how I assume she saw a month old text, but that's just speculation and is none of my business. I haven't spoken to Dan since, not from lack of trying though. He just stopped responding to my messages. I heard through some mutual friends he now tells people I'm racist.

AITA for making that joke or was this friendship DOA?",364,696,0.95
529,Asshole,"Ok, so in high school I was apart of a club that helped out the students in our school struggling with disabilities & mental illnesses among other problems, and our surrounding community. It involved a lot of volunteering, and then a lot of talking and mediating other students. 

I was apart of this mentor/mentee program and I was paired up with this girl who had some disabilities that prohibited her from learning, developing some social skills, among other things (they were very low forms and she was able to communicate pretty well, but she was in special ed classes as she had a hard time reading and writing)I was assigned to help her learn some social skills, and make some friends.

It mostly worked. I got her out of her shell a little bit and when I would walk into our classroom for the club she’d be talking to another student or sitting with someone in the cafeteria. I tried to keep our meetings and check ins a little more casual as I was trying to teach her how to deal with social situations and talk to people. This led her to believe that we were just best friends. And while she’s a sweet girl and funny, I don’t think I’d be her friend if I met her outside of this. Not to say that I would be mean to her but, we don’t have similar interests or really the same humor. 

For a while after I graduated she kept calling me in the summer and I had answered every couple of weeks, mostly because I felt bad because I knew she still didn’t have a lot of friends and she relied on me. I kept in contact for her for almost another year while I was in college and I think at the end of May I stopped answering her calls.

I feel like she needs to move on from me and the mentoring program and make more friends and I’ve become a crutch for her as whenever I would bring up if she had made any friends at school, she said she had me. So I hope from not talking to me she’ll make some more friends. I feel like I’m being mean but I dreaded having to talk to her every couple of weeks as she would kind of dump all of her problems on me and ask how I would fix them and it’s a lot as in school and even over the summer I’m very busy with volunteering, work, my family, and my own problems.

So, AITA for ignoring her calls and texts?",55,224,0.95

532,Not the A-hole,"This happened just today. 

So, I was assigned to a group with two of my classmates to work on a research paper a while back.

As part of our final submission of our report, we are required to fill in an individual contributions form to state whether or not everyone had contributed equally. 

One of my groupmates had done almost nothing at all, except helping us in an interview. The other group member and I felt that we should mark his contribution as only 5% as he basically only did 10 minutes worth of work while we spent more than 10 hours in total to write the report.

By doing so, he would receive a penalty and it may cause him to have trouble applying for any future courses or programmes.

He says that it is unfair that we did this to him and he asks why we couldn't be nicer and pretend that he had contributed an equal amount. One of his reasons is that we managed to finish the report anyway and its already over, he doesn't want his future in the school to be possibly affected.

Am I the asshole for giving him a low contribution for our assignment?

537,Not the A-hole,"I'm 2nd generation Jamaican, my parents moved to the US just before I was born, so I grew up here. My wife and her family are all white. There have never been any issues with any of her family except her nana. Nana is a massive racist, hates my guts and always has. In recent years she's started to go a bit senile and has become even more vocal and aggressive towards me.

&#x200B;

Note:she's still fairly capable, doesn't have full blown dementia etc but she's definitely not quite as aware as she used to be, however I'm almost certain she is more aware than she often acts and uses it as an excuse act however she wants.

&#x200B;

Nana has fairly regular appointments she goes to for various health things and in the past I've been the one to take her as I work from home and am often the only one available in the day. I hate it but my wife said it meant a lot to her etc so I sucked it up and got it over with.

&#x200B;

But as I said nana has been getting more and more aggressive towards me, yelling slurs at me, acting repulsed if I touch her etc. Things came to a head last time I took her to an appointment. The Dr called her in, I tried to help her out of her seat and she screamed at me saying I was trying to steal her purse. Thankfully the Dr knew me and defused the situation. I was left in the waiting room with everyone throwing me disgusted, murderous looks.

&#x200B;

When I got home I told my wife that I was done taking nana anywhere. This was a step too far IMO. She sympathized and was very apologetic on nanas behalf so I figured she was on my side with this. 

&#x200B;

Well apparently not as she came to me a few days ago asking me to take nana to an appointment. I reminded her that I wasn't doing that anymore after what happened last time. She looked stunned and said she'd thought I was just venting and that I'd be over it by now. I told her no, it was a pretty damn serious thing that happened and I'm not just gonna ""get over it"". She told me I was being heartless, that nana couldn't help it and that she couldn't believe I was so unwilling to help a sick old woman. I asked her if she really thought it was fair that I had put up with her screaming slurs at me and trying to get me in trouble in public but she just kept repeating ""she can't help it"". The argument ended with her calling me selfish and leaving to stay with her parents, her last words were ""If you can't do it for nana then you should at least do it for your wife who you're supposed to love and do anything for."" She has barely spoken to me since then, this was 2 days ago, and is still staying with her parents. 

&#x200B;

I thought that I was justified in not wanting to take her anymore but now I'm doubting myself. Reddit AITA?



 Update for you good people:
I had thought I wasn't the asshole here but my wife's reaction put some doubt in my mind but after all the support I received here I text my wife telling her to come home as we needed a long chat about this situation.
She came in and the first thing she said was ""I wasn't even sure I was going to come you know"" I asked why and she replied ""I'm disappointed it's taken you this long to reach out to me to resolve this."" Not off to a great start but I try to keep cool.

 So we talk and she tells me she understands that it's upsetting for me to be with Nana when she starts getting worked up but I have to understand she can't help it and she needs family to support her through this difficult time. I explain it's not just about getting upset, it's legit dangerous for me. She still won't believe me, she keeps saying nothing will really happen though because it's just going to see the doctor, they know the situation there etc she even suggested that if I'm more careful and make sure not to frighten Nana by being too close she won't get as upset. 

I'll admit I lost my cool here and asked her if she even gave a shit about me at all. She became very defensive and told me I'm being unreasonable. I then brought up this post and all the people here who thought I was being reasonable.

She exploded at me. How dare I share our private business with the world? I made her look like a monster. How could I be so unfair to her? You get the idea. She left again and said she didn't know when she'd be back. Honestly I'm not even sure if I want her to come back. I've never seen this side of her but I'm shocked by it. 

I don't know where to go from here but I'm not sure I can be with someone who doesn't respect or believe me and tries to manipulate me.",678,3375,0.97
538,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure I'm not someone to talk sex casually, except with my closest friends. However I was recently hanging out with a group of colleagues and acquaintances from my old internship. We drank too much and the conversation was more open than normally.

Basically two girls in the group started talking about some drama with a crazy guy from Tinder. That's what got everyone interested in the relationship and sex topic.

Someone else told a story about a friend's ex-gf who wouldn't talk dirty, get eaten out or be on top during sex, which led the couple to break up. So I mentioned my ex-bf (I'm also a guy, they know I'm gay) who was a jerk but really good in bed because he knew how to talk dirty well, pull hair and generally do the kinkier stuff.

The guy whose story I was responding to seemed embarrassed, while the others laughed awkwardly and basically said: okay man, we know you're gay, we don't need to know all the private details.

So I felt weird for the rest of the evening for apparently killing that part of the conversation and I've been wondering whether I'm TA for being ""too explicit"" (even though everyone else was talking sex life, though technically not directly their own) or if they were just being too squeamish about gay sex?",93,309,0.93

541,Not the A-hole,"My Mother recently got into a car crash and was told she won’t be able to walk for at least 2 years. As you could probably guess she was devastated. I felt really bad because she was on her way to meet me and my wife for dinner when it happened. Well my sisters and I covered her hospital bill and my mother absolutely hates the wheelchair she has. She says it’s uncomfortable and can’t stand it. I offered to buy her an electronic wheelchair and said to pick one out and I’d buy it. I jokingly said “now don’t go overboard,” but i also said that hoping she’d understand that I’m not willing to drop over 4 grand for a chair. Well that’s exactly what she did.

She said she researched chairs and found this one to be the most comfortable and easy to use. I on the other hand did research and found a great similar wheelchair for over 2K less than the ones she wants. It has all the same features except the chair is slightly larger and tiny bit less comfortable. My Mom got mad that I’d even suggest that chair. She told me that she wants the best one she can get. 

At the end of the day I could afford it but it would mean we would have to wait much longer to start having kids. I told my Mom this and she responded with “if you aren’t going to buy me the one I want then I don’t see why you offered.” 

My mom has always had a tendency to ask for more than she should. Like you could give her a quarter and she’d demand $5 from you. It’s quite annoying typically. I see where she’s coming from. She’s going to be in this chair for a long time and she should be comfortable. 

I told her a few days ago “Look Allison (my wife) and I are hoping to be expecting by the end of the year. I can’t afford to spend over $4K right now for your chair. I’m willing to give you the 2K for the lower model but I can’t afford to spend anything more.” She got upset and basically said I’m being unfair because I’m “responsible” for what happened. Now I feel like a total shit bag. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I showed my wife this post a little bit ago and didn’t tell me this but she did in fact tell my Mom that we would spend 1.5K at the most and she could spend more on one if she desires but we wouldn’t spend more. Somehow or another there was miscommunication and I didn’t find out about this until like 5 minutes ago before adding this.

Update: I talked to my Mom today to remind her of what Allison said about the price. She thought Allison was “joking around.”  Now she told me she wants a better one costing 9K and expected me to pay the whole thing. I straight up told her no.  I said “Either take the 2 thousand right now or don’t. I’m tired of having to hear about this. Giving you 2K and paying for part of your hospital bills was more than fair. Also, the fact that Allison gave you a limit and you laughed at it and expected more than double that is really rude.” She got mad and didn’t take the 2K. Now she’s not talking to me, but I don’t care now. She really has been pissing me off ever since the car wreck reminding me daily that I’m “responsible and if she died it would be on me.” She texted me that after I left.

Edit 2: For those wondering, the chair costs 2K with insurance covering for the rest.",228,1098,0.96

543,Not the A-hole,"fyi, this happened a couple years ago

i'm chinese and korean, but i'm adopted by white people so i didn't grow up with the culture. later on into my teens i developed more of an interest in it. i used to date this guy (i was 19 at the time, he was 22) that was really into asian culture, and he was quite knowledgable about them. he was even learning japanese and korean.

at first, i thought it was cool, we seemed to have a lot of interests in common, which was rare for me since the town i grew up in is more rural and predominantly white.

later on in our relationship, he would tease me about not knowing any korean and being a ""bad asian"" and would basically try to flex on me by speaking japanese and korean (not very well, but he was still just learning) and showing off his knowledge. this annoyed me, because it wasn't my fault i wasn't brought up in those cultures, and due to teasing, i was pretty ashamed of them as a kid. also, i'm not japanese so i don't even know why he would bring that into our conversations so constantly. i like a few animes, but he was the one who was clearly more into them than me.

at one point, he teased me in front of my parents and said something like ""i'm basically more asian than your daughter is, isn't that funny?"" and they laughed along but i wasn't very amused. i didn't confront him there, but i told him later that those jokes were getting old. he argued that he was just encouraging me to learn more about my culture and he would teach me, but that struck a nerve i guess and i broke up with him there (we had been dating for a few months). in that moment, his interest in asian culture was less impressive/cool to me than it was obnoxious and a bit creepy. he said i was ""fucked up"" for making him feel bad about his interests. 

i'll admit he did know a lot about asian pop culture, but it mostly centered around his initial interest in japanese culture. so i'd say his interest was maybe a bit more shallow whereas i actually am chinese/korean, and i was more interested in learning about my own culture. i never had a problem with his interests, just him teasing me for not being asian ""enough.""

the reason i bring this up is because i ran into him recently when visiting my home town, and according to some old friends, he was pretty upset about the breakup and talked a lot about it afterward. they seemed to have varying opinions, so i guess i gotta ask, am i the asshole?",58,49,0.91

545,Asshole,"My fiancé and I have been living together for 6 months now. We get married in January! I was driving home alone and get a call from my Mom who said she found a kitten that was close to death. I came over and helped my mom nurse it back to health. But the issue was she couldn’t take care of it due to her busy work schedule. So I decided to take the kitten (Sadie) home. I’ve always loved cats. They are my favorite animal and haven’t had one in years. So when I met Sadie I instantly fell in love. My fiancé likes cats but not as much as me. The issue is that he’s allergic. He sneezes whenever he’s in the same room as her and gets a really itchy throat whenever around her. 

He understood how much I love Sadie and decided that we could keep her until she reached full health. It’s been 2 months now and Sadie is finally back to full health. She’s the most playful and caring cat I’ve ever met. Meanwhile my fiancé still has been having issues with allergies. He’s been trying different allergy meds for weeks and finally found something that allows him to be in the same room as her but still makes his nose run and sneezes a little bit. 

He told me last week that it was time to get rid of her because she’s back to full health and he’s still uncomfortable to be around her. The issue is I really don’t want to get rid of Sadie. I love her so much and can’t see a future without her. I told him this and he got really mad. He told me that he’s been “miserable” for weeks because of Sadie and can’t live on like this. I told him that if he loved me as much as he said he did then he’d let me keep her because of how much I care for her. He said that was unfair and told me that he refused to live like this anymore. I don’t see the issue. His nose runs and he sneezes occasionally. If she brings me joy shouldn’t he let me keep her? My Mom says I’m being unreasonable causing me to write this.

548,Not the A-hole,"Alright, for a bit of context before I start, let me give a little background in the area I live. My neighborhood has a lot of stray and escapee animals, it's also right on the border of a fairly popular hiking area. So, that means we have to deal with coyotes and the occasional mountain lion. So, if a pet gets lost, it's fairly urgent they get found sooner rather than later due to how unfriendly the area is for outside pets. 

Awhile back, while I was out doing yard work a random dog came up and approached me. My first thought is it's a lost dog, not a stray, because it looks fairly well groomed and was extremely friendly and well behaved. However, it was missing a collar, so I didn't have a number to call and check. There wasn't any possible owner around that I could see, either. My parents aren't home for me to ask for help, there aren't any posts about this dog being missing on the area's Facebook page, so my next logical step here is to go ask my next door neighbor for a little help because they own dogs and I have zero dog experience. We put a post up in the group to ask if anyone is missing the dog, and decide to walk around a bit in the area to see if anyone else recognized it. 

We walked around for about half an hour asking people, no luck on the Facebook post, so then my neighbor suggests we go to the vet to see if it has a chip. It's a short, five minute drive. The dog is super chill, and, hey, it had a chip! The vet calls the owner who lives in a city a few hours away to notify her that we found her dog. I'm happy, the neighbor is happy, the dog is happy. Everyone is feeling good vibes until the owner's very angry husband shows up to pick up the dog. 

It turns out, husband had been working on repairing one of the hiking trails behind my house about half a mile out, and he lets both of his dogs run around freely while he works. This specific dog had just gotten surgery done and had a sensitive neck so it couldn't wear a collar, but also didn't like the feeling of a harness so he just decided to let the dog run around without one. Either way, he starts cussing me out because I shouldn't be running off with random dogs, claiming I stole the dog just to get some sort of reward out of it. Then he demands I give him a $20 for the pay he missed from having to leave work to pick the dog up. I gave it to him because I felt embarrassed over the entire situation and didn't want to drag on any longer, but I'm still not sure if I actually did something wrong.

549,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone!

I'm a year and a half into my divorce of a husband who I spent 10 years with. It's not finalized yet and we've been sharing custody of our son (6). We divorced due to him cheating with me mutable times with a family friend, he intends to marry now. I've never allowed my own feelings and humiliation damage my son's relationship with his dad. We are both mature between drop ups and picks up, re - scheduling and managing the financial part and have never fought. I've never bad mouthed him, or even mention him around my son despite feelings I'm working through because I know how impressionable he is.

The issue raised though when ex's fiance moved in with her 2 children. She and I use to be close friends, but obviously have no relationship at the moment. I know she speaks badly about me and repeated private things I once confided in my ex husband about to other friends and her older children. Word gets around. Recently my son has been returning home repeating foul language and asked me the definition of words, such as whore, c\*nt, insane etc. When I ask where he picked that vocab up, he says she was saying that what dad's fiance calls you. He then started talking about a swimming pool and mentioned about me going 'into' the deep end. I asked him what he meant about that. He told me again, dad's fiance was saying you going into the deep end, which I assume he meant to say going off the deep end. He asked me if I was going anywhere which I replied no. He mentioned that didn't make sense because she said you're going to leave me after they have the wedding because you'll be too sad.

I will admit, once I realized about the affair I became incredibly depressed and was needing a great deal of therapy so my son spent more time at his father's new place. I really didn't want him to see me like that. Both ex and his fiance became aware of what was going on. I've been doing much better now with the right medication and support, which ex is aware of as well. Perhaps my son is just misphrasing, but I feel like his future step mom is saying things she should about me and I really don't want him over there if she's involved. I haven't messaged my ex, I intend to speak to him in person tomorrow. Would I be the AITA if I asked him to stop having her around him unsupervised?

These are all her words. When she was telling me over the phone I was just speechless. I know she has issues that make her easily accept abusive behavior. And I can't help but feel that not only is this ""relationship"" incredibly inappropriate in many ways, that this man is potentially manipulating her with his age and supposed sexual orientation? If that makes sense.

She wants to bring him to visit me and our nine-year-old sister. I didn't know how to respond to her on the phone call in which she proposed this. I don't feel comfortable with my sister introducing this relationship to our baby sister. I don't want her to bring this probably really fucking weird man to my house and I don't even know what to say.

She's going to go off on me for suggesting that she's not making a good decision but WIBTA?

Edit: thank you guys for giving me some peace of mind! When I told my sister I framed it like I wasn't sure it was a good idea since he's a new man in her life rather than going with stating the 100 other red flags. My sister still called me an asshole and said I'm not being fair because baby sister lives with me and my boyfriend, which is dumb as hell because we've been together going on 5 years and it's a really healthy relationship?? but whatever, I feel like I did the right thing and I'm not about to expose my baby sister to the mess this whole thing will be",20,40,0.93

556,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I are attending a friends wedding this summer. The groom and my SO are friends from childhood, and there’s a whole group of their long-time friends attending from all over the country. One of the group, we’ll call him Bob, has had alcohol problems for years - everyone has a story about his awful drunken shenanigans (even me and I’ve only met him twice), and at this point many in the group kind of avoid him (which isn’t too hard since he lives halfway across the country), and don’t even want him to stay at the shared Airbnb for the wedding. 


So the other night we were chatting about the wedding and Bob came up, and we all worried he might cause a scene. Eventually they decided that since this was the only foreseeable chance for their group to be together that they should take the opportunity to stage an intervention. They felt that since the groom is bobs good friend that he should be involved.


While I understand their reasoning for the timing and agree Bob needs help, I argued that it was inappropriate to involve the groom. It’s his wedding weekend, he should be focusing on himself and his FDW, and I didn’t think it was fair to make their weekend about Bob. Some of them countered that this was about bobs health, so it’s more important than their wedding. I’m sure the groom would want to know on some level that this was happening, but I think your wedding is (ideally) a once in a lifetime moment that should be full of love and you should be able to treasure in your memory. They said they would do it the day after the wedding, but I feel like if I was the grooms FDW, I would be heartbroken that this important moment in our lives and our first day as a married couple got taken over once again by bobs problems, and that the groom wouldn’t be able to focus on this one weekend that’s supposed to be about them. 


My SO is torn, and we know it’s going to be hard no matter what, but since I’m not myself one of their childhood group, I’m questioning whether I should’ve even argued for insulating the groom and just let them do their thing, and I feel like a bit of a dick for saying the couple’s wedding experience is more important than the grooms involvement and bobs health and safety. Maybe I’m just glorifying weddings too muck, idk. I just can’t help feeling sad for the couple that so many of their close friends would remember their wedding as “intervention weekend”, and that it would become an inextricable part of their own memories of it. I want to support my SO and help him navigate this situation, but I just don’t know what the right answer is. 


So reddit, I need your advice. AITA for saying the couple’s wedding experience should be prioritized over Bob’s health and his friends intervention? Should the occasion not matter if this is their one chance to try to get bob to get some help? 


TLDR my SO’s friends want to stage an intervention at another friends wedding. I don’t think the groom should be distracted by being involved. AITA?",77,103,0.94
557,Not the A-hole,"I drive a 2002 Miata. It's a common mod in the miata and racing community as a whole to ""delete"" you A/C and Power steering in order to cut weight increase power and refine the feel of the steering.

It started out as just a leak with some occasional squealing. That went away and I didn't pay much mind to it, in fact  I like how it feels (although I should thoroughly depower it by removing the seals from inside the rack)

Flash forward to yesterday when the pump locked up and cut my engine off. I called AAA and got a free tow to the shop where I work. I turned it on and, obviously, heard a horrendous belt squeal. Cut the belt off and and tried to turn the pump.

Then I drove the car home.

When I told my dad ""fixed it, all I had to do was cut the belt off :)"" He went off on a huge rant about how I need to spend my money and not be cheap and for some reason he brought up mecum auto auctions like I wanted to buy some old muscle car or something even though I've said many times I love my car and will keep it forever. He kept bringing up my brothers car and how he'd just done a $1000 worth of repairs (at the shop I work at, after I offered to do them for just the cost of the parts). He also kept going on about how dangerous it is even though I reminded him that power steering was an option for miatas!

558,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I were invited to a friend's wedding. We are not very close to the friend,haven't socialized with them in years, although I did some work for him a while back (for free). We keep in touch here and there, FB, birthday text, etc.

Friend owns a restaurant with his GF. Wedding is at their restaurant - casual, no gifts. They've also said no kids, explanation being they can only have so many people in the restaurant (for fire code/liquor licence reasons), and if everyone brought their kids, that would mean less adults that can come.

We have a 5 year old. He has some health issues that require monitoring, although they are much less serious now than when he was a toddler. Aside from that, I am not comfortable leaving my son with just anyone.

The wedding is on the Sunday of Labour Day weekend, last long weekend of the summer. Our regular babysitter isn't available, and neither is our back-up. We're having a hard time finding a sitter, and I'm not comfortable leaving my son with someone that he doesn't know, and that we don't know and trust.

Husband and I decide he'll stay home with our son, and I'll go to the wedding. I text friend today to tell him. He asks where husband is, is everything ok, why isn't he coming - so I explain we can't get a sitter. He responds that he is a business owner, he does a lot of weddings, and he sees how kids behave, and that he just wants us to have fun. I'm a bit stunned so I ask him, where did that come from? I can have a good time without my husband (there will be other mutual friends at the wedding), but if my coming alone is a problem (for numbers, seating, whatever) to let me know. Friend responds that he is very hurt, that this is a wedding not a gathering, that I am not obligated to come, and that this isn't the first time I haven't showed up to something (we missed a party at the restaurant last winter because son was sick - I called and explained, didn't just pull a no-show). I text back and tell friend I am coming because I want to be there, repeat I'm not leaving my kid with just anyone, and that I respect his choice to have the wedding he wants, that I'm entitled to care for my child the way I choose, and ask if we could just respect each other's choices and agree to disagree.

Friend doesn't respond.

So, when we first got the invite, I wasn't offended by the no-kids stipulation - his wedding, his rules. But now, I am kind of offended that he's lumped my kid (who he hasn't seen since he was 1) in with other ""badly-behaved"" kids, and think the no-kids rule was about just not wanting kids there, as opposed to the capacity/fire code excuse. I've given them plenty of notice, wedding is exactly a month away, and I thought suggesting I go alone was a reasonable compromise in the circumstances. But now, I don't feel like going at all (solo, or with husband if we do arrange child care), and I feel like friend is acting like a Groomzilla.

560,Not the A-hole,"So my wife is about 30 weeks pregnant with our firstborn son, we're both incredibly excited and have been taking in absolutely everything.

We've been going to an antenatal class for the past few weeks now - relatively small group that I generally get along with; except for this one dad, who seems to be very critical of other parents. In the past he's told some in the group that they should ""just amputate a foot as soon as they're born"" when one couple said they wouldn't outright ban sweets, called parents who watch TV irresponsible (don't ask, no idea) among other things.

Well, my turn came very recently.

The dads were all hanging out during the coffee break and were all shooting the shit about how the pregnancies were going. To preface this, I am a massive sports fan. Usually wear jerseys a lot (I find them comfortable to wear) and am right on top of scores etc. I joked to another dad there who was also a massive sports fanatic that our boy was kicking so hard in the womb that it wouldn't surprise me if they went on to play for my favourite Rugby League team. Old mate overheard and remarked ""Why would you want him to like sports? I'd rather my child were intelligent myself.""

This set me off as I was pretty tired of his crap and I just blew up at him. Told him to shut the fuck up, how dare he act superior to the other parents, and that he had no right to comment on my encouraging my son to follow sports if he wants to.

Went home still fuming, the wife was saying she thought I was overreacting a little bit, but I just couldn't figure out where he got off. AITA?

EDIT: Right, a number of people have been caught up on this part, so I’m just going to edit it in here. I have responded to the whole “blowing up/screaming” thing.

561,Asshole,"My family and I hosted an exchange student from Prague a couple of years ago.  Last fall, his family offered for us to visit and stay in their flat in Prague.  I researched airfares and asked my two kids if they would be willing to pay $1000 each to cover their airfare.  At first, they declined but subsequently agreed.  They are 16 (twins) and have summer jobs.  They each already had enough in savings to cover the cost.

We are a middle class family (maybe more towards lower-middle class).  My wife has a disability so we are a single-income family.  We travel for vacations occasionally and I have never asked my kids to contribute to a vacation before.

The airfare turned out to be $775 each.  When I let my kids know this, I was surprised that my daughter was nearly in tears.  Her recollection was that I had told her the airfare was $375.  This is the cost for the return airfare - I don't know where the miscommunication came in. She is VERY fastidious with her money and this extra cost really upset her.  I explained that the original amount I told them was $1000 and that this was a deal.  I told her that she would have to pay the $775 or that she could not go.  If I offered her a reduced fare, I would have to do the same for her brother. The trip would then cost me an extra $800.

My wife says that IATA because parents shouldn't charge their kids to go on vacation.  A couple of her friends went to Europe with their families when they were teenagers and they didn't have to contribute financially.  I feel that we wouldn't get to go otherwise and that most kids don't get to travel to Europe.

562,Asshole,"I (F 28), a stay home mother, have never had pets in my life. My mother was allergic to animals fur so yes no cats, no dogs, not even goldfish or hamsters for me and my brother growing up, which is why my brother (naturally an animal lover), decided to adopt 4 cats and a dog as soon as he got his own apartment years ago.

My sons (10 and 8 yo) recently told their father they would like to have a dog. And I was excited myself, because it would be my first dog *ever* as well! So together my sons and I started doing some research online what to expect and how to take care of a dog as not only as a pet, but also a family member. 

But my husband, who himself, never had pets growing up, thought adopting a dog is a huge responsibility. As much excited as he was, he thought we should learn first how to have a pet around the house, by adopting an animal which does not take too much effort and time to look after. So he got us two male Syrian hamsters instead to get us prepared before adopting a dog.

I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. I had already had this picture of a cute golden retriever puppy in my head and already expected him to bring one home. But anyway we loved the hamsters we named them Rolly and Tolly and the kids were super excited (treating them like dogs calling them boy, thinking they wag their little tails when called it's super cute really).

And, I have to say this is probably the main part which makes me the asshole here, I had not done some research as to how to take care of a hamster prior to getting ours, out of ignorance that they're a piece of cake to handle. So we fed them a lot of green vegetables almost everyday, which is a **BIG NO**. Both came down with 'wet tail' and died soon after. My boys were beyond devastated.

However, my husband took this as a sign that we are not ready. He said we would get a dog when the kids are a bit older or maybe never at all. I had a bit of a fight with him about it and he said *""we can't even keep a rat alive for a month. Let alone a dog!""*
And it rubbed me the wrong way (I know he didn't mean to attack me personally) but I took it to heart that he thinks I am not responsible enough to have a dog. 
I told him hamsters and dogs are way different. Hamsters are small and more fragile, while dogs are stronger and more *sturdy*.

But he wouldn't budge. I got really upset with him which confused him because he thinks the purpose of having a pet is to teach the children some responsibility, which according to him, we failed to do when the hamsters died. 
I know he meant good but I still felt offended. I haven't talked to him for 2 days now. 

Is he right, though? Are we/Am I not ready for a dog yet? Have I maybe taken it too personal and am overreacting?",134,94,0.8
563,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I’ve said some identifying stuff on my main account.

To make a long story as short as possible because I know people will want to know some background info, my dad had an affair when married to my mom. My mom was an alcoholic and could be pretty verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards my dad. Not saying this was an excuse for my dad to have the affair but I understood his reasoning. It was a messy spilt. 

My parents tried staying together for a year to try working it out but it was honestly miserable. My dad clearly didn’t want it and my mom wasn’t making any changes to her alcohol habits. My mom found out my dad was continuing the affair. 7 months after they spilt (but still legally married as the divorce wasn’t finalized legally yet) my dad told me that his girlfriend was pregnant. My mom found out and as expected she didn’t handle it too well.

Over 5 years later, I have a half-brother I adore. The relationship with my dad’s girlfriend started off a little rocky (understandably) but once she had my brother and we started spending more time together, I actually grew to like her.

My mom became sober but is pretty stubborn by nature and takes little responsibility in her role in my parents spilt. She’s become civil with my dad but still despises my dads girlfriend. I understand and she’s entitled to feel that way. But the issue is she’ll bad talk my dad’s girlfriend in front of me. My mom won’t even say her name and often refers to her as “baby mama”. 

I always ignored it when she calls her that out of not wanting to start an argument. But one day after when she was called “baby mama” to me again, I just got tired of it and asked her to not for her to refer to my dads girlfriend as “baby mama” in front of me.

My mom was MAD. She said that “I was sticking up for her” after what she did to my mom. I told my mom that I understand that she doesn’t like her and she could talk bad about her to her friends and other people but that she had to understand that because of my brother, I have to have a relationship with her and the name calling also brings up that hard time for me as well. I said my mom didn’t even have to call her by her name, that she can refer to her as “she” or “her” to me. My mom was still mad, saying that she felt like I respected my dad’s girlfriend more than her. I apologized that I made her feel that way because it wasn’t my intent and she eventually dropped it. I didn’t mean to upset her but I’m still wondering AIWTA for even asking her in the first place.",65,241,0.94

565,Not the A-hole,"Two days before, I met a girl on Tinder. After exchanging a few texts, the conversation took off. We talked for like an hour, and everything was going well. We both were having a great time.

In the morning, at around 4 am, I go out for a walk, so when I told her the same, she first asked me my Instagram username and there, sent her number even though I didn't ask for it. I was like, ""why would you do that?"", to which she replied, ""Alright give me yours, I'll call you."" I gave her my number.

First, I thought she's just joking, but then she called me at the same time. I felt strange, but we ended up talking for another hour. When I hung up, I could feel the pain in my ear. I always face a hard time conversating with people on the phone. I had to beg her to disconnect the call because it would have been rude if I'd have done it. I also told her that I've had to study and finish my work because she was a real talker, and didn't want me to hang up the phone.

Fast-forward, I came home, did my work, and studied for another couple of hours. I was completely exhausted so I went to sleep. Boy, when I woke up, there were 10s of missed calls and lots of texts, both on Instagram and Whatsapp. I had no idea what had happened, so I called her. Her response was really weird - ""I thought you were ignoring me"".

This wasn't the end, she called me multiple times after that. I had to throw so many excuses that I started running out of one.  I had no idea what to do, so I forced myself to talk to her even though I've had many works to do.

Next day - Nothing changed. Lots of calls. Lots of messages. Tons of Instagram notifications. I had to do something about it. We had a heated conversation, and I felt like she has completely lost her mind. ""We just met yesterday. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to talk about all day?"", I said, but instead of responding, she unfollowed me on Instagram and blocked me on WhatsApp. To be honest, this made me feel a little good from the inside.

My happiness didn't last for long because she started calling me again. I was in no mood to talk to her, so receiving the call was not something I was going to do. I was disturbed and angry.

After taking a shower, I wrote a message to her in which I mentioned a lot of things and asked her to not to call me, message me, or send silly Instagram posts. My final message was - ""Please don't waste your time on me because I really can't talk to you. I don't have time for your endless gossips."" She didn't respond after, but unblocked me on WhatsApp and followed me on Instagram.

Months ago my son invented a holiday called “Kid’s Day” for 8/3/2019, and has been planning stuff throughout the whole summer. Fast forward to today, I signed my son up for Brazilian Jujitsu to learn how to defend himself because to be blunt he’s an easy target for bully, so I want him to be prepared. His class (4-7 year group) whole thing is self defense against bullies, and one of the golden rules is only practice during class and if being bullied. 

So after everyone bowed out and shook the hands of the teacher my son (7 4’3) decides to walk up to a 4 year old girl who comes up to his chest and grapples her by her GI and slam her to the ground with a leg trip move her learned a few classes ago. This little girl went down hard and was crying, which made my son cry because he’s never hurt anyone before. He got talked to by the teachers and was made to apologize and is a emotional wreck right now. I didn’t yell at him at but I did speak to him and asked him questions about why he did what he did and did he know it was wrong. Since this is the first time this is happen I need to punish him for it to make sure he really understands. 

Now as I mentioned earlier “Kid Day” is on the 3rd which is Saturday and right now it’s Thursday night so any punishment I give him will be shorted lived (pretty much one day) due to his holiday. So the only punishment that I think will get the point across on how he seriously did a bad thing is to cancel “Kid Day”  Would I be the asshole for that?

Edit 1: to give a little background on why I’m being a little harsh is his very first class he came home and tried to do the same exact move on his little sister who is 4 and we explained to him that that is a  big no.  Also his teacher has said at every single class that you don’t practice at home, you don’t do it to show off and you only practice with a willing partner and once the class bows all practice stops.

It also seems he targeted the little girl because he couldn’t take down the other kids his size, so he found the smallest person in class.

571,Not the A-hole,"So I (M18) was talking to a friend of mine who we'll call Brad (M18)at the library months ago, when another friend of his who I was somewhat of an acquaintance with, we'll call him Nate, We got off on the wrong foot initially, or so I thought, but we'll get to that when we get to that. We decide to hang out at his house, and we agree on temporarily exchanging PS2 games. (And yes, the temporary aspect was emphasized)

If you don't know already, PS2 games are no longer in production, so I decide to hand him my Persona 4 copy, which I bought as part of Persona 3+4collector's bundle that was worth ~40$ (It comes with a bonus disc usually unavailable otherwise, which was inside the case when I handed it to him). He gave me a game I decided to try out, which was a Sonic Collection (i forget the full name)

After we exchanged the games, I had a surgery (which is why I agreed to trade a game with such a long playtime), and I spent around two-three weeks recovering, which I felt was plenty of time for him to finish the very long game, on top of that I gave him a few more days cause I never tried the game he gave me, and spent some time playing that.

I text Nate, no answer. I text him at a different time, no answer. I learn that Brad was hanging with Nate lately at the time, so I ask him to get the game back for me, he then tells me that Nate told him he had no idea what he was talking about, I got angry. But I had nothing I could do, I forgot where Nate lived (although it's a short walk from where I live) so I couldn't confront him.

Fast forward to today. I am walking to the library nearby, when look who I see, it's Nate, and he looks exhausted with some exercise, I confront him, he says Brad has the game, that is complete BS, i've been to Brad's house several times just this month, and it wasn't there, Brad's also been my longtime friend, and he always returns stuff when we exchange or let each other borrow it. He starts spouting out some half truths which I debunked with Brad when we talked later, and he's walking to his house. Bingo, now I know where to confront him at.

I plan on going there with Brad, and his younger brother John (M17), and confronting him about this once again. And basically try and force him to give it back (and return his game, obviously), or at the very least get him to pay back its worth (~20$), I wanted to check with this sub to see if this is a bad move and see if there's better solutions.

Update: Brad texted me a few mins ago and told me that he found out what happened to the game, so we're not going to his house anymore.

572,Not the A-hole,"This afternoon, I happened to sit at my computer and my coworker left his punch in-out login open. I saw that he showed to have clocked out at 2 PM, even though I know for a fact that he left at 10:30 this morning. It also showed that he clocked in at 6AM, despite the fact that I arrived at 7AM and he didn't arrive until about 7:45. If you're wondering how he managed this, despite not physically being present at work, our system can be accessed by basically anything with an internet connection, so yes it's possible to clock in and out on your phone.

I then got curious and I snooped through his time card. Not cool, but whatever. Every single day he punched in an hour before me, despite arriving 30-45 minutes late every single day. I knew he took some liberties and rode the clock here and there, but I didn't know it was this extreme. He also runs personal errands multiple times per week, all of which he stays on the clock for. It's always the same; dry cleaning, haircut, whatever. All things that can be done after business hours. I looked a little deeper, and this guy has been regularly stealing about 40 hours of overtime every 2 weeks. This has been going on for 2 years now.

Now here is where I'm torn. I've worked with the guy for nearly 3 years, so I've come to know him well. We get along great and we work well together. He's also recently divorced, so I know he needs the extra money for child support and legal fees etc. I want to say I believe what he's doing is unethical, and I do, but I also know I have to pull his weight so much when he's not around, and his checks are nearly double mine because of what he's doing. I believe that he's actually screwing me out of money, especially when he leaves for several hours at a time to ""pick up his dry cleaning"". Tell me, am I the asshole for wanting to report him?

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: His excessive over time has earned my department some reprimand. We've had a few (honestly, probably around 6 in the past 2 years) meetings concerning our overtime, which resulted in a loss of hours for myself and others in my department. So yes, what he's doing has affected me financially in the past. And just so we're clear, this guy is making around 2,000 a month more than I am to do half the work. On average, I get about 5-10 hours a week overtime. It's plenty to get my job done. This guy is clocking 20-30 hours over time PER WEEK. Hope this clears up some things.",291,987,0.95

I do adore her, but at times its hard to keep your sanity.

Ive found other people outside of this field do not always understand how mentally exhausting this job can be, so once a month all of the staff get together for a drink to laugh/vent it out. Its very relieving and gets rid of so much of our stress. We do NOT mock our clients. We will however, laugh about the questions they ask every morning, or things that make us need a break, or times that we have just almost given up. I will admit sometimes we say stuff like ""If I have to hear that question one more damn time"" while laughing, but its not serious. Its like a big detox of everything that is frustrating.

Well, we got together like we always do, vented about our experiences and laughed them all off. We noticed a group of bar patrons giving us the evil eye, so we lowered our voices because we weren't there to offend anyone. However, they kept staring at us, and clearly were upset. One finally came over and started to berate us for ""daring to gossip about disabled people like that."" I asked her if she had ever worked with people with diabilities, and she said no, but she was disgusted if this is what the care workers all acted like. 

I gently told her that she had no idea what it was like to work in that field and if she felt so strongly, she should get a job as a caregiver and see how long she lasts. She kept trying to berate us but we ignored her until she left.

My question is, are we assholes for doing this once a month? Should we stop? I honestly never viewed it as a problem but does it look that bad to the general public?",52,102,0.95
576,Asshole,"This is basically a dispute between me (30f) and my younger sister (25f).  Throwaway acct.

My sister (call her ""Summer"") is lately into not wearing a bra. Its not just about comfort or fashion, its her new feminist/ political statement.  Summer thinks (and I agree to some extent) that women shouldn't have to wear bras if they don't want to, that there's nothing wrong with our boobs, etc. 

I'm fine with all this. It's her body, her clothing choices, etc.  But I was pretty embarrassed/ pissed when she showed up to our aunt's funeral braless under a black dress.  I just found it completely disrespectful. You could tell she wasn't wearing one, people were staring, etc. I felt that it took away from a day that was supposed to be about my aunt and made it about Summer's political statement.  I told her to go put one on but of course she didn't have one with her, etc.

Anyway we had a fight over this and we still haven't really made up.  Her position is that she ALWAYS goes braless now, that's her right, so she shouldn't have to make exceptions for things like funerals.

578,No A-holes here,"This happened a while ago - I went to the cinema to see Endgame and in the seat behind me was a kid about twelve years old who proceeded to yell out, jump around, and kick the back of my seat through the entire screening.

I turned around to glare about ten minutes in, and the kid's mother said ""he can't help it, he has a condition"" - so I turned back around, tried to ignore him and enjoyed the film as best I could - but to be honest it kind of ruined my experience.

This was at a large cinema chain in the UK who offer weekly autism-friendly screenings, where the lights are left on, volume is reduced, and more noise & movement from the audience is accepted. We were not in one of those screenings.

580,Not the A-hole,"Recently got back into the dating scene and to help start off, I went back on Tinder just to get a heads start.

About a month or 3 weeks ago, I match with a guy who lives pretty close and we pretty much hit it off, text on the app for a little bit and we chose to exchange numbers.

Fast forward to about next week, he text me asking if we can hang out and I inform him that I can't, I would be running errands for my mom because she had a couple of medical appointments to do throughout the evening. He then ask if we can just talk in person while we do those errands, for which I inform him it was kind of out of the blue and I still had to finish the errands. He replies with an excuse is an excuse but I just let it go.

Yesterday, he texts me again asking if we can get breakfast. I felt it was kind of out of the ordinary, seeing we haven't even met yet, nothing was planned and it was 5:30 am and told him maybe but I can't promise anything, seeing I was tired from the night before for work reasons and got home late but still had to run errands. He then says maybe we can have breakfast in his car, implying we pick it up and since he had my address anyway, it wouldn't be a hassle (planned another meetup a couple days before but had to cancel to babysit), as he is driving to my house. Wasn't able to shower or change, due to him being literally a couple minutes away, so, I caved in and said yes, not in the mood for a possible freakout in front of my apartment building. He also chooses to tell me in the car that he was autistic, me saying that I didn't mind and we continue our drive.

He chooses a diner close by, we eat and before being able to say I'm ready to go home, he blatantly states that since he was autistic, girls chose to skip him. Choosing to continue, I ask why and he says that due to people who have different thinking to him, him being observant was seen as being rude and impolite. Basically, from what he told me, when he matches with someone, to start off an ice breaker he would tell the girls his pros and cons of what he sees and what should be different next time and said that he didn't want to tell me because he felt it should've been obvious already of how I take care of myself, while I reply I wasn't able to change since he literally came to my house without warning me first. Aside from that statement, he adds that because he's autistic, he doesn't believe whatever he says isn't allowed but at least people should understand he says it because he's observant and it should help people be more aware of themselves.

After getting home, I tell him I can't continue contact, him stating that I just don't understand his way of thinking and drop all communication with him.

To be clear, I have no issue with anyone with disabilities or mental illnesses, for I have a couple of my own but I felt he just used it as an excuse to judge people and their appearances.

581,Not the A-hole,"My 17-year-old daughter, my husband and I have been struggling for the past few years. She has pretty much no respect for us. has made it clear that to her, we are essentially her roommates (her exact words) and we cannot tell her what to do. She’ll be out as “soon as she’s 18”. Talking about it, punishments, trying to get her into therapy, etc. nothing has worked. She just hates us. The main reason behind all of this stems from when she was younger and my husband was in the military. He was not around much, because of work. We explained why this was, but it had an effect on her and I understand that. She doesn’t have to like that he did that, but the way she treats us, isn’t great either. She doesn’t even call him “Dad”, just “my mother’s husband” or “your husband” if addressing me. (And the way I get lumped in there is because I “defend him” aka I used to say “Why don’t you and your dad try to sort this out?” or suggest therapy or a number of other things.) She’s also tried to hold things against us like “You wouldn’t let me go to dance class when I had the flu!”

As much as she likes to pretend that she’s this big bad adult, however, she is still living under our roof. She’s never tried to run away or anything of the sort. She will sneak out, but she’s always home by morning. Anyway, there are rules we genuinely try to enforce. One of them is, no drinking. We live in the US. She’s not 21. There isn’t a need to drink. The other day, we had some family over the wine was out. My daughter came over and tried to pour herself a glass. I took the wine bottle away and said “No”. She said she could have some. I said, no, you’re not of age and I don’t want you drinking. I could tell she was going to try to pitch a monster size of a tantrum, and I just held my ground, telling her that she could drink at 21. She turned to her aunt and said “See, this is the shit I was telling you about, they think they actually have a fucking say in my life.” before storming out of the room.

My husband thinks that starting a whole thing in front of company wasn’t worth it. I think my daughter plus alcohol is a bad idea and giving in, would further fuel her disrespect. Am I being an ass here?",675,2422,0.95

585,Not the A-hole,"Major Edit. 

Apparently, the lady told her kids, “I don’t see how she didn’t see the door was closed when I was driving.” They came to my house all worked up. My response was, “I warned you that she didn’t drive well. You said she’s fine. It’s not my job to check if the garage is open or closed, it’s her’s as the driver. I’m glad she’s OK, and even happier that no one was hurt. I love your mom, and wish only the best for her.” They spit on my driveway and left. 

Fake account, blah blah blah. 

Here’s the story. My neighbor is a really sweet old woman. She still drives around and does errands, although I have no clue how since she has horrible eyesight. Whenever her kids come and visit (usually once a month) I share my concerns. Their typical response is “Thanks. She’s ok. We’re monitoring the situation.” 

They’re really not. She drives down the block sometimes, and I really fear for the kids walking across the street. There have been some very close calls on the block and other neighbors have spoken up to her and her kids. Nothing doing. The worst is, when she rolls her window down and chats with us as she drives, since she’s completely oblivious to anything in front of her, but she still tries to chat with everyone because she’s friendly.

So, here’s what happened. 2 days ago I was sitting outside and she pulls up in her RAV4. She rolls the window down and asks how I’m doing. I noticed that even though she was only driving really slowly, she thought her garage door was open. It was not. 

I chose to “not notice” and she promptly drove straight into her garage door. She actually got startled, and hit the gas pedal really wrecking her car and presumably the inside of her garage. Of course the police came along with her kids.  I chose to stay inside so it wouldn’t seem like I was saying “I told you so!” Anyway, it turns out she is almost legally blind, and the police told her she should NOT be driving and I think they’re revoking her license or something.

AITA for not warning her? On the one hand, it could’ve been a kid, and instead it was just her property. On the flip side, why am I playing god?

EDIT - adding some info as per requests. 

I did speak to the police along with some neighbors. They said we can submit a report, which would cause the woman to be notified by the police which would include our names. We decided it would just cause a rift on our otherwise easygoing block.

The officer also told us that this is one of the most frustrating concepts. Seniors have a hard time giving up their licenses because it makes them less mobile. He told us that no lawmaker will ever introduce a bill to require drivers tests on seniors, because they would be voted out of office by.... the seniors. They love to vote. 

We agreed it there was nothing to gain by reporting it since we had already spoken with her. Our hope was that eventually her kids would man up and stop her.",374,3107,0.96

590,Not the A-hole,"I'm on holiday in Canada from the UK. I'm aware that it is custom here to tip in restaurants. I find it weird, but it's not my place to argue against it so I've been making sure to offer the minimum acceptable.

Yesterday I decided to stop at this Lebanese place that caught my eye for lunch. I am allergic to sesame, which is frequently used in this cuisine. My server was a nice lady who seemed attentive when I explained that due to my allergy I would like the shawarma dish I ordered to be served without any hummus as seen in the picture, because I know it's usually made with tahini. I also clarified that my allergy isn't so severe that I have to have my food prepared in completely wiped premises - I can handle traces, just not if it is served intentionally. She asked if garlic sauce was okay as a side, I said no problem.

When my food arrived I happily began to eat, until after a couple bites when I started to feel my mouth swell and my throat itch. Thankfully I hadn't had much and I was carrying antihistamines, so after swallowing the dose the worst it got to was me fighting the urge to vomit for a few minutes. I called out to the server, who was clearly in range but didn't seem to hear me. I called her again, still without response, so I got up and walked over to her sitting by the kitchen to explain that I just had a reaction and needed to know whether they had omitted the allergens that I asked them to. She was apologetic and went to check with the kitchen; coming back to inform me that they had drizzled the meat with tahini-based sauce out of habit which I didn't notice because I thought it was garlic. They apologised again and re-prepared the whole meal very quickly, but one thing that I didn't appreciate was her comment as I was brought my food again that I 'only said to take off the hummus on the plate' in a tone that implied to me that although I mentioned I was allergic to sesame, apparently I should have also specifically named every sesame-based product I didn't want.

I ate my meal and it was fine. Not particularly good, nor bad; I finished it mostly out of hunger. When it came to paying the bill of around $25 I was prompted by the card machine to select my tip amount. At this point I hesitated, especially as each percentage had a little comment like 'Good', 'Satisfactory', 'Poor'. In that moment I decided that actually, I really didn't have a good experience, so I hit '0%'. The server was polite in handing me my receipt, but I couldn't help but notice that she had a pained expression.

Since then I've gone over the situation in my head a few times and I feel guilty. The lady was nice and welcoming, and I recovered fairly quickly. However, they did fuck up pretty significantly considering the possibility of someone less prepared or more at risk being in my position. I think where I'm conflicted is feeling that I might've been too harsh in punishing her for what was arguably the kitchen's mistake. AITA?",84,43,0.91
591,Not the A-hole,"so my roommate has a horrible history of not waking up for visitors, I normally have to pretend he is sick or something so he does not get woken up. we have had contractors be unable to do the job as they cant access his room.

I told my roommate and he told me ok.

592,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been out of the office Monday-Wednesday with a herniated disc, very painful to the point where I can barely even walk. however, my job is high-stress and being out for one day puts you behind, let alone three days. 

so I went in at 8:30am cst this morning and took a muscle relaxer as soon as I parked, hoping it would help take the edge off. well it didn’t (big surprise for someone who has chronic pain regularly) so around 12:30, I took 50mg of tramadol. I’m not a small person so even this small dose doesn’t really help all that much more than the muscle relaxer does. 

one thing led to another and my boss ended up learning this information. she then proceeded to tell me that I “couldn’t be at work on prescription pain medicine” and that it made her “uncomfortable” and “why would you take the medicine if it doesn’t even help, next time just ask and I’ll give you some ibuprofen”.....

keep in mind, I work in an office behind a computer, not a forklift or “heavy machinery”. I’m not abusing the drug and it barely effects me. (does she seriously think ibuprofen is gonna do anything?) I’m getting my work done so I don’t have a pile of work waiting for me once I’m feeling better and can come back full time. who knows when that will be so I feel that I’m doing this for the benefit of the department. I’m here to do my job and go home, I’d prefer not to be in excruciating pain the whole time. what if I had to take medicine like this on a daily basis? would I just not have a job anymore?

it made me upset the way she was condescending like that and especially in front of all my coworkers. so I ended up barely saying goodbye and just leaving in tears; from pain, yes, but also embarrassment. I’m an adult and I can take care of myself. if I felt bad enough, I wouldn’t have cared if I got behind in work and just wouldn’t have come in at all.

593,Asshole,"Our dog died tonight. I know I am already the asshole as I struggled with a faulty electric gate and accidentally  let him out and into the street. 

It was an accident and it happened so fast. He was a big Bullterrier and he was gone before we could get the car going to follow him.

I drove around for about 15 min and sadly we found him on the side of the road. The guys at the fuel station said he was hit by a car. My daughter was in the car with both me and her dad. 
As he got out the SPCA ( Animal services) stopped behind us. 
He had no exterior wounds but they confirmed he died. 
I asked my 15y/o daughter to wait in the car, she was hysterical and screaming. As they loaded him in the van she asked if she could say goodbye to him.
 
Neither me or my husband thought it was a good idea. She was already so distraught. She cried for quite a while after and I held her and kept consoling her. 

It’s now 3 hours later and she just came to us now and said she didn’t say goodbye to him and we should’ve let her. She really wanted too. 

AITA for preventing this ? My instinct was just to protect her from getting hurt more than she already was. But I’m now doubting my decision.

Quick Update : 
Thanks everyone for the input and condolences. It’s been a tough night. We had a lengthy discussion now and I have followed some advice from the comments. I sincerely apologized for preventing her her goodbyes and told her that I realize she’s not a baby anymore. We chatted about our feelings and I had to explain why I thought it was the better option at that moment and that I was wrong. 
She asked if we could collect his ashes and I said I will arrange for us to do so. We are going on holiday soon and she’d love to take his ashes to the beach as she says he would’ve loved the beach. We will do just that. I told her that me saying sorry doesn’t  require forgiveness. She’s allowed to feel what she feels and process everything in her own time.

When we got back to the car, I told her not to correct me like that in public and that I thought she acted completely rude and made a scene in public over nothing. She told me that *I* was being rude by not saying please and to not go out in public and act like I was raised in a barn. I told her that she shouldn't complain that I didn't hang out with often enough if she was just going to be a bitch when I did. She told me to go fuck myself.

No, I didn't say the word please at that time, but I greeted the cashier with an upbeat tone and was polite.

596,Not the A-hole,"This may sound really weird—I’m a bit confused about it myself, but please hear me out.

I (26M) have been with my GF (24F) for 3 years. I love her to death, but we do have a habit of avoiding difficult discussions by (sometimes passive aggressively) joking around and pranking each other.

A few weeks ago, I pointed out that her underwear was pretty clearly visible when she bent over in her skirt. I didn't ask her to change (and I hope I didn't come off that way), but I just wanted to make sure she knew and was comfortable with it. She was a bit curt with me for the next few days, but I thought we were eventually over it.

When we were shopping for our vacation to Mauritius, she bought and showed me a bunch of new swimsuits, all g-strings and borderline micro bikinis. I made the connection to the skirt conflict immediately and was a bit annoyed that she was still caught up on that. I didn't say anything, because her body her choice, but I realized that the same thing applied to me.

I thought it would be fucking hilarious to keep playing her game, so I bought a jock strap online and had it shipped to my mate’s house.

Fast forward a few weeks and we're in Mauritius. We go to the beach this morning and I pull down my swim trunks to reveal my strap in all its glory. 

My GF was a bit shocked, and whispered that I should cover up because I was making her uncomfortable by wearing that in public. There weren't any kids around and I'd been grooming for this, so I told her no, my body my choice.

We’re throwing a goodbye party and she’s inviting most of her class. She was going to the mall with some friends and I told her she could get a new outfit for it. I gave her my card, gave her a budget and left it at that.

I checked my account later that day and realized she had spent way over budget. I went to talk to her and she admitted that she had not only gone over budget for herself, but she also bought outfits for her friends. She said “Dad has a new job, we can afford it.” She then said they planned to do it because we were making her move. I was blown away by the entitlement, took the new outfit away and then went to one friend’s house, explained what happened. They said they were going to give it back anyhow because they didn’t feel comfortable accepting expensive clothes from us. 

I go to the second girl’s house (I had called them ahead of time, mind you, I didn’t ambush them) and they gave me the clothes but said they found this to be very rude. They said that these were a gift and I was taking it back. I said considering it was given without my consent, they should understand. They said their daughter was upset. I told them that they were all in on this, my daughter admitted it, to get back at us for moving, did that bother them? They didn’t seem to be. Which is fine, but still, I thought they’d see it from my side.

599,Not the A-hole,"So we lived together for 6 years. We did have separate bank accounts but split all bills and used each other’s money without questioning. A week into being official she cheated on me, which meant the levels of jealousy and insecurity surrounding this guy were pretty high at the start of the relationship 

She’d been distant for a while and one day I asked if she needed to talk. That same day she packed a bag of things, walked out the door and never came back. It wasn’t on bad terms at all but she barely replied to my texts trying to sort out bills and other joint things. I was basically left picking up all the pieces of a shared life on my own, including rent, bills and responsibility of our 2 dogs. 

For a couple of years we had been using an old run-around car that we paid £1000 for. Around 3 months before we broke up she decides she wants a brand new car. I have no interest in this and wouldn’t want to use it, so we agree I’ll use the old one and she will take out a finance plan for the new one. However, she has terrible credit so it would be in my name. I see no problem with this - we frequently talk about marriage and children and every other aspect of our lives is entirely shared. The contract length is 6 years. She hasn’t spoken to me about anything serious since the breakup so I just kind of assume she’ll keep making payments and there won’t be a problem, though the money does come out of a joint bank account made specifically for the car. 

2 weeks after the breakup I find out she’s in a relationship with this guy from before. She had been cheating on me for at least 2 months prior to breaking up with me. All I can imagine is her and this man whizzing round in what was supposed to be our family car. My friends point at that at any point she could stop paying for the car and I would be screwed. 

I text her saying that, even though I don’t want the car and can’t really afford it, I also can’t have this un-ended situation for 6 years and that I need closure so will take over payments from the car. She wouldn’t be losing anything other than the £1000 deposit. But she owes my brother £300 that she has said she will not be paying, and I would be giving her the runaround worth £800 that she could sell. 

She said I was being completely out of order and threatened to take me to court. She would have no legal standing as all documentation for the car is in my name and the money has come out of a joint bank account. I feel like a bit of a dick because she loved the car and I don’t really want it... but I couldn’t see a better way the resolve the situation. I was genuinely trying to come up with the best solution to allow us both to move on and was a little shocked by the response. Was I an asshole?

But he can be EXHAUSTING to be around at times. He simply does not know how to just be calm and have a nice family time with us, everything has to be the max amount of fun, everything has to be a cool party.

Just to give an example, last time we had a family dinner at a restaurant, he started flirting with a random woman from another table, invited her over, kept insisting we all do shots, then kept asking everyone if we wanted to stay and go to a bar somewhere instead of going home. He also told about a dozen stories about his trip to Greece. He dominated like 80% of the conversation of the dinner. 

&#x200B;

I told him that he cant do that stuff while hes with us, and he just laughed and said ""oh come on, its MIAMI, you're joking right?"" and acted as if he barely even cared what I was saying to him, and that he was gonna party like crazy either way, then he said he had to go and hung up. I feel really upset about this, hes gonna be in the house we are renting there, and if one family dinner with him was exhausting, what is 15 days going to be like? I know everyone else is hesitant about him going, but it seems like nobody really wants to say it because it feels wrong to tell your own son he cant come on vacation.

604,Asshole,"As background my husband (34m) and I (34f) have been struggling to conceive for a little over a year. Its been a rough road and I've been struggling mentally. Fell down a rabbit hole about 3 months back, drank too much, screamed at my best friend, generally hit rock bottom. I'm in therapy and its helped a lot, but I'm still sensitive about the whole thing. I'm also an only child, so there's a lot of (self imposed) pressure to give my parents a grandkid, since I'm the only shot they have. Cut to today and I see that my dad has posted this on facebook:

""a quote on a childfree, career-focused life from John Hirschauer: ""Life can be lonely when you've made a God of yourself.""

Reddit. I lost it. I emailed my dad directly and let him know how hurtful the post was, and that if I lived a childfree life, it would be after years of blood, sweat, and tears, not because I fashion myself a God.

His Response? "" This was not directed at you. It is a reflection on our society’s general success-driven course. For example, I missed your childhood in my pursuit of wealth and fame. ""

I also texted my mom. She told me ""he didn't think about you"" ""he's sorry now."" I told her that he should have thought about me before he posted something like this, and that neither she, nor my in-laws would ever do that."" I also told her I needed some time to process what just happened and talk to my therapist about whether it makes sense to keep him in my life (this is not the first crappy insensitive thing he's done by a longshot). I'd been tolerating him because my mom and I are very close. After that, she told me I was ""hypersensitive"" and ""expected them to be mind readers."" So I blocked her- phone, email, social media, they cannot contact me at this point. I didn't tell them, I'm not looking for a fight, i'm looking for space. My husband has historically been the one who tells me not to cut my dad off, but when I called him sobbing today and he came home, he looked me in the eye and said ""I honestly don't have a leg to stand on here with respect to telling you to keep him in your life. I've got nothing right now.""

Here's the thing, They're 64 and 72. I know there's a good chance one or both of them could die soon and I don't want to not be on speaking terms with them if one of them gets sick, but I also can't explain or rationalize their behavior. Both of them have been sucked into the social media rabbithole and are becoming increasingly detached from reality. Reading those texts, its almost like they don't realize they're talking to their kid. I haven't decided if/when I will unblock them. This literally just happened. I'm really torn. I don't want to lose my parents forever, but I'm not sure they're good for my mental health.

So, AITA for being upset by the post? AITA for blocking them?

Edit: The response was overwhelming. I deactivated FB, unblocked my parents from my phone, but kept them blocked on IG/Twitter. The latter is more a function of trying to get away from their constant competing political rants (of which this was one- apparently this came from a National Review article about Candice Bushnell?).

605,Not the A-hole,"My mother went in for major surgery. While this surgery is pretty routine, she was gravely ill, intubated, barely responsive for several long weeks. 

Doctors told us to talk to her (even though she was under anesthesia) and let her know we were there. I spoke to her to let her know that I loved and needed her. Like most parents, she desperately wants grandkids. I told her that she couldn’t go because I needed her help, when the time came, essentially promising to have a baby.  

She made a full recovery. 

A couple of years later, at a group dinner with several friends, my siblings and other family members present, a friend teased me, pleading for me to have a baby. My mom took this as an opportunity to call me out, saying it was time for me to keep up my end of the bargain and have a child. I left the table, fighting back tears and she never apologized. The subject was dropped and never picked up again. 

My partner and I are on the fence about having a child. We need to figure it out soon but I really don’t know what I want to do. He’s not too keen and I’m worried about making the right choice.

609,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want my mom to know my real account when I show her this post (regardless of which of us is the asshole).

So here's the deal:  I've gotten very into tracing genealogy and got an ancestry DNA test done earlier this year.  My closest match is a lady from near my home town who shares 675cM of DNA with me.  All of the shared DNA is on my maternal grandfather's side.

&#x200B;

Based on this information and what I know of my immediate family, there are only a few ways this lady can be related to me.

1. She could be my mom's half sister (my grandfather is mystery cousin's father)
2. She could be my mom's half niece (my grandfather is also mystery cousin's grandfather)
3. She could be my mom's 1st cousin (one of my grandfather's brothers would be her dad) \*\*note: My grandfather is deceased, but both of my grandfather's brothers are still alive but very old, one of them is 90\*\*

So basically, there are 3 options and all involve my grandfather or 1 of his brothers having an illegitimate kid.  My mom has submitted her DNA but the results aren't back.

My mother is losing her shit.  Her first response when I told her about mystery cousin was to tell me not to say a word and ask how we can hide it.  She is deeply religious and any suggestion that one of her family members had sex with anybody but their wives is more or less blasphemous.  She says I will be ruining lives if I ever reach out to mystery cousin or say anything to ""the family.""

Now here is my argument: I've looked up mystery cousin, and she and I work in similar healthcare fields and she seems like somebody I would like to know and befriend.  Her daughter (who is my 2nd highest DNA match) even resembles my daughter.  She hasn't logged in to ancestry since I got my results so hasn't seen our match.  Mystery cousin only has 3 people in her tree, so it's likely she is searching.  I have traced our ancestry back to the 1600s (with DNA proof) and would love to share my research if she's interested.

Obviously, I won't be saying anything to anybody until my mom's results come back and we can determine just how closely mystery cousin is related.  Assuming there isn't some glitch in the DNA (as my mother says MUST be the case), would I be the asshole for reaching out to mystery cousin and explaining our relationship which would likely lead to ""the family"" finding out that somebody banged somebody they ""shouldn't have?""  The very suggestion makes my mother furious.",130,511,0.97
610,Asshole,"I am not having a traditional wedding. I wouldn’t say I was eloping, but it’s not exactly a full wedding either. My fiancé and I are getting married at our favorite vacation destination. We were in a long distance relationship for many years with her living in one country, me living in another and now she’s moving to live with me fulltime (we’ve gotten visas in the past to temporarily live with each other). Anyway, I don’t have too much family or friends I want at the wedding and hers can’t afford to come to America/mine can’t afford to go to her country, so we’re doing our small ceremony followed by a quiet dinner at our favorite vacation spot with my parents, brother and best friend, then a bigger reception in her country in a year or so.

Now onto the problem. I technically do not have a bridal party. I didn’t think it was fair since my wife didn’t and won’t at our wedding reception. But my best friend is coming. My mom also had me pick out her dress. My dad and brother don’t care what they wear, so I chose khakis and polos for them (it’s not a fancy thing).

My best friend, for the record, lives in the area of this vacation spot. She doesn’t have to travel and it’s like a half hour drive. I’m paying for the dinner later and her flowers. All I asked was that she buy a $30 dress I found online, to wear to the ceremony and dinner, because it sort of goes with the other outfits. She got a little offended and said that she wasn’t a bridesmaid or MOH, so I couldn’t ask her to wear anything specifically. I offered to pay for the dress and she said that it was fine, she’d pay for it and wear it, but I was being a bridezilla, trying to dictate outfits when I didn’t have a wedding party.

612,Everyone Sucks,"Last year I moved into a 3-bedroom house with this guy I met through apartments.com (or some equivalent site). His parents own the place. He'd been living there for a year or so with his brother, who had to move out. He has the master bedroom, which has its own bathroom, and he uses the third bedroom as an office. 

I paid $900/m for my bedroom, which given the location and how nice the house is, is a pretty good deal. He paid for the internet, which is about ~$100 per month (fuck comcast) and the property owners paid the other utilities. There is no contract signed between me and the landlord. There’s no contract between my roommate and the landlord either. I give him my half of the money and he gives that to his parents, the landlords. 

A few months later, I meet a girl, we start dating, she moves in. She moved in relatively quickly, and her moving in was kind of sprung on him. Given the circumstances, he thought it would be necessary to renegotiate the allotment of rent owned by each of us. This is where I found out two things: 

• He also pays $900 per month. We were paying 50-50 despite him having the master bedroom and a second room. 

• He wanted to keep my girlfriend living here a secret from the property owners, thinking if they found out, they'd increase the rent. 

So a deal was struck. I did not like the deal. But nonetheless, he offered a deal of 66-33. We pay $1200, and he pays $600. We also split the internet bill 50-50, and I pay for any data cap overages (fuck comcast) because I'd be the cause of any. And my girlfriend and I have free reign over the living room with the big TV. This was his compromise, given the fact that he had the extra bedroom. 

This shaky handshake agreement continued for a few months, until he got  a girlfriend who moved into the house. Then it went back to 50-50. The landlords were not told about her either. 

Last month, they broke up and she moved out. Today being the first, I send him the $900, and he unsurprisingly is trying to get me to pay the $1200 rate previously negotiated. 

I say the 50-50 deal when I moved in was unfair to begin with, and the 66-33 deal was also unfair, and that we acquiesced because we sprung the move-in on him and understood his feelings on the matter. But I believe the deal should be renegotiated. I offered $1050, which is about 60-40 as a fair compromise. 

He claims that simply won't cut it because he claims to have money problems. I don't really know the extent to that because it's not any of my business. I say if my offer won't cut it then we'll have to move out. 

My girlfriend thinks we should move and get out from under his thumb (and the landlord’s thumb as well, who’s also been kind of a dick in the past). And she thinks we should be saving that extra money for our future. 

I’m hesitant to move because I don’t think we’d find a comparable place for $900 a month, or even $1200 a month, and I hate moving. 

Am I the asshole for trying to renegotiate the deal? 

Is my roommate being unreasonable? Or am I?

615,Not the A-hole,"So my boyfriend's sister is about five months pregnant. She is having a difficult time, vomiting often, and it's affecting her work performance. Understandably, she is stressed out from all of this.

I work two jobs and my boyfriend works overnights. We don't get to see each other as often as I would like. My time with him is very important to me.

His sister has, according to him, always been very clingy and entitled, and I think this pregnancy is bringing out those traits even more, to be honest. Oftentimes when she is stressed out before her shift at work begins, she will text my boyfriend asking him to come over and drop off some weed so she can handle her work shift. It's really annoying because he will drop everything for her, we'll drive over to her house, and I'll be forced to endure her complaining until she leaves for work.

I've spoken with my boyfriend about it. He's annoyed by her behavior as well, but he seems to think there's nothing he can do about it. Sometimes he will ignore her texts in order to hang out with me, but other times he'll be like ""she's blowing up my phone"" and we'll have to go over there.

The thing is I don't mind his sister's company in small doses - she's a good conversationalist when she's not complaining about her health. I just would rather we see her maybe once or twice a month, not every single week. I'm so busy and it kind of drains my energy because she's so negative.

616,No A-holes here,"About ten years ago, my family took a long trip across the world for a two week long vacation. I was 19 at the time; just starting to lighten up from being a real downer of a teenager. I still think of this trip as a real highlight of my life because sometime during that trip a light bulb went on in my head and I realized what an amazing family I have.

The only souvenir I still have from that trip is a 8ft by 10ft cloth with a rooster embroidered on it. I’ve always liked birds and my family had a chicken coop at the time so it made sense.

I moved to NYC the year before and I had that cloth hanging on the wall over my bed all through college and in my first few apartments after college. Three years ago I moved into my current place that is perfect for me, except for the lack of open wall space to hang a massive cloth. I started dating a girl who ended moving into that place, and she created a drawing of the rooster on the cloth and framed it for a gift for some occasion. I hung the drawing on the wall and have the cloth stored at my parents house a few hours away. 

We date for a few years but break it off pretty amicably in the middle of last year, she finds another place and we both move on with our lives. The only thing remaining of hers in my apartment is the framed drawing. It reminds me of that trip, not of her. 

A few months later, a good friend and I realize we have feelings for each other and we have been dating now for most of this year. I’ve never been happier, I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman and that has been clear to me since soon after this relationship started.

 I never mentioned that the drawing came from my ex because it honestly hadn’t crossed my mind as possibly being weird or something I should mention. We had a little get together with some of my girlfriend’s friends at our apartment last weekend and it was a blast, as usual. My girlfriend’s friend (L) set the whole brunch up. L has been close friends with my current girlfriend since college, but had also met and become friends with my ex in the last year of that relationship. She also seemed unhappy when I started to date my current girlfriend and tried to convince me to give my ex another try. Yesterday, my girlfriend mentions that her friend (L) told her it was super weird that I still had that photo up. I told her the whole truth about it and offered to take it down. She said I should keep it up because it fills the space on that wall nicely.

Even though she told me to keep it up I can’t help but feel like I’m the asshole if I do. She’s the most kind, caring, and compassionate person I’ve ever met so I can definitely see her swallowing whatever she really wanted to say so as not to start a fight. I could just go get the cloth from my parents’ place and fold/cut it and frame it. I just get so much joy when I see that dang rooster I don’t want to take it down until I can replace it.

I mention this because that seems to be a major problem with some of her family. From the first time I went to her house, her immediate family was either standoffish or outright hostile (except her brother and grandma). Things haven’t changed over two years, they’ve really only gotten worse. I won’t go into details but it’s pretty bad stuff sometimes, and it even got physical at one point, to the point where her uncle had to pick her older sister up and carry her to another room and bar her in there until she calmed down (also we’re all 22-27 so that was pretty pathetic to have to see). Most recently, we took a trip to Colorado together for our anniversary. She has family up there and they’re very traditional and to keep things on the up and up, we stayed with her aunts family in separate bedrooms. We had a good time until the last day, where I overheard her aunt encouraging her to break up with me (and also drop out of college?) while my gf just told her she didn’t really want to. It was an awkward goodbye with the aunt after that, but we left and before leaving town, we stopped by her grandparents to be respectful. We were then treated to a lecture by her grandpa about how he doesn’t approve of us, if I really loved her I would marry her and get a job (I’m a CS major at a university so not a bum or anything) instead of dragging her all over the country. He said over and over that he doesn’t approve of us. After this latest incident, I’m pretty done with her family. I had tried to be polite and respectful before, and always tried to keep in mind that maybe they haven’t received great treatment at the hands of other white people, but honestly it’s just ridiculous now.

So, a bit of context. My mom[47] has been a single mother almost her whole life. I[20] and my brother[30] grew up with just one parent and life has always been tough for us. My brother moved out when he was 23 and I am planning it as well, ASAP.

She is very good at planning her money, but terrible at saving money. She pays her bills and almost runs out of money every time. However, she often spends money on useless things. If she has free money, she *will* find a way to spend it. 

I go to university, work 4 days a week and earn three times less (even a bit more) money than she does. She knows I have money (because I am the kind of person to save up) and pressures me into helping her because she is often out of money.

628,Not the A-hole,"Hi you guys, first time posting so forgive me if the format isn't great:

Me and a group of friends have recently come back from a vacation where one of my friends, lets call him Erin was driving us throughout the week. He volunteered to drive and we all paid for gas, the rental car, etc. 

When he went to return the car however, the rental company initially said that the car was fine but after about another hour when our group was at the airport, the rental company called back and said there were some minor damages. 

Now he's panicking a little bit and worried about how this would affect his insurance back home but we were boarding the plane in a couple of minutes so there was nothing that we could immediately do.

Fast forward about two weeks and he got a letter back from the rental company billing him for approximately 1k for some damages to the car. He then said he did not want to pay all of it by himself, but as he was the only one who was driving and he said that he got insurance, we all did not think it was fair of us to pay. At this point he demanded the money for the car from everyone and we were all confused because prior to renting the car, he told us that he bought insurance for the vehicle (which was supposed to be split between the 7 people here). 

At this point he tried rounding up all the money from us and told us he wanted to pay it right away. No one immediately returned to his message as it was during the work day and then he asked one of his friends to write up a draft saying that if we did not pay him his \~141 each within 48/hours, that he would pursue legal action. 

So everyone in the group was talking now and thinking how this situation got out of hand. I pulled him aside and talked to him to see where he personally stood on the situation and he said that he had a mental breakdown over this whole episode and wanted it to get everything paid off immediately. He then went on to say that his other friends would have paid it off for him no problem and this was the first scenario where this type of conflict had happened. I told him that yes, that was a nice gesture but we're not his other friends and I personally did not feel that I had to pay for damages that I did not cause.

Continuing the conversation in the group chat now, he was aggressively speaking out about how distressed he is and how he's again having a mental breakdown. At this point I had enough because he then started shifting blame to other people who did not drive the car/ had no reason to be at fault for the damages for the car. I then asked if everyone's friendships (including mine) was worth 141$ and he said I don't know.

I paid him the money and just told him that ""once you even threaten to sue people who are close to you for just a couple of bucks, you've burned serious bridges"". After that I told him to only talk to me again after he re-thought the situation again.

Am I the asshole for telling him off on how he handled the situation?

631,Not the A-hole,"So our family has been going through a bit of a stressful situation that I can’t detail, but it’s been putting a lot of pressure on my husband. So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can’t really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn’t give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.

We have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can’t exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.

So I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said “yes thanks!” GREAT! Green light given!

Then I remembered that it’s my Dad’s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn’t care. I asked again, and said “This first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it’s your decision” and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn’t care again. Alright, he can’t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn’t care, so I invited my dad. 

My dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. 

Tomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me “How about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?” I asked why. He said “The game doesn’t start until 7, it probably won’t end until 9. I have to be up early for work” I said “Okay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don’t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad”. 

His face dropped. He said “I thought that was MY decision?” I said “Well it was, but you just kept saying you didn’t care, and I figured you really didn’t care, so I invited him”

He stopped talking and just said “k”. I can tell he is upset. I said “I’m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted. I had to make a decision and this was what I decided.” And he just continued to not respond to me (yes this was in PERSON) and then I had to go to work. So we haven’t been able to talk since.

632,Not the A-hole,"My sister is a pretty off her rocker right now. She has essentially chosen some guy from the internet over being a parent to her son, abandoned my nephew with our mom the grandmother, and I happen to live with grandma(my mom)  at the moment while I save money. So, I’ve been around this whole ordeal over the weekend. My mom is exploring getting guardianship, but found out the price of it all. She is hesitating now because of the expensiveness of the process and she frankly doesn’t know if she can actually manage to care for him. My mom is 61 and her health is iffy. She has manageable health issues, but she hasn’t taken the best care of herself the last few years. And she’d basically has be doing it alone on the daily. I live with her right now and I help where I can, but I want my freedom and in the long term I know I can’t take on a kid right now.

The grandma, my mom, said she is considering just calling CPS and saying my nephew was abandoned with her. I already know realistically I can’t provide my nephew the time or care he needs and I really don’t want the responsibility of a kid at this point in my life.

642,Not the A-hole,"Okay some background: I don't live with my parents, my brother and sister do. Me and my boyfriend both have cars, and when we go to my parent usually my boyfriend drives. 

When I was younger, every time I wanted to go somewhere I would have to take my bike/public transport. I didn't mind, the problem was my younger brother and sister would be brought almost everywhere by car. That was a little unfair, but I didn't mind.

Now some years later, I have had my drivers license for about 4 years, and my brother for about 2. My sister, who could have gotten hers 4 years ago, still hasn't done the exam, so she can't drive. Since I've been able to drive, I have had to take my sister almost everywhere. To school, her work, her friends, boyfriend, parties, ... In the beginning I didn't really mind it, but since a few months my parents and my sister have been expecting me to just drive her, and change my shedule to fit hers, so she can get to her meetings on time. Not only that, when my boyfriend is at my parents with his car, they will just say things like ""you can drop sister off at her job, can't you"" they don't care if we've got anything planned. 

After this had happend a couple times, my boyfriend said to me ""could you maybe ask your parents to not do that, your sister should be able to get herself to her work"", at first I didn't want to tell this to my parents, but it was getting a little bit to much, so one day I was at their home, and my sister was there so I said it. 

""Do you think maybe sister could get to her work by bus? It's not really fair to us that we have to drive her everywhere, and I used to do everything by bike, maybe she could do that too or she could get her drivers license?"" My parents were livid ""we can't ask that of her, she has to make it there in time, and has to take alot with her"", so I sugested they could drive her, but no that wasn't an option: I was already driving, so I should take her, they didn't want to leave the house that night. 

Later that night (I didn't drive her) my sister text me saying she is really hurt that I won't help and support her. She says she could lose her job, and she thinks I'm the asshole for not driving her. She says she doesn't have time to learn how to drive/get her license, and that she just can't bike to her job, because nobody does it. 

So what do you guys think? AITA for not driving her? (sorry for my English)

643,Not the A-hole,"I have a hobby of studying and practicing magic and tricks. While it is far from professional, I am able to be a performer for the kids during bi-annual family gatherings at my grandaunt's. I love the attention, and the kids love my performance, it’s been all fun until recently, I was told off by one of my relatives.

I was, seemingly cutting my fingers off with a plastic knife before rolling it up and setting it on fire, and of course, the finger magically grew back. The children laughed and cheered as usual, but afterwards a lady relative(One of my distant cousin, I guess? Too many, can’t remember them all) approached me and asked me to not perform “dangerous"" tricks using things like knives and fire.

She said it encourage dangerous behaviours in children, especially her daughter who is only 5. She was worried that the she may try copy my tricks and play with fire and knives and hurt herself in the process. I admit, I never quite put much thought to that, but can’t say it doesn’t hurt when one have put effort to perform and being told off like that, and her tone attracted a few other adults to look in our direction. It’s one thing for children, but I get rather nervous when adults start to stare. It’s very embarrassing.

After some quick thinking I apologized in the most dramatic way possible, made a very big apologetic  bow towards her, raising and twisting my voice in a funny way, made a face before snapping my head to the side with a “crack” sound as if its broken(it’s just a popper). The children, who were confused at first, started to laugh, and it seemed to ease the tension in the atmosphere.

The lady relative wasn’t the least bit impressed though, she looked more embarrassed than I was earlier, and obviously angrier at me. Oh well, I made a slip and got out before she could confront me again.

644,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: I have no amount of thanks worthy to the comment that suggested homeowners insurance. After calling, it looks like they are willing to cover half of the amount. As for the BS ambulance charge, my boyfriend called the hospital and tore them to shreds over it, and it has now been removed. He's also filed a formal complaint against them. As for the remaining 600 euros, his mother actually offered to split it with me, and sincerely apologized for the poisoning and how she acted. This was actually a huge step forward for her, so my bf also offered to pitch in. So yeah. The incident is now over with and we're all moving on and going for dinner somewhere today. Surprisingly happy ending. 

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were out visiting his mother at her country house. His brother and sister-in-law, and his sister were also there. The farm has loads of fruit/veggies/berries/herbs/etc growing, and a lot of it is natural, so one evening, his mother decided to make a berry pie. She's cooking the berry mixture, and my boyfriend and I notice it smells strange when we walk into the kitchen. We comment on it, and his mum gets all huffy, saying she's lived out here for ages and knows what to pick.

Obviously she doesn't because about 30-45mins after we eat it, we're all being rushed to the hospital, vomiting and feverish. His mother and sister go in an ambulance, and my boyfriend, myself and his brother and sister-in-law have a neighbour drive us. Because this isn't my home country, I have private insurance while I'm waiting on approval for permanent residency ( bf+his fam have free, national health care). The insurance company I use prefers it if we call to clear our issue before going to the hospital (provided we're able to). I call and explain the situation, and the guy I talk to gives me the all clear to go to the hospital and get treatment.

A couple weeks later, I get a bill from the hospital for 700euros and a letter from the hospital informing me that my insurance won't cover it because the situation was ""preventable"". They even charged me for the ambulance that I didn't use. I call my insurance company, stating the guy I called before I went to the hospital said I was cleared, and they give me some BS answer about that decision not being binding, and that after reviewing the instance I'm not eligible, blah blah. I then call the hospital and try to argue the ambulance charge, but they stand firm claiming that the ambulance was for the group.

I talk to my parents about this, and they think my boyfriend's mum should pay because it was her mistake, and she paid everyone else's hospital fee (about 20euros each). I feel a bit awkward asking, but after some deliberation I send her a message asking her to pay it (minus the cost of the medications and ambulance (was a sh\*t charge but I don't feel it's fair to ask her to pay that)). So I'm asking for roughly 500euros.

She takes this as a super personal attack, and both my boyfriend's siblings think I'm being unreasonable and causing her unnecessary stress. She says it was an accident, and she shouldn't have to pay for it because it was just a mistake. I understand that it was a mistake, but it was avoidable if she paid attention to what berries she was picking. My boyfriend is trying to stay out of it, as it's just been over the last year where he's patched up his relationship with his mother, so he doesn't want to damage it (which I 100% understand). He thinks neither of us are wrong, but isn't sure who's right.

645,Not the A-hole,"So, my sister is getting married in about a  week, outside by a lake, both the wedding and the reception. She’s very particular, borderline bridezilla, but she’s always been that way our whole lives so I expected nothing less.

She requested every female attending the wedding wear a specific style of dress. Long black dress, I guess as to not take any attention away from h

I however am VERY pregnant. Due August 13th pregnant, and can’t imagine anyone being comfortable in a thick long sleeve black dress in the middle of summer, let alone a 38 week pregnant woman.

I asked my sister directly if I could adjust the dress a little bit, make it not as long and shorter sleeves and she freaked out. Told me I couldn’t change the rules because then she’d have to do it for everyone.

I told her I wouldn’t subject myself to heat stroke, and she’s putting people in danger by forcing them to wear black long sleeves outside in the summer.

My mother told me I was being ridiculous and I should just suck it up, but I think my sister is the ridiculous one.

I’m thinking of just wearing a nice black dress that I can be somewhat comfortable in, or not even going.

647,Not the A-hole,"I (M 33) haven't talked to my brother (32) for almost 5 years now. We had so many fights and both hurt each other so terribly that we both stopped pretending that the other exists. It was sad really. We are too different. We see and perceive things in life too differently and the last thing he said to me 5 years ago, I still haven't been able to forget and forgive him for that. But anyway it is not what I came here for.

I got married last month in another city. My parents, my brother and his family they're all living in my hometown. My wife and her family are more laid back and modern in contrast to my family who tends to be more traditional and overly religious. And this is one of the reasons why I stopped talking with my brother.

Anyway my mother wanted me to invite my brother to my wedding as an invitation to reconcile. She said she knew he wouldn't come but I should send him an invitation anyway because it was the right time to put things right between us. I told her no. I was a bit upset about that. I told her to please not bring up my brother and me because it was my and my wife's (fiancée at the time) day and to stop making it about me and him. This apparently made my dad upset that he decided to not come either. My mother was devastated. She loved us all but seeing this family fall apart was too much for her.

My fiancée asked me to be the bigger person and to relent and grant my mother's request but I stood my ground. This was our wedding. It's not about me and my brother or our long-standing feud. Her parents understood the situation and were okay with only my mother, youngest brother and some family members attending. 

The night before the wedding I had a long deep conversation with my mother who was crying all night. It hurt her how her sons treated each other like enemies instead of brothers. She tried to talk me into calling my brother just to tell him that ""I wish things were different and he was here for the wedding"", even if I didn't really mean it. But no. And I asked her to please stop talking about him because it still hurt and angered me.

The wedding went well,  only tainted by the look of tremendous pain on my mother's face as she was trying her best to look happy for me. She was. But she was also sad that my father and brother weren't there for me on my most important day.

And I have been feeling guilty ever since for causing her so much pain. But I don't think my relationship with my brother can ever be repaired. The damage is too overwhelming. The wounds are too deep. I do hope though, I told my mother to tell my brother this, that our children (when I have my own. Brother has 2) will still be allowed to get to know one another. It's their fathers acting like assholes hating each other. They've got nothing to do with it. I hope they will love each other, siblings and cousins all the same.

648,Everyone Sucks,"Some background...my cousin was married about 3 weeks ago. She is on her honey moon so we agreed to take her daughter on vacation with us. I love my niece, and she is stunningly beautiful, very sensitive and smart but also boy crazy as any other 17 year old. I'm only 25 so I feel I have more in common with her than I do my cousin.

We went to the pool at the resort the first day and she wore a one piece with a sarong on the way but when she took off the sarong the bottom was a dental floss thong. I mean her entire butt was out. There must be a huge cultural shift in the 8 years between us because she swam and she walked around with no fear. She has several bikinis that are even more revealing.

As we were laying I sort of brought up the discussion of was she sure that she was comfortable with the attention she was getting. She said it wasn't a big deal to her and it was the style now. She even showed me tons of pics on Instagram to back it up. And I felt like a real old lady when my 17 head old niece talked me into buying 3 thing ""kinis"" of my own that will get here before we leave...so I may be prancing around with my butt out (yikes but fun...I guess?)

All was fine until my husband's freind who lives in town came over for the day yesterday. He's the friend that I tolerate but will never like because he's never got over not being in college. I could see him checking out Alicia's butt which was really weirding me out. He had a few beers and both me and Alicia are sure he said  ""do you like asshole behind thong pics? because that's how you get asshole behind thong pics"" As she was walking by his chair. Alicia grabbed her towel and took off for the room. I told the friend that was an awful thing to say and he gave me the ""what, I was just being honest"" and then ""what I was just joking"" and then the nerve to say ""what, I was just looking out for her from the pervs around here."" I told him to get the fuck away from us and tried of catch up with Alicia. Oh the way I ran into my husband coming back from the bar and told him his friend had to leave and don't you dare argue with me about it.

I caught up with Alicia in the room and we had a long talk about how that wasn't her fault and how he was just a jerk and jerks are everywhere. She handled it very well but I suggested that maybe until my swimsuits get here, she should should wear her competition suits or I'd buy her somthing with more coverage. She got really mad at me and said I was making it sound like it was her fault what he said. I was like no, I'm not saying that at all but maybe when I have my equally revealing suits all the ""pressure"" won't be on her since they'll be another woman dressed similar. She said I wasn't making any sense and I sounded just like her mom. I told her I was really sorry, I'm trying to do my best since I'm not usually responsible for a minor. She got very insulted when I said that and hasn't really spoken to me.

I feel bad but was I the asshole ?

Edit: I think people are really misunderstanding and thinking I’m “blaming the victim.”  I don’t feel that way, I feel I’m saying “wait one day and we’ll be dressed alike and we can deal with the shitty comments together.”

For background, in the youngest sibling with a very problematic half sister, she's 10 years older than me and my single mother has tried to move her out before and invested a ton but it failed and she came back, and put her through cosmetology school that she ended up not passing. My sister has been so babied that she will most likely never be independent, and she suffers from bipolar disorder which is not medicated. She's extremely ungrateful and my mom helps her so much cause I believe she blames herself for her not being successful at anything. My sister has worked less in her entire life than I did, being 10 years younger. 
It's also worth mentioning that because of my sister being pretty much useless when it comes to contributing (at whopping 32 years old!) I have taken it upon myself. I've taken out loans, helped her pay groceries and bills for years. I have co signed a debt (not knowing what co signing is) of over $10k for my mom and the collection agencies are now targeting me with calls, letters and withholding my salary. I never demanded anything from my mom, trying to be the unproblematic daughter to compensate for my sister. and when i ask if we could spend time together I get ignored. My mom hasn't hugged me, talked to me or helped me through this situation that she caused upon me at all (Even though i'm very vocal about saying how important it is to me)

The main point is, 3 days ago I have turned 22 and nobody remembered. Needless to say I am crushed, my dad is in a sect (JW) so he never calls but the rest of my family didn't either, and the two closest family members didn't even congratulate me.

I have always given both of them either money or normal gifts and gave them wishes, but I was forgotten about. At 11pm on my birthday I asked her what day it is and she said it's not her job to do anything during her grown child's birthday,  however she purchases my sister a cake every year for hers. She didn't show any sign of remorse and went to bed. 

Three days passed since 

Today I snapped worse than a child getting griefed in minecraft. I screamed into my mothers face on how I'm always in the shadow, how she hasn't spent any time with me since I was in middle school and how i'm sick of being ignored. I was screeching into this 52 year old woman's face about how I regret the money i spent on her instead on moving out and getting a car, I called her terrible names, told her how unfair she is being to me and how neglected I feel. She had a can of beer standing on her night stand, which I promptly took to the bathroom and emptied into the sink, then threw the crushed can into her room. Yes I know. I just really hate alcohol and it made me even angrier

I'm just truly crushed, I want nothing but my mom to praise me for my efforts to help her and appreciate me. That's literally all I want.

I was furious. I put a lot of effort into making all my guests happy at my wedding, and now I realized Jeff had the nerves to be a creep during it.

About a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don’t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I’ve gone I’ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it’s been free.


I’m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?

Update: Hi guys

I thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. 

I thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn’t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


I wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I’ll be honest I didn’t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


After I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, “I mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it’s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn’t steal”


I made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

It was a gift card. 


I had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn’t read the text that said “gift card” on the bottom.

I’m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like “alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.” But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

Im not preachy about it, Ive never nagged my husband for eating meat and I still buy and prepare meat dishes for him.

However, he doesnt seem to take my decision seriously. He hates vegans and vegetarians and thinks theyre a bunch of snoby idiots who think they are more intelligent and enlightened than the rest of the world and hasnt hesitated to call me out on my ""bullshit"" on many ocassions

We´re both very excited about his restuarant and have spent  many hours talking about the location, the interior, how much staff we sould need and what legal documentations we need to work on. The problem is that my husband is also working on the menu and Im pretty sure every sinlge dish is going to have meat and fish

The other day he told me he would like for me to test his dishes to better work on the menu i a very ""how about you drop the whole vegetarian act now that were talking about something important"" kind of tone. This made me extremely anxious, I took my decision very seriously and the idea of eating meat again, even if its just a  mouthfull makes me very very uncomfortable.

Am I exagerating?

I know how much work and passion he pours into his cooking and that he´s asking me because he really values my input and opinions. Also, hes from a different country and thinks my opinion would be very valuable to see if locals would enjoy his dishes

Is it wrong of  me to say no ?

WIBTA?

\*Edit\*

Well this blew up O-o

Thank you to everyone for your insight and responses, its been honestly very helpful (and thanks for the gold wth?)

I wanted to provide a bit of context for a few things

First of all hes korean and Im spanish, no americans here. Weve been living together for eight years and love eachother to death, weve been through career changes, deaths in the family, economical struggles and more and came out the other side stronger.

I see how me focusing the attention of this post on his disregard for vegetarianism may have protrayed him as a huge asshole or someone otherwise abusive towards me, this is not the case. Hes never yelled at me, hes never insulted me and he has made many sacrifices for my sake in the past, including moving to Spain wo live with me despite having so little prospects for a good job here.

The way I see it, his view of vegetarianism is so negative purely out of cultural context and deeply rooted cultural differences. Yes, Im sure 99% of korean restaurants in america have plenty of vegetarian and even vegan options but thats not really a thing in korea itself. I lived there for years and didnt ONCE see a vegetarian restaurant that wasnt a buddhist one (which are not that common) Same goes for my country, it is extremely tough to find a restaurant with at least one vegetarian friendly item on their menu. Even salads are loaded with ham or tuna. To give some context, the percentage of people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet in the US is of about 5% (according to google, the number may be off) whereas in Spain is of about 2%. However, If you take into consideration the difference in the volume of population between both countries, it really hghlights how rare it is still today.

So, when we talk about our restaurant (which we want to be a more modern korean-style tavern that focuses on the ingredients in the north of Spain) it doesnt surprise me at all that hes not really considering vegetarian dishes on the menu. Its extremely normal here, even american franchises that open in Spain get rid of the vegetarian options for the spanish crowd (I was shocked to learn you guys have veggie burgers at Five Guys I went there and all I could eat was fries) In that sense, his choice to have a meat based menu has nothing to do with his view of  vegetarians and more to do with how most restaurants are over here.

&#x200B;

So all in all I want to thank everyone once again for their input. The way I see it, none of us is being an ahole here, ill just explain to him that it makes me uncomfortable and, while not happy, im sure hell understand, Ill also offer him to have my family taste his  menu, since they all eat meat and my dad is a great cook that will give him much better advice than me

Thanks again!

664,Asshole,"Okay sorry for formatting I'm on phone and TL;DR at the end. 

so as the title says I(21 M) have ghosting issues like, no matter who you are to me, how close we get or anything I'll ghost you at some point.

But that's not a targeted thing I'll just stop having any social interactions with people on my phone for an undetermined period of time sometimes it's hours sometime it's days. And, as you can guess I don't have a lot of friends and my circle of friends is an ever changing one. 
So Everytime I talk with someone through messages/Twitter DM/WhatsApp whatever. When I see that we're kinda getting along well I warn them that this phase may come where I'll just ignore them and won't talk to anyone so i ask them to not take it personally as it is an issue I have and I've tried to fix to no avail. 

Now comes this girl(21 F) I met at college, we kinda clicked during our classes and kept talking through Twitter dm since it's summer break. 
I told her that it's more than likely that I'll end up ghosting you at some point. And she just brushed it off like no big deal I often do it too. Fast forward to yesterday we've been talking on a daily basis, we're flirting etc... 
As you can guess by now it happened, and all I did on Twitter was retweet memes and funny tweets for the entire day, didn't open her dms nor any  message I got during the day. 
This morning I sent her a message and I completely ignored her previous ones, that's where I think ITA i should've apologized but it's been a thing for years and I'm kinda tired of saying sorry everytime it happens.
She lashed out telling me that I'm a huge asshole for not telling her that I didn't want to talk to her and that the""""""phase"""""" was happening, plus I retweeted memes the whole day which was a ""clear sign of disrespect""

That she can't take it, which I completely understand, and that I shouldn't be engaging in social relationship with my situation. 

That last bit hurt me because, even if I long have accepted the fact that I won't be keeping friends/close friends for a long period of time with this kind of issue, her telling me that I should just stop interacting with people because of that upset me so I told her that she was the asshole, that I warned her of my situation and she just didn't take it in consideration as she should have. Then I blocked her number + social medias. 

TL;DR : I always end up ghosting people I know no matter how close, met this girl in college, we talk through Twitter for summer break, I warned her of my situation, she brushed it off, i ghosted for an entire day, came back next morning without saying sorry, she told me ITA and I shouldn't be engaging in social relationships with this issue, I got very upset and I blocked her. 


So reddit AITA ?

Edit : just want to make clear that I didn't just slide in her dms one morning saying : ""hey you may or may not be ghosted in the near future suck it up take me as I am or leave me "" 
I told her that I have an issue with private messages in general and that i stop answering any one that I receive during these phases that can last for  days or for hours, that it's not like she bored me or I was done with her I made it very clear that I enjoyed talking with her a lot but no matter how much I did it won't change the result. I also told her that I wouldn't resent her if she stopped talking to me because of it or any other reason linked to it.

And I'm not contesting the judgement, ITA i knew it before posting and this sub helped me confirm it. 
I need to work on my situation either by seeing a therapist or finding a solution myself. 
I plan on unblocking the girl and sending an excuse message not restart any relationship with her just because I wronged her and that's what I should do in this situation 

Thanks for all the comments I didn't expect my post to have this much.",123,32,0.7

667,Not the A-hole,"Background: my bf and I have been together for 2 years, he goes to college and I live at home with my Mom and work for someone my Dad grew up with. I fucked up a lot as a teen and didn't graduate or get my GED, I've had a lot of medical issues and while I'm in better health now, I sometimes have seizures and can't drive. I was unemployed for a long time before being 'given' this job. But my bf feels like I should change jobs and I don't want to and don't know if I can.

BF's POV: I didn't earn this job and it wasn't fair for me to be given it over people that had the qualifications asked for in the ad. I couldn't do the job I was paid to at the start so I was taking money from the company for nothing. I don't enjoy the work, it doesn't pay well and it won't lead to a qualification that would get me a job I like. My boss often buys me dinner and that makes him uncomfortable. My boss has driven me home twice which is also inappropriate. Since I didn't know my boss growing up, he's more of a boss than a family friend, especially since we're only linked through my Dad who died when I was little and my bf worries about him being so friendly. The job also takes up a lot of my time and we don't see each other as often, it also takes up a lot of free time because it's not close to home. I refuse to talk about it or compromise.

My POV: I didn't earn this job, my uncle knew I needed a job and is good friends with my boss. My superviser wasn't satisfied with my work at the beginning, but I worked hard and she's said she's happy with my improvement. I don't enjoy the job, but the medical insurance is good and I feel happy in general because I can actually contribute for once and do things without feeling bad about it. It pays better than any other job I could get and not many jobs offer qualifications. Since I can't drive I wait at work until Mom can pick me up, my boss does buy my dinner when I'm stuck there until late, but it's ordered to the office, he also pays for his (male) secretary's dinner and a lot of staff are there and the office is open plan.  He gave me 2 rides home, both times it was dark and the bus doesn't go close to home, I haven't taken a ride from him in months.  This argument keeps coming up and I don't think there's much left to say or compromise on.  I agreed not to get a ride from my boss again and I haven't, it would be uncomfortable to start avoiding him and we're never alone together.  His family are well off and I feel like he doesn't understand just how badly I need this job, I have looked for and applied to other jobs with similar benefits and have been rejected.  I'm sick of this argument.",43,51,0.92
668,Not the A-hole,"Hey reddit, I'm going to try to cover everything without sounding preachy or adhering to stereotypes. 


Ever since I was a kid I've been completely incapable of harming animals, even ones some people see as lesser like bugs or rodents. I ate meat as it was how I was brought up but if I was ever confronted about me being an animal lover I would find myself wrought with guilt. 


Now I'm in my 20s and through a lot of introspection I have found myself a fairly spiritual individual. I don't practice any organized religion, but I do believe in a higher power and I believe all life is equal. Human, animal, what have you. I won't even swat a mosquito. I understand this is unorthodox but I am not here to debate this so please be respectful.


A few days ago I was out with friends when I noticed a spider had fallen on a friends shirt. I pointed it out, got a piece of paper and a cup, caught it and released it outside. My friend was furious that I ""jeopardized their life"" to save a spider and should have just killed it. I told them I couldn't.

670,Not the A-hole,"This has gotten way less clear cut than I originally thought it would be!

When I got off of work last week I was very upset to discover my entire bumper had been scraped up with the paint missing and cracked. There was no note left on my car. I was so furious and ready to find who did it and press charges, thinking it was must've been a customer. (I work at one of those arcade/pizza/outside entertainment places)

After spending a couple hours going through security footage I was shocked to find out that it was actually a coworker, one of the maintenance men, and he had hit it with his personal vehicle! The video clearly shows my car shake after he backs out and hits it. My conflict comes from talking with my manager and finding out it has been a rough month for him, as he has had to have surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, then apparently he spent a night in jail after leaving the hospital still with some anesthesia left in his body and so now he has a DUI from that. These are circumstances that would weigh heavily on anybody let alone a blue-collar man who probably lives paycheck to paycheck. 

My original plan was to sit down with him in the office and and try to work out something that would not cripple him financially as my car is driving fine it's just a cosmetic issue and doesn't need to be fixed right away. BUT I just got back from the weekend and now apparently the owner has FIRED him for hitting my car and not telling anyone!

Now I have to decide if it's worth it to try to get an expensive paint job paid for. It would definitely take a chunk out of my paycheck, (I make 8.50 an hour :/ ) but I'm worried I might be sinking this guy even further into a financial pit on top of his hospital bills and court fees! These are the kind of circumstances people become homeless or financially crippled over and I really don't want to do that to anyone, like if I took the money he needed to continue paying for rent or food. On the other hand, as sad as it might sound this '09 Lacrosse was probably the nicest thing I own, having bought it just 4 months ago in perfect condition hardly used. It was a breath of fresh air after getting rid of my previous beater car, which was ALSO involved in a hit and run where I had to pay for damages.

Obviously I want my car repaired but would I be the asshole if I were to make him pay for it, either through small claims court or some other way, during what sounds like a very difficult time in his life?

He recently asked me if it would be okay if he took the kids to New York for a few weeks. I am completely happy for them to go, but my daughter is OBSESSED with New York and she really wants to go. Since she found out her big brothers are going, she’s super excited. 

I am considering asking their dad if he would take her along too, because the boys would look after their little sister. The only thing is I wouldn’t be able to afford it so I’d have to ask him to do it out of goodwill.

After the threats of buying a bodycam, and me pricing them in the store, they started to back off on this behavior and it has been alot better. In fact, the  daughter has stopped trying to use that card entirely after the wife caught her doing it. She heard/saw the kid do something and the kid tried to claim it didnt happen when I said it did, and the kid didnt realize her mother saw it.

I have brain damage that makes me have memory issues, but on top of that, I feel like the excuses with my memory are used against me- people claiming they told me things they didnt or claiming I said things I know I didnt say. I feel like for my own sanity I need to record my day to day interactions with people with a bodycam.

My wife is vehemently against it. I feel its because she and my daughter (8) are the ones using my bad memory as an excuse to flat out make up bullshit and gain the upper hand in disagreements. My wife coddles my daughter and lets her get away with way too much, at least partially because of her own childhood. Between either not believing how some interaction went down or flat out telling me shit qas said that wasn't.

At least if I can ""go to the tape"" I can disprove alot of what I feel is bullshit thrown my way. Her hatred of the idea reinforces, imho, that she knows the stuff she is saying is bullshit.

So reddit, AITA for wanting a bodycam to make sure I am not getting gaslighted and mistreated due to my postcuncussive brain injury?

edit- so for all the armchair physicians out there- I see a neurologist monthly and a neuropsych quarterly. When I mentioned either voice or video recording my day to day activities because I felt people were using my memory issies to take advantage of me, I was told by a neuropsych that it would be a smart idea. Wife has been against it from day one and has recently gotten worse in her weird claims. 

My daughter has SEVERE adhd/add and behavioral Issues bordering on ODD but is extremely bright for her age and will flat out lie about interactions we had seconda before to.manipulate her mother and repeats her mothers bullshit accusation of ""you have a bad memory how do you remember what happened"" when the things either qere said or happened when I was out of her mothers earshot.

Its a case of an overly permissove spouse letting my kid gaslight me and not backing me up, ever, combined with dojng it herself. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree.

684,No A-holes here,"This weekend past one of our dogs found a rabbit burrow with 4 babies in it and tried to run off the with one. Since I was playing with our other dog at the time I was able to grab her and get the bunny back before she hurt it.  I put the dogs up and returned the bunny to it’s burrow, covering it as best I could as it had been before.  Judging by the state of the rabbits they were approximately 8-9 days old.

When my SO got home I showed her where the burrow was and we agreed that the dogs should not be left alone in our back yard without close supervision for the next 2-3 weeks, and making sure we kept them clear of the burrow.

For the next day and a half we had to stay very close with both dogs as they were very eager to get back into the burrow to reach the rabbits.  There was good news however as the mother did return to her brood regularly for feeding. All was well and we were relieved!

Today I had to spend 16+ hours at work, doing a lot of traveling.  About 30 minutes from home I get a phone call that our dog had gotten into the burrow and killed 3 of the rabbits, though she stopped her in time to save the fourth.  She had let the dogs out unattended “for just a minute” while she grabbed some food to put on the grill for dinner.

Having had a similar situation before (I accidentally mowed a burrow, got all 4 bunnies to a rescue that time) I gave her some pretty quick instructions on keeping it warm and safe, and started calling some wildlife rehab/rescue in the area to find it a home.  Luckily we found it a berth and it’s in better hands then ours.

However, after having a stressful day and discussing how best to keep the rabbits safe already, I was fairly upset about losing them. I know nature is nature and things die, but I hate thinking that I was part of reducing their chances.  To be completely honest I internally put a lot of the blame on my SO for her lack of foresight. Not wanting to be a jerk and trying to realize that she already felt terrible about it, I of course did not voice this, though I was very quiet and non-talkative so it was obvious something was wrong.

After returning home from the rescue, she began to yell at our animals and I asked her to stop. She kept going and I told her rather than asked her to stop. When she asked me why I told her that dogs are dogs. They are hunters and going after animals is what they do. I told her even well trained dogs can’t conquer their instincts left alone and it’s up to us to be responsible for their actions.  Following that, she asked me if I thought what happened was her fault, to which I rather bluntly answered yes.

She then became understandably upset and told me I was an asshole who didn’t care how she felt, and “didn’t I think she already felt bad enough about it?”  I had no chance to answer as she has been in our bedroom for the last hour crying and does not want me around.

I had shown her what a jukebox was on old Happy Days episodes, but she wanted to see one IRL so bad. We went to the Waffle House by our house and she was ECSTATIC to see & use one. She picked two songs (""Love Shack"" and ""Thriller""). Important note: We were the ***only people*** in the place - me, my toddler, and 2 waitresses. The minute the first song started playing the waitresses rolled their eyes and commented on the ""shitty song."" Then one of them proceeds to pull out her phone and blast trap music so loud my kid couldn't hear her songs. They were both sitting in a booth dancing and laughing very loudly over the music I paid a dollar for my kid to hear. The whole time they were making *loud* snide comments about how loud and shitty the music we chose was (I apologized for the volume, but we were the *only* people, and I couldn't control the volume). My 3yo didn't cry, but she was sad on the way home bc the girls blasted trap music over her 2 songs. I am really pissed about it tbh (it just happened 3 hrs ago).

690,Not the A-hole,"My brother Howard [32M] and I [24F] are renting a house from our father. Originally it was just me and a cousin, but Howard moved in when she left. Howard and his wife, Janis, have two kids. My niece [5F] and nephew [2M] spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. Howard has them from Friday to Monday morning. 

The current problem—

I have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of “help” and that I find them unreasonable. I am not the second parent in the household, I view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. I am here until I finish school and can move out on my own. 

He wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during MY only free time. I feel like I shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. His argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. I don't plan to have kids. He has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me “selfish” and “shallow” for not helping him out. 

Howard says-- 

I have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. I feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. 

She makes her own meals, but she doesn’t offer to help make meals for the kids. She is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if I want anything [I will give her $$$]. 

When I ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. We have gotten into arguments because she will see I am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if I am okay. 

I need to get away from the kids sometimes. I have asked her to watch the kids while I get milk from the store. She says she will pick up the milk for me. When I tell her I need a minute alone, she says the offer is “I get the milk or nothing.” 

I am drowning in debt, I have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. I just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. I am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful—which I don’t want to be. But I feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. 

Our dad has a pool in the back. She swims laps every morning. It was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. I had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. She said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. So she didn’t have time. I would desperately like some help. 

Conclusion—

We both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. Thanks for the help

691,Not the A-hole,"So - I was on a 3 PM EST flight that was about three hours long from the east coast to TX. The lady in the aisle seat and I started chatting and turns out she was really cool. We were talking pretty much the whole flight, but not loud or yelling. The row in front of me was compiled of three strangers - male, pregnant woman, male.

Around 90 minutes into the flight the pregnant woman passes us a note that states:

@@@@@@@@@@

Hi Ladies - you both seem like lovely people based on your convo this flight so I didn’t want to say anything in an obvious way. :)

my eleven month old is sick and I haven’t slept well the past four nights. i’m also 7.5 months pregnant and flying to tx for an event tonight and all day tomorrow. with that, it would be wonderful(underlined in the note but i’m not fancy enough to do it in reddit) if i could catch a quick nap before the craziness begins.

would you both mind either talking quietly and/or not talking for the rest of the flight? i think others may appreciate this as well. i’ve tried ear plugs and music via headphones but nothing is working. thanks so much :)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@

at that point i started asking the people in the row behind and next to if we were being loud. they all said no we can’t hear anything cause we’re on an airplane with engines and propellers and shit. we tried to bring the tone down to a whisper, but she still kept looking back/turning around randomly. i know she has a lot of shit going on, but the whole letter thing threw me off.

AITA for continuing to talk?

Edit - this might not have been clear for the people who keep saying why didn’t we just lower our volume. we did bring it down to a whisper instead of using our normal talking voices.

696,Asshole,"UPDATE:
Thank you to everyone who responded, whether you thought I was an asshole or not. I appreciated the insight either way. My brother-in-law actually brought up the tree and presents maybe overdoing it to my husband, which surprised me. My husband asked what I thought and I told him I agreed with that part, but felt like a little bit toned down version would still be memorable for everyone. We went ahead and had what we traditionally make at Christmas for dinner, cookies, music playing, and took lots of pictures. I'm very thankful to those of you that told me I was trying to protect them too much, as they were mostly just fine. Thank you also to those that pointed out some things that might bother them down the road, as I didn't think about future actual Christmas being bittersweet with this ""Christmas"" memory. My mother-in-law went to the hospital that night in severe pain, and was heavily sedated until passing a couple days later. My husband was able to be with her most of her last hours, and I am so thankful we all had that time together before.

Edit* i should have reworded my title- it’s mote AITA for not wanting to have a “Christmas theme” get together to say goodbye as an entire family. We will be going regardless, I just wanted to talk to my husband, after getting insight here, about just making it more of a “reunion” type thing 

TLDR: husband’s mom is dying very soon of a terminal disease. He and his brother want to have a last minute “Christmas” (the full shebang) with the whole family as she won’t be here by December. I want everyone to feel good about these last days together, but I’m pretty sure my kids aren’t going to react the way he hopes. It should also be noted our kids are the only grandchildren on his side of the family.

Pretty much the tldr- I don’t even know that my husband’s mom would want to do something like this, but I’m realizing that perhaps this is for them, to have all the familiar Xmas things she did/cooked/etc one last time. They are in a mad scramble to get  decor and food and presents lined up and delegated to family members to surprise her. Only our oldest teenage child understands her illness is terminal. The younger kids know she is sick, but since it’s only recently taken a fast turn for the worst, haven’t been told we will lose her soon. That conversation is happening tomorrow. They will be heartbroken as she was extremely close and involved in their entire lives. This wasn’t a once a year visit type relative. We’ve been visiting much more frequently as of late and the oldest knows it’s as much for her as us. He is able to be calm, albeit sad. I don’t think my other kids will act accordingly. Now add a Christmas tree and a full house and presents and everyone chatting and laughing. I feel like it’s asking a lot of them. To celebrate and enjoy our time a la Christmas, but also grandma may go any day now so don’t ruin the mood by being upset in front of people. To be clear, I fully see several emotional meltdowns happening from our kids and I don’t think anyone wants to acknowledge that’s how we are all feeling. Am I overthinking this? I proposed still getting together with family, food, etc but more of a reunion, not a major holiday. It’s not my family, so am I the asshole for not wanting to add another layer of complexity to this time for our kids?",57,74,0.9
697,Not the A-hole,"I know there have been a few posts about wearing bras here but I would really like some insight on my specific situation. 

I really hate wearing bras. They’re uncomfortable and I don’t like the idea of having to wear a certain article of clothing UNDER my clothes because society expects it. I know about bralettes and perfect bra sizes but I still think nothing is more comfortable.

My boyfriend is usually pretty cool about me not wearing a bra but we got into a huge argument about me going to family events without one. Before going to a dinner with family I got dressed in a nice classy dress but I didn’t put a bra on underneath. He says it’s “disrespectful” and “trashy”. Which really peeves me because I don’t think my body is disrespectful or trashy. He keeps saying “why do you NEED to not wear one”, as if I’m trying to show my body off. But for me it’s like the principle of it. I don’t believe in wearing bras and I don’t think I should have to change for other people, even family. At this point we can’t talk about it without screaming which is unusual for us. I understand that he sexualizes that part of my body and doesn’t want others to see it. But I feel like I want to be the strong woman that I am inside and be myself- and if his family doesn’t like it then I don’t need to come. (Apparently his grandma has complained about it to him before)

I get that putting a bra on is not that bad, and I could just do it to appease him and his family...but that makes me feel gross inside. I wish he would stand up for me and tell everyone that I just think for myself and don’t feel the need to conform.. but I’m starting to feel like an asshole. I don’t want to not be a part of his family over something so silly. And I get where he’s coming from to a point. I just don’t agree that my nipples are trashy, even if a lot of people here (small town in Texas) do.

EDIT: my boobs are pretty average size C cup and perky. Although I don’t think women should be held to different standards based on the body they were born with.

I do get what some people are saying about attire at formal occasions. You’re right there. This specific dinner was really a casual dinner. Most of these fights are over just hanging out family times. But that was good insight I can see that sometimes it is just nice to dress up even when it’s uncomfortable. Unfortunately he doesn’t want me to ever not wear one around them even in my own home. I don’t dig that.",202,58,0.73

704,Everyone Sucks,"My family went from being super poor to very well off since I was a kid. I don’t want to sound pretentious like the title might suggest, honestly it’s mostly about how my dad has made me feel. 

At the age of 16, my oldest sister received a car as a surprise from my dad. The following year, our middle sibling received a car for his 16th birthday as a less surprising surprise. The next year was my 16th birthday and it came and went without anything happening. I got my license and just took over using the family mini van. I still drive this car when I’m home from college. Slightly unrelated but I got into some serious traumatic event that got me sent to therapy and had a bunch of adults constantly counseling me to make sure I was okay. My parents ended up sending me on an educational therapeutic retreat to a foreign country for a summer at the age of 17.5. After HS I moved out of the country.

My parents and I have gotten into it before because the topic of me never receiving a car will be brought up. My dad will always say he gave me the choice to have a car or go to college abroad, which isn’t true. Then he’ll say well he gave me the choice to go abroad for a summer or get a car, which also isn’t true. And then he’ll just get mad and the conversation will end with him walking away without admiring he’s wrong.

I can’t prove to you guys that neither my college nor the trip I took at 17 were choices I made in an ultimatum but they honestly weren’t. He just didn’t get me a car and while I know most kids never get cars from their parents, it’s just the feeling of sadness I get when I think that he got my siblings a gift that he wouldn’t give me that makes me want an answer as to why.

For reference the traumatic event isn’t related to any of this, it happened when I was 17 and was nobody’s fault. Just unfortunate stuff to happen to a kid.

My brother proposed to his girlfriend of a few years last year, the wedding was 2 weeks ago. Ceremony was held on the beach, we planned to move to a hall just up the road we had booked for the reception afterwards. Before the ceremony formally started I felt rather unwell and had cramps in my stomach, this is when I realised I needed to shit. Not a big deal, I can hold a shit in. After about a minute of these cramps I was in a fair bit of pain and both my dad and my girlfriend who I was sitting next to advised me to go to the toilet as there was still a few minutes until we started the ceremony, and my brother would wait for my anyway. I didn't want to go into one of those public toilets on the beach as they're normally filthy, I would just wait until the ceremony ended, then drive back to my place which was about a 5 minute drive, then head to the reception hall. It was obvious I was in genuine pain and discomfort and they kept telling me to just use the public one, I really fucking wish I had. The ceremony started, and less than 10 seconds after the officiant started speaking, I had a huge fart I needed to let out. You know when you try to let a lot of gas out gradually and silently? This worked for a second, and then I convulsed from my stomach pain, and violently shat myself. Everyone within a couple metres heard it, and smelt it, and after a few seconds everyone knew what had just happened. I was gagging and sprinting towards the toilet trying not to vomit from the thought of what I had just done. I took all my clothes off, tried my best to clean myself and just sat in a cubicle and cried for a few minutes. I had no idea what to do. Girlfriend drove me home and I had a shower and got some new clothes on, it had been 30 minutes now and they still hadn't started. Me and my brother have a very good relationship and he wasn't passing any judgment, and refused to start without me there. As soon as I was there I sat back down and no-one looked at me, just pretended it didn't happen. The ceremony went well from that part forward, and we went to the reception. His now wife and her parents were giving me dirty looks and I just went home straight away and cried some more. Later that night received a bunch of angry texts from his wife and her parents, and my own father. Telling me I had completely ruined the wedding and that I was disgusting and should have gone beforehand. My brother's wife is constantly upset that her wedding will forever be remembered as 'that wedding where my brother in law shit his fucking pants'. She hates me for it. 

I have not shit my pants before, this is not a common thing for me so no, I did not expect that stomach cramps meant I was going to shit myself. I should've gone to the toilet beforehand but I didn't want to hold up the ceremony, AITA?",802,3686,0.96
707,Not the A-hole,"I went to eat Mexican food a few days ago. Nothing fancy just a quick $20 meal at the most. The waitress we had wasn’t the greatest. She didn’t fill up our drinks after they were empty for like 5 minutes and had to waive her down to order.

When I get my check I notice the numbers don’t add up right. The food was $9.50 and my cheese dip was $3.00 and she had it added up to be $17.50. I showed her the numbers didn’t add up and she said I didn’t calculate the tax. I calculated the tax and it should have been $2 less than what she priced me for. She left before I could explain more. 

I just decided that if she was going to upcharge me like that then she’s not going to get a tip from me. I told my friend this and she flipped out.

708,Not the A-hole,"OK so this is actually a two pronged problem. 

My husband and I moved several states away from his parents a few years ago. Our children are their only grandkids so naturally they want to keep in touch and visit as often as they can. When they come to visit my MIL insists that they stay at our house (she believes that family should always be together and that it's just rude to not let family stay at your house), which wasn't a huge problem in the past. We have a guest room but no bathroom (a future project on our list) in our basement that has worked well.

My MIL has been having increased physical/ageing issues (due to injuries sustained in a car wreck when she was a kid) that have impacted her ability to walk well and climb stairs. The last time they came to stay, my MIL really struggled getting up the stairs to the point where she was crawling up the stairs.

What's worse, MIL loves festivals/fairs/etc. and insists on attending. Her trouble with walking means she has to stop every 10 mins or so and has to sit, then gets up and wants to see every attraction whether or not everyone has already seen it while we waited for her. I don't mind slowing down, but this makes the day very long and we miss a lot of cool stuff. She says she knows she needs a walker or wheelchair to get around easier but refuses to use one.

My husband and I suggested they stay at a nearby hotel for future visits and we get a wheelchair to make their stay a little easier. MIL vehemently refused both offers and insisted they stay at our house.

We can't house them on the main floor because there would be no room for any type of bedding and we can't have them stay in our room upstairs due to my husband still has to get ready for work and will need the bathroom at 6am. We don't have the funds currently to pay for a hotel when they visit, but are more than happy to cook for them and take them around wherever they want to go. My in-laws are very financially well-off and can afford a hotel so money isn't an issue on their end.

My husband has repeatedly made suggestions that they stay at a hotel for his mom's safety and health but keeps getting shot down by his mom and won't put his foot down. Since an upcoming visit is bound to happen fairly soon I really want to make our house off limits (and insist on a wheel chair for any fun we're planning).

I know the ageing process sucks and I feel bad for MIL, but I don't want her to get hurt or worn out while trying to visit us. 

I plan on doing this but I still feel really bad and I don't want to make anyone upset at the same time.

713,Not the A-hole,"When my husband and I decided to have kids, it was agreed that I'd leave my job and be a stay-at-home mom, because it was essentially cheaper to do that than to pay for childcare. We also save some money because I'm able to homeschool, which cuts down on a lot of expenses associated with public/private schooling AND frees up our schedule to travel during off-peak times. I do however work part time with a couple of side jobs, and he does a little on the side. My husband's salary pays for bills and necessities. Our side jobs are more or less considered to be ""play"" money. 

I've been spending my money so far on things for the whole family, like vacations and throwing extra into retirement or our kids' college fund. My husband, on the other hand, has spent his money mostly on stuff for him. The most recent purchase was over a thousand dollars for a new gaming pc. 

That's fine and all, as it's his money to play with and enjoy, but I started thinking about my own purchases. I haven't really spent much of the money I've made on just me, and I'd kind of like to. So I'm considering cutting out one short beach trip to give myself back a little bit for things maybe a day at the spa or some shopping– things I normally wouldn't do and that likely won't add up to nearly as much as what the trip would cost. And if vacations are something that are valued more than stuff, my husband is completely capable of contributing to a vacation instead.

So... WIBTA for spending that money on something I want, instead?

Edit: We've talked it out. Since I am the one who handles all of the finances, he genuinely wasn't aware that I'd not been spending my money on myself.

714,Not the A-hole,"I'm posting via a throwaway account. 

The past year has been very difficult for me. I experienced an extremely messy breakup with my girlfriend after I discovered that she had been cheating on me with a mutual friend. For reasons that I will not explain in this post, the breakup was extremely messy and resulted in me losing the close-knit friendship group which we shared. For some time, I was in a very dark place which I only got out of with the help and support of my school friends. My confidence and self-esteem definitely took a beating, however in recent months I've begun to feel a lot better about myself. Recently, I downloaded Tinder in the hope that I could start dating again. 

After a few false starts, I got talking to a girl. At face value, it seemed that we had loads in common: shared interests, similar taste in music and film, etc. One thing that seems particularly significant now (but didn't strike me as such then) was the fact that she paid close attention to my job. I work in finance and earn a high salary. Nevertheless, we decided to meet each other in person. I decided to book a table at a very nice restaurant, expecting to cover the cost of the date. I should mention, for reasons that you'll understand later, that this is the sort of place where people wear extremely formal clothing (suits and ties are the norm for men). It is also worth mentioning that my friends and I dine here quite regularly and thus are on very good terms with the staff. My friends were dubious about the amount of effort which I put into this date, but their cynicism did not dissuade me. 

Soon enough, the big night rolled around. Given the nature of the establishment (something which I forewarned my date about) I put a lot of effort into my appearance, donning a suit and tie. I expected her to do the same. You can imagine my surprise when, upon meeting in the bar, I found that she had put absolutely no effort into her appearance at all. In a room of smartly-attired people, she wore jeans, trainers and a baggy jumper. I immediately sensed something was off but pushed ahead with the date. Once we were seated I attempted to strike up a conversation only to get monosyllabic responses when she wasn't disinterestedly scrolling her phone. When the waiter came around to take our order she listed off some of the most expensive items on the menu including a £200 bottle of champagne. My patience snapped. I felt that I had been completely played. The only reason why she had agreed to come out on a date with me was to snag an expensive meal. As such, I pretended to excuse myself so as to go to the bathroom. Instead, I headed for the door where I met the maître d who I know relatively well. After explaining the situation, I paid for my share of the meal and left without so much as sending my date a text to tell her I was leaving. About ten minutes later, she figured out what was happening and sent a stream of vulgar and abusive messages.

715,UPDATE,"Repost because of mod approval. 

So.. It's been +2 months and I figured some of you might want to see an update on the whole situation.



First of all, a big thank you to all those people that gave me advise and were the lovely judging people of Reddit. Without a doubt that AITA made a difference for me, so thank you.


Again I'm not English so hating on my grammar or vocabulary will be there for you grammar freaks! Just a heads up.




Long story short : we broke up, I moved out and am so happy now.



I know it's normal to read and it will always go this way but ignorant me always read these posts thinking nah that ain't gonna be me. Here we are single and all and never felt better.




Now the longer version :

After the skirt thing he made a few other comments and I had it. I broke up with him at the end of May With no idea what to do next (just emigrated to this country) while living together. 



We went to therapy where he got told in his face that he was an abusive and controlling a$$hole and if he truly didnt see any of that he can be diagnosed since they thought it might be autism or high functioning aspergers. 


It was bad. I cried a lot during therapy and tried to open up to her about the situations and not knowing to go on because he didnt mean it, right? When she was out of the room he called me a crybaby (again as a joke)




Later that night he also told me he knew about all of my Reddit posts and that he could see etc everything. So most likely also this one. (Yeey)



After the second sessions where they told me (2 individual therapists) he will not change and I do not want to sign up for a life like this with kids etc. They see it so much and if I had a way of preventing this future I should for my emotional wellbeing. 




I moved out 1.5 month ago on my own, made some new friends and started looking for new jobs. He tried to contact me several times and we did talk sometimes. It would always go that he told me he had changed and can see it now but my love was long gone. I told him I didn't love him anymore but he kept pushing until I blocked him. He told me he was having panick attacks, was suicidal and what not. He needed someone to talk to, but that someone wasn't me.



Just having normal people around me while I'm wearing my skirt and doing my things without negativity is just a big breath of fresh air. It's so relieving I can't tell you how much I feel like myself again and most of all,  not crazy!

I'm doing hobbies, sports, therapy and what not but I'm happy. 




On the few moments this month I did feel lonely did I sometimes text him back but ended that completely too and just re read all of my situation with him (32) within a year and a bit.



Apparently he also cheated on me with his ex telling her that he wanted to marry her instead of me, her ass was way better than mine (I had to work out more to earn a compliment according to him)




So that was that. No more Mr I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way.




Thanks for anyone reading this. If you are in a situation with a partner and you doubt yourself or question yourself all the time by things he says or does please listen to that gut feeling because you aren't wrong or a bad person for thinking it and it tells you more than enough.

In the end I was NTA. Thanks everyone for your input and opinions.

720,Not the A-hole,"So I'm just out of high school and I'm going to be moving to another city to study in about a month. My parents have offered to buy me a car for when I move out. For the time being, I live with them and use my dad's car to get around.

Now, I like to drive. I don't usually listen to music or anything, I just like having my head clear and focusing on one thing. There's a long strip of road right by my house, it's about 2 miles without any traffic lights or intersections, usually pretty empty. Sometimes when I don't feel like going home right that moment, I drive down that road to clear my head and make a u-turn at the next light.

So earlier today I decided to go for a drive down that road. When I stop at the red traffic light at the end, some genius slams into me from behind, and then I hit the truck right in front of me. Long story short, no one was injured, but the damage was pretty bad on both sides. Guy behind me was likely on his phone and didn't see me or the red light. 

I call my dad to let him know. After making sure I'm ok and helping me sort everything out with the cops and insurance, he start asking why I was even there in the first place (there's really nothing by that area). After giving my weird explanation, he starts giving me the classic ""a car is not a toy"" lecture, and saying I should only drive to places I need to go, etc. He also tells me that he's seen a lot of accidents on that road. And now's he reconsidering getting me a car for when I move out, saying I can just be safer and take the bus. He doesn't think I'm responsible enough to own a car. This is my first accident and I really don't think it's fair with it being 100% the other guy's fault. This could've happened anywhere, it just happened to be there.

So, AITA here?",30,27,0.8

722,Not the A-hole,"So, for background: I have a lovely family. Two amazing parents and a ""little"" brother I'm extremely proud of and close with. We still all hug loads and bro & me are late twenties. My mum, however, is terminally ill (cancer). She's in ""good health"" for now, but we're already past the estimations, so no telling how long that'll last.

My birthday is coming up and my parents have asked me what I want. I can pick whatever I want, although an experience type gift usually comes with more parental funding than an item. I've been thinking about it and there's not really anything material that I need. Last year, I asked for an experience type gift to share with my partner (of five years), which was amazing. My parents were on a trip that year, during my birthday, and I took my brother out for dinner. 

My heart tells me I want more time with my mum. Not doing anything specific, just... More time, I guess? There's still stuff I want to know about her, anecdotes that I've never heard before that crack me up, hugs that make me feel at home. So I kind of want to ask my parents for an experience type gift to do with my mum. 

I feel very conflicted about that though. I don't want to take away from my brother - his birthday is more than half a year from now, and it's entirely possible he won't get the chance to do something similar with her then. I also don't want to shut out my dad because he'll be funding this too, and I feel guilty for the part of me that's thinking ""he'll still be there when she's gone"", because I know it won't be THIS dad anymore, and he'll change once mum dies. My partner isn't an issue - I'm 100% sure he'll understand and he'll probably even want to chip in. 

WIBTA if I asked my parents (both) to gift me an experience alone with my mum? Also, is there any way to include my brother while still getting one-on-one time with my mum so I can feel less of an asshole?

Edit1: I was actually thinking about a short trip of two days. Nothing fancy, but definitely more time consuming than a high tea or whatever.

Edit2: the experience I have in mind is also inherently a two-person thing. There's no option to take a third person along, even for a few hours or part of a day. I might be able to figure out some middle ground there though, where I'd alter something to allow for a third person (bro) to join in for a bit.",30,34,0.85
723,Everyone Sucks,"So my husband and I just found out that we're pregnant. We're super excited since we'll be providing the first grandchild on both sides of our families. When we told my in-laws the good news they asked when we think the due date is (late March) my sister in-law immediately started talking about how she's not going to cancel her birthday trip for me (she goes to Disneyland/world every year plus multiple times throughout the year as well) My father in-law suggested that maybe they could come home a few days early so they could see their first grandchild as soon as possible. And she threw a fit stating that they can come home early but she isn't.

Since then I've been really short with her.  She's always super entitled and will throw a fit if something doesn't go her way, but I thought she'd at least want to see her first niece/nephew.

724,Asshole,"Throwaway because this involves my family. I have two beautiful biracial daughters, ages five and six. They have mostly inherited my wife's genes (super curly hair, darker skin) so it's not really obvious that they are biracial. It doesn't matter to me at all, though I'd like to not be the only one in my family to have to apply tons of sunscreen, haha. On Friday, my wife is going on a three-week business trip to Europe. Keep in mind that she's the one who always does our daughters' hair. Before she passed away, my mother-in-law would swing by to do their hair when my wife went away. Yesterday night my wife tried to teach me how to handle our daughters' curls. I was initially happy to learn, until I saw how tedious it was. So much hair conditioner was involved and my five year old kept screaming because I was hurting her scalp. My wife got frustrated with me and said I was causing damage to her hair. Seeing as how I was causing more harm than good, I told my wife that we should hire someone who is experienced in black hair to take care of it while she is away. My wife accused me of being lazy and said that I had to be involved with their whole existence. It might not be hard for her because she has black hair, but I have hair that I can wash with shampoo every day with no repercussions. I also got mad when she said that I wasn't involved with our daughters' ""whole existence"" because it felt like she was saying that I was leaving out the black part. I don't feel like my daughers' have a black part or a white part that's split half and half. They're just who they are and they're biracial. I told my wife in a kind of frustrated way that I am not doing my daughters' hair because I don't want to damage it and my five year old started crying. My wife ended up doing her hair all by herself. I'm feeling really guilty with myself because of my five year old's reaction but I have serious doubts about whether I can take care of my daughters' hair for three weeks. AITA?

UPDATE: Last night I went over all your comments with my wife. I apologized to her and said that I would do a better job with connecting to our daughters' black heritage, which includes learning about their hair. I also realized that her frustration with me was tied to her sadness over the recent death of her mother, who used to do her hair. We decided that I'll book an appointment at a hair salon and learn from professionals. The two of us also read about the importance of sun protection. Tomorrow I'll get some clear or sheer sunscreen for my family. For everybody who commented, thank you!",304,780,0.95
725,Not the A-hole,"(Apologies for any format issues, I do not use reddit.)

My husband and I are expecting a baby. I am currently 7 months pregnant with a boy, and we wanted to make sure until there was near zero chance of miscarriage to think of names. My husband and I started to discuss names the other day, and he is firm on his desire to name the child after his foster grandfather. My husband was abandoned as a baby, and his foster grandfather cared for him as his own, until he died when my husband was nineteen. He was the only family my husband had.

However, his foster grandfather shared the name of my incredibly abusive father. If I have this child, and name him after my father, I don't think I could love him. That is terrible to say, but I cannot imagine having a child with the same name as my father and me being able to say that name with love.

I put my foot down on the name, insisting that it would not happen (with explanation), and my husband was incredibly upset with me. I said I was open to my husband's grandfather's middle name, but my husband said that that was condescending and rude. Since the argument started, he has been talking to me as little as possible, only replying to my questions and usually only with one or two words.

I am upset at him now. From my perspective, it's a bit rude for him to expect me to set aside my own abuse for his sake. I guess from his perspective, I'm disrespecting his grandfather, but I tried to explain my perspective to him, and he seemed to brush away my reasoning.

Some of my friends also said that I was overreacting, so I wanted to make sure that I wasn't just confused by pregnancy hormones and that I wasn't being unreasonable.

TL;DR: Am I the asshole for refusing to name my son after my husband's grandfather, who shared my abusive fatjer's name?

(Edit) Thank you everyone. I'm glad that I don't seem to be the asshole. I'm going to offer my husband the nickname alternative and see if that goes better than the middle name one.

Also, I am currently looking for a therapist for the abuse... It's very callous for me to say that I can't love my child if he has my father's name, and unfortunately it's true. I know this makes me a terrible person, but I can't even imagine saying my father's name in casual conversation, much less as I'm tucking someone in.

Thank you everyone again for your advice :-)",110,240,0.95

727,Asshole,"My GF and I have been together for 7 years. She's great, we love each other and have a solid relationship. Her job requires a lot of travel. I've expressed that I don't like it but try my best to be OK with it and support her. 

This week has her \~70 miles from home for  a client dinner followed by a meeting the next morning at 10am. She says she would rather get a hotel and stay the night so she doesn't have to drive back and forth. I don't agree and feel she should be putting in more effort to be home because of how much she is already gone. If the roles were reversed I would be driving home for a ton of reasons (we have dogs, own and enjoy our home, I want sleep in my own bed with my gf).  When I said I would rather her sleep at home she became frustrated and said she wouldn't be home until after 11pm and will have to be up at 5am; total over exaggerations on time and we both know that. Her company will pay for everything: rental car plus gas, and a hotel so it's not about money. I see where she is coming from and want her to get enough sleep as we both work hard. However we regularly are up past 10pm and out of bed by 6am and I don't think her driving home would change that at all. In comparison my job is closer in distance but with traffic takes right about the same amount of time to commute that it would take her to drive home, and I do that everyday. 

I'm not the kind of person to set ultimatums or try and force someone to do something.  I would never make her ""choose"" between her job and me. She left today and will be back tomorrow. This isn't an issue that jeopardizes the relationship but I have been pretty withdrawn from our normal daily texting.

730,Not the A-hole,"So short story, at a restaurant today for lunch I got an entree and a glass of water (not fancy water mind you, just tap and it didn’t even have ice). My girlfriend got the same entree and a tea. When the cheque came we had been charged the same amount, $10 for the entree and $2 for a “beverage”. When I pointed this out to the waitress she said water was a beverage and I needed to pay for it. 

When it came time to tip time I did the math for what I would usually tip, $2.50 tip for my $10 entree and then subtracted the price of the $2 tap water. Basically I left a .50 cent tip. My girlfriend thinks it was an asshole move and I think I’m not paying $2 for lukewarm tap water. basically I brought my cheque total to the $12.50 it would have originally been without the water added.",465,1971,0.96
731,Not the A-hole,"So bare with me this all happened on a Facebook re-post so I didn't actually interact with the said individual.

The repost was stating how the girl felt embrassed and humiliated by a waiter because she refused to give the girl a straw despite having a condition that makes it very hard for her to put the glass to her lips without spilling it.

From reading the post it sounds like the restaurant is trying to eliminate straw(plastic) waste which is a normal practice happening around many restaurants today. Some places will only give straws out to the elderly or just flat out not provide straws to use anymore.

I suggest that the girl go buy a case of bendy straws from a dollar store or invest in a reusable straw so she won't run into a similar situation again, because the way people yelling about the environment it's going to happen again at a different restaurant.

732,Not the A-hole,"My daughter (22) got her boyfriend one of those picture quilts for their anniversary. I thought it was so beautiful and creative. I kept telling her how much I loved it. She asked if I wanted one for Mother’s Day and I said that’d be great. I even showed her the pictures I wanted used of our family. Scout’s Honor, that was the full extent of our conversation.

After Mother’s Day, she came to me and told me the price of the quilt. I was a bit confused. She told me I could pay her back, whenever. Then I was super confused. I assumed it was a gift. I told her that and she said, no, you kept saying how much you loved it so I offered to get you one made. I said, “Yeah but for Mother’s Day, I never assumed you wanted me to pay you for it.” She said that she would’ve just gotten it as surprise if she meant for it to be a gift.

I felt weird about it, but it was Mother's Day and I didn't want to fight. I couldn’t afford to pay her for all of it at the time, so I paid her for some of it then. She went on vacation for a bit, then I was away visiting family. When I got back, we went out to dinner and she paid with card for both of us. I was giving her the cash money for it and she brought up, “Oh you still owe me the other bit for the quilt.”

I finally told her how weird it was that she made me pay for my own Mother’s Day gift. She repeated what she meant, since she asked me if I wanted it and I said still, she never told me I had to pay for it. I gave her the rest of the money I owed her and she said it was awkward now. I said she was the one that started it.

733,Not the A-hole,"Info: I live in a neighborhod that has these walls around each property, it's more of an aesthetic thing than a security one. Most people lock their gate during the night regardless, me included. 

Today I woke up at 4am with the sound of someone banging at the gate of my property, I found it weird and waited for it to pass but the noise got louder so I went to check. It was my next door neighbor asking if I could jump over the wall of her property and unlock the gate for her because she forgot to take her keys with her. At this point I told her that I would help her but also, it was at this point that I might have been an asshole. She thanked me and proceeded to say that she was avoiding to call her mom that was inside the house because it would wake up her kids and she didn't want to deal with that. So I asked her if she had tried to contact her mother in any way before she came to ask me for help, she said no and said once again it would be too much trouble. I was 100% ready to help her before because in my mind I thought she was completely stranded outside but once she revealed this piece of information I told her to try her mom because there were cleary better options than making me climb over a wall so she could get in. This set her off and she said that I was being a bad neighbor and I had no regards for her well being, so I told her I would wait with her while she called her mother but she denied it and walked away. I still stayed at my gate and I watched her make the call and then her mother opened the gate for her.

734,Not the A-hole,"So there is some back story.

My roommates bought a pet chinchilla about half a year ago without telling any of us. They stuck her in our bathroom and pretty much only took her out whenever there were girls over. They clean her cage about once a month and this had two effects. First, the floor around our showers and bathroom have little shit pellets and chinchilla food all over. Secondly, she lives in a filthy cage which is sad to see. We live in an environment that is not healthy for the chinchilla (a fraternity annex) that is constantly blaring music and staying up late. Plus our house has no AC and it has been incredibly hot this summer.

Now the reason I want to give her up for adoption.

The roommates who bought the chinchilla both live out of state. Since the moment they bought her (December) I would remind them that they need to find somebody to take care of her for the summer (it wasn’t going to be me). As the summer got closer I kept giving them reminders to find somebody who would take care of the chinchilla. Finally summer emerged upon us and they both moved out of state leaving the chinchilla here knowingly that I was going to live here for the summer and basically forced me to take care of her. So, all summer long I have been asking them to take care of the chinchilla or sell it and they haven’t. I don’t want to see her live the life she does at our house for one more year because I know they won’t sell her. WIBTA if I gave her up to adoption even though it’s not my pet.",44,193,0.95

I have refused to stay over at my father's house overnight for the past year. My father takes me out for dinner once a week instead.

He has apologized many times but I am unable to forgive him. Especially since seeing his affair partner everytime I go to his house reminds me of how he put his needs over everyone else's.

During the divorce, my mom basically got less than she deserved because my father fought her on everything.

One thing he agreed to was to pay for 80% of my undergrad and 70% of any post-grad degrees.

The remaining amounts were to be fulfilled by my mother and I (using loans or scholarships).

I got accepted to a few schools. One gave me a full ride where all tuition gets paid. I got partial scholarships for the rest.

My father and his wife are now expecting a baby. When I told him of my school acceptances, he basically begged me to take the one that would get him off the hook for paying anything.

I was really pissed off. He never even considered which program was better, which had better work programs etc. He only cared about his money.

So out of spite, I picked the very expensive private school. I was actually leaning towards a state school but changed my mind because of his begging. With this school, I still wouldn't pay anything because of the partial scholarships.

My father had a complete breakdown since finding out that he's on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even his wife thought it would be smart to call and plead with me and saying they have take loans out. This has just further solidified my decision. I hate that woman.

My best friend and I (both 21F) are super close, and we tell each other pretty much anything. Her and her boyfriend have been together for over 2 years, and I’m pretty good friends with her boyfriend too. I spend a lot of time with them together, but I don’t hang out much with the boyfriend individually.

Her boyfriend has always been a big guy. He’s about 6’2” and when I first met him he seemed a little heavy-set, but he’s gained a lot of weight in the past year or so. At this point, it’s clear that he’s obese (around 280-300 lbs) and not just a little overweight. My best friend is a little overweight herself, but definitely not unhealthily so. However, my friend has always been in denial about her boyfriend’s weight, by always calling him “muscly” and “strong”, when it’s very obvious that he’s obese, and not buff at all (he only goes to the gym about once a month).  

I’d never make comments about someone’s weight because I think that’s really rude, but lately I’ve noticed some concerning symptoms. I’ve noticed that he’s developed dark patches on the back of his neck and on his knuckles, and he seems to always be both tired and hungry, which wasn’t the case a year ago. He also cut his hand about a month ago and it hasn’t really healed. He also goes to the bathroom every 5 seconds every time we go out. I’m studying pre-med in college, and I’m generally really interested in health, so I know that these are all symptoms of Type II Diabetes. I also know that this condition can have really bad complications if left untreated, so part of me wants to express my concerns to my best friend, but I don’t want to be out of line.

My ex husband (Bob) and I had two kids: the older one has been working for a few years now (a relatively well paying government job), while the younger one is still in college (he's on a merit scholarship, so he's almost completely independent financially, though they give him barely enough to survive). After we split up over a decade ago, we remained amicable and me being better off financially, I generously helped Bob with his living expenses since his work doesn't really pay much (we're talking almost six digits). It was never an issue for me since I care about him and I know he's a hard worker, he just needed that money more than I did.

Over the last few years, Bob has had quite serious health issues which have made it harder and harder for him to work, to the point where he had to apply for disability. I've helped him a lot, also with his medical expenses, but now I need to start planning for my retirement and I simply cannot continue providing for him forever. I did decide to give him a place to live for free (which I guess makes the title slightly inaccurate), but I've decided that whatever expenses remain should be covered by my older son. These expenses shouldn't exceed $200-300 a month, depending on how much Bob will get from the government. My son has the means to contribute that amount, though I understand that he will have to change some plans regarding his future.

So, WIBTA if I asked him to do that?

So, I’m white, and my boyfriend is half black despite appearing white. 

My boyfriend said first that he wanted to wait until our kid was nearing or at maturity to tell them about their ethnicity, to avoid them (for example) thinking they get an N-word pass just because they’re 1/4th black. But I’m not sure if that makes me an asshole (or even a racist??) for hiding that from him/her.

I’m just imagining future scenarios where he could possibly get into a lot of trouble for saying things when he looks white.

The hard part when I tell people how bad it is, most people thing I'm talking about their grandma. Well after working at this store for 1.5 years, I can tell you with certainty that your Nana might make the best cookies, but she would smother Sweet Brown Baby Jesus with a pillow if he tried to tell her she was using an expired coupon. 

So to get into it, I work at a sort of Whole Foods Lite that is sort of national chain. We are known for our ""wokeness"" and I generally like our corporate culture. My specific store is about a block away from a retirement home. I work five days a week typically from 4:30 to 1:30 with an hour lunch. The retirement home brings people over in shifts from 8:30-9:30. After being there for 1.5 years, I realized I can't take these fucking people. They are rude, pushy, aggressive and their physical limitations make them difficult to deal with. While this may sound dramatic, that hour would ruin my day. 

We get to pick our lunch hour based on seniority so even though it's inconvenient and I'm not even hungry, I've started taking my lunch hour while they show up. 

It took about a week before everyone figured out what I was doing and now everyone is pissed at me. Like enraged pissed. The general sentiment is that i'm abusing my position and I should spread it around because everyone else has as much of a hard time as I did. I didn't give that much though because sour grapes. 

But my manager just pulled me aside and in as many words said I was being an asshole because I'm leaving him to deal with this challenging time every day more or less by himself but I'm actually costing the company money because with my experience I can clear the line in about 60% of the time it takes the less senior employees. 
I'm like dude if you don't like it, assign lunch breaks. He said that would be going against company tradition. So with that, again I don't feel like i'm doing anything wrong.

I just want some unbiased opinions about the situation. 

Just for info I’m gay, 32M and have a boyfriend who’ve I’ve been with for 8 years. 

I started working at a new place 3 1/2 weeks ago. Everyone in the office gets along well enough, bit of office drama here and there but nothing out of the ordinary! Anyway I hadn’t really gotten to know anyone overly well because I’ve been shadowing one particular woman who was training me in for 2 weeks, so I’ve really only had a week to actually properly chat to people.

So I’m in the office last Friday and one of the guys comes up to me and asks me how I’m getting on, nice conversation and then he asks what I’m up to for the weekend. I said something along the lines of “going to spend the weekend with my boyfriend and his parents”. He stared at me for a minute and then says “Oh I didn’t realise you’re a fag”, and then walks off back to his desk. I was very taken aback and upset. I didn’t really know what to do, so I decided to speak to HR about it, and they immediately called him in, he admitted he said it and they suspended him prior to a meeting this Friday. 

I am now afraid that they will fire him, and I honestly don’t want that. I am thinking that I will just go to HR and explain that I may have overreacted and that I have no other issues with him. Now maybe they have already made a decision, but I’m hoping they will take my opinion on the situation into consideration! 

Look I know that it’s a horrid word, and god knows I have spent years hearing it and it never doesn’t hurt. It really upset me, because I was feeling good about a new place and now I can feel that old nervous tension returning that people are whispering about me. However, with that said, I honestly don’t think this guy put any thought into what he was saying. Maybe it’s naive but I genuinely believe that he is someone who could learn that this language isn’t appropriate. I just feel like I’m letting the side down by letting this kind of behaviour slide. But I don’t want a man to lose his job! I am seriously regretting going to HR! 

I spoke at length to my boyfriend and his parents about it over the weekend! My boyfriend and his mom said that I should maybe let it slide, it sucks but they agreed he may have just not been thinking. My boyfriends dad said that he thinks it’s completely unacceptable to speak like that to anyone, let alone a coworker! He said that’s it’s 2019 and people are fully aware that they cannot speak like that. So two very different opinions both of which I totally understand! 

Basically I want to know if I would be the asshole if I let homophobia slide? I think I’m gonna be an asshole either way!

UPDATE: Everyone, thank you so much for all the advice! After some serious consideration, reading everyone’s comments and talking it out at length with my boyfriend I have decided to leave it in the hands of HR! As everyone has so rightly pointed out they are the professionals and they know what they’re doing!

750,No A-holes here,"First time poster here, long time lurker, all that jazz. 

I have an older car that no longer meets my needs. It would take a fair bit of money and work to get it up and running again. I have the resources but I don’t want to put in the time or money, when I could just sell it to someone who could do the work themselves (or even junk it for a couple hundred bucks).

My stepmom told her friend that I’ve got a beat up old car for cheap. I’ve done some back and forth with this lady and she doesn’t have a big budget because she has cancer. She just needs something to get from point A to B. 

If I were to sell to Cancer Lady (sorry if that sounds rude), I would have to put in the work, the money, and then tow it 200 miles to where she lives. I’m only looking to get about $500-$800 out of it, but if I sell her the car I probably won’t make any money at all. 

I’m not entirely worried about the money. But I do work 50 hours a week and freelance on the side; towing it to her city alone would put me out ~$150 as well as taking up my only day off during the week. I know there’s plenty of people here in my town who would pay what I’m asking and do the work themselves. 
I can’t help but feel like maybe it’s not morally the best choice to have wasted this lady’s time to get a little more $$.

751,Everyone Sucks,"Using my throw away acct because this issue is not out in the open for everyone in the family involved.

A little bit of necessary backstory. I (29F) have been divorced since Feb of 2018. We had been together for 8 years. My divorce was the result of my ex-husband(34M) having a 6 months long, long distance affair with a girl(24F) he met online playing video games. We have two small children. The end of the relationship (after I found out about the affair and it continued because they are shits) leading up to the divorce and separation was messy and I suffered a lot. My ex-husband was a shit to me.

While I was married, we would often go to family gatherings on my husband’s side and he has several cousins around his age. The cousin he was the closest with(31M) was also married and his wife(34F) became close with me. She told me a lot of personal things, including that she had had occasionally cheated on her husband.  I kept those secrets to myself, not even telling my husband. The way I saw it, that knowledge was not my bomb to drop. I didn’t want to cause pain for anyone. If I had said something, I would have been scolded and ridiculed by the rest of my husband’s family for bringing an issue like that to light. I guess I just hoped that she would come to her senses one day and stop… or be caught. 

Rewind  to 3 weeks ago, I get a face time call from this friend/cousin and when I pick up she looks terrible. I ask if everything is ok and she says no, and that her husband has found out about all of her affairs, that she is a compulsive liar, that she’s lied to everyone about a lot of things for her whole life and that she’s probably even lied to me about things. Then she said that her husband asked if anyone knew about her cheating, and she told her husband that I knew. She was just calling me to let me know that he might be calling me and that whatever he asked; I could tell the truth about it. I expected he might call me within a couple days, but then kinda put it out of my mind.

Fast forward to yesterday when I get a text message from the guy that basically said that I’m a piece of shit for not telling him because I was supposed to be family (even though I was just as much family with her and she and I were closer than he and I ever were).  He said had I told him years ago that he could have left her when they only had one kid, and now they have 3, and that I could have saved them a lot of trouble had I been a stand up person and spoke about it. Then he said. “You deserve everything your ex-husband put you through.”

I always thought I had done the right thing by not putting my nose where it didn’t belong and instead just putting space between me and this friend/cousin while hoping she would somehow sort it all out. I always felt like it wasn’t my place to say something. Now I’m wondering if I did the right thing.  AITA?",47,31,0.88

My friend has a history of ending up with the worst people. One ex was highly manipulative and threatened to leak her nudes and personal info if she didn't send him more. Another ex was extremely obsessive over her potentially to the point of being a stalker, wrote creepy sexual fanfiction about friend and herself, and had a history of dating 12-16 year olds despite being in her mid 20s. Another ex constantly demanded money and nudes from her (which she provided) and otherwise ignored her. What's worse was that she didn't have the resolve to break up with any of them until something even more horrific happened (ex. Calling the police on an ex and said ex then running from the cops for upwards of a week while blaming friend for everything wrong), but she would forgive them half the time. Not once has she ever ended up with even a half decent person.

She met her latest boyfriend on Roblox. He is 16 while she will be turning 20 in about a month, which, while not illegal, is a bit iffy to me. I've never had a full conversation with him, but I have heard him make creepy sexual comments towards her multiple times. He's actively encouraged her to cut off contact with their other mutual friends (they had some sort of disagreement over whether or not to give someone a 2nd chance), which I personally believe isn't his place. He's really needy for her attention whenever I hang out with her, but she says she enjoys it when her boyfriends/girlfriends are jealous, so idk if this one is really a big issue. She insists that he's different from all her exes and would never do anything bad to her, but I've heard that line from her before.

To be clear, I haven't encouraged her to break up with him or anything of that nature, but I have told her to be careful with him and that she doesn't have to rush things with him. I just really don't want to get to know this new guy and I have told her such. She thinks that I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance. AITA?",29,35,0.97
754,Not the A-hole,"We visited our family lake house a couple of weeks ago with friends and discovered two kittens (each 8 weeks old) at our property. My kids played with the kittens, but we warned them that the kittens likely belong to someone, so don't get attached. Although the kittens had no tags, we weren't really looking to add a kitten to our house.

Fast forward 4 days, and we have talked to every neighbor we can find (as these are lake houses, many sit empty for weeks at a time between visits) and can't find an owner for the kittens. They are living outside, very hungry and very thirsty. So we've been feeding them and giving them water.

When it's time to leave, our next door neighbor tells us, ""If you don't take those kittens, they are going to the shelter."" His grandson is allergic, and he wants them gone. So we take the kittens (our family has one and our friends have the other).

Two weeks later, Tucker is part of our home. He sleeps with my 10-year-old son. He cuddles on the couch with my dog. We've taken him to the vet, got him shots and dewormed. We bought a litter box, food bowl, etc.

Last night, my mother-in-law calls from the lake. She was telling our other neighbor about how we found kittens a couple weeks ago. That neighbor claims that the kittens are hers, adopted 3 days before we arrived for her children. They want the kittens back. 

Their plan is to let the kittens live at the lake, under the porch, and they (the owners) will come by every couple of days to make sure the kittens have food and water. That plan appears suspect to us, as they did not visit the lake and their new kittens between Thursday at 7 pm and Sunday at 5 pm on the weekend we were down there. Keep in mind, we live in Texas and it is summer. The lake has snakes, hawks, foxes and coyotes (that we've seen over the years).

Before the crash, they had been dating for a bit over a year and engaged for just 1 month. He was just so in love with her. He once told me that she was his soulmate and the best thing that ever happened to him. I thought she felt the same, but Im not too sure anymore.

Yesterday, I was on Instagram and his fiancée posted a story with this other man, whom she called “her babe”. I was shocked and messaged her, asking if she was dating someone else. She said that she was. They have been going out for a few weeks and she just made it official.

I said it’s her life and she can do what she wants, but this really makes me wonder just how “in love” she was with my brother.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because ""what is something happens to her in the night?"" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?

I want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says ""I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish."" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell ""fuck you"" or ""I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel."" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.

I am 15F and I have a 25 year old half sister from my dad. She's graduating at the end of August and having a huge party. My whole family is planning to come to her graduation and the party which is hosted at my Aunt's house, my grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, cousins and even some other family friends that aren't related.

   
Before she went to college I saw my sister only a few times a year. She'd come for a week in the summer and a few days around spring break, thanksgiving and Christmas. It was always a huge deal when she came. I used to think of her as extended family because I only saw her once in a while like my aunts uncles and grandparents, but it seems my other family members are only around to see her. They are very supportive of her but they never come to my soccer games, or my recitals, but if my half sister has something they will all go. I'm talking about a crowd of 10 or more people for all of her events. They bring gifts and flowers and everyone takes tons of pictures. For me it's only my parents that show up. Even for birthdays the whole family comes out for her but for me it's only my parents and then I get something in the mail from the other family or just a message. 

  
I get that they don't see her often but they don't see me often either. It's like everything stops and we all have to worship her when she's around. My dad always gets super excited when she comes and expects us do whatever she wants the whole time she is there. I never see him act that way any other time.

My mom and I are a different race and I feel sometimes that is why they are like this.  We always got along ok, but she was never around enough to have any problems since she left for collage we've grown apart and don't talk very much. I don't enjoy spending time with her anymore because it always becomes a crazy family reunion and I feel left out. 

  
My Question: I asked my mom if we can go do something else that weekend after her graduation so I don't have to be at the party the whole time.  My mom is fine with it since she is not the one hosting the party, my Aunt planned the whole thing with my sister so we are just guests. My dad is mad about it and my parents have been fighting ever since I asked. My mom knows how I feel but my dad says I need to try harder to have a relationship with her. It's like my mom and me vs my dad right now and my dad says I am just being a moody teenager. It blew up my parents a lot more than I expected so I feel like I was TA. I feel like my dad's side of the family are clearly jerks but I don't know if I was really out of line.",31,33,0.9
771,Asshole,"A bit of backstory: I bought a gaming laptop (2.3k$) for myself around Christmas 2017 because I wanted to bring it to work from time to time when I had nothing to do and also bring it when I went to visit my family. I already owned a gaming PC at this point so I just kept using this when I was at my home. I visit my family four times a year and I started biking to work so I actually very very rarely bring it to work.

Anyways, my girlfriend really got into Overwatch and she started using  my laptop almost everyday. I'd say she used it for around 95% of the time this laptop has been used at all.

Now, the power supply needs replacement (after 1.5 years of course it's not under warranty lmao) and I asked her if she could gimme some money since she's the one who used it mostly. She told me that if I would've warned her she'd have to pay for maintenance, she just wouldn't have used it at all. She agreed to pay for 50% of the power supply but I think she should pay more because she's the one who's been using it all that time.

Edit: A power supply for that computer goes for around 150$CAD.

Edit2: Thanks to everyone for your answers. But here's something you need to think of too. I owned that other gaming PC for seven years and only threw in a new drive because I wanted a SSD, and upgraded my graphic card because I could. I never had to dish out any money to maintain it so I think it's unfair to tell me ""I should've given her ground rules for usage of my laptop"" like come on, this isn't Law & Order, it's a relationship with another person. I didn't think it would need reparations ever, she used it until it needed reparations. Now I'm an asshole for asking for her contribution? Like come on, I just didn't know.
If I never use my car and she'd use it 95% of the time, I would like her to pay for the upkeep as well, and I'd expect it to run fine when I want to use it.
How's this different?

TL;DR: AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay for repairs on my 2nd gaming PC that she's been using for 95% of its uptime?",199,132,0.86

My mom and dad are renting a house boat for a week and invited my sister, her husband, my girlfriend, and myself (25m). They are paying for literally everything and have made it clear my sister and I will have no expense. I come from a close knit, middle class family. We always lived well but not beyond our means, meaning we haven't taken trips like this often. I have declined the invitation for multiple reasons. The one I'm giving my family is I dont want to take the time off work and drive 7+ hours to the lake the boat is on. The real reason I declined is because however much I love my family, I don't want to be stuck on a boat with them for a week. I'm kind of the black sheep of the family, grew up religious and turned my back on it once I moved out. Different story for a different time. My family still loves me unconditionally but they are just taxing to be around for an extended period. My girlfriend will be out of town training for a new job the same week as the trip so she is out. 

They have tried offering various solutions to my reasons. They have offered transportation, to cover some of my lost wages (I work a job with no paid vacation), to invite a friend of mine when my gf backed out. I have turned them all down and my mom has stopped asking. Now my sister (21f) is calling and texting me about it. I love them but I really dont want to go.

I have a 4 year old daughter, a 12 year old terrier and a 2 year old terrier. They have two: one 7 and one 9.

I said if we were all in a burning house and only I could run in to save everyone, I'd pick things in this order:

* my child
* my wife
* my dogs
* their children
* them

Everyone, including my wife, looked at me odd and they got upset asking if I'd really save my dogs before them and their kids. I knew I was in a hole already so I tried to justify it by saying if left alone, their kids could probably find a way out whereas my dogs couldn't. They'd have more of a chance to escape on their own, so I should prioritize my dog. I doubled down by saying I don't really know them that well anyways, and I think any man would choose his family other another in this situation.

778,Everyone Sucks," So I was coming out of the grocery store today and I saw a woman being, what I would consider, a lazy shit head. I called her out for it. I felt justified. Then I reflected and became unsure as to whether I was justified, or just an asshole to a working mother on the grocery run after picking the kids up from school. You’re the experts, tell me my fate! 

&#x200B;

The parking garage by my local supermarket has a problem, and that problem is people being too lazy to walk to the shopping cart corral and put their trolley back – people instead prefer to just leave them right there, in the parking spots. Obviously, this is annoying and gets in the way of people trying to park their cars. 

I did a sidealong park into a spot today (relevant) and was annoyed to discover that I couldn’t park in the middle of the spot because there were abandoned trolleys encroaching onto the space. Luckily my car is small, so it wasn’t an issue. After doing my shopping I came back to the car to discover that someone had left their trolley in the space between the back of my car and the front of the car behind me. Not an issue for me, as I could go forwards out of the spot, but it would be an issue for the person behind me as they wouldn’t be able move around it. 

I loaded up my groceries into my car then grabbed that trolley and my own to walk back to the corral. A middle-aged woman with two teenage children (about 13 and 16 I’d guess) were opposite me and finished loading their groceries at the same time. The woman then walked her trolley across the parking lot to park her trolley *right in front of my car*. I was standing half a metre away and she just… dumped her trolley there, blocking my car into its space. I will add that given my outfit, there is no way she thought I was an employee even if she hadn’t seen me just put away my own groceries. 

&#x200B;

The following conversation ensued (M = me, H = her)

&#x200B;

M: “Yeah, just leave your shit wherever for someone else to clean up, that’s a good idea.”

H: “Excuse me? That is so rude.”

M: “I’d say being a trashbag and leaving your shit everywhere is ruder, are you seriously that lazy?”

H: “How dare you speak to me like that in front of my children!”

M: “Well someone’s got to teach them some fucking manners about putting their own shit away and not leaving it for someone else.”

Then she said how dare you and I said fuck you, and I pushed her trolley back to the corral (a whole 10m away) while she huffed to her children about how people my age are just SO TERRIBLE (I’m 25).

My mom's old friend reaches out to her and says that her neohew, who I'll call Billy, is new in town and wants to introduce him to people. My mom gives her friend my number and is really pushy towards me and insists that I text him.  So i text Billy, we don't get much beyond the basic 'what's up' texts, but we agree to meet for ice cream on a quasi-date and we each pay for ourselves. We talk for about an hour, but I really don't have an interest in seeing him again. I won't list all of my reasons, but the main reasons are that I don't find him attractive, interesting, and he's too ""country"" for me. Additionally, his career revolves around a sport that I can't stand. 

I normally keep details about my private life away from my parents, I don't even like them to know when I'm going on a date, but my mom asked how it went. I told her that I wasn't interested in him, but she told me to ""be nice to him"" because he's new in town. I asked her why my feelings don't count and she kept on saying to be nice to him and wouldn't answer my question or see my viewpoint. We got into a fight and it ruined my evening and the next day (today). I tried explaining this to my friend and she says to give him another chance too, when I know that she wouldn't do the same. 

WIBTA if I told him that I'm not interested in him that way? He also has his  birthday tomorrow so I don't want to be the one who hurts him on his birthday when he already seems a bit depressed.

782,Not enough info,"We used to have this tradition that most family's have in Sweden. In December we go somewhere to eat Julbord  (Christmas food buffet basically). I was 25(M) and she was 27(F). Dad was driving, me sitting next to him. Mom sitting in the middle next to my half sister. We pick up my big sister and I can see how she walks that I believe she has taken something. When she start talking it  made it clear to me she was on something.

To  make it clear, I have never taken drugs, just alcohol and I don't hang out with people that take drugs. I have told her never be around me if she decides to go back with that shit.

I  start typing on my phone saying that she is high and show it to my dad next to me. He does not agree. Big sister start to talk very loud and aggressive kind of way. So I decided to talk as little as possible to  make sure I don't add any wood into the fire when she is in this mood.

The  drive was over an hour and I was just trying to survive at that point without boiling over how she is acting atm to me, parents and our half  little sister. When we finally got to the parking spot I was thinking:  Phew made it and was looking forward to get some distance and reset my mood that was at the boiling point after listen to her being high almost next to my ear for over an hour.

When I am just about to step out of the car she decided to ask me why I was making puuufffzz kind of sounds during the trip. At that point I turn  around and look right into her eyes and said: BECAUSE YOU ARE HIGH! At  that moment she flips. We both get out of the car, she start to push me and put my back onto the car, she starts to kick me and scream but not  hitting any where serious. I wanted to hit back so baaaad but I knew there where no point. Parents did not know what to do. Little sister runs away for a while and crying.

We had to cancel the dinner that father had payed a lot for. We had to  leave her there. Because she was in effect and there is no way me and my  sister could handle another car ride. She ended up in a phone call with  my mom on the way back. Sister was sitting in a living room of some  random two old couple that was nice enough to let her in. Mom heard them  in the background trying to calm her down since she is screaming.

Now almost 4 years later I don't have any contact with her. Because it  feels like no matter how much I have tried to help her in the past it does not matter. My father said to me ""siblings should stay together  like him and his 5 siblings but I don't have a sister like you do  tho.."". So he understand why I decided to but does not like it ofc. Mom  says that big sister want contact with me. I understand that my parents  want us to get along. But they barely can handle her still. I also said I  don't want to hang around with some one that is always high even if  this from her medicine these days.

783,Asshole,"I (22M) noticed that I lie a lot about trivial things. I do it without thinking and without effort.

For example, when people ask me how many people I slept with, I lie and inflate my number (I say I've slept with 20 people. Real number is 8). When people ask me what grades I got, I always give a higher number. When people ask about my fitness, I lie - example, I went on a 3 mile run. When I came back and my dad asked me how it was, I said I ran 6 miles.

Or when people ask me about past relationships. I've never had a girlfriend, but I tell people I had 3 girlfriends, sometimes I say I've had four relationships, etc.

This weekend my parents planned for us to go visit him again, which normally I would be fine with, however I already made plans. My friends and I were going to have a big party sometime in August and it just so happens this weekend is the weekend one of my friends parents aren’t home. 

I told my parents in June that my friends and I were going to have a really fun sleepover sometime in August and that I’ll let them know when I know a specific date. Since I have strict parents I normally am very careful about how much alcohol I drink and weed I smoke at parties because I’m not allowed to sleepover, however they said I could sleepover at my friends house since I know him very well, so I’ve been looking forward to it all summer.

A few nights ago I learned that we were going to party this weekend. I was going to tell my mom that night but she said she didn’t wanna talk and to tell her the next night. That morning she then casually mentioned that we had planned to see my cousin this weekend. WIBTA if I go to the party instead of going to see him?

I was pretty angry she even tried to get out of the car, we had both just had a long day of work. And I was just trying to go home.

A bit of backstory. My now ex-fiancé and I were together for 5 years and engaged for 1. Near the end of our relationship, things had been rough with periods of arguments mostly stemming from one of her male coworkers. Since working together, I was overcome with jealousy and felt very strange about their relationship. Things that felt ""off"" about with this ""friendship"" included them hanging out late at night together, to them constantly texting each other while my ex and I were hanging out to eventually me glancing at her texting him saying things like ""I adore us."" This lead us to having many discussion about trust. She would constantly reassure me that they were just close friends and that I was crazy to think otherwise. I felt compelled to believe her through this.

The situation took place during my friend’s bachelor party where I was planning to be gone the entire weekend (Nothing crazy). I let her know ahead of time, which she made her own plans to party with her other female coworkers. I was initially okay with this, but something felt off. Throughout our relationship, she was very introverted, never partied and never hung out with these particular coworkers outside of her work before. It felt out of character. When she got home from work, her demeanor was very unusual as well and was overly excited. I made a judgement that she wasn't being truthful. As soon as she left, I decided to log into her Apple account and use the FindMyIphone feature. And sure enough, she wasn't going where she said claimed. Over the course of the night, she traveled the exact opposite direction out of town. During the bachelor party, I continued texting her trying not being direct with this situation, which she denied anything. The next morning, I confronted her that I knew where she actually was. She finally confessed that she was with her male coworker at a hotel two hours away. She was adamant that nothing happened between them claiming that they slept in separate beds and that she didn't want to tell me because she knew that I would be upset. She just wanted to get out of town and hang out. I said I felt suspicious of her behavior but didn't tell her that I used her account to find her location. Being blinded by ""love"", I forgave her. She eventually found out how I tracked her. When she was using my phone, my ex noticed the location where she stayed was on my most recent list in google maps, which an argument/fight/break-up ensued, and me questioning what I had done in this situation.

I also want to be clear about the fact that I have zero issues with nudity in general. What people want to wear or not wear in the comfort of their own home is solely up to them.

Look, I get it it. It’s summer. It’s ridiculously hot. AC is not common where we live, and fans do little to alleviate the problem. Especially at night, when the sun has been beaming and heating our apartment up to oven like temperatures all day. It makes relaxing and sleeping uncomfortable as hell. I get all of this, I really do and I’m sympathetic to the problem. The kicker is we live in a relatively small apartment with our 3 year old son (let’s call him Kyle). Kyle has his own bedroom to make room for his toys and what not, and we have the living room split with a divider to create a bedroom for us. This room doesn’t have a door since it’s not technically a bedroom, but we make it work since it’s quite a large room with enough space for both needs. 

Now for as long as I’ve know him, my boyfriend has always slept naked. I have too, sometimes I wear a T-shirt or something else to bed but most of the time I’ve slept in the nude as well. But lately I’ve started to think that since our son is getting older and more understanding of body parts and what should and shouldn’t be on display that we should act as role models here and start wearing clothes to bed. 

My main issue is that although it’s not often, every now and then Kyle will wake up in the middle of the night and come into our room and we’ll just put him in bed with us. And more often than not he wakes up earlier than us (or any alarm for that matter) and is the one that comes in and wakes us up in the morning.  

I’m starting to feel that sleeping naked is inappropriate at this point and we should start dressing for bed. I’m not saying it has to be a full button down pajamas, just boxers would be fine in my book but at least cover up the most private parts of the human body. Am I crazy for thinking this? I understand where my boyfriend is coming from, it’s hot and uncomfortable but just putting on a pair of boxers shouldn’t make that much of a difference and it’s just something he needs to get used to. His argument is that parents bedrooms are supposed to be respected and kids will learn that before walking in. But we don’t have a bedroom, it’s a shared living room/bedroom without an actual door and he’s 3 years old. Which in my book is too young to understand any of that reasoning. 

So tell me reddit, am I the asshole for telling my boyfriend it’s time to stop sleeping naked?",407,1651,0.95

Pretty much what the title says.

Also a quick note, this is not related to any specific political party, I just believe it is important to participate in politics.

The other night I got into a pretty big argument with my girlfriend about how dangerous it is to not care about the current state of affairs.  Both of us are americans living overseas and she thinks that this means the effects in our country don't impact her personally.  I told her that is true to an extent, but if she has the ability (and right) to choose a representative then it is an obligation to do so.  She responded along the lines of ""I didn't ask to be born American"" which just floored me.

I honestly feel like this kind of belief is dangerous in the grand scheme of democracy if even a portion of the population feels the same.  I understand why she would want to avoid the political news-cycle, but she constantly criticizes my attempts to stay informed (easier said than done overseas) yet she refuses to inform herself because its inconvenient and causes her stress.

To top matters off, in a comparison she made she ended up bringing my physical and mental health into the argument (she thinks I'm apathetic about my health, and tbh she's right to some degree).  It felt like an unfair comparison and a low blow, so I told her that is my business to resolve and she did not know what she was talking about.

I'm sorry if this feels more like a rant than a question, but I feel disgusted in myself for some of the things I said, but I completely stand behind  my point.  Maybe I could've phrased some arguments better, but I've had discussions before that have led nowhere.  At least this time I think I got through on some level, but AITA for this?

I've watched this poor little thing for 3 months. Every day I walk my dogs around my property, and lately this calf has been coming to the fence for attention. He's so sad and thin.

I will offer that he can be in our paddock (adjoining theirs) and I will bring a couple of my herd so he can have company. I'm hoping they will accept my offer.

Edit 2:  I spoke with the neighbors- they have agreed to buy the calf a friend!

We have newborn twins so it’s a little tight, but we only have a few weeks left on our lease so we are making it work. Right now I am sleeping on our sectional and my husband sleeps in our room since he works M-F, and I get to stay home. He works hard for our family, I think it’s important he gets decent sleep during the week so I get up with the twins at night during the week. 

His mom is visiting from out of state next month and asked if she could stay with us a couple nights to “help out”. She wants to sleep on our couch with me (it fits two people sleeping comfortably). When our twins were first born she did this and I was miserable because she snores SO LOUD. Not only was I waking up every 1-2 hours to feed our twins, but I’d lay there wide awake when they’d finally go back to sleep because of her snoring. It was awful! I told my husband I don’t want her to stay with us because of the snoring and I suggested that she stays at her brother’s or sister’s house (both live in the same city as us), or a 2nd option, get a hotel. 

Well my husband is offended I said no, and he thinks I’m being extremely rude so he is refusing to tell his mom that she can’t stay with us. He told me, “she wants to help us out and we tell her to get a hotel? Absolutely not.”

(they park them at the garden gate) I get the 10yr old doing it, he's 10. But the 18yr old knows better and has only just (last 2 weeks) got a new bike which is used to get to work.  Despite constant reminders, they still do this and usually my wife gets them in. So i've said to them, one day the bikes will be stolen.

And that really is my worry is one day someone will walk past our house in the early hours and say 'thank you very much' and they will wake up to no bikes anymore. So I purchased a bike lock and when i went to work at 5am, their bikes were there, outside the house. So I wheeled them away to a bike rack (right next to our house) and locked them up and took the key with me. I have left them a note so they know. It just means they won't get their bikes until 7pm and means older one will have to walk to/from work.

Where I live it’s a widely agreed upon convention that pedestrians keep right except to pass in the way that cars do. These kids were in my lane and they were old enough to know better. In the distance I heard a parent put out a half assed “watch where you’re going, Kaden.” 

Kaden didn’t watch where he was going. 

As anticipated it soon became clear he expected me to get out of his way for him. I saw this as a teaching opportunity and decided to not alter my walking path or cadence. Shortly after he ran face first into me. Now I’m not entirely heartless so I made sure he didn’t connect with my knee, but he did land square on his butt. Once on the ground he thought for a moment, rolled over, hopped up, and ran away. The absence of an apology was noted. 

I feel what I did was reasonable. I firmly believe that if I had moved out of his way I’d’ve reinforced his bad behavior. By assisting him to the ground I helped him learn an important lesson about keeping right and the consequences of being careless. Mombie clearly wasn’t impressed but didn’t say anything.

So my friends and I went to a party on Sunday. I see a friend I never saw in forever. I give him a hug while he’s sitting and he tells me to sit down. There’s no seats left but he pats his lap. We’re just friends, I’m grown, it’s whatever. It’s only weird if I make it weird. It’s only a big deal if I make it a big deal.

The very second I sit on his lap, he gets a boner. This is the first time I’ve ever been in a situation like this and I’m SO uncomfortable.

I’m super uncomfortable, mentally freaking out and trying to telling myself it’s not what I think it is. I can only lie to myself for so long. I didn't want to feel it for half a second more and had to get up. I just stood up and got off his lap. But I was not slick with it at all.

When I got up everyone can see his “situation”. It was literally the most awkward thing I’ve ever been through, and I can’t imagine how much worse it was for him. I just awkwardly walked away.

Apparently he’s been getting a lot of shit for it and his friends are clowning him. It was just SO awkward. It's a ""you had to be there"" type of awkward. So the people there ran to tell their friends and it got around the party real mf quick.

My guy friend says that the wind will give guys a boner and I should have known that a pretty girl sitting on his lap would do the same thing. I said that I literally don’t have a dick and can’t possible know what does and doesn't give guys boners. My friend said that everything does. Is the alternative me just sitting there? I didn’t want to be on his lap for even half a second more. He said I should have told him I was getting up and given him time to readjust, instead of just jumping up. 

Edit: A lot of people are saying it's not normal for him to invite me to sit on his lap. But idk girls sit on guys laps all the time. It's like a flirty thing. But no one sees it as any type of ""sexual act"". He's not a stranger to me either.",60,74,0.88

815,Asshole,"Our daughter is 14 years old and has changed significantly over the past few years. To give some backstory, when she was in elementary she was the kind child anyone could have known. She always thought to put people before her and overall had a calm temperament. Then she started puberty at around middle school. When she started puberty she turned into an angry, aggressive person. She'd always complain and get extremely angry. She even had issues with harming herself by pulling her hair and scratching her arm. She also began holding grudges from the past, and I do believe it would be caused by her abusive teachers in preschool and a bully she had never told me about until 4th grade (thus we could not have taken action). We did think she had a problem in the beginning, so we treated her with lots of love. During middle school, she had earned an invitation to join a counseling group for girls, and despite us pushing her to go she decided not to go. Over time our daughter grew more and more calm, stopped harming herself, and has become more like herself back when she was young. So I thought it would have been hormones during her puberty years, but this year she asked me to send her to therapy. Now I have thought about it, and I believed she wouldn't require therapy. It was probably the flaring hormones while she was developing, and she has become much more adjusted to become a normal girl. Therapy is extremely expensive around here as well, and we have never mistreated or abused her. And while she had never been mistreated or abused by us, my husband was physically abused by his older brother so I don't see why she needs therapy when her father has never received therapy and yet has turned out completely fine. So therapy would not only be a waste of money, but our daughter has just turned out fine and so would be deemed a waste of time. So would I be the asshole if I don't send my daughter to therapy?

Edit: heres a couple things to clarify

My girlfriend didnt order the pizza, her guest did and thats fine I respect that, but whenever my friends come for a dnd session she expects candies beers snacks etc, that THEY buy. Im upset not because of the pizza but because the sharing isnt reciprocated. 

Its also not the first time its happened, a couple weeks ago our roommate ordered a pizza while I was napping and left us 4 slices. She ate all 4 that time and today is the second time. 

We've also been very broke recently so a pizzas kind of a big treat for us, since we've been surviving on rice, ramen and pasta. 

I also did not make a fit or throw any shade. I kissed her goodbye when she went out to hangout with some friends and I'm not holding any kind of grudge right now. Like I said I just want a perception check since its hard to see everything just from mine I guess?

My mother and I were at my sister's high school volleyball game and one of her guy friends came up and said hi. I was shocked when my mom said something to the effect of ""Hey handsome"", but decided it wasn't a big deal. After all, when I call her she answers the phone ""Hey gorgeous"", so she probably didn't think anything was wrong with calling a young man handsome. They then, however, continued to flirt for a bit, including a wink as he left. My mom then told me that he had started texting her and she had been texting back. It was very flirty, just shy of sexting. Nothing explicit was said but it was implied. I immediately told her how gross that is and inappropriate. She replied with ""He started it."" Which I felt was juvenile at best. I then went on to tell her she is the adult and that means it is her responsibility to end it. We argued about it for a few days before I dropped it. My sister knew about it and also thought I was overreacting. This weekend it came up again because more of my sister's friends have been hitting on my mom. By now they are in their 20's so it doesn't bother me at all but my mom brought up how much I hate people hitting on her. I was dumbfounded because I am usually the one pushing her to date and even encouraging her to go for younger guys since they hit on her a lot. I asked her what she was talking about and this came up again. She still feels that since nothing happened it was okay to exchange her flirty texts with a 16 yr old. Am I the Asshole?",55,83,0.93

834,No A-holes here,"So I’m a pharmacy intern at a big retail chain pharmacy. Today I was working the register and a girl, 17 years old, came to pick up her inhaler. Her total came to 36.22 and she took out her money to pay. 

She counts her money in front of me and only has $35. She tries to hand this to me as to say thats all she has, and I tell her I need the other $1.22. She is visibly shocked that I need the remainder of the money, but I refused to give her the inhaler without it, as I feel it might be reason for me to lose my job. She asks around the few people on line to see if anyone has $2 for her, but no one does. I also had no cash on me, and neither did any of my coworkers at the time. 

At this point shes obviously upset and I feel really bad but I still refuse to give her the inhaler. Eventually she just gives up on asking and leaves.

I felt especially bad because it was a rescue albuterol inhaler and in a moment of need it could be the difference between life and death. I feel like I could be justified, though, because my company fires people for reasons dumber than this all the time. 

So reddit, AITA?

837,Not the A-hole,"My father passed away a year ago from a stroke and it has been the most devastating loss in my life. One of his greatest virtues was his generosity; He offered what he could in helping his friends and family at any time, including having them stay in his home. He comes from a large family so there was no shortage of brothers, sisters or extended family that would request a room or rooms (the house is a 5 bedroom, 2 bath) to stay in when they came to town. He lived in a small community an hour outside the city. It’s a lovely home, with many surrounding amenities and annual events minutes away so when ppl would come to town he was often asked by several to stay at his place; He always said yes. Often times they would “book” ahead of time to ensure someone else didn’t get the rooms first. All of this to say it was a common practice & became a hub for visiting family.  

When he passed, I as his sole heir (his only child) inherited his home. What I was going to do with the house was the hot topic then as it remains to be now. I couldn’t enter a room or be part of a conversation without someone asking what my plan was for the house. I was even sat down amongst aunts and uncles & had one of them express to me that they hope I continue my father’s welcoming & generous spirit, as so many of them have great memories of them with him in that home.  

In the last year I’ve had repeated requests to stay at the house, rent the house, or rent a room. Most recently I’ve had all three requests be asked of me in the last 2 weeks. My uncle was having a wedding in the community and messaged me the night before his wedding if some of his guests (more family) could stay in the house, I said no and received a prompt reply from him that we were “going to have a talk after the wedding.” (Which hasn’t happened -yet.) A week later another uncle asked if his daughter’s family could rent it until they found a new home, and just this morning I was asked by my cousin on behalf of her dad, quote: “I wanted to ask about your house. How’s that going for you? I was talking to my dad about his living situation and your house came up. He’s retiring at the end of the year.”  

Now I love my family, I love each and every one of them, they are good people, but I am not my father, and while I have a great deal of generosity it does not extend to my home. I do not want to be a landlord or run a bed and breakfast inn. I pay for the utilities, wifi, cable etc & stay there as I please. I’ve renovated the house and refurnished it with my belongings. It is my second home and I intend on moving there when the time fits me and my family. 

So AITA for saying no to my family & keeping the home all to myself in spite of my father’s reputation?

Edit for more info: The majority of requests are for staying at the house (for free) for a weekend or week while they are in town. There have been 5 requests to rent the house or room but upon request the “rent” they offered was for utilities. I wouldn’t making any money off them. I’ve said no to all requests as I feel if I said yes to one it would snowball.",233,1302,0.97

839,Not the A-hole,"The relationship with my mom has always been kinda rocky. My dad and and her divorced when I was born or thereabouts and she has always made it clear that she thinks it was my fault. 



 Last year, I got married and I wanted the fairytale wedding, big dress, fancy venue. My husband and I worked out asses off so that we could afford it without borrowing any money and I planned and designed everything, even my dress. The thing is a monstrosity that I can barely walk in but it's mine. All through the wedding planning my mother was obstructive and doing lots of second-hand bragging, culminating in making her own invitations and 8 or so people turning up that I didn't invite and didn't know were coming. I guess she thought I wouldn't notice? Except I opted for a small wedding of about 35 people.




Anyway, fast forward to to last weekend and she lets me know that her brother that I met once (at my wedding) is getting married next week and she told him I would pay towards it. 




I explained to her that no, I can't. I'm moving across country so I have left my job and also he's a stranger. My mum went off on a rant about how he was there for my wedding and would do anything for me. Today I was added to a group chat for this wedding (that I'm not invited to, but w/e) full of that side of the family asking for the measurements of my wedding dress and when I'd be sending it over. They feel it's the least I could do since I ""backed out"" on payment.




I've been stewing on it all day, but on the one hand, I'm not about to use it any time soon. I also feel bad for them because I get the idea my mum's been telling them I'd do it for awhile. So, AITA?


Edited to add: It might seem obvious that I shouldn't feel bad but I am from a culture of sacrifice for family, particularly elders. Also I am being told that now they can't afford cake or refreshments because I didn't go through with paying for it.

Edit 2:

Thanks all for the input, and many of you PM'd me both with support and advice for last minute budget ideas for my family. I took the route of least resistance, I agreed she could use my tiara and veil as ""something borrowed"", ignored the request for my dress and left the group chat. I messaged both my grandmother and my mother privately to say I was unable to loan them my dress and to pass on my congratulations to the couple. I muted notifications on my mum's chat because I know it's going to be bad, my grandma has left me on seen.

I wear mine everyday, even when I'm at work. (Mine has ""his crazy"" written on it lol) I work in fast food, and I work one on one with tons of customers a day. Since I've started working there, I've received many compliments on said necklace. However, you may know that a puzzle piece is a national symbol for Autism and the awareness for it. This has lead to many customers complimenting me on being ""brave"" for getting out and being more than my disability. It is really sweet of some of these people to say that, but it has lead to quite a few awkward conversations of me explaining that I am not in fact on the autism spectrum, but am just wearing a gift from my boyfriend.  Some of the customers understand and even tell me their own stories of being on the spectrum or about a loved ones experiences. However, and I'm really not sure why, but most customers seem to have a problem with it and give me disapproving looks, even after telling them it's a gift from my boyfriend. This one lady even quietly whispered to her daughter accusing me of trying to get sympathy and ""faking"" autism. She did not care for my explanation. 

The other day, not wanting to be bothered with explaining the necklace 3 times a day and being glared at, I hid it under my shirt. ( I refuse to take it off lol) One of my coworkers noticed and asked if everything was ok with my boyfriend. I told her yes, and showed her that it was under my shirt. When she asked why, I explained how I didn't want our customers assuming I was on the autistic spectrum. I also explained the incident with the one lady. My coworker called me an asshole and said that being mistaken for being autistic is not problem, and that I am being ""ableist"" by hiding the necklace.

He has also paid for my father's expensive medical treatments and is getting a lot better now. My family owes him a lot! 

I feel conflicted. If I told my family and aunt, their marriage would fall apart, and it would make me feel like an ungrateful asshole.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT : To anybody who says that he's bribing me to conceal his infidelity, which part of this post indicates that? It's not like he told me that he would save my future and my dad's life if I didn't tell my aunt about it. So which part is the bribing here? Smh.

843,Not the A-hole,"On mobile, sorry.

Issue is pretty simple: I (F24)have a family gathering on Saturday. It’s mostly people I don’t know very well and I haven’t seen in many years, but we used to go every year when I was a kid so I figured it would be fun to go as a grown-up.

Well I was talking to my mom about an hour ago and she told me to dress « appropriately » for the gathering. I asked what she meant, since my style is pretty average and our family isn’t conservative or whatever, and because I’ve never been known to wear « indecent » stuff. Like I know not to show my mid-riff at a family reunion.

Anyway, I had a hunch she was asking me implicitly to cover my body hair. You see, I am a woman but I also happen to not shave. Like yea I’m a feminist but it’s mostly that I don’t care, don’t see the point to shaving, and don’t wanna waste money on that. Everyone has hair, whatever, ya know?

So I asked her if she was actually asking me to cover my legs and armpits. She said yes, because she didn’t want me to « disrespect the older generation ». I asked what the hell she meant, how is my body disrespecting older people? I said that I’m not ashamed and people aren’t dumb enough as to comment, and if so, whatever? It’s not like I’m going to show my butt or anything. Plus, the forecast for saturday is 40degrees (celsius my friends) so I wouldn’t imagine wearing jeans or tights just to please my mom. Also there’s a lake on this property and everyone is encouraged to go swimming every year and I intend to do so, therefore showing my hair while in a one-piece swimsuit. 
 
She begged me to not be so stubborn, that not everyone shared my « opinions » and « leftist views » and that I should either shave or cover for the sake of the « older people ». I told her I wouldn’t do such thing. I intend on packing clothes according to the weather and activities planned for that day, i.e. shorts and a tank top. Sure, I could pack a maxi skirt, but I feel like that would be too pleasant to my body-shaming mom. Either way, some hair is bound to be shown, let’s be real.

Yesterday, his aunt who is in town, rang me up and asked if I could come and give her some 2 hour relaxation full body massage plus scrubbing at the hotel she was staying at because the long flight made her joints ache and she could not sleep.

After the massage though, I  expected her to pay me, and she said ""What? You won't charge family right? I am (husband's name)  aunt.""
I said politely that it is my job and I make money from it so family or not, she still has to pay for the whole treatment. She huffed but gave me the money anyway. I said thank you and left. For consideration, the rate I gave her was already 30% off my usual rate, because yeah she's family.

This morning though, my husband told me over breakfast that the aunt  had called MIL who then called him to complain about ""that stingy wife of his who charged family for a little massage.""
I was really upset. I told my husband if his aunt wants a free 2 hour long massage treatment she can ask her husband or one of her sons to do it for her. He said maybe I should have charged her half my usual rate. I said no and told him his aunt is entitled and I could not believe he sided with her on this. He did not say anything after that and just left without finishing his breakfast.

Thanks everyone for your supports. I live in a city where masseurs/masseuses are still looked upon with disregard and negativity, especially if done by a woman. And sorry I'm a woman so that makes me a masseuse, right? Lol. Sorry English is confusing sometimes.

It's good to see there are people out there who don't judge people based on what they do for a living.

And I have to say yes I was an asshole for not telling my husband's aunt up front that the treatment is not for free. But I got some considerations why I did not tell her.
First, she specifically told me that she wanted a 2-hour-long relaxation full body massage, not just little message here and there or some neck rubbing while we talk and socialize.

She said, and I quote ""Dear can you please come over to my hotel and give me some massage? My whole body is hurting. I would like a 2 hour massage on my back and legs. This hotel has no spa and the nearest one is like 200 metres from here. I can't walk there.""
She even asked what kind of oil or lotion I use, and I said I've got Olive and Lavender with me atm. She said she didn't like the smell of Olive, so Lavender.  
Because her request is specific, I assumed she knew it would be like having professional masseur/therapist over for a 2 hour treatment. I did not feel comfortable telling her that it would not be for free and that she would have to pay me. So I carelessly assumed she knew she would pay me for the treatment. And I think this is where I was wrong. I should have told her yes. 

I even brought my collection of lavender-scented candles with me to 'bring the spa experience' over to her hotel room. Hell I even put on some Enya on my phone to make her feel relaxed while I did my job lol. It's my personal style.",299,1584,0.97

OKAY. Here goes.

My parents are planning a vacation for my younger brother (20s). He is severely autistic and aggressive, heavily medicated but still unpredictable. We can't fly him anywhere because if he were to have a meltdown, it would be the sort of event that would reroute a plane mid-flight. 

Normally, my mother is the one who takes him on vacation along with my stepdad. They drive to a coast and hang out. I'm not invited, because it's not really a vacation, it's a follow-your-brother-around-while-he-dictates-what-happens trip. Oh, and I absolutely have to keep my communication/talking with them to a minimum if my brother is near, as he gets aggrivated when my parents arent focused on him 100%. 

However, this year, BOTH my mom/stepdad and my bio dad are joining forces to take him on a trip, and they have offered to for me to come with, essentially free of charge.

However, my bio parents hate each other. Viciously. My dad even had a physical altercation with my stepdad at one point. They do not like each other at all. They are going to swap days with my brother to give each other a break, supposedly. But I'm not convinced they're going to be able to work out an agreement between them.

Couple this with my brother's behavior, and my parents behavior, even if I spend time with the opposite parent while on this trip, I'm not sure it's going to be worth burning the vacation time. I really do want to see my extended family we might cross paths with, but the stress of everything else... I'm not sure its ""worth"" it. I will be going on a 10 day trip with my mom next year, and did have a trip with my dad this year, so it's not like we don't do things together. I'm just not sure I want to tiptoe around my brother for a week.

In addition, the man I am seeing is also planning a trip to the same area, but at a different time. He has invited me to tag along. I'm considering it, even if it will cost me money. 

I'm concerned that when I explain this to them, I'm going to be called selfish. I haven't had a chance to run this by my therapist yet, so I came here for advice. How do I navigate this? Help! AITA?

I was having a really rough week last week, so my wife graciously gave me a night to just sleep and not wake up with the twins. I went to bed around 9pm and woke up with the twins at 7am, while my wife woke up with them during the night.

On that Friday, we had discussed being intimate that night because my mom and sister  (who are currently temporarily staying with us) were going to be out late that night. However, being the tired mom that I am, I fell asleep on the couch after eating dinner. My wife said that she tried to wake me up (to have sex) multiple times but I wouldn’t budge, so she just stayed awake and watched TV. My mom and sister got home around midnight and we were still on the couch, me asleep and my wife watching TV. I followed through with my favor and woke up with the twins that night after we had gone to bed around midnight.

This caused my gf to audibly say ""what the fuck are you doing?"" It was then I apologized and explained I was just trying to shift the uncomfortableness of the situation off her mother. The rest of the night went ok, nobody really talked to me after that, and now my gf is really mad at me. So, AITA here or is she overreacting?

EDIT: I showed my gf the responses on this and apologized profusely. I also plan on calling her parents (at least her mom) and apologize and tell her I realize how out of line I was.

My boyfriend (19M) and I (20F) have been having some issues due to the fact that one of our mutual friends (19F) is very close to him, up to the point where they'll drink alone together in his room. I wasn't comfortable with this, and haven't been for the entirety of the time we've been dating (1 year) and have explicitly told both of them this separately, though both denied any wrongdoing and said they were just friends. I know they are just friends, but I know that he used to like her, and tells her private details about our relationship (that I don't want to do anal, that I don't like sending nudes, etc) and have only found out from him that he has told her that. She hasn't made it known that she knows these things. I'm annoyed that when we're together she can sit across from me, knowing intimate and personal things about me, and not say one word about it. She has also told my boyfriend very personal things about her relationship, like, very private details that no-one should know, and has asked him if he thought she was pretty, and if he thinks it's weird that he could potentially never sleep with anyone else. Bare in mind, they're both really wasted at this point. She also asked him his kissing technique, which he demonstrated on his hand (wow, I know).

I have since confronted my boyfriend about this, and told him in no uncertain terms, that if this whole thing continues I don't want to be around either of you anymore. He has finally realised just how much this has been affecting me the past year, and is not going to invite her to his house. I confronted her also, saying that if she had any respect for me she would have stopped talking to him about private things as soon as she found out we were going out, and would she like it if I went to her boyfriend's house and got drunk, and she essentially turned it around on me, saying that she had no idea it even bothered me, any of this, even though she has definitely known I've been really against this whole time, and we even met up for coffee to talk about it. I also confronted my boyfriend in December, and know he told her, so I don't believe the whole ignorance thing. She has essentially made herself out to be a victim. And I don't want to be around someone so self-involved. Should I be feeling like a villain for confronting my best friend?",36,35,0.9
862,Not the A-hole,"Edit 2: Thank you all so much for your kind words. This has helped solidify my resolve to help him come home if that's what he wants. I was just really starting to doubt myself after watching my mom have a bit of a breakdown. I feel a lot better about my decision. Y'all are the best. 

Alright, first I gotta apologize because I've never posted on Reddit and I'm on mobile so I dont know how this is going to work out. 

A little backstory. I (24f) and my family grew up Mormon. I left the church basically as soon as I turned 18. My family is super cool about it, sad and all but they still have me and my kids and husband over for dinners and hanging out and all that. They didnt disown me or cast me out or whatever

My younger brother (18m) drank in high school, vaped, smoked, all that jazz. Then he started dating a little mormon girl, and suddenly decided he wanted to go on a mission. Threw me off, but hey, his life and his decisions. He is out on his mission right now.

Recently, he has decided he wants to come home. Hes only been out for a month, and has decided it isnt for him. My parents are crying constantly and trying to convince him to stay out. He doesnt want to. I've told him I'll support him no matter what he chooses. 

He messaged me yesterday and asked me if I would be the one to pick him up from the airport and if he could move into my house for a while. I said absolutely, just tell me when. I told my parents about this, and they are very upset that I am enabling him to come home early, and that he doesnt know how hard it's going to be for him if he comes home. They think I should tell him no, that I wont help him avoid his responsibilities. I think they are overreacting. Sure I feel bad for them, and i know it's going to be hard on them, but I just dont see it the same. 

So WIBTA if I picked him up and let him stay at my house?


Edit: My parents would let him live with them if he came home. He just would prefer to stay with me until he sorts out what he is going to do.",45,53,0.92

I opened my mouth realized it wasn't appropriate and closed it. She asked what I was gonna say. I said it's nothing. She said no what is it. I said I was gonna tell a joke but realized it's not appropriate. She asked what it was I argued not to tell it while she pushed for a while.

868,Not the A-hole,"  

So I’ve debated posting this here because I feel 100% in the right however because of the amount of pushback I’ve received from friends and family I thought I’d get some outside perspective. 

So I(25M) grew up very close to my grandmother, she lived alone and looked after me and most of my cousins every day after school. She’s a super cool lady, would always come to school plays, events and was just generally there for me, she honestly felt like a third parent growing up. While she’s a progressive person however she made it known that she did not like the LGBT community, she’d always change the channel when the news/tv shows discussed it and constantly mention how it used to be a crime in her day. 

Well around 15/16 I started realizing I was gay, and for this (and other family reasons) I began acting out. I’d sneak into gay bars, drink and do pretty much what you’d expect. Well eventually I befriended an older guy (he was 20 at the time) and he pretty much saw what was going on when I met him. He’d let me crash on his couch whenever and was just a good dude who had similar experiences and wanted to help. I need to stress though that it was never a sexual relationship and we never did anything, and talked less when I went away for collage. Well fast forward a couple years I’m 20 now and he’s moved up to where I go to collage and we started hanging out again, things started to become more romantic and long story short we got engaged a couple years later. 

Now my grandmother new I was gay and didn’t like it, she mostly just held her tongue for the sake of our relationship. However one of my cousins recently mentioned how me and the guy met when I was a teenager and he was over 18. She calls the cops and drama ensues. Again nothing illegal happened and we only started sleeping together after i turned 18. 

Our lives got thrown off the track quickly and while we’ve mostly recovered now (he was able to get his job back after his boss fired him) I’m still angry. So I uninvited her to the wedding and most of my family understood where I was coming from and protested but agreed, however I recently said I was going to cut her out of my life all together. Now my family agree that what she did was wrong however they still think that I’m being too extreme and as she’s already quite old I should just get over it and spend the last few years with her pretending it didn’t happen. Recently she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and most of my family told me that I’d be an asshole for cutting out an old lady for something she doesn’t even remember doing. 

So WIBTA for cutting my grandmother out of my life?",34,45,0.88
869,Not the A-hole,"I have a good friend from high school that I hang out with frequently. Lets call him Jason. 

Recently a mutual friend of ours (let's call him Marcus) came out of the closet. Jason responded with kindness, despite us knowing that he is homophobic and a devout christian. He told Marcus that he was sorry if he had ever offended him in the past, and that he is okay with Marcus being gay. 

A week later the three of us met up for our usual round of Sunday night drinks. Jason said that he had been struggling all week to reconcile the conflict between his religion and supporting homosexuality. He concluded that it was still a sin, and he could not support the ""lifestyle"". Jason then stated that he did not want to compromise his faith, but reiterated that he still loved Marcus as a friend. He also clarified that he still accepts Marcus, but does not agree with him being gay. 

Jason and I have always had a close friendship, he provided some vital support for me in high school. I wouldn't say we are bosom friends due to some disagreements on several issues (gay rights, for one). It has always been a topic on which we were able to agree to disagree. But recent developments have made this disagreement so raw and unfiltered that I can no longer ignore it. When he expressed his homophobic views, I was thoroughly repulsed and furious on behalf of Marcus. I don't think their friendship will recover from this either. 

But here's my dilemma: it is easy to label someone a homophobe, but there are definitely varying degrees of homophobia. Although Jason makes it clear he does not accept homosexuality, he also doesn't attempt to preach, and doesn't say things like ""gays are going to hell"". And he continues to emphasize that his love and friendship has not diminished. I can also see the inner conflict and struggle he is facing.

I know he is a compassionate person. I have experienced his kindness firsthand, but I cannot condone homophobia. WIBTA if I cut him off for his homophobia?",289,103,0.81
870,Everyone Sucks,"This weekend I went on a big camping trip with my friends, my boyfriend and some of his friends (who at this point I know really well and I consider friends too).  I bought a bunch of food and drinks and paid for all the camp sites.

It was kind of a hectic and stressful weekend and I had to actually kick someone out for fighting and keeping us up all night. I hadn't really slept.  Eventually we were all sitting around the fire and I didn't have any more beers left and I really wanted a beer. By this point though all of my closer friends had gone to bed and it was just me and my BF and his dude friends. The only person with beers left was one of my boyfriend's friends who I have always gotten along with and I even drove down there. I asked him for a beer and he said no because he only had a few left.

I wasn't super drunk or anything, it's not like I had drank all the drinks I brought, I had been sharing everything with everyone.  All I wanted was one last beer on my birthday camping trip and he said no.  I then proceeded to get kind of mad and I kept asking him. I know it was immature but I couldn't believe he was serious. I told him it was my birthday and that I would buy him more beer when we left the next day etc. etc. Probably being sleep deprived and stressed out fueled my anger. I did remain calm and didn't yell at him or call him an asshole. Again I was not belligerent or wasted, I just wanted a beer after a long day.

My boyfriend then told me I was being annoying and to stop pestering him and that I was being a fiend and all this stuff and I was upset at him because it was my birthday and I had literally shared everything with his friend and everyone else and now he wouldn't give me a single beer. We got into a huge fight over it and kind of agreed to disagree. It's been two days and he's kind of brought that he still thinks I was being a brat, which still makes me mad.

I told my other friends about this and they think that he should have just given me a beer, since a. it was my birthday and b. he had drank a bunch of my beers and eaten my food and he still had a couple left. My BF's friends think I was being really annoying and entitled and that I couldn't use my birthday as an excuse to get a beer.

Was I being the asshole for asking him for a beer?

Edit: the next day I did go up to him and apologize for pestering him and he said ""I wasn't that bad"" and did not apologize but we are ""okay"" now. I'm just kind of annoyed that by BF still thinks I was a brat and didn't stand up for me mostly.

Edit 2: I should have mentioned this before but earlier in the day I had asked my BF to ask 2 of his other friends to leave. They were a couple and they ended up fighting super loudly all night long keeping everyone up and upsetting my friends.  He said he would but kept putting it off and riding his dirtbike or whatever and I finally got fed up and just asked them myself (they were cool about it and totally understood). So part of the reason I was so mad at him was because he first did not do what I had asked him and then he didn't stand up to me to his friend and instead called me a brat.",74,34,0.9

When they were growing up, they both asked for lots of different things. I’m by no means a rich person, I’m just managing resources as best I can. I had to say no to them a lot but would try to get them things for their birthdays. My son asked me for a PS vita when it came out and I struggled to get it for him. My daughter did the same and I struggled to get one for her. He used his for almost five years while she dumped hers after two months.

My daughter told me she wanted a bike for her 13th birthday because her female friends were in a bike phase and I got it for her. When they got out of the phase so did my daughter and she dumped the bike too. This hurt me because it wasn’t easy to get her these things.

So I got my son a console for his 15th birthday, but I told him it was really for the house so his sister could get to play it too. In the four years he’s had it, she’s played about 5 times and I’m not exaggerating. He took the console with him to college.

872,Asshole,"I (F18) work at a food place that’s placed inside a YMCA. Its in the middle of a long hallway that leads to four hockey arenas and is secluded from the more popular areas of the Y such as the gym. it’s summer, no people except the staff of the Y that  aren’t near where my work is. Days are slow therefore I’m booked to work alone. Last saturday I had a shift, and no one was there except the casual gym nuts that ordering from my store. One man, mid 30s was one of my customers that day. I didn’t make much of it at first, he ordered some food from me and then that was that, a normal customer transaction. However, i noticed how he walked  back and forth every few minutes in the hallway between my store and the  arenas that lead to the gym. I really didn’t care at this point, and went onto minding my business. He continues to do so for three hours of my shift and I start freaking out, but i end up not doing anything except panic silently until the next person takes my shift.

Monday rolls by and I had a closing shift alone. 3 hours left of my shift the same guy comes back. He bought more food and this time i asked if he worked in the facility, and replied “no, i’m just visiting.” I felt uneasy about the whole interaction given what happened, but he left with his food right away and i took a breath of relief. However, 30 minutes later I see him once more pace the same path he took saturday, this time looking at his phone then into the store and everytime  He does this for another 2 hours and I continue to do my usual work routine, but now with shaky hands, avoiding  eye contact with this creep. I don’t deal really well with confrontations due to my anxiety so i quietly suffered in my nervous sweat alone. Thankfully my parents came to visit knowing I had a night shift. told them what was going on and was going on and was comforted. Since I had to start closing my mom went to go get the security for me to talk to, and dad stood guard while i cleaned the store. the staff gave me phone numbers and said they’d escort me if ever I felt unsafe. They also said that they’ve checked the cameras and even got the guy’s face and the next time he does this will be kicked out, doesn’t matter if its me who saw. The staff and I never confronted the guy but he continued to pace back and forth while i was talking to the staff and he ended up leaving since the place was closing for the night. 

Once home, my dad told me that everytime the guy passed by he would give him the dirty look while we were talking to the YMCA staff. The man then told my dad that he was just playing Pokemon Go and even showed him his phone. I now feel like an asshole if this were to be true, but doesn’t stop the fact that if he really was just playing a game, the next time he’s going to do it he’ll face be kicked out of the YMCA.

Until this summer when my mother made my sister stay at my dads for (reasons).

My mom actually offered to do the dishes on my sisters days which surprised me because she’s never really helped out with the chores much.

First week of summer comes along and I do my dishes like usual. When it came to my moms turn she didn’t do them right away. She waited 2 maybe 3 weeks before doing them. It got so bad that I’d have to wash myself a dish to eat off of for every meal. Eventually she did do them. Half of them.

She loaded them into the dishwasher (the same dishwasher she has claimed “doesn’t clean the dishes enough”. We’ve always hand washed them) and most came out pretty clean. But she only did half and the rule usually is that if you don’t finish the dishes you have to finish them before the next person does them.

She said that she’d finish the dishes the next day. I believed her because she had actually done half of them this time.

She didn’t do them.

Now she’s waited about 4 weeks to do them. But this time she’s claiming that the dishes aren’t rinsed enough and she’s not doing them so it’s my turn.

(A little backstory here is that for a VERY long time me and my sister have constantly complained about her not rinsing her dishes AT ALL. She either ignores us or says that she made the food so she shouldn’t have to. She rarely cooks.)

Admittedly yes there are about 6 dishes that aren’t rinsed nearly enough and that’s likely my fault. Also there are quite a few peanut butter knives that are poorly rinsed. But there’s also a large amount of perfectly rinsed dishes in there.

I am pretty sensitive about this stuff, so I immediately eyeballed him to tell him to cut the shit. He looked at me and still went ahead to make fun of my ex and I. I felt really hurt by this and he continued to tell an embarrassing story about my past relationship that I told him in secrecy as I wasn't proud of it. This whole time his girlfriend joined in on making fun of me. I was pissed, and right after that he told her something else unrelated to what he was just talking about, and something I don't want to say here either as it hurts bad. This went on for 20 fucking minutes, just non stop talking shit about me. Then his girlfriend, made an off hand comment about him definitely being cuter than me and how I was ""ugly"". My friend laughed at this and I finally had enough, and admittedly freaked out.

I looked at him and said, ""you know you're a giant cunt for throwing me under the bus just to boost your ego for some girl you've known for two weeks. I wanted to be supportive but the moment a fucking girl talks to you drop me like a bag of shit."" Then his girlfriend makes another comment saying that I was ""salty and didn't have my girlfriend to protect me"". I turned to her and told that ""unlike my friend my taste in women isn't as weak as your chin, to be quite honest I don't care what some bimbo has to say about me and especially about my loving girlfriend, so I don't need to fucking validate myself."" She started crying and my friend ran after her. I left his house and went back home, kinda feeling bad on the way back.

He called me demanding I apologize, I said that while I regretted not being the bigger person and having to stoop to their level, I will not apologize. They were creating high school drama that I don't want to be apart of, and if she couldn't handle it herself she shouldn't have dished it out. My girlfriend says I'm in the right, and she said I should've had more respect for myself and not just sit there for that long and take it. This is my best friend and he's totally acting different, I don't know if he's just infatuated and not thinking straight, but even then that's no excuse for his behavior. I refuse to talk to him till he gets his shit together or apologizes, AITA or am I over reacting?

EDIT: I apologized to him and he didn't return it :/",114,600,0.96

We decide to buy a clean t-shirt to wear and as a joke we decide that we will each buy the ugliest and most embarrassing t-shirts for the others. We have good fun going around showing t-shirts to each other with the most ugly designs possible.

Aftee about 30 minutes we have found our clothes and are ready to reveal (i chose a short with cheetah print because i know my friend absolutely hates animal print), and the t-shirt chosen for me is a gay pride t-shirt (it is not even that ugly it is just a full tshirt in the rainbow colours). I tell my friend that i refuse to wear a symbol like that, that means a lot to other people as a part of a joke.

885,Asshole,"My ex-wife and I have a 13 year old son, we got divorced when he was 3 years old after we figured out it wasn't going to work out. Our son lives with her since I work travelling around but I always pick him up when I'm around. As she requested our contact is very minimal and we only talk to each other when something relating to our son comes up. She met someone else about 5 years ago, I know him, he's a nice dude and my son likes him. They're engaged and they're going to marry this fall. 

A month ago or so, our son came up to me because his mother and her fiancé were getting ready to make the invites and they had let him invite people to the wedding to and he wanted my information to put it on his list. This rubbed me the wrong way but I gave the info anyway because she probably already had me on the list and hadn't warned him. Come this week I received the invite and when I open up it says that I'm invited ""as a guest of: son's name"". 

I took offense of this because it seems like I'm not wanted there by her and her fiancé, so much that they didn't even consider inviting me themselves and had my son do it instead. I called my ex-wife to say as much and she said that if it were up to her, she had no reason to invite me but since we had a son and he wanted it, she did it. I told her that what she had said only confirmed my initial theory and that I would not feel comfortable going because they didn't want me there. She responded by saying that I should do whatever I wanted but when it came time to explain why I didn't go to our son, I would be the one doing it.",103,198,0.87
886,Everyone Sucks,"My SO (28 F) and I (28 M) have been in a long distance relationship for one year, after spending two years dating while living in the same city. 


She moved to Los Angeles for work, and has two years remaining before she is able to move back to where we are from (Philadelphia).


Now every time I visit (usually for 3 - 4 nights), we invite over my cousin (who happens to live in LA) for dinner one night. She is similar in age to us, in a similar profession, and we all get along very well. It is usually just us 3 for dinner at my SO's place when we invite her, and we have a fun time together eating, conversing, playing games, etc.


I'm going to visit again in 2 months, and this time, on the same night that we have dinner with my cousin, my SO wants to invite one of her friends from childhood (and her friend's SO) who recently moved to LA. Please note that my SO hasn't seen her friend in 15 years, and maybe exchanges text messages once every year. However, her friend moved to LA, so my SO thinks its a good idea to invite her and her SO over.


I told my SO that I would prefer getting dinner with her friend and SO separately, at my SO's place, or at some restaurant. I don't get to see my cousin very often, and after my SO moves back to Philadelphia when her work obligations are completed, my cousin and I will meet even less frequently. Adding people that none of us really know well I think may make the night less fun in my opinion, and more ""formal,"" rather than ""loose."" 


My SO was upset with that idea, and said that inviting people over multiple nights will be a lot of work, and told me that I am being ""weird"" and ""antisocial."" I said that I would be happy to prepare the food if we do it at her place (I generally do anyway when we call people over), and we all help with cleanup, which takes no time at all. If we went to a restaurant instead, I would be happy to pay for our meals. 


She tells me that it is not about that, and states that ""we never hang out with my friends and do what I want."" I pointed out to her that the past two times I visited, we have met her friends for dinner in LA (though we have separately also invited my cousin over for dinner those times as well), and that I plan on continuing to do so.


She didn't like that answer, and basically told me that if we are going to invite my cousin over, then she is inviting her friend and her friend's SO over, because its ""her place, so she gets to make the final call."" If I didn't agree to that plan, then she said I am free to go hang out with my cousin alone at my cousin's place. I think she is being unreasonable and childish here, but I may be wrong as well. 


So Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I think people have mistakenly assumed that every time I visit her in LA, that we do things the way I want to do them all of the time. The reality of the situation is that she makes plans for us to do, and I go along with them, because she has told me that she doesn't like doing things alone. So when I go there, we more or less do what she wants. The only standing plan that I like to make is to have dinner with her and my cousin one night. The other nights, afternoons, etc., we do what she wants.",63,70,0.96

She’s a sweetheart, and right now her father and I have been taking her on daytrips because she won’t be an only child soon as I am pregnant. Here’s the problem: I don’t like her that much. I can’t shake this dislike that I know is linked because she’s not my daughter (long story, I married my high school crush but he had a previous marriage, had said stepdaughter, etc) and I feel awful for it. No amount of therapy has helped and I’d never tell him I don’t like his daughter because that’s absurd.

I had made a post about this previously but I wasn’t pregnant then, now I’ve begun to overthink it. Kids can tell when you hate them and I’m worried she can tell that I don’t really love her and I’m afraid I never will. I feel like an asshole for it even though I can’t change these feelings.

888,Not the A-hole,"This story happened in June this year. 

My sister, two of our neighbors and myself  are playing outside with our scooters or bicycles, nothing out of the ordinary. 

At some point my sisters gets bored and sits down at the sidewalk and does something on her smartphone, writes with her friends etc. 

Then we (neighbors and myself) realize, that my sister is filming us. We stop and ask her to delete the films. Not because they in it self were embarrassing or harmful to us, but because we (and especially I) didn’t like to be filmed without our knowledge. 

My sister knows that I dislike being photographed or filmed and even more, if I don’t give my ok. She has done this in the past (to annoy me I guess) but has always agreed to delete the pictures. In those conversations I have threatened to ban her Instagram account, which is really simple, since she is 12 and Instagrams minimal age is 13. 

The above mentioned film however was sent to a friend of her and she refuse to delete it and went home. At that point it really wasn’t about the film, but about the whole issue itself. 

So our neighbors and I decided to each report her for not being 13. 

The next day I got a message from Instagram saying that the reported account has been banned. My sister was really angry with me, but within a day she made a new account, so no real long term consequences.

889,Not the A-hole,"I am fully prepared that I’ll be called the asshole on this, but just for my own peace of mind I want to write my story up and hopefully make some sense of this. 

I met my husband 13 years ago. We were married after two years of being together. When I first met him, he told me that he had a 2 year old daughter that he had no interest in being a father to, and that she wasn’t a planned baby. 

I accepted this, and accepted that he just paid child support and that was it. His child lives with her mom in Pasadena, and we live in Vermont- so as you can imagine, worlds away. 

My husband never once expressed an interest in going to see his child, maintaining contact, they NEVER spoke or exchanged birthday cards, Christmas cards, etc. My husband said that he never had any intention to be a dad, and that this child was born despite his pleas for abortion. 

I accepted this because I myself am childfree- my childhood was spent slaving away looking after my mother’s 5 other children, and while she was constantly on drugs it fell on me to be mom. I am NOT okay with children, having children, or wanting to foster maternal bonds with children. 

When I entered into this relationship, it was 100% done under the trust that my husband had no contact with this child or wanted to be a father.

Last year, his daughter made a Facebook account and reached out to him. She spilled her heart out, said she had sleuthed her way into finding her father, she wanted a relationship desperately, etc. 

My husband came to me in turmoil and in tears asked for permission to go and see her. I was angry, my world had turned upside down, my own place in his world had now changed, everything was different- but I swallowed my hurt and NEVER ONCE did I let him feel my own fear. I told him to go and make his peace. 

Since then he has regularly flown to see her. He has had an apparent complete change of heart and has taken on the role of daddy with enthusiasm and gusto, to the delight of both his daughter and her mother. 

A few weeks ago, he sat down and had a serious talk with me- he said he knew my stance on children, but he begged me to integrate this child into my life, to let her come and stay with us from time to time, to open my heart to her. I told him I couldn’t do that. I said I would rather divorce then be a stepparent to a child I never knew would be in my life. 

To be clear- i honestly 100% know for certain that they had never communication since before last year. Had I known, I would have left as it’s unfair to this child, she only has 1 father whereas I can go and find another partner. I feel horrible. I feel like a terrible person, like I’m an evil witch, but I also feel like this is horribly unfair to *me* - any insights on if my behavior is asshole-like would be very much appreciated.

EDIT: my husband asked me to take on being a ‘mom’ with him. He used those words. He hasn’t just asked me to open up our home a few times a year.

EDIT part II: someone asked me to ‘paint a better picture’

1.	⁠he speaks of her enthusiastically, which I’m happy about. He becomes sullen and withdrawn when I don’t join in the topic with equal enthusiasm.
2.	he has started a college fund from our shared savings. We have a LOT in there, and I added to it thinking we could share an early retirement. That’s gone out the window.
3.	⁠he has taken over the second bedroom that used to be mine, and has decorated it so she has a space to stay. That’s very well and good, except he has the basement which he recently spent 90k concerting into an at home gym. My second bedroom was my walk in closet/ shoe store, and now it’s all packed away in suitcases while we figure out where it goes.
4.	⁠he wants me to actively take an interest in her life, beginning with the visits and building up so that we function as a family. There’s nothing wrong in that, except I never consented to being part of this type of family and he knew that.
5.	⁠all of our vacation days have been wasted since he booked them more than a year ago and now he has used every single. one to visit her.

She got defensive and told me our parents ""were great parents."" Something that is nowhere near true.

They had my marriage arranged when I was 6. When I turned 18 I was supposed to marry this man and not go to college. All because his parents ""donated"" a lot to our church.

They locked me in a room with no food for a day because I was reading Harry Potter.

She's done it in the past thinking that it would just be a nice thing to do but we're starting to get annoyed with people asking for her to house sit. Our interpretation is that they're assuming she has nothing else going on so why not watch their place.

So i had to go to London for work and planned to extended my stay there so that I could fly to Switzerland to see her for a weekend.

However, oddly that same weekend she had a trip planned with her mom and two kids to the Canary Islands.

However, she begged me to come with them there, so I thought cool why not. U haven't seen her kids in 3 or 4 years and this really is my best friend in the world so I jumped at the opportunity. So I went (got back late last night).

Her mom though, has never really liked me. Long story short, because I'm a party girl who loves to go out dress up and post my party pics online, she's used that to judge me and cast me as irresponsible. It also doesn't help that when my friend was going through a divorce years ago, I fully encouraged her to leave her nice rich but emotionally abusive husband (hint: her mom did not want her to get divorced).

So I have a good body, I'm 28 single and wanted to have some fun vacation time by showing it off a little.

I brought about 7 bikinis, all were thongs except for two, and one was a G-string.

I ended up wearing mainly the thongs the entire time. 

Now her son is 10 and he's such a fun kid, I'm a child at heart too so often we'd play beach sports in the pool or water.

Most times I'm not in the water I'm wearing a mesh coverup.

He's a child still and I know when men or boys are checking me out. It wasn't like that with me, it's like he sees me like a big sister.

My friend was totally cool with it at all times and I even asked her if it was ok and she said it's a beach vacation, half of the women here are wearing thongs (probably realistically maybe 20%). So I had her blessing, apparently her mom did not.

Before I left, and we were saying good bye at the hotel lobby (they leave tmr), her mom told me ""Next time you come with us remember to pack more appropriate clothes"", I was like, ""Jan said it was fine and it's normal dress code here"" she was like ""Honey look, I know you're a wild girl, but my grandson doesn't need to be seeing you butt on display all day"". I told her sorry and left.

But its left me feeling so dirty and uncomfortable, I keep thinking maybe she just doesn't like me, but also, his mom had no problem whatsoever, he saw tonnes of other women wearing thongs.

I was excited to start dancing, I don’t have the best dance skills but I try. But I’m sure on camera I have zero rhythm plus a dash of clumsiness.

She didn’t ask for permission to record or anything.  Just plain started recording us. I let it go for a couple of minutes. But she kept recording us, without even trying to hide the fact that she was recording us.

902,Not the A-hole,"I'm aware of how cosmic-level petty this is, but:I'm a relatively introverted person. I love socialising on my own terms, but (probably) compared to the average person do so less than normal. I ""ration"" my socialising, essentially.

I recently moved back to my home city with my partner (we lived abroad for three years, which was perfect in terms of there not being any unannounced surprise visits!), and my parents and her Mother are living in the same city as us.

I've always been very clear with my parents that I dislike unannounced visits (from them and anybody else).

I initially communicated this in a humorous way, ie, Making sure to schedule my visits to *their* house, saying ""Don't worry, I'm not going to be *one of those people* who turns up at the door unannounced. They majorly irritate me."", etc.

For the past couple of years, my parents have made their own honey from their beehives, and have a few jars for my partner and I. I thanked them and told them it was very kind of them (etc.) and that I'd, in the near future, ask them for a time that works for them to come and collect it.

A day later (today) I had a knock at my door. It was my Dad with the honey.

I felt conflicted because on the one hand, he's giving us a home-made gift (for which I'm very grateful), but on the other hand he, seemingly intentionally, chose to ignore my (clearly re-iterated request) to schedule a time to come around, and just turned up un-announced at the door.

I still thanked him for the gift, but also didn't invite him in and mentioned (again) that I'd prefer if he'd scheduled the visit, or at least given me some warning.

I'm therefore tempted, for future visits, to ignore the door if they turn up unannounced. I have a video security camera that enables me to see who's at the door, and if it's them, I could ignore it.

WIBTA if I did this?

&#x200B;

**Other info:** My partner believes that I am possibly ""on the spectrum"" to some degree. She doesn't think I'm autistic, but maybe mildly asperger's (undiagnosed). While it may be relevant to the underlying feelings of wanting people to schedule visits, I don't feel that I should be obliged to disclose this to my parents (or anybody else) as some sort of 'external, objective' justification for my wishes, because respectful people would simply adhere to what I've requested(?).

**\*UPDATE\*:** I've sent them this message, to hopefully clear up any potential ambiguity about my stance on this:

905,Asshole,"So basic background is I’m 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in April after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get my fair share from him. The details of “why” are not important but I’m angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. A lot of this has to do with feeling like I’ve been “replaced” by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything I’m
not. My husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but Jesus Christ...give me a break. 
 

My husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. So this past weekend I picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. They said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and Aunt Stacey and Uncle Brian (my brother and sister who I didn’t even know were in town). I was like your dad took you? They said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. I was devastated because while I don’t get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me. I can’t even let that sink in without tears forming. I sort of jested that “oh and let me guess Ms Surf Instructor was there too?” My daughter said “well actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave Stacey and Brian lessons after ours.” That included my mom and dad. I was so devastated I took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour. 

When I was done I sent a furious email to my entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with my ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn’t even tell they were in town let alone invite me makes me feel so alone. 

My mom was the only one to respond and she basically said “yes it was rude we didn’t tell you Stacey and Brian were  here and we shouldn’t have done that. But we didn’t divorce Bradley, and we still see him as a son. This email along with your behavior over the last 5 years should really give you insight into why we might not want you at family events.” 

In so many words she called me asshole for sending the email, was I?

906,Asshole,"When there’s a frustrating situation that’s beyond my control, ranting is my coping mechanism. 

My girlfriend is for whatever reason incapable of listening to me rant. She always contradicts me, even when I’ve told her all I need from her in those moments is to listen to me. This happens 2 maybe 3 times a month. 

Recent example. Irritating guy at work got given great assignment. I don’t control who hands out the assignments and I can’t do anything to change this, so to let off steam I came home and just ranted about how I was frustrated. 

I’m paraphrasing but basically: “I can’t stand him. He’s getting in the way of my career opportunities. He’s such a weasel, I wish he’s just fall off the face of the fucking earth.” 

And her response was (paraphrasing) “What has he ever done to you? Why do you give him all this mental power over you? Maybe he deserved the job for doing good work. You need to let this go. You sound so pompous and arrogant.”

I’ve told her before even if she thinks whatever I’m upset about is ridiculous, ranting is how I come to accept situations I can’t change. (After I’ve had my little fit I usually don’t bring the issue up again, ever. Unless it persists in a new or different way.) And that it only makes it worse when she critiques me when I’m trying to vent. I just need her to listen (or even pretend to) and nod and then I’ll stop bringing it up. 

She says I’m the asshole for saying any of this stuff (that I rant about), being so negative, and expecting her not to call me out when I’m “being like that.” 

I don’t think asking her to just listen and nod when I’m upset is any bigger of an ask than when I listen to her complain about her problems and support her. But I can also see how it is unpleasant to listen to, and definitely very negative. Am I being an asshole?

Edit: Lunch break is over but thank you all for the insightful comments. Definitely clear to me now that it’s not just her and it’s not just me and we’ve got to actively work through this and arrive at a solution together. Appreciate everyone’s time!",296,460,0.93
907,Not the A-hole,"My father, my sister and I babysit my brother’s children while he and his wife go to work. He obviously has a favourite- his granddaughter. No matter what she does, it’s fine and sometimes even encouraged. 

The problem I have is with how he treats his grandson.

Every time anything bad happens, he’s always the one getting the blame. For instance, one time the granddaughter (who I’ll call E) spilled water on the floor. He was okay with it and instead blamed the grandson (who I’ll call Z) for it because “she learned it from him.” 

If Z is playing with a toy and E wants it, he’ll make Z share, which doesn’t sound too bad, but if E has a toy that Z want to play with and share, he’ll get angry and say that she had it first and doesn’t have to share.

He’ll often get angry at Z and give him long lectures about how he won’t do anything for him if he continues doing what he does.

I’m not saying that Z is a perfect child, but I feel as though my father should be a little nicer towards him.

908,Not enough info,"Okay, so i posted here previously asking if I was the asshole for not talking to my roommate except for about the money he owes me. Well he still hasn’t paid me back for 2 months of back rent and now our third month is coming up and it seems like he doesn’t have that rent either. I presented him with a roommate change form if he doesn’t have his rent by the fourth. After doing so, I contacted his mother to let her know like hey, your son is not doing his part in payments and I’ve presented him with a roommate removal form. He also hasn’t paid the electricity bill which I specifically gave him money for. The account is in his fathers name but I can go online and check the status of the bill and I have done so and called him out on it. I also explained to his mother that I did give him money but he did not use it for the electricity bill but rather something else and is now saying he doesn’t have the money due to other bills.

909,Asshole,"Just to give some context. My friend and I have only known each other for 3 weeks now because we met at a weight training class. 

So today, my friend was frustrated and mad at her best friend (who was her ex) because they got in a really big argument. She was telling me how toxic he was and how he would spit at her feet and act very immature with her. I told her that it wasn’t healthy for her to be friends with such a toxic guy. She agreed with me, but she said that she couldn’t let him go because of the memories they had together and how her personality makes it harder for her to let go of people.

Trying to be a good friend and do what is best for her, I asked if i can see her phone, deleted his number, and deleted her entire WhatsApp conversation with him. (thousands of videos and photos from the past 3 years).

All of a sudden, she gets mad at me saying that I shouldn’t have deleted all of their messages together because she had some very important pictures and videos in there.

She couldn’t get the pictures and videos back and she’s mad that i did that. Reddit, am I the asshole?

911,No A-holes here,"Little back story, we took a trip to a large waterpark 6 hours away, we all shared a hotel room the night before and to sum it up, it was not great. 

It’s been about 3 years since and I wanted to go visit the waterpark again. The original intent was to do a best friend’s trip. But then I realized I didn’t want to leave my FH by himself and her FH was expected to be in town by then so over dinner, we all planned to go together at the end of July.

When I and my FH go on vacations, we love a good hotel room. Clean. Safe Location. Relaxing. My friend on the other hand claims she could care less. Full disclosure, I told her years ago we shouldn’t share a single hotel room again. And I meant it. I still wanted us to all be together, but I felt we needed some space when retiring for the night. Her one request was that they did not want to spend “too much”on a place to
stay. With that in mind, I looked for places that met EVERYONE’S criteria. Searched for hotels and AirBnB and everything I found ranged between 75-130 a night (there were plenty options to choose from) 

She was not having any of them. 

She found places for about 45-55 bucks a night that were outdated, sub par, out of the way, sketchy, and frankly, you could just smell the funk in the room from the photo. I’m not rich. Nor do I like being a snob, but I could not do it. I told her I’d keep looking, and that I’d also even pay for their night stay if it meant we’d all be together in a nicer place- to which she adamantly refused the idea and I agreed I would respect her wishes. We came to the agreement that if I couldn’t find a place we all agreed on, everyone one would just be responsible for their own lodging and call it a day. Soon after that, she then proceeded to talk about inviting other people on the trip, and that they’d be staying all together. They would also be visiting other friends in the city, and basically told me they would not be available after the waterpark. 

That’s when I called it off. 

I apologized, and told her I just felt it would be best if we didn’t take this trip together. Nothing had been booked. Passes were not bought. Technically no one was out of any amount of money. She is upset with me, and neither of us have talked in about 3 weeks. Nor did anyone go on the trip I believe.

So am I the Asshole for dropping out on this trip? 

TLDR: A girls trip turned into a couples trip. Plans were made over dinner, and soon things took a turn. Every step from budget, picking dates, booking the stay, and activities to follow all proved to produce a bit of head-butting. The breaking point for me to call off my participation in the planned trip was when it began to occur to me, they only wished to spend time with other people. I felt there was no reason to go on a trip I did not feel wanted on, so I shut my part down. My actions did not inhibit them form going, but it seems to have left my “friend” upset with me and we are now on non-speaking terms. Am I the Asshole?",31,36,0.89

913,Not the A-hole,"I know these post are pretty common on here but hear me out. my upstairs neighbor is nuts. she never sleeps, walks with shoes indoors, making loud clomping noise all the time, she moves furniture or whatever almost every night, like drag the furniture across wood floors, which is super loud. she gets into screaming matches at midnght, but i never hear or see another person or even animal living or visiting there. she has to be mentally deranged.

she has a feud with an older couple. its been going on for years and she thinks they contaminate the house with poison, so she holds the door up for hours & end, even in the winters. she also harrassess them by the entrance, and she and the other people scream at each other at all hours, even past midnight/2-5 am. my friend couldnt even sleep at my place because of the constant noises.

i collect guitars and have some old wood furniture, and the moisture on the summer and the cold in winter really ruins those things, as they are made of wood. i have to leave my guitars in the shop often, because the wood warps and makes it hard to play, so she has cost me money too.

she also insists on talking to me, but she creeps me out, she looks creepy too. im getting sick of her, and her yelling and her noises, and she also brings druggies or at least weird people in to the house, they usually sit in the entrance, not her apartment.

the last straw came when i fixed an old guitar from my dads. i spent a month fixing everything, then it got really warm and damp outside and this woman let in all the moisture by holding the door open. since the guitar is old, the wood was fragile, and some parts popped out, or in general got messed up, so now i have to spend maybe 80 euros again, when thought I was done.

I got tired of her horrible behavior and called my landlord. she got thrown out  on her ass a few days later. my friends thought it was cold of me, since she doesnt work, and probably cant find another apartment with her behavior, but other people deserve to live comfortably too, AITA here?",35,43,0.89

Our Airbnb will cost around $2,300 for about 7 days -- a number that we all agreed on. My girlfriend and I are fronting all of the initial booking costs and my family members are going to pay us back when we get to the beach.

My dad invited my uncle, who will have ""spending money"" but will not be able to contribute to the condo. I was not overly concerned, because my dad seemed to want him to be able to come. My grandmother, who is in her 80s, will not be contributing to the condo, because grandma status -- we're all splitting her portion (girlfriend is assuming a percentage, too).

Parents called this morning to ask about the Airbnb and asked why they had to pay their portion (around $900 for my dad and mom combined) if I was paying for my brother's portion. Well, last month my girlfriend and I visited my brother and our dog ripped up his carpet (thankfully there was hardwood beneath it), so we are paying his portion of the vacation so that he can fix his floor (which he did).

Parents knew that was the case because they said: ""your brother said that because Annabelle ripped up his carpet, he didn't have to pay anything for the condo.""

They then made a comment about how they used to front our costs for the beach (when we were 18-20 in school). Mind you that I just flew them up to our apartment in NYC a couple of months back and paid for everything except their taxi ride in.

921,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago, when I was 15, my step-dad came to me and proposed to ""pre-adopt"" me. I don't have the details but basically it wouldn't be a real adoption (my dad would still legally be my dad) but an official paper saying that we're officially family  and allowing me to percieve an inheritance when he dies. Because he raised me, I'm his only child and he basically considers me his daughter, he wanted me to be his heiress. The choice to accept or decline was mine.

At the time I was more than ok with that, I love my step-dad and I didn't think it would affect my father in any way.

Boy I was wrong.

When I told my dad about it he got really, really mad. He thought my step-dad wanted to ""steal"" me from him and yelled at me for the whole week-end I spent with him. He even got drunk one night and came into my room to vent to me, telling me how my step-dad was an asshole, how my mom was a slut and I was a slut too, how he should never have allowed me to be born and he should have bought a dog instead.

Needless to say when I went back to my mom's, I told my step-dad that I didn't want him to adopt me. I was so sad to hurt him but I was terrified how my father would react if I let my step-dad go on with the procedure. I didn't tell what happened with my dad until recently.

Back to 2019. A few month ago, my step-dad brought back the idea to pre-adopt me, because he is getting older and he wants to take care of his inheritance before it's loo late. He said he was okay with me refusing this but since I'm 22 now, he figured that after 7 years I may have changed my mind.

That's when I told him about my dad's reaction years ago, and after talking about it he said that my dad didn't have to know about it, that he isn't entitled to know what's happening in this side of the family.

I really want to let my step-dad be officially a part of my family. I love him so much and I wish he was my real dad.

923,META,"# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub. 

---

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",1601,41154,0.94
924,Asshole,"I am from the east coast on an exchange program from my private university to a large public one in Arizona. I have made friends with lots of different groups through classes but none of my friend groups intermingle that much.

I am friends with a girl named Katie who is from a small tribe way in northern New Mexico (Katie is also half white and may be the most physicallly beautiful girl I've ever met, I'm attracted to her and I've never been a lesbian before) I'm also a freind with a guy names Notah who is from a huge tribe in Arizona. They are both such cool people but they had never met so I asked each of them if I could set them up on a date because I assumed they had a lot in common.

Well Katie said that while she's trying to be open minded, her parents would absolutely kill her if she dated someone from Notah's tribe. Notah was even more direct and said that I was actually trying to get him beat up or worse because there is so much hatred for his tribe among the pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona that goes back 1000 years. I said we live in 2019 and he's allowed to do and do go wherever he wants. He says basically yeah as a tourist but not rucking someone's daughter or sister. Notah said I was being an asshole and approaching racist to assume all native Americans would have things in common.

Most of my more traditional white friend's and the ones from here said I really  overstepped and if Katie and Notah were meant to meet they'd meet, my friends from Europe and the east coast said I did nothing wrong and basically it's ok to move people past prejudices.

925,Not the A-hole,"My (19f) 7 year old brother is a menace. He is badly behaved most of the time. He screams, throws tantrums, breaks things, sulks and is generally just nasty. My parents work long hours during the week so I spend a lot of time trying to deal with his behaviour.

Now, I do character parties for kids. Most of the time I dress as a princess for the parties, but I've had a couple in which I've been asked to be Black Widow or Gamora. My little brother saw me dressed as Black Widow, and is basically convinced I am the real Black Widow on the side and that I fought Thanos in Infinity War (he hasn't seen Endgame).

I told him no, Thanos is alive. He is just regaining his strength before he makes his next snap.

926,Not the A-hole,"Bit of a backstory.

My wife is autistic, and has a lot of rigidity issues. Shes heavily routine oriented, and can often get very overwhelmed when something messes up her schedule.

I messed up her schedule.

My buddy and I planned a camping trip, and went for it. My wife, obviously and quite understandably, was having a very hard time with it, being as I'm literally ALWAYS home after work, and me being completely gone for 4 days was a HUGE break in routine for her. So there was a heavy emphasis on being home when I say I'm going to be home.

Now, my friend is one of those guys who buys a 20 year old vehicle, and drives it likes it's a brand new really car. Just ratbags the shit out of things. He had recently gotten a rather old truck, and sure enough, he beat the hell out of it so badly that the exhaust pipe sheared clean off of the muffler. So he was all ""well if you wanna make it home on your 'schedule' youd better call someone."" So that's exactly what I did. Tbh, I think he was expecting me to stay for a few extra nights while he figures out where to get his exhaust fixed. (Worth noting this happened on the day before Canada Day and no place was going to be open for a few more days).

So I call my brother, and he saves our asses. In the 3 hours it took for him to get to us, we managed to redneck rig the exhaust back on to the truck, and we decide to just limp it home and hell get it fixed in a few days. The thing was running like shit but we got her home.

Fast forward 2 days.

Hes been to a muffler shop, and got a really awesome new exhaust manifold installed. I made it home to my wife ahead of schedule, and everyone was doing fine. Until he goes to drive it away and it's still running like shit. A few hours in an engine repair shop later, and he finds out the horrible truth: he has cooked his engine. The thing is just dead. He castrated the poor thing. Understandably, he was a bit upset. That's where the ""WITA"" part comes in.

(This was a month ago so I'm paraphrasing)
Him - So the motor in the truck is fucked. But at least we got you home for YOUR schedule right?(make sure to read that in a snarky shitty voice)

Me - I'm sorry about that man. But that was a pretty shitty thing to say.

Him - (still in that shitty way) You're right. I've been biting my tongue for a long time now but I guess I'll just bite it some more.

Me - well dont worry. My wife and I will keep her schedules well out of your way from here on out.

Him - that would be GREATLY appreciated.



It went on a bit, and there was a fair bit of cursing on both parts. Worth noting he did eventually apologise for how he acted, but that was also a week later and it was just a half assed ""hehe sorry about that buddy"" sort if apology. It's been sitting with me. Was I the asshole? I didnt WANT to go home when we did, and I certainly didnt want him to kill his engine trying to get home. I just wanted to hold up my word to my wife.",25,28,0.77

Well I see him chatting with people and he seems to be getting close with my buddy Austin. Austin is a extremely chill do. Hell of a pot head and is normally just trying to have deep conversation when he is high so. All of a sudden Steve yells *fuck you motherfucker* I look over Steve is standing up and Austin is still sitting down trying to eat his nachos and shit I go over and ask what's going on and Steve says that ""that motherfucker says I need to train to defend myself"" (Steve carries mace) so Steve is calling out Austin and says let's go outside and I'll show you what's up....

 I was like yo Steve if you fight him I'm not getting involved. Austin wasn't trying to have any of it and was just trying to eat. So Steve goes over board and slaps Austin food. So Austin gets up and just says alright man let's go so they go across the street and I go with them. Austin just wrestles Steve down but than Steve head butts Austin and that's when Austin was like alright that's it and gets on top of him and punches Steve a few times and stops and says ""do you want me to keep going"" he gets off of Steve thinking it was done and this motherfucker sucker punches Austin. I started going over and Austin just started throwing hella combos and cut his lip and swelled his eye this was no more than like 3 combos so about 9 to 12 hits that's when I jump in and tell Austin to go inside he goes in. I pick Steve up took him home and helped him up with his face the next morning his family asked what happened and he says that I let him get beat up and I was like yeah. He shouldn't be picking fights especially with trained fighters. Then they turned to Steve and said it was his fault but my exgf put it on me 

AITA for letting him fight my teammates?",36,34,0.89

929,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account. I’m also new to this thread and am seeking some perspective, I do apologise if many similar situations have been brought up before. 

My daughter and her boyfriend are both 20, and have been together for over 1.5 years. BF is over at our house quite often, at least 4-5 times a week and everyone in the family is okay and used to this. Sometimes, he leaves the house at very late hours, around 1-3am. (They are both waiting to enter university and are working part-time, hence have quite a bit of free time these few months) My husband and I initially did not like that they were spending time in my daughter’s room behind closed doors, but it seems to be a long term relationship and we are okay with it now. 

However, we have a strict rule that he is not allowed to sleepover. A few months ago, my daughter asked if BF could sleepover and I firmly said No. She was visibly upset but did not pursue the matter, I assume because she could tell from my tone that I would not budge on this rule. She hasn’t brought it up because she respects our decision, but I’m sure she wishes this wasn’t a rule at all. They spend lots of time together anyway so it doesn’t seem like there’s even a need for him to sleepover? 

Anyway, she has now asked again and brought up the fact that she is about to go overseas for Uni in a few months, which means they will be long distance for many years. However, I still don’t see the need for him to stay the night and as far as I know, his parents are not okay with it either. But maybe I need more opinions. So AITA for not letting my daughter’s bf sleepover?",186,165,0.87

931,Not the A-hole,"I’m 15 about to turn 16, as an early bday gift my mom paid for me to go on a trip with some cousins. 
My aunts(22 and 25) came on our trip to chaperone/hang with us as we’re a close family. 

There was 8 people total in our group. We booked 2 rooms and split the price evenly between all 8 people. 
So we check into the rooms and my other 4 cousins staying in their separate room has 2 double beds. 
When me, my cousin, and our 2 aunts checked into our rooms, there was only 1 king bed and a pullout couch. My cousin and I thought the front desk messed up, and suggested we go ask for 2 doubles. My aunts said they booked the room like that on purpose because they didn’t want to sleep close to each other and that my cousin and I can have the pull out couch.  

We were pretty upset but didn’t want to cause a rift and pulled out the couch, we laid on it and the mattress was like a semi thick blanket put over springs, it was so uncomfortable. I couldn’t imagine sleeping on it, let alone for a week, 8 hours a night. It would’ve messed up my back for sure. My cousin also has a spine problem and can’t sleep on hard surfaces like that. We told them we wanted to change to a 2 double room and they told us to shut up and they’re chaperoning the trip and they’re older so they’re in charge and we have to listen to what they say. 

I immediately got pissed off and told them “We all split the price evenly so we need to split the room evenly. My mom paid for my hotel room so I can have a bed to sleep on, not for you two to get a king, so either change the room or I’m calling her.”  They told me to call her and I did. My mom first tried to be an adult about it and told them nicely to change the room. They refused. My mom ended up booking another room for my cousin and I separately and told my aunts she’s not paying for the king bedroom. 

After that, my aunts started excluding us during the trip, not including us in convo sometimes, and saying they couldn’t do particular activities we planned to do as they had no money left cause they had to pay the full price for the room, boo fuckin hoo you both have full time jobs and their parents are taking care of rent and tuition. Our trip was pretty much ruined. 

My other cousins(who are much more obedient than me and my roommate cousin) told us we should’ve just sucked it up for the sake of the trip. I don’t think we should have because my aunts think they’re entitled and can do whatever they want, and my mom paid for me to go on this trip evenly. Had my aunts paid for the hotel we might’ve not said anything but we were more inclined because we paid and the bed was fucking uncomfortable and my cousin has a bad spine. Idk, I think my aunts can suck it but should we just have let it go? The 4 of us are still mad at one another and I don’t plan to be the first one to make up.",509,3710,0.97

We are now finally in a position where we can take the dream trip, however now we also have two kids (4) and (5).

Our kids don’t understand much of the trips we take, they get tired easily (obviously, they’re kids), and they forget it all in a year because they’re so young. Would we be the asshole if we took a 4-5 day trip to Disneyland without our kids? Initially we thought it would be fine as we have weekend getaways every now and then, and no one bats an eye.

934,Not the A-hole,"Hello Everyone,

Its 5am and I don't have to be at work till 9am. I'm currently lying next to my snoring bf who doesn't even roll out of bed until I've already left for work (he has a job). So why am I awake right now? Is it insomnia? Restless leg syndrome? No.

ITS ALL OF THE GODDAMN ALARMS MY BF HAS SET TO GO OFF BETWEEN 5AM AND 8AM!

Here is a morning in my life.

5am:
 
bf's alarm goes off

He doesn't wake up

I wake up

I shake him awake 

He doesn't wake up 

I shake a little harder 

He doesn't wake up

I shake him a lot harder

He goes ""stooooooop""

He turns towards his cell phone

He just idk stares at it while the alarm is still going?

I shake him again

He turns off the alarm 

He goes back to sleep


Rinse and repeat for until 7am which is when I get out of bed. The alarms are still going off mind you I'm just not there to shake him awake. 

I've asked my bf several times to turn off all these alarms but he always has the same excuse. ""I need them to wake up I wake up slowly"" this statement is dumb for two reasons. 

1 - The alarm doesn't wake him up. I do. His alarm wakes me up and then I have to shake him awake multiple times within a few hours to get all these alarms turned off. Then he doesn't even become fully awake until I get out of bed and turn the light on

2 - Why does he even need an alarm at 5am when he doesn't even need to get ready until after 8am? The answer is he doesn't. The answer is that he set up alarms for one time events and then never turns them off!! Im being woken up for doctor's appointments for six months ago!

So like I said Ive asked my bf to turn off these alarms multiple times but he always has his excuses. I've been putting up with this for years, but I'm at the end of my mental rope. 

The alarms. They haunt me. The jingle. I hear it now. Even as Im looking at his phone which is clearly off I hear the jingle playing over and over in my head. I can't turn it off. I have to do something.

So would I be the asshole if I just turn off these alarms and didn't tell my bf? Alternatively if, instead of shaking him awake every morning i just started screaming ""THE SIRENS! THE SIRENS! GODS DAMN ME TO HELL THE SIRENS!!""",461,2239,0.97
935,Not the A-hole,"This is gonna be a long one so grab a drink and maybe some snacks.

My BIL recently annouced that he has a serious gf and that they are hoping to move in together. This is a big deal since he lives in a different state and we never get to see him, but they plan to move closer to home. Great. Everybody is happy. Ok so now it's time to meet the girl.  BIL suggests we all get together and he introduces her to everybody at once. Even better. I suggest we have dinner at out place. BIL and gf agree. So far so good.
This is where the shitstorm starts brewing.
A few times a year I make this lasagna dish. I almost never make it since it's a huge pain in the ass to make it. I make my own tomato sauce and lasagne sheets. It takes forever but in the end it's worth it.  So I make the lasagna for 19 people. BIL comes over, we meet the girl, everything is going great, the plates are empty and nothing seemed weird.

Half an hour later my kid comes out and yells ""Tinkerbell barfed"". Tinkerbell is our dog, the kids named her so don't judge. Anyway I go clean it up no big deal. Except she barfed up my lasagne. I can clearly see the cheeese and the beef. Someone fed my fucking lasagne to the dog. Now I am upset. Not angry just upset.

Now the grand finale. BIL's gf comes over and offers to help with the clean up. Great. Then she admits it was her. She's vegan. She is very very sorry. She didn't think it would hurt the dog. She is oh so sorry. I on the other hand am PISSED. I did raise my voice at her but it was nowhere near yelling. I was angry as fuck but i walked away without saying what I actually wanted to say. Now the girl starts crying. Everybody hears it.  I explain but everybody thinks I'm a huge bitch. Dinner is ruined. They only person who took my side is my mother in law.

So, am I the asshole is this scenario?

EDIT: oldest kid admitted to husband that she saw BIL'S gf giving ""something"" to the dog. Bil called like an hour ago saying that the girl is devastated and was afraid of being ""that"" kind of a vegan so she panicked and just fed half od it to the dog. She offered to take us all out to eat as an apology.  Now it's official I'm a bitch.

EDIT 2 : The dog is fine. She's an old mutt but she's tough as hell.

Last EDIT I swear. The dinner was yesterday.

OK THIS IS THE LAST EDIT: Again I was never close to yelling at the girl but I did say some things that might sound harsh. I can't quote exactly what I said but my first question was ""WHAT were you thinking?"".  Also I said something along the lines of ""do you know how much spices I put in the food dogs can't handle that"". Last thing was something like ""just go outside I'll clean it up.""",1695,3597,0.95

937,Not the A-hole,"The title probably gives 90% of the information, but I'll provide a bit more context.

I, along with my brother, just graduated from university. My first cousin once removed (aged 18) is just about to start university after the summer. My cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on Facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). In this post, she went on and on about how Child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. She listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.

I don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. I would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why I have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.

I replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'So great to see another [surname] starting their next stage in life, just after [brother] and I graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false. A little while later I got a message from my aunt, my cousin's mother, asking me to remove the comment since Cousin was embarrassed and felt like I was trying to one-up her (even though that's exactly what the tone of her post was).

I haven't yet removed the comment, but woke up feeling pretty asshole-ish, and probably will remove the comment later on. Just how much am I in the wrong?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone, we've had to pander to my cousin before over things, so I need to learn to stand up for myself. Also I know I messed up in correctly labelling who everyone is, the person going to university soon is my first cousin once removed, and her mum is my cousin. I also got a pronoun wrong at some point too, MY brother and I were the people who graduated a few weeks ago. Finally, to everyone saying my profile picture should be me in my gown, it already was!!

2nd EDIT: I know I got the proper name for my first cousin once removed wrong!! I didn't want to change it in the post since I've seen so many times about how changing posts automatically means you're a liar and karma-seeker, but every PM saying 'just so you know...' is slowly breaking my soul!

938,Asshole,"To give some context: I broke up with my ex-husband about 4 years ago, things were pretty hostile for several years but have been better for the last 6 months. Before this event we were able to talk like grown ups, mostly. We have a boy together, He is 6.

It all started about a month ago, I enjoy going to McDonald's for breakfast. When I don't have my son I go once a week before work, because that is the only time I can go. 

Well I have started taking him with me for breakfast once a week before dropping him off at school when he's under my care. He always gets what he would normally get, a burger, fries and a frozen coke. 

The problem is my ex completely exploded over this when I picked him up, He said it's completely irresponsible to be taking him for fast food for breakfast, and that he is complaining and refuses to eat the crappy food my husband serves him for breakfast, and only wants McDonald's. He thinks I don't care about his health at all either.

We both ended up completely screaming at each other in a car park over this. I'm so sick of dealing with my ex. I don't see how this is an issue, it's once a week, it's not my fault he gives him yuck food for breakfast and he doesn't want to eat it.",110,99,0.91
939,Everyone Sucks,"My family runs a tour company that operates small to large tour groups around the surrounding region. These span from scenic tours, historic sites, and even some whale watching. 

In order to make things run more smoothly, and also to the benefit of our customers, some of these tours are group focused. For example, we have tours specifically for Chinese and Taiwanese tourists with bilingual guides. 

Along these lines, my mother started organising family tours a while ago specifically for parents with young kids. She is very family oriented and these tours are her pride and joy so to speak, being specifically geared towards making sure the kids enjoy themselves as well as their parents. It’s also a great opportunity for kids to make new friends.

Now, because these are a hobby of my mother and done for the benefit of new families, they are significantly cheaper than the main tours. 1 or 2 parents can simply buy a family pass for a set price and bring up to 3 kids at no extra cost. The family pass costs significantly less than two adult tickets for the equivalent normal tour group. For this reason, bringing at least one kid is mandatory, else people would take advantage of the price discrepancy. **We are very clear about this requirement.**

Fast forward to yesterday, a couple without any kids shows up to a family tour they had booked online. I immediately bring this up and they explain they’re “child free” and booked this one since the normal one was full. I explained that this is a family tour and we are very clear about this requirement, which sparked a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against as a child free couple. The online booking system requires them to put in how many kids they have (1+) so they 100% knew they about this. They definitely lied to book the tour.

Eventually I relented and offered to let them join the tour provided they pay the difference between this and the normal one for two adult tickets. They refuse saying they already paid online and shouldn’t have to pay more than the advertised price. Again sparking a ridiculous argument about them being discriminated against. 

Eventually the tour is set to leave and they, accepting Im not gonna budge, demand at least a refund. I refuse since the tour was fully booked meaning their fraudulent online booking almost certainly meant we missed out on another family. 

They claim this is illegal, at which point I gave them the contact details of our family’s lawyer and said we would be happy to see them in small claims court. They swore at me before walking off defeated.

Since then our tour group has seen a bunch of fake reviews from a “child free” Facebook page claiming we’re evil etc. Luckily we got them removed since they’re obviously fake, but AITA for my response to them?

942,Asshole,"I try to be an honest person and never do things like this ever, concidering it gives me moral qualms, though it is such a small thing.

So, I  need a bleeding kit for my bike with hydrolic discbrakes. FYI, they use oil pressure like cars and need the oil replaced and air bleed out of them. To do this, you either need a special kit or hire a mechanic.

Anyway, I found a kit for about 15$ (not actual currency but converts for ease) but upon buying it, they will slap a 7$ delivery fee ontop which makes the prices far above what I hoped. 

However, the site has a policy that states that if you order above 50$, you don't need to pay the delivery fee.

What I am concidering is ordering both the bleeding kit and like a pair of shoes to avoid the fee and then return the shoes which means I don't actually have to pay the fee.

I know this works because I needed to return a cycling shirt because in Poland, people there are apparantly really small, and even though my order now came under 50$ through the return, I never got an invoice for the delivery fee. 

Returns are also free by company policy.

During a particularly busy flurry of people a somewhat entitled man came to the till with a shit heap of clothes. After scanning them all in the conversation went as follows: 

OP: That’ll be £351.55

EM: Can you take the £1.55 off? I don’t deal in change.

OP: I’m sorry?

EM: I don’t like having change so can you take the £1.55 off so it’s £350?

OP: I mean, I can’t just take money off. 

EM: Yes you can.

OP: If you don’t like change I will round it up to £352. 

The entitled man didn’t like this and started yelling. 

EM: I am not paying more money, you’re already getting £300 from me I’m not paying any more!

OP: If I do this for you then the customers behind you would want the same treatment.

 I myself started to get annoyed.
 
OP: Look, sir. I’m sorry you don’t like change, but I can’t just take money off willy nilly. Otherwise I’ll go into a shop and tell them I don’t like spending more than £10 so can they knock the price of an item to £10.

At this point my manger came and asked what was wrong. I told him the customer didn’t want to pay the full amount because he doesn’t like change and wanted to pay less. They exchanged words including the whole “customer service is our priority” and “I am going to Facebook with this” (I did laugh at this). Come the end my manager told him we could reduce his purchase to £350 and I was in the wrong.

This was at the weekend and I am currently waiting outside the office for a disciplinary and a lesson on customer service. So, Reddit, AITA?

TLDR: Customer wanted to pay £350 instead of £351.55 because he doesn’t like change. I said no and am now getting a disciplinary.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your advice. I understand I could've brought the manager over straight away, but being a supervisor I felt I had enough authority to say no. In regards to the 0.44% comments, yes I get it's so little, but if EM has such a problem with change he should work around that in what he buys. In regards to the disciplinary, the area manager for our region needs to be present. It will be in the next week. From the way my manger was, I think he realised his mistake in making me look like the bad guy, so kudos to him I guess. I will update with the outcome. Peace out xx",87,48,0.92

945,Asshole,"So I took my daughter (16) to the dentist recently and they x rayed her teeth and told her that they strongly recommend she gets braces, her teeth are crooked and she has 3 adult teeth will not grow in (they are blocked). She doesn’t experience pain from this so I don’t necessarily consider it a need. but she admitted to me that she was always very embarrassed of her teeth but she was afraid to ask since braces are very expensive. Looking back, I noticed she never smiled with her teeth in photos. Anyway, after this she said she REALLY wanted better teeth and begged her father and I. We sat her down and talked. We told her 1: while we technically can afford it we have more important things to pay for and 2: getting braces is just weird for her age and people will likely judge her for it at school. We offered an alternative option in that since she is old enough to get a job then she is old enough to pay for her own wants. We said we’d allow it if she is willing to get a part time job, and we’d even help pay a percentage (20-25%) if she behaves well and keeps up her grades. This was last night and she is upset and has not given us an answer yet. AITA for refusing to get my daughter braces even though we can technically afford it?

Edit: Thank you for the responses, I am 100% the asshole. I was thinking about this the wrong way and didn’t consider the potential issues it would cause later on. I also didn’t think about her current embarrassment vs the embarrassment of having braces, which you are right people will judge bad teeth more.

946,Not the A-hole,"Background: I have an old riding injury and still bothers if I use stairs. It's not excruciating, but it just gives me a dull, annoying pain throughout the day when it flares up.  

I bought a place in a small complex (12 units).  There is a parking garage (each unit gets 3 spots, but I only have one car), and my unit is in the front of the building.  There are two routes to get to my unit from the garage: (1) click open the garage entrance and just walk through, then enter through the complex's front door, or (2) walk to the back of the garage, go up a staircase, and then walk back to the front .  There is no elevator or ramp even though the building is not super old (2005).  I did notice the lack of ramp when I was looking at the building, but didn't think much of it since walking through the garage door seemed like a pretty easy fix for my purposes.  

If there is no street parking, I typically park in the garage, open the gate with my clicker and walk out. The garage gate also has a little code box right by the entrance that could only be reached on foot (not the kind that you type in as you're driving - it's placed in a way that you can't use it from inside a car).  I'm not the only one who does this.

A few months after moving in, one of the other owners (not the property manager, but the only person on the HOA board) told me I was no longer allowed to enter and exit that way because it was a safety concern and it caused excess wear and tear on the garage door.  I said (1) the safety concern was unfounded as many garage doors in our neighborhood have a door ON them so that people can enter and exit by foot, (2)  there was a code box that was only accessible by foot for this exact purpose, (3) there was literally no other way to leave the garage for someone who can't do stairs (or has a stroller), since we don't have ramps, and (4) I have only one car and everyone else has three, so I'm still causing less wear and tear on the door than others (I think the wear and tear excuse is BS anyway).  I didn't tell him about my hip pain because I thought it was none of his business - this is totally a rule he's made up (not written in our HOA docs) and I don't want to disclose medical details about myself to him for no reason. 

It's been a few months, and today I heard him talking to someone else in the building about he was going to change the punch code so that people can't use it as an entrance.  I'm pretty annoyed by it and his persistence.  Part of me thinks he is worked up about this because he is an older man from a patriarchal culture (I'm from the same ethnicity/culture) and I'm a younger woman who refuses to follow this seemingly ridiculous rule...but then part of me wonders if I'm just being an asshole here.   If I didn't use the garage, my only option would be to basically sell/move out or subject myself to pain, neither of which sound great.  AITA?",32,56,0.87

I'm taking a lot of classes right now and had to carefully carve out my time to study for this test today, and I was worried about it because the last tests were easy to miss points on. Anyways, I noticed this kid in front of me writing down a ton of notes from his notebook onto his desk, and then saw him cheating the entire test period. It really pissed me off because I studied and stressed over the test. Also, this class is graded on a curve, and I was angry that he might fuck up my curve by being a lazy POS.

In my mind; we invited friends over, I spent 3 hours cooking an amazing meal, only for it turned into a sales call for them. My girlfriend and her haven't seen each other in years and this reeks of a sales pitch as the only goal, rather than catching up on old times.

I'm sleeping on the couch tonight, but I can't help but feel a bit justified here... Am I the asshole?",322,2580,0.98
951,Asshole,"I apologize in advance, I’m on mobile. 
This happened about a year ago. I was hanging out with some friends going out to bars and we met up with their good friend, someone I’ve never met. I was aware he had a girlfriend at the time, but I didn’t know too much about the relationship and my friends didn’t care for the girl. 

We met up with him and were drinking quite a bit, bar hopping and whatnot. Well, our little group ended up getting split up and he and I ended up alone together. 

He and I were talking and he told me he is in an open relationship (something that’s common where I live). I didn’t think anything of it and I wasn’t feeling any kind of emotional/ physical attachment to this person. I ended up getting ridiculously drunk and we ended up sleeping together. I didn’t think it was a problem because he told me his relationship wasn’t serious and it was open. We slept together a few more times throughout the night and a little more the next day. 

We were talking for a while, nothing serious going on. I wasn’t into this person, it was basically just sex. 

He eventually told me he lied to me and wasn’t in an open relationship and his girlfriend was under the assumption that the relationship was more serious. I asked him why he slept with me and told me that and he said because of the line of work he is in, he decided he wanted to live his life to the fullest and not have to hold back. He bragged about having sex with over 100 women, so I’m assuming this wasn’t the first time he has cheated. (He can always get “away” with it because he’s always going on business trips)

After all of that, we ended our sex fling and stopped talking. I saw him a few more months after that. We went for a drive, something that I went on with the intention of not doing anything because I wasn’t about to fuck up his relationship more. He kissed me then, and I stopped everything there. 

I now find out he’s engaged to his girlfriend, who knows nothing about this behavior he’s into. I’m conflicted on what to do, because I’ve talked with friends about this and they’re telling me it’s not my business to tell her what he’s done, it’s his.... but I also believe this girl deserves more than the man she’s about to marry. She comes from a small town, she’s from a good family and is so incredibly intelligent. 

So, AITA for not telling this woman her fiancé is a chronic cheater?",30,35,0.89
952,,"OK, I'l try to shorten the story so it's digestible... 

Basically, there's this cat. He ""lives"" a few houses up... I didn't even learn this until a couple weeks ago. The cat, who I named Robert, has been waiting for me at my door for the last three months. He stays by my place, waits by my door. He's always happy to come inside, eat, chill, sleep. 

 I get home very very late. Midnight is early for me. 2am is more realistic. Robert is declawed, so he has no natural defense. He is very old, frail, milky old eyes, clearly ""elderly.""  I'd estimate he's at least 13? He can barely jump up to the couch.

He was covered in scabs. Mange. Fleas. I Capstar'd his ass immediately, with followup Advantage. I've been picking scabs for at least a month, and I'm still only about 75% done, he was beat up, nasty, scabby, gross.

There's no reason an elderly declawed kitty should be out that late. Also, the ""home"" of the cat is home to four dogs, and they have an entirely fenced yard. Rob can't even jump up over it. It might be the dogs that were beating him up, it might be the local feral cats, who knows...

All I know is this cat picked me, I let him in, and he looks 200% healthier since I've been picking and brushing his gross fur. He loves me. He spoons on the couch. 

My other neighbor said the ""owner"" of the cat was crying on Facebook about the lost cat. Asking me if i'd seen it... I confided in her that I basically took the cat. Other neighbor said ""good job, It's out secret"" after seeing how clean Robert looks now.

TLDR: I stole someone's terribly neglected, underfed, elderly, gross cat. He chose to be here. He is very affectionate. He lets me pick scabs and brush him back to healthy. I'm keeping him.",494,4022,0.94

954,Asshole,"I’m a high school cheer coach and I need to know if I did the right thing here.

One of my girls lost their dad in May. It was really terrible for her and we were there for her, as a team. Her mom spoke to me privately and said that her daughter was not going to be up for going to cheer camp. Now, at my school, this is required for the kids to be able to rejoin (or even tryout) for the squad in the fall. (It’s the same for football). I had a dilemma on my hands. While I understood why this girl wasn’t going to be up for a week of workouts, learning new stunts, dances, jumps and techniques. That being said, if she missed it, she would be very much behind come fall. I asked the mother if her daughter still wanted to cheer and she said yes, but she wasn’t up for camp.

I debated this for a while and spoke to the head of the athletics department, along with the school principal. They left it up to me, but the athletic head said it was a lot different than giving say an extension on homework. Letting her miss it and the allowing her to rejoin the team wouldn’t be fair to other girls who took the time to go.

Eventually, I went to the mom and said to give her daughter time to think it over and explained why. We had time to wait. In time, however, the mom confirmed, the daughter was just not up to it. I said I understood; however, this was what it meant.

I got a very upset e-mail from the mother, saying I was taking out her daughter’s grief on her. I tried to explain that it just wasn’t fair to the other girls and it wasn’t the same as other extensions. I said that she could try again the following year and that I was here for her further.

I feel terrible right now and like I said, I need to know what you guys think. Am I being an ass here?",554,919,0.9
955,Not the A-hole,"So I had a date coming up but since I didn’t  know how to do make up, I went to a booth at the mall that does it for you. I waited patiently for my turn to do a test run. The employees decided they were gonna let the new girl do my make up. At first I had no problem. I’ve seen her around before. She’s 16.

The problem was she had on a sheer blue top with no bra. I could see how dark and size of her freaking areolas were. She started doing my face, but I couldn’t take her jiggling in my face. Normally I don’t care what girls wear, but there’s a time an place for everything. 

The test run was ok. Nothing extreme cause I wanted to leave the chair. Later that day, I was talking to her boss (roommate’s friend) and told him about her outfit. I went the day of my date to get my make up done. All the employees refused to do it since the girl was put on probation. They told me she cried and was embarrassed that the boss confronted her about the shirt. 

AITA?

Edit- The shirt wasn’t “sheer in a certain light”. It was basically see through in any light. That was the style of it. She had to know it was see through as I saw her looking in the mirror and fixing her boobs.",162,245,0.92
956,Not the A-hole,"This couple lives in the apartment next to me and TBH I can't stand these people. Within a few days of them moving in, their off leash dog attacked my elderly leashed dog. He was terrified after that but the only physical damage was a slightly bleeding ear. He was scared of their door for the next few months until he passed (unrelated). And all the complex did was leave a note on their door about leashing dogs. But I'm off topic.

At least once a week our living room smells strongly of either cigarettes or weed, depending on the day. They are the one of two apts whose vents connect to ours, but it started right after they moved in. Weed is illegal here.

Sure I could complain to complex but what will they do? Put a nicely worded reminder on their door. That's it. And sure I could talk to them myself but the thought of a confrontation makes me want to throw up. Plus I'm afraid my prior anger will come shining through, and that won't help anybody.

958,Everyone Sucks,"BACKGROUND: I’m currently at a 3 week long math summer camp at a university campus, where me and about 70 other students are all collectively taking classes. In a way, it’s kind of like a normal college: we go to class, eats meals in a dining hall, and go back to our dorms before curfew to sleep. Furthermore, when I learned a close friend of mine that moved away when I was in the first grade was also going to this camp, we asked the camp and we got accepted to be roommates. Also, when I came to the camp, I brought around $150 so I could buy stuff that I forgot to pack. This will be important later.

Now the actual story starts. One day after one of my classes, I come back to my dorm to drop off my stuff and go to lunch. I set my bag down and as I’m about to leave, I notice several dollar bills strewn out across my desk. I go to check my wallet, and it turns out I’m missing a $20 dollar bill (I counted my money the day before). The bills strewn out across my desk were obviously change that someone had used my $20 bill for.

I WAS LIVID. No one had came in my dorm except for my roommate, and I went to the dining hall to confront him. He said something along the lines of “oh it was a dare”, and I’m so pissed I just leave. I get back to the dorm, and just flip the entire room UPSIDE DOWN. I smash open bottles of soda onto the floor, tear the bedsheets off both beds, etc. When my roommate got back, I proceeded to flip out against him as well, shoving him into a corner and screaming at him.

Note: I know what I did here was wrong. I should’ve contacted an RA, calmed down, or something. I’m not proud of my actions.

An administrator or something heard me screaming at the top of my lungs, and opened my door to sort things out. I was given back my money, and my roommate just moved to another room. 

Now, I think some of you may think my roommate didn’t take the money. Here are my reasons why he did:

1: When the administrator came to my room, I told him that my roommate told me about that whole “it was a dare” thing. He then proceeded to completely deny saying it.

2: Only he has been in this room, with the exception of a few people. However, those were only a couple of times, and I escorted them in and out, keeping a close eye on them at all times.

3: When I confronted him, he offered to give me back the money I lost. If someone else told you that you stole their money, would you be willing to just give them free money?

Am I the asshole here?

Edit:
Wow. Thank you everyone. I really needed to hear that. I’ve been a huge asshat to people lately and that was the push that helped me to finally start sorting out my anger. Thank you all. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to manage my anger better.",16,34,0.96

I've suggested that we set it so she can only view r13 movies and TV shows (you can do that it's just annoying to do)
you set it so it needs a 4 digit code to watch any movies that are over r13. 
my parents have refused to do that, they never give me or my sister a reason.

971,META,"Rule 3: Accept your judgement. Perhaps our most abused and misunderstood rule. Let’s talk about it.

#What does ""Accept your Judgement"" mean:

Accept your judgement doesn't mean that OP has to agree with the judgement. It simply means that OP needs to understand that a judgement has been given and it's not their place to debate it here.""

#First, why do we have it? Three key reasons.

* To prevent /r/changemyview style discussions. We’re not here to debate broad views, we’re here to discuss the implications of actions. So if you’re looking for a structured environment to debate your personal philosophy, we’re not it.

* Some OPs come here for validation and don’t receive it. They’re not supposed to be buttmuches about it. While it’s perfectly fine to clarify and add new information, we’re not here for your *”Ok, but…”* or your *“OH SO I GUESS IT’S FINE IF YOU…”*. Sometimes you’re going to learn you were in fact the asshole. Don’t post here if that’s not something you’re comfortable with.

* To keep participants from getting unchecked nasty replies, or to be drawn into an unwanted debate when OP doesn't like the answer. ***It is not a metaphorical stick to beat a ‘YTA’ OP with.*** This is where the abuse comes in. We get *a lot* of folks here that think, when someone is an asshole in a situation, they shouldn’t exist beyond serving as an outlet for your frustration. This makes *you* the asshole. 

To follow rule 3, OP simply needs to keep their comments limited to clarifying, and providing new information. Questions from OP should be limited, and only for when there's genuine confusion. While it fosters a better discussion, **OP does not have to comment at all.**


#Let’s cover some dos and don’ts for everyone else.


Do | Don't
---|---
Ask questions if you’re confused (INFO tag exists for this). | Comment things like ""accept your judgement"" or ""rule 3."" Simply report it.
Upvote the answers for visibility, even when you hate it. | Report an OP you just don’t like, but who is participating within our rules.
Accept OP can participate within the context of our rules. | Report someone other than OP for rule 3 (lol, seriously?)
Report an OP that is breaking the rules ***ideally by reporting only the most recent comment.*** Reporting every single comment does not increase our visibility. It just takes time for us, and twice as much time for you. | Be uncivil because someone is not accepting their judgement. The two do not cancel each other out. Report it and walk away.

#Finally, how do we enforce rule 3?

1. We warn. Not every time. If they’re particularly egregious and/or breaking other rules (usually “be civil”) in the process, we may skip the warning.
1. We ban. Typically for 1-3 days – just enough to keep OP from engaging in the thread while its active.
1. We remove the thread. We REALLY don’t like to do this for rule 3. It’s generally reserved for OPs who pull crazy nonsense like editing their post to continue the convo, make another throwaway, etc. We like the keep the thread active so, hopefully, a calmer OP can reflect on their feedback later and reconsider.

With this in mind, one thing you could do to help us is **get into the habit of noticing when OP commented last.** Was it 5 minutes ago, just a few comments removed from the mod warning? Report that shit! Was it 7 hours ago and they haven't commented since? Then the issue has likely been resolved.",245,1997,0.97

As soon as he came in, he was visibly upset and started pacing the hallway. The place isn't in shambles or anything. Just a little messy from cats and the person currently moving out. There are three smallish bedrooms. Mine is just big enough for a queen sized bed and a large desk. After we left, I asked him why he was so upset. He avoided the question for a bit, but eventually told me the place is ""bad.""

974,Not the A-hole,"In summer 2008 I met my ex-wife. She had two boys, who were two and three years old. When she got pregnant with twins I raised these boys as my own.

In February 2018, she left, leaving the boys and my own twins in my home. As we moved through the divorce process, I kept all four kids with me. I never adopted the boys and have no legal parental rights over the boys.

In the divorce, I gained primary custody of my twins, who are now ten years old. They visit their mom every other weekend. The boys are not listed anywhere in the parenting plan.

In September of 2018, the oldest stepson, 13, bucked my authority when he didn’t like the consequences for one of his actions. His words were “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to listen to you. I want to move to my mom’s. 

I asked him to take a few weeks before he made this decision, so that the decision was not made in an emotional state. For the next three weeks I discussed with him the ramifications of the decision. I explained that his mom was living with her new boyfriend, and that he might not like the living situation when he got there. This also meant moving to a neighboring state, changing schools, friends, doctors, etc. I explained to him that in life, the decisions we make often have far-reaching consequences. During this time I made the decision that if he were to move, I wouldn’t let him move back, because I wanted to teach him that our decisions in life have repercussions. I explained to him that he couldn’t just leave there and come back when he didn’t like a situation.

He chose to move anyway, but his younger brother stayed with me.

In early June of this summer, my ex-wife informed me that she would be having her other son move in with her at the end of summer. Then, the first week of July she changed her mind and moved him up that week.

Yesterday, the oldest, now 14, called me and asked if he could move in with me. When I asked his mother she said she would be ok with that. She then proceeded to tell me the other son, who moved out against his will, also wanted to move back.

Both sons still come visit me on my weekends with the kids. I take them both on outings, backpacking, hiking, shooting, and camping. I have maintained my role of father in their life, despite all of the challenges that come with that. 

I feel like I might be the asshole because part of me doesn’t want to allow them to move back in. My house has become incredibly calm and stable since they left. The younger children are thriving. The two boys are not my biological children. Their mother has never offered any child support or financial assistance in raising them. 

TLDR; I continued to raise two boys as my own after the divorce, who were not my biological sons. Circumstances have led to them moving back to their moms. Now they’re asking me if they can come back to my house to live full time, but I’m not sure if I want to agree.",40,123,0.97

So imagine my excitement when my wife said that she wanted to take her son to the Disney World. I immediately started shaking and laughing, as I've always wanted to visit. However, when I asked her ""so when are we gonna go? I need to check if it's okay with work."" She looked at me kind of seriously and said ""What do you mean?"" I was confused and didn't know what to say so there was bit of an awkward silence, until she broke it by saying ""Oh, you wanted to come too?"" I felt like being punched in the stomach, and there was another awkward silence. She explained that she used all our miles for them and her ex, and there wasn't enough left for me.

They both are super nice to me considering I must be a bit of a burden, altho sometimes I feel like the husband (call him ""Nathan"") tries to subtly flirt with me, which is inappropriate of course.

Shortly after I moved in I kinda thought pairs of my panties were going missing a lot, but at first I figured they were just getting lost in the wash(?).   Also sometimes it would seem like someone had been in my room and in my drawers, although my sister was just coming in to cleaning/ put stuff away?  After all its her house.

Then I bought like 4 pair of new undies and almost immediately the \~sexiest ones vanished right after I wore them. Little black lace ones. I thought that was so odd that I scoured the wash/ house and they weren't anywhere.  I asked my sister (as casually as I could)  if some of my underwear ended up in her drawer by accident but we checked and they weren't there.

So .. here we go.  On Saturday when my sister and ""Nathan"" are gone for the day I can't find my phone charger. I text my sister and ask to borrow one.  She says ""Nathan"" had it last but he's not sure where it is, I should look around.  I search all over the house, still can't find the charger.  Then I see his work bag, open it up and find the charger, along with my black panties, stuffed way at the bottom.  Am horrified.

On the one hand maybe I should let this go.  It could ruin their marriage.  Try to move out as soon as possible, etc.  On the other, maybe my sister has a right to know that her husband is a perv.  Honestly I don't know what the right course of action is here.  WIBTA for telling her??

Update: Hi everyone, thanks for your help. I'm a little overwhelmed by this post rn if I don't answer everyone, I'm getting a lot of conflicting advice here.  I have decided that I need to tell my sister but I haven't done it yet bc he has been around etc. Also my friend and I did search my room for cameras and I didn't find any. The panties he took are still in his bag, I didn't want to touch them.

&#x200B;

Update 2: I just told my sister. I was actually in the middle of making plans with my friend to set up a camera etc like a lot of people here suggested (her bf has a GoPro) but all of a sudden I just couldn't take the pressure anymore and ""Nathan"" wasn't around so I told her the whole story. I said that as far as I know my panties are still in his work bag (he has it with him).  I didn't say that he stole them, just that they vanished in the wash and turned up in his bag and I didn't know how they got there or what that meant.

At first she almost shrugged it off, like ""no big deal, who knows how they ended up in his bag,"" but then (I guess after she thought about it?) she started asking me questions, like when did I last see/ wear that pair of panties, etc. And I told her that other pairs have gone missing (as she knows) and that I felt like someone had been in my room. She said she never goes in my room and definitely not my underwear drawer, that would be weird, etc.

I guess I would describe the mood right now as tense? She doesn't seem to be blaming me but at the same time I don't think she's ready to believe that ""Nathan"" would steal her sister's underwear. I don't know if she's gonna confront him tonight or not, it seems like she wants to think about it first?",438,2203,0.97
979,Not the A-hole,"I work at a car dealership and a couple of us were gathered at the receptionists desk talking about how one of our co-workers got engaged this past weekend.  Everyone was kinda surprised at how quickly it happened, they have only been dating for about 2 months but I'm very happy for him.  So a couple people were talking about how long they dated and so forth before getting married and whatnot.  So I had said that my fiancee' and I dated for three years before I proposed and that we have been engaged for almost year and that we are getting married in October, to which the receptionist replied, ""That's gonna be a mistake.""  So I asked why and she said multiple reasons to which I asked like what and she then tried bringing our sex life into it and that she wouldn't buy me lunch when I was very low on money and that because we're too young.  I'm 23 and shes 22, soon to be 23, we live in our own house, have bought both of our cars on our own.

982,Not the A-hole,"My eldest daughter (17) recently got her first part-time job. I wasn’t overly involved with the process; I know she was out applying to a lot of places throughout the summer at my wife’s urging. She started a couple of weeks ago at the local grocery store where lots of the kids do, and she seemed to be liking it.

Then the other night, I come home and my wife & daughter were arguing. The basic gist was that my wife had given my daughter awful advice and set up my daughter to really embarrass herself. I asked what was wrong and my daughter explained that my wife had told her that she would be able to pick her own hours at work, along with her own days. I asked what she had told the job when she applied and she said she gave them open availability. I told her there was no way she could expect that then and she said that she didn’t know that, but her mom told her to do that and then she’d be able to pick her shifts. Despite the store never telling her that. My wife, for the record, has never worked in retail. So, I have no clue where she got this information.

I calmed my daughter down and told her what to expect, realistically. I told her that she had made a commitment and that this would only be for a few weeks until school started, she’d be fine. She settled down and left the room. I then asked my wife, what the hell she was thinking. She said she just assumed that’s how it worked. I asked how the hell she’d assume that. I pressed on what my daughter exactly did to “embarrass herself” and my wife said that she had suggested my daughter go in and ask to change her schedule, despite just starting and for no reason outside “she just doesn’t want to work those days”.

I was further flabbergasted and told my wife to stop giving my daughter work advice here. My wife said that was a dick move and I can’t say that. I told her that she’s gonna get our daughter fired with these demands and entitlement.

983,Everyone Sucks,"  

I live with 2 guys my age in a 3 BR 2 BA apartment. I was friends with one (P) before we moved out here and the other was a friend of P (T). Before agreeing to live together I talked with P and he said they were pretty clean.

After 2 weeks I realize we have VERY different standards for cleanliness. I not a neat-freak but good lord they were gross. At first cleaned up after them, but once it became routine I spoke up and told them to clean up their own messes. They never did and I was left cleaning.

On Thursday I come home and go to the bathroom, but the toilet was to the brim with murky brown water and big doodoo chunks. We have 2 bathrooms. P uses one and T and I use the other. I come out and theyre watching TV. I asked “Who fucked the toilet?” knowing full well it was T. Neither of them say anything. “T I know it was you, can you go clean it up? Its nasty and I need to go” T says “Are you serious?” I respond “What? Its your mess.” He goes “Are you really shit-shaming me? Everyone is fucking ashamed of when they take a shit. Yeah ok I clogged the toilet. MY. BAD. That doesnt give you any right to go and talk about me shitting to the whole world”

Im lost and answer “Ok… but are you going to clean up the toilet or…?” T says “Dont know how” Even more lost I ask “Dont know how to clean or dont know how to use a plunger?” He yells “Dude not everyone is a fucking mechanical engineer and knows how everything works” I answered “You dont need to be a M.E. to push your shit down a tube” At this point P joins in and says “If you care so much why dont you just clean it up?” I answer “There’s no way Im cleaning up someone elses turds, this is on T”

Come Saturday the toilet is still clogged. Im refusing to cave because Ive been caving and cleaning their messes ever since we moved in. No chance I let them win this round. I decide to teach T a lesson and show him that his messes arent going to just “go away” by literally shaming him with his own shit. While they were out Saturday night I rigged the bathroom. I aimed an IR sensor at the door and mounted a servo to the back of the toilet with a cable snaking into the well and tied to the water feed plunger so that when T opened the bathroom door the servo would pull on the cable, open the plunger and allow water to feed into the bowl which, already completely full, would overflow onto the floor covering his feet in his own soggy, neglected shit.

That night T brought a girl home from the bar. I didnt know this until I heard the scream. She was the first one to go into the bathroom and tripped the trap. T came running out and I could hear him completely panicking. The girl grabbed her stuff and took off. I came out and T was still freaking out and I said “Shoulda just cleaned it up” And then went back into my room.

T cleaned up the mess and it reeks in the apartment but they didnt know I had anything to do with what happened. So Reddit AITA for “shit-shaming” my roommate?",233,1267,0.95
984,Not the A-hole,"My roommate has Asperger's and honestly I had no idea what that was until I met him. He seemed normal to me. Had he not mentioned having high functioning autism, I would have been none the wiser in our first meeting. Anyway, we've been renting a townhouse together for almost 2 months now and it's become a nightmare. My roommate--who I'll refer to as Allen--is remarkably particular about where things go. For example, everything must be put back **exactly** where it was taken from. If something isn't where it's supposed to be, I've seen Allen take everything out (dishes, cups, eating utensils) and rearrange the entire kitchen again until everything is back where it's supposed to be according to him.

This obsession isn't restricted to the kitchen. It extends everywhere except my room, because he isn't allowed in there. Allen doesn't confront me if he finds something out of place. We've never argued about it, but I can tell it's frustrating for him. He has a meltdown each time he finds something not in its exact place. By meltdown, what he does is he covers his face with his hands and will wail for several minutes while rocking back and forth. Once he calms down, he's fine and will just fix whatever he found wrong.

I've tried to accommodate Allen, but it's just too much work. I have to remember that the sofa needs a pillow at each end, that I can't put two pillows together on one end. The bar stools have to be spaced apart evenly. The mugs have to all face the same direction on the coffee mug rack. I've mentioned it before to Allen, and all he could really explain to me is that his mind works a particular way. He likes things to be a particular way and if they're not, then he can't stop thinking about it until it's fixed.

I tried to get out of my lease and was told by the property manager it was impossible. But I can't continue to stay here and walk on eggshells. Sometimes I just want to come home after a long day and kick off my shoes (instead of arranging them neatly on the shoe rack) but I know if I do that, Allen will have a meltdown when he sees it. I'm not a messy person by any means and do tidy up after myself, but living up to Allen's standards of organization is beyond me. It's exhausting and makes being home uncomfortable. WIBTA if I stop accommodating Allen and just live like a normal 26-year-old guy?",116,98,0.94
985,Not the A-hole,"For reference: I am a 16-year old Male. My sisters are 15, 12, and 11, respectively. My Mom is 51, and my Dad is 49. As well, for the sake of this post, I'm gonna let you know I support the LGBTQ community if that's what you're into. You do you.

Judgement Part: In sexuality, I would describe myself as a straight male. I am sexually attracted to women, and always have been. The problem here that I'm having comes from my sisters, who constantly insist I'm either Bi or Gay, despite me having 2 girlfriends, (One when I was 10, the other when I was 14) and constantly trying to find ""evidence"" that I could be gay through smaller things, such as the way I dress (I usually wear black and white) or designs I make (Made a rainbow design on something, and that somehow links to me coming out), even though I'm not gay in any way. I have also talked to them in private to stop calling me gay or bi on several occasions, which results in them calling me homophobic and the such for some time.

This leads to my situation today, where me and the family are in our car out on a road trip. I am relaxed on my phone, eating chips, minding my own business. Things are going good. Well, that was until my sisters once again pulled me into their convo. related to sexuality, where they asked me personally asked me my stance on sexuality/LGBTQ, where I said, ""I'm fine with whatever you guys want to do in that case, I'll still support you because your sexuality dosen't really matter to me.""

After my reply, my youngest sister (who I have told the most overall to stop insisting I was Gay or Bi) injected into this, asking if ""I was coming out"", to which I told her again that I am straight, but I still support LGBTQ.

Then, seemingly not satisfied, she told that ""I should pretend for a while that I'm gay, so that way I can get into girl's sleepovers and dress better than I do.""

From there, I kinda got mad at her, and told her directly to stop insisting I was a ""pansy"" and that I don't want to fake my sexuality for the sake of getting a social group's attention, and that I have told all 3 of them several times in the past that I was heterosexual, and to drop the idea that I was gay when I clearly wasn't.

Both my Parents seemed to agree on me with this, and asked my siblings to stop harping on me on this matter, since I also told them recently about my sisters nagging me about sexual attraction matters constantly. From there, the car ride was silent.

As of now, all 3 of my sisters refuse to talk to me, and are now constantly trash-talking me behind my back. My Parents still seem to agree with me on my stance, saying that ""You can be straight and still support the LGBT community, which is what you are doing.""

So, am I the asshole for growing fed up with the behavior of my siblings regarding me being straight?

UPDATE: Based on the feedback gained here, I'm going to see if I can forgive my sisters, but also set some clear boundaries for them with me. As well, I'll see over time how some of the techniques you people came up with here go. Thank you all for the advice!",52,112,0.88
986,Not the A-hole,"I work at a coffee shop. About a month ago a woman came in and ordered a latte. She asked that we add a pack of Sweet & Low (S&L), but we dont carry that particular sweetener. I politely told her that and asked if she would like a different one. She said no she wanted S&L. I apologized again and asked if she still wanted the latte without it. She said yes. 

So she got her latte and headed to the other side of the bar and stared at the sweeteners. I was cleaning the bar and she asked why we didnt carry S&L. I told her we carry a number of other sweeteners and dont get enough requests for S&L to justify the cost. She replied with ""Well Im going to have all of my friends come in and ask for it so you have to get it"". I told her I would mention it to the owner, but I could almost guarantee that it wouldnt happen.

I asked the owner and like I thought she said no. Now this woman comes in at least twice a week and every time she requests a latte with S&L. We always tell her we dont have it and she just says ok and takes the plain latte.

Today she came in and did it again and when I told her we dont have it she said, ""I know. Im just going to keep asking until you get it"".

989,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a couple of weekends ago and it's bothering me, so I'd like you wonderful internet strangers to set me right.

We had a friendly get together that weekend and one of my friends is pregnant. Jason (my friend, fake name) who is on his way to becoming a doctor did the math and realized that Catherine was pregnant over the holidays while she was drinking and Catherine said that she didn't know she was pregnant at the time. He started going at how if her and her husband we trying, she should not have been drinking and how irresponsible it is to drink to the point where she started crying. Catherine tried to explain to him that she didn't know and that they were trying for 2 years but she couldn't just abstain from drinking until they eventually got pregnant (if they ever did).

My husband and I have been trying for 11 months (no-one knows) and I stopped drinking, gave up eating certain foods and was very careful with my body for the first three months but giving up certain aspects of your life in hopes of something that may or may not happen is very taxing mentally, it just leads to a lot more sadness when you find out you're not pregnant month after month, so I totally understood where she came from. During the holidays she would have been maybe a month along AT MOST (maybe a couple of weeks). I told Jason that he's being an asshole because a lot of women drink while trying and some drink in early pregnancy because they don't know that they are. I even explained I had a friend drink for the first 3 months of her pregnancy because she didn't know and was still getting her periods, it happens. Most of the group starting turning on us and saying that it's ridiculously stupid to say such a thing, and that I probably should try to have a baby until I can give up the little things in life.

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I was in no way advocating for women to drink while pregnant. When you're trying to get pregnant and it doesn't happen right away, a lot of doctors (including mine) say to just live life normally until you know you are pregnant.

995,Not the A-hole,"My husband’s family and I have had some cultural difference issues in the past. I try to stay out of them as best as I can, until they involve my kids (I have a son who is 4 and a daughter who is 3 months old). I’m good with them spoiling the kids and all that fun stuff, but I’ve put my foot down on the certain aspects of say “Women are to serve the men” (which my husband does not agree with and we do not do in our home, so he doesn’t want our kids being raised with this) and other things of this aspect. A lot of these cultural aspects, I refer to my husband. If they’re important to him, we do them. And he’s never wanted to do anything that would be harmful to myself or our kids. Most of his culture is amazing, and our children are being raised in it. I’m not against it at all. There are just certain aspects of it that both my husband and I don’t agree with, since they are dated.

One tiny thing that came about when I had a daughter, was ear piercing. It’s a big deal in my husband’s culture that the baby girls get their ears pierced pretty much at birth. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I know they won’t remember it and wasn’t so much the pain aspect, but moreso I wanted her to be able to decide. Yes, the holes close up, but I’d rather her get to decide when or if she pierces them, when she’s older. I told my mother-in-law this, every time she pestered me (pretty much from the time I was post-labor and she came to visit me in the hospital). My husband agreed with me. Now, mother-in-law has watched our kids a handful of times since she was born and daughter never came back with earrings, so I assumed we were safe and that maybe she was respecting our parenting.

Then last weekend, we went out to run a few errands kid free. Mother-in-law kept them out a bit later and when she returned….my daughter had pierced ears. She said she had my sister-in-law (husband’s sister) do them. She’s done them for all the babies in the family and it was tradition. I was pissed. I felt so violated, took my kids and told her to leave. My husband was equally as pissed and they argued outside, in their native language, for quite a bit, before mother-in-law left.

I’ve since decided I don’t want mother-in-law alone with the kids. I’m not banning her from them, period, but she’s not going to be able to babysit anymore. My husband is on the fence, but says he’ll back me up either way. As soon a its safe to, I’m removing the earrings. My husband’s family is saying I’m being so disrespectful and I’ve said that I just don’t trust her, since she’s contiously disrespected my parenting.

This dog was an absolute gift to the world and I loved them unconditionally. They were 16 though and had countless medical problems (rotated front legs which prevented them from getting up, jumping up, being moved, just completely unable to walk among other things). This dog was in CONSTANT agony. Every time the dog tried to get up he would be screaming in pain. There's nothing the vets can do.

I don't take them in the street, or in formal settings. But if I'm in the car with just my bf, or with my own family (funnily enough every member of my family has pain conditions, mental health issues etc) then I don't see the harm in taking two tablets.

The other day I was at my bfs mums. I was in a lot of pain and was waiting for her to leave the kitchen so I could take them privately. After a while i asked her if I could get a drink and took 2 painkillers. She asked if I had a headache and i said no. I told her i had TMD, and when she asked what that was I said it's to do with my jaw and causes me pain.

She seemed uncomfortable, or disapproving and said i was destroying my kidneys and liver. That I should try something else. I said I'd tried cbd oil and massages helped, but without painkillers I'm in a lot of pain. I said it wasn't a long term plan, but for now that's what I have to do.

My bf overheard some of it and wasn't happy. He expects me to not do it in the car, which I've since stopped and respected that. He thinks it's weird and I should never take them in front of people.

1001,Not the A-hole,"A week or so ago I was up at night in a robe and took a series of photos of myself. They ranged from barely covered to nude, and I sent them to my boyfriend. He was not as a receptive as I expected, but I was fine with that. I thought I looked really good in one of the ones that I was mostly covered in, and so I posted it to my public ig account. My boyfriend ask me to take down the ""slutty"" post and I did, and we did not talk about it so I did not think much of it.

About two days later, I went out with my friends and one of them took a photo of my outfit from the neck down. I was wearing a white shirt that I borrowed from my boyfriend (that I really liked because of the logo over the left chest area) tucked into cutoff shorts. I posted it in a series of photos of me and my friends. He was enraged and said that my boobs were bulging out of the shirt. I got mad at him in return, thinking that the photo was benign. Looking at it now, I do think it was mildly suggestive, but that was not my intention. I told him that I did not like to be treated as property, and he replied that my social media indicated otherwise. He said he felt disrespected and betrayed, and that he was repulsed and extremely turned off by me. I apologized over and over and he said that we should take a break, as he still feels love for me despite his other emotions.

1002,Everyone Sucks,"I am taking a few courses at my college this summer, to help lighten the load come fall. This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.)

He’s really mad at me claiming I’m selfish. 

AITA?


edit: after reading your guys responses I think honestly it’s a really shitty situation and ESH because it was my pillow that I bought and he made fun of but on the other hand (a few of you guys pointed this out) he is my father and he did pay for the trip so the right thing would of in theory been to give it to him.",26,62,0.89
1004,Not the A-hole,"Let's call my best friend of several years Edward. Since he was a guy and I was a girl, everyone had always shipped us as a couple. Out the blue, Edward asked me out over text. We dated for several months. We were having a lot of fun together, and I thought things were going great.

Again out of the blue, he broke up with me. I was given no explanation why. I felt really betrayed by someone who was one of the most important people to me. Edward avoided me as much as he could. (We still had to work together every day as partners in some classes and especially as teammates in a club.) He left our normal friend group and joined another. He wouldn't talk to our mutual friends and teammates about the situation.

A couple weeks later, I started hearing the rumors and stories that Edward was gay. Then some of our mutual friends starting talking to me about our breakup in defense of him even though I was very upset and just didn't want to talk about him. ""He really liked you as a person but wasn't attracted to you."" ""This was his last shot at pretending to be straight."" ""He was just trying to be accepted."" My friend group split up from arguing over whether or no he was in the wrong.

I felt used. I was his way of confirming he was gay. I was his mask to hide behind for a few months.

Months later, he's now fairly open about being gay. But after all this time, he still never directly told me he was gay. I never got the truth. The only thing he's said about our relationship is that he was happy it happened. But I'm not. I don't think it was right for him to use me like that. I'm not glad that it split up our entire friend group. After everything, I'm saddest about losing him as my best friend.

Some of our old mutual friends blame me for our friend group splitting. I wasn't even in any of the arguments between them about whether Edward was in the wrong. I was a bit busy at the time crying and just being sad. But they say that if I was just more supportive of him coming out everything with our friends would have been fine. (Again, he never even came out to me.) If I was more accepting and happy about the situation apparently everything would have been just perfect.

I'm happy that Edward feels like he can be himself now. I really am. But I can't go back to being friends with him like we were before.  I'm not even sure what I could've done to be more supportive but enough people are still telling me I wasn't supportive enough that there must have been something I'm missing. AITA for not being supportive enough of my (used to be) best friend coming out?

&#x200B;

tl;dr My best friend of a long time asked me out. After a while he broke up with me with no explanation and broke contact as much as possible. A couple weeks later he started coming out to people as gay. A lot of people say I'm being unreasonable for being upset and that I'm not being supportive enough of him coming out. My entire friend group split up taking sides over what some claim is my fault. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: He has since then said (multiple times in group settings) that he knew he was gay since he was 12. We have still not discussed our relationship with only the two of us beyond what I have already written.

Edit 2: I tried to talk about our relationship with him many times. He refused to and avoided me (eg sitting away in class and lunch, not showing up to club meetings, switching his normal routes in the halls).",53,106,0.89

1006,Asshole,"Throwaway for privacy purposes. So here’s the situation.

My wife and I have been together ten years, married since October. I love her and she is wonderful and we are each other’s best friends, and we fight very little. We are both 31 and not kids in this endeavor.

In January, we miscarried our first attempt at having a baby. It was very sad for both of us, but my wife took it very hard. Now the present, we are 14 weeks pregnant and around 8 weeks (one week past our previous miscarriage and with a strong heartbeat), she bought a pregnancy book/baby planner and started filling it out. She stated that she wanted me to fill it out as well, because she wanted baby to be able to look back when he or she is older and see how excited we were for their arrival. I wrote a little bit in it, but then put it off and did not write more, despite her bugging me about it. I knew the oncoming storm of telling her I didn’t want to do it, and wanted to avoid it as long as possible

The other day, she confronted me and stated the fact that after weeks of her bugging me and I still had not even touched the book, she took my actions very personally and was starting to get upset about it. I told her honestly that it was just not something I wanted to do, I didn’t think it was necessary and honestly a bit pointless. I told her that if she wanted to write in it that was fine but I should not be forced to.

She stated that when she was a teenager, she found her own mother’s pregnancy book and it made her happy that she was so loved even before she was born, but that it made her a bit sad that her dad had not been a part of it. She wanted baby to have the experience of knowing both their parents were excited enough to write in it.

She is a history buff, so she is interested in that kind of stuff — I’m not, and told her this and that I never would have given a crap about the book if I had found it, so why would our kid? She countered that baby is half her, so he or she has a 50% chance of wanting to see it.

So now we are at an impasse. I conceded and said I would fill it out, but then since she is a woman and hormonal she immediately said forget about it and that she “won’t force me to do something that I CLEARLY don’t want to do.” So now I’m still the bad guy.

So, Reddit, you’re always honest with me. Am I the asshole for not wanting or caring about this pregnancy book, and not wanting to fill it out? I do understand it’s something she may need to do — she has confided in me about how scared she is about another miscarriage and I think maybe this is her way of staying connected with the baby and getting herself through the pregnancy. But I don’t see why I have to do it, too. It’s her thing.

Tl;dr : my wife is filling out a pregnancy/baby book and wants me to write in it too, but I don’t want to and tell her as such. Am I the asshole?

Edit: the “woman and hormonal” words were actually ones my wife has been using lately, however I can now see that while it is totally okay for her to say it, it makes me look like a  misogynistic* dick. Should’ve worded it differently.",216,320,0.87

She was definitely very attractive, and I wanted to approach her, but it was a higher-end restaurant and she was with a group of her friends.

Before we left (her group had started eating later than us) I saw her on her iPhone and sent her a note with my phone number over airdrop. Luckily, no one else was using their phones.

I saw her look down, then smile, and I felt very pleased with myself. I told my (F) friend what happened after we left and she got kind of angry with me. She said I was being a creepy douchebag.

I thought it was respectful, since I didn’t put any pressure on her and she could decide whether or not to text me of her own free will. I do want to know if this is douchey, though, so I’ll know not to do it again.

1009,Not the A-hole,"Some side info: My sister has two children (4yo, 2yo) and is married. For the last 2 years the barely made it to the end of the month and all of the family know they struggle finacially. Me and my partner are doing well financially and have no kids.

Two weeks ago my sister called me and asked me to come visit her, since there was something very important she needed to tell me. When I arrived she immediatly broke down crying, telling me how she was pregnant again and she ""doesn't know what to do"". She didn't even tell her husband at that point and I was very surprised to be the first person to know, since we're not really close.

Anyway she continued saying that they don't have the means to support another child with all the debt they already deal with. I tried to calm her as much as I could, saying that there will sure be some solution to handle the situation. After a while she told me she looked up how much abortions cost and that even if she wanted to, she could not pay for it at the time.

So I basically offered that if she decides to abort, I would take care of all medical bills coming from that procedure. She asked me if I could afford that, so I told her she does not have to worry. Since I don't use up all my money every month, I'm usually able to put some into savings and it was okay for me to put 2 of my mothly savings into her procedure, if she decides to have it.

She thanked me and told me that she needs time to think about it.

Four days later she asked me to come visit again when her husband is home, so we could discuss how to go about it. I drove there at the same evening. They greeted me and her husband told me that he's really happy that I decided to help them in a tough time like that. She told me how she thought about what I said and she wanted to ""accept my offer"". However she didn't want the abortion but suggested that I should give them the money for the abortion as well as ""a little bit very month since I don't spend all my money anyway"". I was pretty much bewildered. I did not offer that. I told them straight forward that I will only give them money for the procedure, but won't be financially supporting them in any other way. Her husband blew up, telling me I'm an asshole for ""wanting to pay to kill his child but not supporting them to make it live a good life instead"".

I was overwhelmed by the situation and left immediatly after.

My sister texted me the following days relentlessly about how I don't love her if I don't support her decision and how I'm forcing her into the abortion.

They also told the rest of the family which are also firm to believe I'm a massive asshole in the situation, because I don't need ""all that money to live and I could easily support them"".

1011,Not the A-hole,"I’m a nanny by profession. When I applied for this position, the ad said no tattoos. Now, I did take this as no “visible tattoos”, as I have worked in places (pre-nanny) with that policy and it’s been the same thing. I have a tattoo on my upper thigh that is not visible unless I’m naked, wearing short shorts or a swimsuit. Therefore, I did not think to disclose it, when I went for the interview because it wasn’t necessary. I wear sundresses, board shorts, jeans or leggings with a long t-shirt when I nanny, so this has never been an issue, until last week.

It’s getting hotter and the mom was working from home. She had asked me the day before if I would help her on Friday to take the kiddos to the community pool and I agreed. I also brought my swimsuit, not even thinking about it because it’s been 6 months, so I could swim with the kids and keep an eye on them. Everyone got changed there. Like I said, I wasn’t even thinking about it when suddenly the 5-year-old said “Oooo Jessie wrote on herself! She’s gonna get in trouble!” (Because they get in trouble if they do.)

I look down and realize, my tattoo. Now, it’s nothing profane. It’s just an anchor, with a date underneath it, to represent a special time in my life. My boss, of course overheard this, looked, but didn’t say anything at first. From the look at on her face, though, I knew we’d be talking later. Sure enough, after the kids went to bed that night, we had a long talk. She said I had purposefully deceived her, that I should have been up front and honest about the tattoo when she asked about it. I tried to explain that I assumed the ad meant visible ones and she said, well clearly, it’s visible at the pool. Since they didn’t have a pool, I never thought this would happen. I apologized profusely for it, and she said she would talk to her husband about the future of my employment.

I showed up to work today and things have been frosty. They left me alone with the kids, but barely said a word. I know they’re conservative people, so tattoos and extra piercings outside the standard two in the ear are a no-no for themselves and their kids, and I respect their beliefs. I feel bad. Should I have disclosed it? Am I an ass for not doing so?

&#x200B;

Update: So, thank you all for the feedback. When they got home today and I put the kids to bed, we all sat down. I explained my side, including what the tattoo meant and that I assumed the ad meant visible tattoos only. However, I said that was no excuse. I apologized and said from the start, I should have told them and been honest.

They said they appreciated it. They had talked about it a lot this weekend and it was more than the tattoo. They were very happy with my work and would give me a good reference going forward, along with 2 weeks pay, but they would have to let me go. They wouldn’t include this in the reference (obviously), but they just felt like they couldn’t trust me. Overall, they said if I had just told them, it would’ve been fine, as long as I kept it covered up. It was the fact that I never said anything and accepted the job.

I feel so stupid and terrible. I really fucked up. But, I’ll be able to find a new job and I’ve learned.",568,1885,0.97
1012,Not the A-hole,"You know those ""don't worry ladies, I'm still single"" t-shirts that little boys wear sometimes? So my MIL made one for my son when he was a baby (she has one of those machines that you can embroider letters with). He barely wore it simply because putting a baby in a t-shirt is a nightmare; he wore it to visit her and that was it. By the time he was easier to dress it didn't fit anymore.  

Daughter is three, almost four. MIL made a dress for her that says ""come on boys, I'm single"" and I cannot bring myself to put my kid in it. It was one thing with the baby because he was a baby but she's old enough to walk, talk, dress herself, she just feels too old for this to be cute? It seems creepy to me. Especially the wording

Doesn't help MIL gave her the dress during a ""grandma date"" and she came home in it. So daughter loves it and obviously doesn't understand why I don't want her wearing it. 

Don't want to hurt MILs feelings, but I kinda wanna let the dress ""go missing"" when we travel in a few weeks. MIL buys my kids new clothes whenever she finds something with a good price: we've always appreciated this because it's helpful, and I do my best to make sure the kids wear whatever she bought them next time we see her (we see my in-laws a few times a week) and I don't want to be ungrateful, especially since she made this. 

Husband agrees it's weird but doesn't want to hurt his mom's feelings and says to just let her wear the dress when we go to his parents for dinner and no where else. But I just don't feel right about that. I told him my idea about ""losing"" it while traveling since we always manage to lose something in hotels and he said it felt wrong to lie but that it also wasn't a bad idea. 

Is this an instance where a white lie is appropriate? Or WIBTA?

Edit: probably should mention this is the family tradition she's started. She's made all of her grandkids one of these ""I'm single"" things. Usually t-shirts and onesies for babies she gives at the baby showers, my daughter is the only one who got a dress past the age of 1. So husband doesn't wanna rock the boat with all of his siblings since this has gone on for like 10+ grandkids

My daughter was my second kid born at the same time as my SIL's first (gave birth a week apart) so I didn't have a baby shower so people could focus on her. I thought my MIL forgot that my girl never got her homemade Gramdma gift (this is the only time she makes them homemade clothes since shes got so many grandkids) but rest assured...Ruth never forgets

Edit II: She wouldn't make a new one. These are one and done gifts, a few other kids have ruined theirs over the years and all she cares is that it's fair and they each get one.",282,1262,0.97
1013,Not the A-hole,"Basically, here’s what it boils down to - my family refuses to stop giving excessive gifts to our kids despite my wife and I asking for years for them to stop. My wife and I have been dealing with this since our wedding 9 years ago when they went way over the top with gifts. Every birthday and Christmas they get absolutely crazy with the gifts and give way too many. They even buy an excessive amount of gifts for holidays we don’t celebrate, like Easter. They buy gifts for valentines day, Halloween, 4th of July, etc… They don’t even buy meaningful things, it’s mostly just junk they get on the clearance isle at Wal-mart or something from the dollar store (the kinds of toys that you can play with for about 30 seconds and then they break).

My wife and I have had enough and we’ve had multiple conversations with them about this, but they just come back with telling us that we’re taking away their joy. They tell us “I’m sorry, but I just had to buy this for the kids.” They say things like “Oh great, more rules.” We aren’t setting this boundary to be mean, it’s because we don’t want our kids growing up having an unhealthy attachment to “things” and thinking that some new toy or item is going to make them happy. As you can imagine, I grew up with this and it took me a lot of years to undo the selfishness that comes from growing up getting everything I wanted because my mom couldn’t say no.

Anyway, this Easter was the last straw. They did a fun easter egg hunt (which the kids loved), but they also just threw tons of toys out in the yard for the kids to find (kites, waterguns, sidewalk chalk, bubbles, etc…). They also gave the kids a bunch of money because they knew they were saving up for something and they wanted them to be able to buy whatever they were saving for. This was too much and completely undermined what we were trying to teach our kids about saving money and financial responsibility. 

After all of this and many conversations with my wife, we gave them a chart of how many toys they could buy the kids at each holiday and we told them that we didn’t trust them to help teach these values to our kids, so we’d be taking away all unsupervised time. As you can imagine, this has turned into a clusterfuck shitstorm and my family is being super angry and manipulative. I won’t go into the details, but it’s been bad.

So, AITA? Did we go too far here? I could really use some unbiased input here, because this has been an emotional rollercoaster and I’m hoping you guys can help be my compass. Please let me know if more information is needed. I didn’t want the post to get too long.

Edit: For everyone saying that we could just donate the extra toys, we've tried. We used the opportunity to teach the kids about donating to the less fortunate. The problem then starts to become an issue of my wife and I being the ""bad guy."" This is because it allows my family to continue to give tons of gifts, and then we have to be the ""bad guys"" and tell them they can't keep them all. In our experience, this approach doesn't solve the problem, it's just a band-aid to avoid conflict and keep the peace.",40,51,0.86

1017,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a week ago, and it has resulted in a major power struggle/ dick-swinging contest in my family.

I promise this isn’t a validation post. I hope it comes off as one, because that would make me right, but most of the people I’ve talked to disagree with me.

I am 16M, and thus live with my parents and siblings.

My entire family is Catholic, but not insanely religious (they aren’t THOSE Catholics). However, they care enough to go to church every week, pray before every meal, and say cheesy phrases like, “God is always watching,” or “God has a plan for us all,” and shit like that. 

A few years ago I told them I was an atheist. I’ve always been one, but only decided to bite the bullet then. At first they thought I was just saying that to get out of going to church since I’ve always expressed my hatred for it, but now they realize it’s the truth.

Officially they’re “okay with it,” but they sort of passive-aggressively try to make sure I can never escape. For instance, we go out to eat as a family on Sunday nights, so in an effort to make sure I attend church, they’ve switched from attending morning mass, to attending evening services, and then driving straight to dinner. I don’t really mind that much because it’s only an hour of my day, I don’t have to even listen to anything the priest says, and they spend money on a nice dinner for me. I can appreciate that even though I’m a dirty heathen damned to hell.

Well, on this particular day, it wasn’t Sunday, it was a Tuesday, so not our normal day to go to church. My dad comes up to me and says, “Hey we are going to church to help out with the food drive.” Our church occasionally has events like that, and I’ve gone to them before in order to get service hours and whatever, so I didn’t think anything of it. I said sure, under the impression I was going to a charity event that I could get credit for.

This is where things get interesting. We show up, and walk into the main service room, which is odd because most events are done in another big open room. We sit down, and some random guy starts talking on a microphone. It turns out it was a speech about an atheist who “found God” and converted back to being a christian.

I was pretty angry, I sat there for a few minuets planning exactly what I was going to say. I LOVE to make my words sting when I’m mad. It’s petty, yes, and disrespectful, so this is why people tell me I’m in the wrong. 

“Really? You thought this would work? You seriously lied to me in order pull this desperate attempt at converting me?” Then, what I said next was more than a little disrespectful, I admit, but I said, “Stop trying to push your bullshit religion on me that I don’t want or need in my life. I don’t want to be a part of your retarded fantasy book club.” They told me to sit down, and that we were “here as a family,” and that I need to be, “open minded,” and shit.

A ring that I couldnt return and I was too bummed to sell at first then had trouble selling at the original price and then kind of...left...in my safe. Tbh I kind of forgot thay I had it.

Well, now I am with *the one* and she has incredibly similar taste to my ex. So much so that when she showed me the type of rings she liked (antique style) they were all similar to the ring I had, even having some qualities she said those rings from pictures *missed*

So I figured....I have an expensive ring... that I have trouble selling... it is exactly in her style...why not tale adventage

I mean.... at first I felt lucky since I wouldnt have to actually look for a perfect ring.

I proposed and she LOVED the ring, I mean she was overjoyed. She kept going how ""i knew her so well"" and what not.

And then all hell broke lose when she saw an old facebook picture of my ex...with me...with the ring on her finger...with ""we got engaged!!!!"" Caption.

During that fight I had a ring thrown at my face for the second time in my life (though she thankfully didnt break our engagement). She basically asked how I would feel if she gave me her exes ""hand-me-downs"", but i dont think that is fair since clothes dont usually cost 5k. Plus her taste is so similar she would get a similar ring anyway, so why not this one

So, AITA?

EDIT: so uh, i dont think i need to wait for the official verdict to see I was being an dumbass. But I thought I will at least share the good news: we talked when she cooled off, she said I shouldve at least told her before hand, I apologised a thousand times and finally we reached the conclusion that the ring has to go but we can reuse the stone and put it in a custom ring.

Backstory: Last year, my grandpa died, and left his affairs to my aunt with explicit directions on how to divide assets etc.

We're getting married in April next year, and have sent out our Save the Dates already. We're having a large wedding, so extended family and friends are invited. My aunt and uncle have always been a constant in my life, and have always been supportive and outgoing. It was a no-brainer they'd be invited.

My mum tells me yesterday that she now owes them money because of how the assets from my grandpa's stuff is to be split, and that if she doesn't pay, they'll be suing her for it. My fiancee and I were out of town, so over facetime, she told us that ""If they're going to the wedding, I can't be there"", and ""this should be an easy choice for you to choose your mum over them"".

I told her that I loved her, and that as my mum, I needed her to be at the wedding. I also went on to say that my aunt and uncle have had a formative role in my childhood and adulthood, and I want them to also be there. We offered to seat them separately, but she was upset and calling us selfish for not offering to uninvite them.

1020,Not the A-hole,"I’m [26F]  currently pregnant for the second time (yay!) I have a daughter, 3F.

For my baby shower, I decided to include a gender reveal (cheesy, I know) at the end. I had a cake made and the inside of the cake would be pink for a girl or blue for a boy. I thought it was a very cute idea, not over the top like other gender reveals, and my husband thought so too. 

I invited about 18 friends and their families, including my own family. So it was a rather large gathering. One of my friends, 26M, is dating a transwoman. They have been together for 8 months and I have met her several times. I wouldn’t say we’re extremely close, though.

Anyways, the baby shower happened on Sunday. It was quite nice and everyone had fun. Then, my husband got the cake out and told everyone that the colour of the filling inside would reveal the gender of the baby. It was a surprise and people were “awwing” and saying how it was so cute. My mother even teared up.

My husband and I cut the cake. It was blue so that means we’re getting a boy! I was really excited and it was just a great moment.

At the end, my friend’s trans partner approached me and asked if she could talk with me. Firstly, she thanked me for the party. Then she said that she was surprised by the gender reveal bit at the end, and that she was disheartened by it. She said we seemed like “really forward thinking people”, but that having a gender reveal and calling it that in this day and age is backwards thinking. She said the only thing that it reveals is that my baby has a penis. She said that her parents gendered her to be a boy growing up althought she wanted to be a girl and that it really messed her up. 

I defended my actions and said I “didn’t think too much into it” and said that saying “it’s a boy!” is much better than saying “my baby has a penis!” especially in front of all my friends and family. 

She said, “Well maybe you can be more open minded when raising your child.” She also told me that if I was planning to do a gender reveal, I should not have invited her because she thinks it was very offensive and almost triggering to go through it. 

I thanked her for my input but said at the end of the day, it’s rather rude of her to tell me how the baby shower should have been done or how to raise my son. She seemed upset when she left.

1021,Not the A-hole,"Point of my story up top: I'm a single father and my daughters are 8 and 11. We went to a family friendly nudist beach on our recent vacation where they had fun, but a friend of mine thinks it was highly inappropriate to bring them to a place like that. Was I an asshole for making this decision?

I took my daughters on vacation recently and I had brought up the idea of going to this kind of beach to the girls and explained what it would be like and asked if they'd like to go. 

Youngest was all for it and oldest wanted to read more about it, but after her own research she came back and said yeah she'd try it. 

We spent a day at the beach there on our vacation and I'll skip details, but they both had a lot of fun and we actually went back for an extra day since they liked it so much. 

When back in town, I had mentioned it to a friend of mine and she didn't flat out berate me for making the decision to take them to this kind of beach, but she was clearly put off by the idea of a single father doing this. She also claimed that they were too young to understand the context of it. I respectfully disagree with that last part, but I'll let others decide their view on that more

Was this an awful thing to do? I'm no stranger to some assumptions that people make about a single male taking care of girls, but I've been having second thoughts on if this crossed a line somewhere.",255,180,0.88

Here’s the back story, we dated for about 4 years, bought a home together, we did everything expect get married and have children. A year and half ago,when we were still together, she joined the reserves and went to boot camp and I visited when she graduated and all that good stuff. She then had to go to do additional training and schooling. In middle of her additional training she decided it would be best for us to break up. I was heart broken obviously,especially since it had been over 2 months since I last seen her. She wanted nothing to do with me. But I held down the house while she was gone, A total of 5 months. She came back home and I moved out and we agreed to sell the house. We weren’t on good terms and I was bitter, And to add insult to injury, she then tells me she’s getting married to her bunk mate or whatever that she met in basic training. 
Fast forward a couple months and we finally sell the House and we’re now on good terms we talk every now and then and i came to accept everything that happened. She’s now married and I’m dating and all that. She then moves to another state with her wife, but she occasionally comes back to visit and do her reserve duties, but now she constantly texts me, calls me asking me to hang out with her whenever she’s in town. I am now in a serious relationship  and I tell her that’s not okay for us to hangout even tho it’s just platonic. She just shrugs it off and tells me it’s not a big deal. Now she’s keeps texting me more and more, sending me old photos of us  and bringing up old memories. She keeps saying that just bc we broke up, doesn’t mean we can’t still hangout and be friends. I’m starting to think she’s severely delusional and I think she might be trying to manipulate me. She gets mad when I tell her no, she says it’s not fair to her.

He is constantly putting his hands and face near her mouth and when I get up to come inside with my dog he tries to come into our house.  He then hangs out on our porch for a while and keeps trying to look into our windows to try and look at our dog.

The boy's mom will constantly tell him to come back home, but she never actually comes over to get him.  She just stands on her porch yelling at him and he will NOT listen at all.

Obviously this causes extreme anxiety to my wife and I.  At least one of us sits out there with our dog, but with him putting his hands near her mouth it does worry me that she will bite him.  Also having him peek into our windows is not something we want going on either.

1029,Not the A-hole,"I'm 29M, sister is 22F, my mother passed four years ago but my father is 67M (I think). Throwaway because friends know my main account.

My sister is low functioning autistic. She's nonverbal, still wears diapers, I would say the equivalent to a 4 or 5 year old mentally. My parents are primary guardians of my sister.

Growing up, I had to do a lot of ""babysitting"" for my parents as they worked full time, well into their 50s. It was an expectation, never really asked. I basically had no social life, because if I ever went out, there's a high chance I'd be called back to ""take over parenting"". No movies, no trips, no long drive. My highschool life sucked as you can tell. And I never got to go to college, either. I basically had to remain within a 5km radius of the house, and if I ever veered off, I'd get scolded. Grounded, in my 20s. It's not like they could rescind privileges anyways, I had basically none.

It was always the expectation I'd be caring for my sister when both my parents passed, and when my mom did, my dad got these things in motion. He started talking about how I should get a house for both of us, I should ""get a girlfriend to help out"", things like that. I never had a girlfriend because I never wanted to bring one home to meet my family. My dad has money, enough to provide a house for me and ""live"" comfortably off of it.

To me, my family was dysfunctional and as bad as it sounds, I hoped my sister would die so I could begin to have a normal life. I hated her, not because of her, but because of what she did to the family. I know it's not her fault, she's an innocent party in all of this, but this is why I'm asking if I'm the asshole. I'm trying to be candid with my thoughts and don't have an expectation or NTA or ESH or whatever.

My dad's in failing health, he wants to give me power of attorney, write up a living will, etc. I can't be given guardianship against my will but power of attorney means I can decide what happens with my sister. She's entitled to $2,200/mo in long-term care benefits from the government which *can* be used for a group home, but my parents always kept it because it helped them out with bills, etc relating to my sister. If/when I do get this power, I want to put my sister in a home because I can't (and more importantly, won't) take care of her. Other people can, people more trained for this.

It's less about me being unable to and more about not wanting the responsibility, though. I want a life, something I haven't had since she was born. I want to go to college, I want to work (yeah, never had a job), I just want to live, and she's the impetus against this. Relationships with my dad be damned, I just want to live.

Throwaway because I don’t want anyone I know finding my real account.

I have been with my girlfriend for three and a half years. We’ve talked marriage, and I proposed last week. She said yes, we’re very happy. I thought everything was perfect.

She started crying to me this morning before leaving for work. Apparently, she *hates* the ring I picked out. We agreed to discuss this after she comes home. 

I called a friend of ours for some advice. When she heard the situation, she told me I was an idiot for not “sneakily checking” with her first if the ring design was ok. I didn’t want to ruin the surprise, so I didn’t. It’s a beautiful ring and is very in style. I figured she’d love it. 

My fiancée comes home in 7 hours, and I don’t know what the hell to say to her. Here’s the thing: I don’t want to return it. It’s a beautiful ring, and I chose it for her. Our friend says this makes me a bigger asshole, because my fiancée will be wearing it. But I feel like if she picks it out and is wearing it, then I have zero part in it and in the end, she just is wearing a piece of jewelry that has nothing to do with me. 

So, Reddit, AITA?

They do exchanges but she doesn’t want a new ring, she wants an antique/vintage (which I’m not comfortable with but this isn’t about me I guess) so I’m just out the money until I can sell the thing.",651,1528,0.95

For everyone to understand I'll give some context, it's kinda long but its important to understand why I say no. 

In my family theres mum, my older brother, me and my younger brother. I'm 18 but since my baby brother was born when I was 13 I've been taking care of him mostly. It was around that time that I realised how sexist and racist my family is. I wont go into too much detail but I hit rock bottom in 2016 and literally had to leave for a week and a half others I would've killed myself. I picked myself up after thanks to my amazing best friend and the world of books. Now I hold resentment against my family for this. The day since I turned 18 I got a job at my bros workplace which is a bar/restaurant (you need to be 18 to work there) and it was good I make on average £160 every two weeks working two days a week, I would be making more but I have to take care of my baby brother

Recently theres been drama in the kitchen with the dickhead assistant kitchen manager R and my bro who works as basically a chef. My mums now saying leave the job at this point and I've said dont go until you have another job lined up as a safety net because it can be hard to get a job sometimes. 

Onto the AITA part. Now my mum said today if my brother is fired or quits today I have to quit as well. Let me say this my workplace has treated me so well, and I appreciate them so much my coworkers are great and everything. And if I wanted more hours my floor manager would be more than happy to give them. When I said ""no why would I, they've treated me extremely well"" she went OFF and started saying I dont support my brother how I'm a fucking idiot and all. Literally says ""hes the man of the house if you find a man he has to get your bros approval how are you gonna sleep knowing you're betraying him"" like WTF IS UP WITH THAT. and funny enough this isnt even the tip of her sexism. She thinks of me as a loose whore even tho I've never done shit with a guy. Not me who's the loose one considering shed had 3 different kids with 3 different men and each left her ass running for the hills.

My brother and I have a semi shitty relationship but we've recently bonded over the fact our mother is fucking crazy. He's still a volatile angry for no reason ass so I've resolved to cut ties as soon as I move out.

He told my mom to suck it, gave her the middle finger and slammed the door Cuz she told him no. I texted him we could go into town tomorrow, a little earlier and I would buy him a drink. He told me my parents would regret this day. Wtf.

He constantly talks about all the ladies that wants to fuck him and how they stare and drool. I don’t see them, but okay.

Maybe it’s because I’m 19, I got out of bad relationship and really really enjoy being single with my smaller friend group of 6. I only know 30 people I want to invite to my party as opposed to 100, like him. We’re at different places in our life.

But shit when he talks like that to my parents and tells me that I’m the opposite of a sex god (when we literally look like twins, I’m just a girl) it pisses me off.

Thank you for the advice :) I had a little talk with him and explained why it’s uncomfortable for me to know about his sex life and by the facial expression he gave me, it seemed to sink in.

A few years ago, I married the love of my life.  He gave me a beautiful daughter who is now two years old!  All good so far.  My husband's family is religious.  Like, give-ten-percent-of-your-paycheck, throw-your-heart-medicine-onstage, gay-people-are-just-sick-and-need-loving-electric-shocks sort of Christians.  You know the type.  We got married in a church wedding to cos his parents paid for everything, which was fair enough, and we had a synagogue blessing with the canopy and signing the ketubah (Jewish marriage contract) afterwards because we wanted to respect both sides.  But the problem is that my parents-in-law seem to think that means I've converted to Christianity.

Now they are pressuring me to bring my kid to their church which is an idea I'm really uncomfortable with.  Being Jewish, I was always encouraged to question the Bible growing up - we have rituals where we are REQUIRED to argue about scripture with each other, and it's considered a religious obligation to keep reading and learning and changing your mind about God and religion.  Hell, there's even a tradition where every year we have to get a new commentary or interpretation of the Exodus story just so we can see lots of viewpoints and discuss a new one every year.  And that's the kind of intellectual tradition I want my children exposed to.  I don't want them exposed to preachers who yell every word as if it's a certainty, and use the Holy Books as weapons or recruitment posters.  I don't want my children sitting in a pew every Sunday listening to someone preach things I disagree with morally, but have still brought them to hear.

My husband isn't willing to tell his parents off, and they're getting more and more pushy even though I've told them we want to raise our daughter with exposure to different ways of thinking and she can decide for herself one day if she wants to be Jewish or Christian or an atheist or even a Jedi.

Today a young girl ran up to my truck and told her mother she wanted an ice cream. The mother told her no as she didn’t have any money. The girl was really cute and seemed excited so I offered the mum a free ice cream as a spur of the moment thing. Girl was happy, mum was happy, I was happy they were happy.

After they left a bogan woman quickly walked up to my truck and said she saw I was giving away ice cream and asked for three “hundreds and thousands chocolate ice creams”  (hundreds and thousands are a topping) for her kids. I told her I wasn’t giving ice cream out and it was just a one-off. She was very annoyed at this as she thought it was unfair that her children were being denied free ice cream when I gave some to “that Asian brat” as she put it.

Okay, up until now I’m obviously NTA. But I must admit that last comment along with her entitled attitude angered me. So I yelled out to a family sitting on the grass if they wanted free ice cream. The kids ran over excitedly and the parents thanked me.

About a year and a half ago, she took me to meet Byron. She told me they'd been discussing moving away and looking at houses/apartments, and several months after that, told me we were going to move in with him.

I asked her once every few months (this was back in mid-2017 to mid-2018) where we are in the whole moving situation since we were going to move in with him, and it seemed every time I asked her she never really gave me an answer to what was going on other than ""We'll get there"" or ""We're looking at storage"", and she would always move the planned moving date back a few months. First it was December 2017, then it was February 2018, then it was summer, then it was November, and so on.

Fast forward to October 2018, nearly a year after I met him and we first discussed plans to move. I was told that we were going to move out in summer of next year, 2019. Then came January of this year, my mom says that we're going to move in August. In late February or early March, she confirms that we're going to move in with Byron.

*This whole time I hadn't said anything to my dad because my mom said that she would tell him, herself.*

A few weeks ago, I ask her what the deal is with moving because she told me back in February that we were moving in June. She tells me that we're not going to move in June. She had me believe for months that we were going to move out at that time and that we had a plan established. Nope, she says ""we don't have a plan"", despite telling me otherwise. She says ""it's not that simple"". Again, no definite answer.

So on top of keeping her affair a secret for nearly two years I have to deal with this shit too. In the past whenever I got frustrated with her not coming clean and my dad asks me what's wrong and wants to know why I'm upset, I can't say anything to him, so I also have no one to talk to. I've told her that this secret is too much stress for me to handle. I've written her an email that was like four paragraphs long about it (that she didn't read when I asked her about it).

WIBTA if I told my dad about the affair? I really want to but I also don't want to be responsible for our family falling apart.",30,34,0.91
1052,Not the A-hole,"Background: I've always been close with her side of the family and get along with all of them, and they are very sad that she is leaving me, and have reached out several times to meet up for dinner and such. I have an individual relationship with both the bride and the groom outside of just being familiar on account of their relation to my ex wife.

We both received invites with no +1 to her cousin's wedding. I was going to RSVP no and send a present, because I do not want to cause any drama at her wedding, and it is an adults only ceremony so my three children would need someone to watch them. My ex asked me to RSVP yes so that they would save a spot for me, and then she could take her boyfriend instead.

I told her that I would not help her undermine her cousin's wishes for her wedding; That if she wanted to include my ex's boyfriend she would have given her a +1 in the invitation, and my ex blew up at me. She is already acting like her cousin is a bridezilla for not allowing children at her wedding, and I think part of the reason she wants to bring her boyfriend is to wave a metaphorical middle finger in her face for not inviting him or the kids.

Bonus: WIBTA if I went to the wedding?  


Edit: Invites were sent a week ago, the family has known about the pending divorce for 5 months now. The reason I wasn't sure if ITA is because my ex accused me of only refusing to let her BF use the invite to keep him separated from the family, who are having some troubles accepting him. That isn't my intention, I am mainly concerned with not ruining her cousin's wedding or going against her wishes.",330,3090,0.97
1053,Not the A-hole,"Ok so let me tell start this very quickly: I spend more than 90% of my time on riding clothes. I give horse riding lessons so of course I will be dressed for that. But the rest of the time I will be the first to say that I don’t dress very... discreetly? I’m studying fashion design so I tend to dress a bit more out there. Nothing outrageous. But imagine, I’ll wear pink brocade boots, or my Cher from clueless matching yellow skirt suit, or my usual skirt/dress shirt combo with a ribbon tied around my neck, or my glittery silver mini skirt. Not very usual for day to day but nothing really outrageous. People tend to like it, and I will receive compliments from everyone. Except my parents. They hate how I dress and ALWAYS make a point of criticizing something. It’s not always the whole outfit but at least something. 

So what broke the camels back? I bought gold glitter boots (I buy all my clothes with my own money because when they offer to buy something it has to be a) approved by them b) they tell me that if they don’t like the way I’m wearing it they will take it back) and I was wearing them yesterday. A girl around my age approached me and said she liked them a lot and she would like to know where I had bought them. My parents didn’t let me answer and told the girl that she shouldn’t buy anything similar, because no one wore that type of stuff. And look, I blew up. I spent the entire ride home screaming with both of them. I told them that from now on, each time they criticized anything I wore I would tell someone something really embarrassing about them. They tried to argue with me, but I was so done. I told this to my best friend (who I trust with my life) and she said that while she agreed she thought that I was extremely rude. 

The question here is not if I’m right for what I did. But rather the way I said it. I know that the constant criticizing is not normal. But do you guys thing that I was a bit exaggerated?

Edit: just to clarify, I don’t hate my parents, nor do I think they are controlling. This is probably the only major thing we have butted heads over the years (apart from the normal teenager phase where I thought it was cool to wear sunglasses everywhere and my parents were pissed off at me)

Edit 2: thank you guys for your input, I really appreciated it. A little update, I spoke with my parents and apologized once again for my behavior. We tried to talk, and they said that indeed they were out of line for saying that to the girl, and they said that they didn’t like my outfits and they could say so. We ended up no coming to any specific conclusion, but they said they would be more considerate of my feelings in this case. Once again, I want to reiterate the point that I adore my parents and have a really good relationship with them. Thank you everyone!",182,1157,0.94

I work in a building where a lot of the people order out for lunch to the point where the security in and surrounding the building have made it easier for food delivery to park for a short while in front of the building to deliver food to the employees inside. I was in a hurry today and ordered from a popular restaurant that delivers quickly to my place of work since we only get around 30ish minutes for lunch here and since I couldn't get food from home, I opted for that restaurant since they know the place so well.

The delivery guy calls and tells me he's outside and I go outside to the usual parking space that is designated to the food delivery, I dont spot him so I call again and ask him where he is - specifically asking if he's in the front where the food delivery parking is, he tells me he's behind the building, near another parking area. I figured it's just a minute to go from my spot to there, so I do so, waiting for a little while and searching before I call again to tell him I dont see him. I've been outside in 40c heat that feels like 50, alongside the high humidity, for at least 10 minutes trying to find him with no avail after his instructions from when he hung up.

I called him a third time, this time I asked him if he can come to the front of the building since I couldn't find him. Instead, he said he'll send me his location and I can come to him and then hung up. The parking place he was at was for an apartment building right beside my workplace. I called again and asked again if he could come to the front because the parking place was not the company's and it was another 5 minute walk to there alone.

He huffed and asked if I still cant find the location even though he sent it to me, I just said it'll be easier if he can just come by the front of building as I'll notice him better. Lo and behold, it takes him a grand total of 20 seconds to drive from that area to the designated parking space and I get my food. At first I thought he was new and maybe didnt know his way about this place, so I just mentioned how the front area of the building here allows food delivery in quickly for the sake of time management on both ends, he just tells me that I could have walked and I'm making his other deliveries late for not specifying from the get go, even though I think I clarified from the first call that the front of the building is quicker access.

WIBTA for complaining about his attitude and not listening to me? A part of me says do it since he wasted \~20 minutes of my lunch time, another part of me is saying it's a dick move and that I should have been clearer.

1064,Not the A-hole,"My mom and my brother (Mark) have not really spoken to each other for about 2 years now. The reason for this is because my brother's wife (Cheryl) vented to her own mother via text message over a pretty long period of time about my mom. My mom found it because Mark and Cheryl gave the phone (no one used it anymore) to their daughter to use as a toy. Kid was about 7 at the time. Mom was babysittting, found the text messages, and read all of them. She didn't take it well. Took screenshots of the messages. She was heartbroken honestly. Obsessed over it. She couldn't understand why Cheryl felt this way about her because she's always tried to be nice to them. Said she couldn't understand how someone could say things like that about someone they care about.



She told me about it when she found it. I told her that she shouldn't have gone snooping, but I get that she's upset. I said she could either talk to them about it or let it go. She opted to let it go. That lasted about 6 months. She could not let it go. It was tearing her up inside. She had talked to me about it off and on, and I encouraged her to talk to Mark about it. Problem is, now she's been lying about it for 6 months. To say that talk didn't go well would be an understatement. I wasn't there for the conversation. They both tell different versions of what happened. The only thing they really agree on is that there was yelling, and Mark decided my mom would not see them or my niece until further notice.



And that's the way its been for 2 years now. They both talk to me about the other. I've tried having a relationship with each of them. My therapist keeps saying that just because they're fighting doesn't mean I can't have a relationship with them. But after all the awful things they've said about each other, I'm ready to leave both of them alone. The straw that broke the camel's back happened yesterday.



My grandfather (mom's dad) died a few years ago, and he was a big part of our lives. Real no-nonsense kinda guy. One of my mom's friends recently started harassing my brother via text message again (yes...again). So Mark reached out to mom and said ""Why is Terry harassing me again?"" My mom took offense to that because it felt accusatory (probably because it was). Mom tells me about it. Tells me how she's offended he would think she had anything to do with it. I told her I'm not surprised he thought that and Terry shouldn't say those things to him, and that I blocked him on my phone like a year ago because he told Mark that our grandfather would be ashamed of him for fighting with his mother. She says ""I don't care at all for the name calling or his harsh methods but you know what there is a kernel of truth in what Terry said. Grandpa would be disappointed in Mark for letting this go on for so long.""

For example, when I was about 15, he subtly mentioned that he and my mom aren't monogamous, and it's because she cheated on him first. Things like that, that make me very uncomfortable as someone who loves them both very much, and super anxious as their daughter who sees them as a unit destined to be in love and together, happily ever after etc..

1066,Everyone Sucks,"  

This is ages ago now, but I'm still curious as I don't consider what I did wrong.

I used to have an old female friend, who was my best friend. We knew each other for about 5 years, and about 2 years after we first met I started to catch feelings for her. She didn't want to, and I tried to accept it but I was a total wreck for about a year. Especially since she at the same time as I confessed my feelings for her she was juuuust starting to date another friend of hers. Kind of fucked up maybe, but I did confess to her immediately when she said her friend had confessed to her as well, so I saw it as my last and only chance.

We still hung out and our friendship never really changed, but I knew I would not be able to talk to her about stuff like sex, love and such, but she wasn't that type of girl anyway, who spoke about stuff like that so I thought I wouldn't even have to mention it.

Years go by, and we go for a weekend holiday trip in our capital. Good and fun trip, but when we sat down and had McDonalds, for some reason she starts to mention how she doesn't think she wants another relationship for a while, but just see someone she's attracted to, aka fuck buddy.

I started to feel sad, not as sad as I had been before but still. My feelings had diminished, but not completely vanish, so I gently said ""is it alright if we don't talk about stuff like this? It's making me uncomfortable"". She said ""Alright, sure"", and I thought that was that.

Without going to deep, I went into a deep depression a few years later for other reasons and I got extremely needy for attention, while she at the time was extremely busy at work. After some time she exploded as it just became too much. This lasted about 6 months.

One of the things she said during her explosiveness was how horrible I was for saying that we shouldn't talk about sex/romance, how it made her feel small and insignificant. I responded with ""Listen, I had feelings for you once. I didn't want to talk about topics like that because of that fact because it made me uncomfortable and sad. Would you have become just as mad if I asked for her to not discuss cancer, with my family's history?"""", or something. I can't remember my exact words. her response was something like ""No, I wouldn't."".

Anyways, those 6 months had taken it's toll and our friendship never grew back. We talked on Messenger for some time, but 4-5 months after we completely lost contact. I've ben thinking about whether or not to contact her again as it's 2 years ago, but I don't know what I would say.

Anyways, AITA for asking my old friend to not discuss sex/love with me as I had feelings for her?",10,26,0.86
1067,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments, appreciate it. (Please no more replies.)

I will try getting my family to seek therapy, but I am doubtful that my sisters will be willing. I will see to it that my younger sister is supported at least till she is 18, and my parents will decide depending on the situation then.

I see the point about how maybe there is more to it (psychological trauma etc). However the issue now is that anything we do/say that is in the slightest way unfavorable to them is seen as a hostile act. I am not sure how to reach out to them to try and understand the possible deeper issues they might have. My parents have tried all sorts of ways. I was always the 'nice older brother', only recently did I take a harsher stance (as my mum calls me crying about it).

We have tried limiting contact between my sisters as we see the bad influence. Did not work and only aggravated it; after all they are two fully abled (soon-to-be) adults. My younger sister goes over to my older sister's place so much that it is causing problems in her marriage.

This isn't a sons vs daughters gender issue; my younger brother is only 12, who knows what might happen. If anything, my younger sister was always seen as the brightest kid in the family. (and no, my mum didn't pressure for ridiculous straight As)

Indeed, it is impossible for me to give the full picture in one post – it spans years of conflict, and this is only my side of the story. However, I have questioned myself many times as unbiasedly as possible if my family really did do something so terribly wrong and I still come to the conclusion that my sisters are too much (even if my parents erred). On the other hand, I don't think that they have ever tried to reflect on their actions or our well intentions for them, or tried to reconcile the issues.

ORIGINAL POST:

We come from a middle-income family, my parents are immigrants who work really hard for us. They dont ask for much, they just want us to do our best / be good people.

My older sister [28] was always the trouble kid since middle school. She would drink, smoke, go out, fight with my mum and eventually dropped out of high-school. She hated my mum for simply wanting her to be a good daughter/student. She did unspeakable things like stealing $5000 from my grandma just to go shopping. Once she was 18, she left home with her car accident compensation money ($45,000). My parents tried finding her but she had severed ties with us. Two years later, she appears at our house BEGGING my dad to let her in. She splurged all that money in 2 years and was now homeless. Despite all the hurtful things she had done, my dad let her back in.

Things in the family was normal for the next few years. My older sister never truly grew up, but had a stable job and a husband who enabled her. Lately her husband almost divorced her as at 28, she is still behaving irresponsibly – getting drunk daily etc.

Now to my younger sister [17]. She was a good kid, but started going astray in high school, following the steps of my older sister. She is caught up with Instagram, smoking, drinking.. Her grades are atrocious. I tried to be a good brother giving in to her requests for luxury goods like the iPhone X, with promises that she would study hard etc; she never held up her promises. My dad slogs daily just to send her to a $6,000/year prestigious school. My mum has given her life to her children, even an opportunity to go to college. Still, like my older sister, my younger sister sees us as enemies. My mum is taking anti-depressants and constantly blames herself.

We have tried every method – advises, bargaining nicely, nagging, fights.. All we get is more hate.

My older sister adds oil to the fire by discouraging my underage younger sister from studying and brings her to clubs and drinking. My older sister tells my mum that she is a bad mum that is ruining my younger's sister life like she did with hers. My younger sister even stole $60 from my dad to go out recently.

We finally gave my younger sister an ultimatum: she can either stay and listen or leave the house. She left with my older sister but returned the next day. My older sister is financially dependant on her husband and is unable to support her. So my younger sister had no choice but to come home.

Our home is upside down and we are at our wits end. My younger sister said she hates us. I have confiscated her iPhone and Apple watch. She has been sending hate texts but also pleads for her phone. My parents acknowledge that my sisters are hopeless, but do not know what to do with my younger sister who is still in school. My parents see me, their oldest son, as the future sole caretaker of the house and therefore asks me for advice.

I want my parents to kick my younger sister out. My sisters are ungrateful and I refuse to let them hurt my parents any more. Reddit, AITA?",84,178,0.95

He calls me 2 times at 11pm (while I’m at an exclusive benefactor gala that I was lucky to be invited to), of course I didn’t answer either time.

He sends me a text saying “sorry to disturb you, just wanting to let you know, no need to call me back I’ve handled the situation. I won’t call again. It’s not like you ever answer the phone anyway. Enjoy your vacation”

I responded back saying “I am on vacation. I have had little to no cell reception the entire time I’ve been out here, not to mention it’s gala night. That snide remark was unnecessary. When I’m out of town, our AGM is the one you need to be reaching out to. Have a good day.”

1069,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I live with my family, the oldest child in a household of six. For the past five years, I’ve been away at training camps on my birthday, sometimes across the country, and so it would be celebrated when I got back, squeezed in between one of my brothers in mid August and back to school. Because of the timing, I never had a big celebration or got to do anything special on my past five birthdays.

This summer was my first time staying home to work, which meant being with my family on my birthday. I didn’t want much, but I wasn’t budging on my desire for a seafood dinner and a baked cheesecake. 

The big day comes. I spent most of the day outside, and help clean a bit, but leave my mother alone who is making my cheesecake. As I’m making my final decision on the seafood restaurant, my youngest brother starts complaining that he doesn’t want seafood for dinner, and he can’t stand it. This child is twelve.  I tell him it’s my first time having seafood in a very long time, and it’s my birthday, so he will go and have something else on the menu. My brother immediately started yelling, so my mother told me we’re going to a burger joint, and I will survive. 

Throughout dinner my youngest brother harasses me and grumbles. I dare not make a scene in a restaurant, but when I quietly remind him to behave, I get scolded by my father for fighting at the table. So I sit quietly and try to get this over with quickly.

We eventually get home to cut the cake after dinner, and I realised that the cheesecake my mother made was no-bake. I’ve never been fond of them, but I tried it anyways. In my opinion, it was disgusting. It had the texture of pudding and tasted bad, but my brothers seemed to enjoy it.

I was mad, I wanted to toss the whole thing out the window. When my mother asked me if I liked it, I told her I hated it. I told her they all ruined my birthday, and that I was entitled to have something so simple as a meal go my way on my birthday.  I am very upset and feel like I was cheated from having my birthday include things I love and rarely get. I  never said this, but I want them to take me to a seafood place, even a cheap one, and get a small store bought cheesecake to try again. Father called me an ungrateful asshole for not being glad I even got to go eat out on my birthday. Am I in the wrong?

EDIT: it didn’t take long for the majority to come up as ESH. I’ve been acting spoiled and immature, blinded by my desire for that “perfect” birthday. I’m going to apologise to my mother for being rude about the cheesecake, but I’m going to maturely explain how I felt when she disregarded my wishes to settle my brothers fit. I’m also gonna buy myself a bunch of seafood chowder and cheesecake and eat it alone. Maybe next year things will turn out better.

EDIT 2: just want to address a few things I mentioned in comments so everyone can see:

1. Birthday tradition in my family is that the birthday child gets to pick the dinner/desert and it’s absolute.

2. I mentioned I had emotional instability. I am in therapy. I have a few outbursts of aggression, however they are mild, verbal, and often come from anger. It used to be worse.

3. My father plays obvious favouritism on my brothers, and my mother usually goes along as well.

None of these make me any less of an asshole. I just wanted to provide a bit of extra information on where my poor behaviour came from. I know now in hindsight I should have been more mature, and I can be more mature.",129,340,0.96

We were driving on one of the Major highways and our off-ramp was coming up. Problem was that there was another car sitting in my back a bit on our left. She headchecked a few times and saw him so she knew he was there. He was far enough back that she could comfortably change lanes.

So she does, as she is halfway across this driver speeds up, trying to cut her off perhaps. But he can't fit so he honks at her. This makes my daughter jump. But doesn't affect her too much. But it annoyed me.

I tell her to focus on the road, so the driver overtakes us on the right, drives past us and gives my daughter the finger. Now I'm pissed. I'm normally a happy go lucky guy, someone who is far more likely to be found fooling around than trying to be intimidating or angry.

He pulls infront of her and starts slowing down. My daughter is getting uncomfortable now. So I tell her to pull off to the side of the road. As she does this other driver does too. Now just to be clear, we have the yellow L plates up showing that she is a learner driver.

We pull over and stop the car, my daughter is shaking. The other driver gets out of his car, he is a shortish man. I stick my head out and ask what his problem is. He swears at me and calls me a cunt. I ask him again what his problem is and then ask why he is trying to intimidate a learner driver, let alone a teenage girl?

He swears at me some more. So I get out of the car and I think he he fairly well mouthed ""Holy Shit"".

Some more clarification, I'm a big guy. Not fat but I am, as my Basketball Coach said, Physically Huge. I'm 203.2cm or 6 foot 8 inches and I weight about 117kg which is 260lbs. Add to that I look like a Biker, as my daughter tells me, I have the beard, the short hair and a few tattoos on my arms.

He says sorry and gets in his car and drives off, well above the speed limit. I ask my daughter to switch seats with me and I take out the L plates before I drive us the 20 minutes home.

When we got back I told my partner who called me an asshole and told me that I should have called the police or taken over driving the car.

So, AITA? I will admit, I probably am, but this is my daughter we are talking about, no one gives her shit because she is my baby girl.

1071,Asshole,"Some backstory to get started:

Long story short, I was a terror of a kid growing up. From age 5 to 18, I terrorized my family emotionally, mentally, and in the case of my brothers (who are about my age), physically. My older sisters grew up with our mother and abusive father. These two factors have had my sisters (currently 31 and 32) and my mother always fearing what I might become when I became an adult.

&#x200B;

I'm happy to say that since 18 (I turn 21 this fall),I've made strong strides from becoming a more violent version of my father. My temper is in check, and my relationships with my family, friends, etc. have all improved dramatically as a result.

&#x200B;

Enter my girlfriend (19F). We've been together almost 3 years, that means she and I started dating around the time I was making my turnaround. Some of my toxic tendencies bled over into the beginning of the relationship, such as unwarranted levels of yelling, mild to moderate insults, etc, but she's helped me to learn to control this. I've NEVER laid my hands on her though, just to be clear.

&#x200B;

I started bringing my girlfriend around the family last fall, exactly 2 years after we started dating. She's since become friendly with my family, and they all have high opinions of her but just to be clear they aren't particularly close. The only one that talks to my girlfriend outside of family events and whatnot is my mother.

&#x200B;

Cue today, it's family dinner. I'm in the living room with my brothers. My girlfriend is with my mom, my sisters, and my sister's boyfriend. The topic turns to me and they all start talking about the massive changes and improvements I've made in the last few years. My oldest sister then turns to my girlfriend and asks her questions like ""Does Josh ever scream at you?"" My girlfriend lied, as we have our shouting matches from time to time but didn't want to share that. They pressed her about it, saying ""You don't have to lie, it's okay."" My girlfriend stood her ground, as she felt that our issues aren't their business if we don't feel comfortable sharing.

&#x200B;

I found out about this an hour ago (they left at 8pm and it's 12am now). I told her she could've been honest but I appreciate why she did what she did. However, I'm pissed that they felt inclined to ask and press my girlfriend about this. I understand why they'd worry given the backstory I shared, but I feel that this wasn't their business and they crossed a line. They should've asked me directly considering they aren't THAT close to my girlfriend and I'm their brother/son. I've also never given them a reason to think I'm abusive to her.

&#x200B;

I want to confront them about this and establish boundaries and explain that this was wrong of them despite the past. My girlfriend believes that while it was uncomfortable, doing this would result in damaging the growing relationship she has with my sisters and mother.

1072,Everyone Sucks,"When I met my now ex he was in a shitty living situation with a lot of harassment and could barely pay his rent. I invited him to live with me (in his own room). I gave him a very fair rent (much less than his percentage cost) and told him that if something happened between me and him he would still be welcome as a roommate.


Later he breaks up with me and starts spending a lot of time with his exgirlfriend. Since we wanted to be friends he came clean that he cheated on me with her for months. I decide I can still be his friend, we live together and I really do enjoy being his friend, but that I dont have any desire to be her friend. 


She comes over sometimes and I'm civil. If I'm the first one to the door I let her in, I reply to her, I just don't initiate anything with her on my own. 


Today they came over while I was hanging out in the living room and I just kept doing what I was doing. They were bringing furniture in and I asked if I was in the way and moved when they said yes. 


5 minutes later he comes back out and tells me its unfair that I'm being so unwelcoming and rude to her. That its okay I dont want to be her friend but I cant be mean to her. I say that I dont think I'm being hostile, I'm just keeping to myself and letting them do whatever they want to do. He agrees I'm not being hostile but says I need to try harder to be friendly. I tell him that would be a lie, and I'm not going to, and that he's free to have her over however much he wants and do what he wants and I'll stay out of his way. I'll still be his friend when shes gone, but I dont want to hang out with her and I'm just going to keep to myself. 


He says that sucks and he doesnt know if he could still be my friend anymore if I cant be friendly to her. I tell him yes it does suck, but it is what it is and I'm not willing to pretend anything other than what I feel, but I will stay out of their way when she's here. He reexpresses that I need to be more friendly or he'll stop being able to be my friend because its uncomfortable for him to feel like he's in the middle. I acknowledge that and say that I can't do anything more than what I'm doing now. 


That's the backstory. 


So. Where I'm stuck on is if I'd be TA is if he follows through with that and decides he cant be my friend anymore, would giving him 30 day notice of change of rent costs make me TA? 


Right now he pays well over $70 less per month just for his portion of rent+utilities. I also cover his grocery costs at no additional expense. I would not have offered this if he wasnt my friend. For a regular renter I would have calculated the costs by percentage, and given them their own shelves in cupbards and fridge so they would be responsible for their own food costs. 


He doesn't bring in enough income to meet all of those expenses, which is why as his friend who makes more money than him, I have covered some. But if he's decided he cant be my friend anymore, am I still obligated to give him that price?",142,161,0.95
1073,Not the A-hole,"A few weeks ago I noticed a girl in a porn vid online that looked remarkably similar to someone I knew from a few classes. We’re not friends, but we’ve chatted a few times during class. We take the same major so we’ve shared quite a few classes.

The channel that uploaded it had a lot of videos, most of which starred her and the same guy. Normally I’d leave it at that and not do anything else, but all of these videos had a “hidden camera” vibe to it. As in, it’s always a camera in the corner of the room, neither of them ever look or pose for the camera. I felt as though her boyfriend might be secretly recording her without her consent.

I thought about this for a couple weeks before I decided I should tell her just in case she didn’t know. I didn’t want to come across as an obsessed creep or perv, but I don’t know the girl’s contacts or even last name, as we only chat briefly, so I thought it best just to approach her discretely after class and let her know.

When I approached her I tried to explain what I came across and that I was only telling her because I wasn’t sure she knew about it. She was extremely upset that I’d bring this up to her in person and that I should mind my own business. I tried to apologise and explain it just looked a bit sketchy and she wasn’t having any of it. She asked me how many videos I’d watched at which point I felt very uncomfortable and tried to apologise to diffuse the situation. She got even angrier and accused me of stalking her (like what the hell??) and I eventually just walked away.

She told someone at the Uni about it and I was brought into a meeting with people I’d never met before that reprimanded me for bringing up private issues at a place of learning. They say I violated her privacy and informed me not to talk to her in future. I didn’t object and just apologised.

1075,Not the A-hole,"Long story made short. I just found out last Friday that my roommate lost all of my July rent money at a casino.  Flash back to last Friday when I was supposed to get August rent from him. Friday morning, he’s gone, and so is his curve tv (his only possession worth anything). I find out from his friend that he’d lost my money at the beginning of July. On top of that, he also has a warrant for arrest in the next county for failing to appear on a felony charge from months ago (theft 1) which I knew nothing about. 

Flash to today, I owe unpaid July rent, late fee/his bounced check fees, plus August rent on the 1st - about $4k. He’s blocked my number and isn’t replying on social media, so there’s no getting money out of him. I have a new roommate lined up for August, but that only covers 1/4 of what I owe. I pulled from my 401k, but that might not deposit in time, as they’re evicting on the 2nd I’d rent isn’t paid. 

So I’m $800 short, and working my ass off w/ Lyft on top of my day job, but that won’t cut it in time. This brings me to his clothes. He filled a duffel and left the bulk of his wardrobe behind, which is a lot, including a dozen suits. He might return for them, but I haven’t heard anything. I know selling them to thrift stores (some out here buy used clothes) won’t cover the $800, but it’s better than nothing. He kept all of this hidden from me, so I didn’t even have a chance to be frugal/ save. Would this make me the asshole?",29,34,0.83

1077,No A-holes here,"Ever since my sister was younger, she talked about wanting to be a mom. She was one of those that was amazing with kids, babysat at a young age, etc. When she was older, she tried to get into a relationship, but those failed. Eventually, she went through the process getting an anonymous sperm donor and got pregnant. She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, and sadly only got to raise her for 7 months before she died of an unexpected brain hemorrhage. It was a terrible time in our lives. I got custody of her little girl and struggled immensely. I still feel guilt that I am raising this child that my sister worked so hard for and didn’t get to.

When the little girl began speaking (around the age of 1), she tried calling me “mama” a few times out of hearing other babies at her daycare doing the same but I corrected her to my name. I love her so much, but I’ll always be “Aunt(ie) X” to her. As she’s gotten older, she’s never tried to call me that on her own. She’s currently 6 and is a beautiful, confident and smart little girl that knows a lot about her mom, also knowing that she’s immensely loved.

Recently, my mom confronted me privately that I don’t allow my niece to call me “mom”. I always assumed she’d have the opposite issue. (Not my reasoning but still what I assumed) She said I was raising her and it was wrong. It was coming across to my niece that while I love her enough to adopt her (I did this when she was 18 months) and raise her, I didn’t enough to be “Mom”. I said this was how things worked. My mom told me that it was going to backfire in time.

I’ve been thinking about it a lot more and have wondered if I made a mistake. Am I being an asshole by doing this?",379,2196,0.97

It's the constant chewing and spitting especially that distracts me and drives me to the brink of insanity, like I want to punch a wall. Important to note that I'm normally a very chill guy and almost nothing sets me off like spitting sunflower seeds.

Sadly its one of the favorite snacks of my gf at the gas station close to our place. She usually knows by now not to eat them in my presence but when she does I'll usually leave to the other room.

1080,Not the A-hole,"Background - I have a 1.5 year old dog who goes to daycare 1-2 days/week. It’s a franchise of a nationwide chain. They record the playrooms via webcam. 

A few weeks ago, I dropped my good boy off. I got a call around 9am telling me he had an accident playing with another dog. I was told he was acting ok, but they would remove him from that playroom and clean it. I was told my dog would be kept with the staff the whole day as I was unable to leave work to get him. I start panicking but they assure me it’s “not bad” and he’s “really ok” but “should go to the vet” later.

I reached out to my vet to get an appointment and was able to get something same day. They requested pics so I called the daycare back to ask for pictures texted to me. Around this time, a friend told me that she could pick up my dog. I told her to call me when she was on her way so I could call the daycare and authorize her to take him, but I never got a chance to call them, so they had no permission to release him to anyone. 

My friend arrives to get him. She finds him alone in the “spa” (essentially a supply closet with cleaning supplies, baths, dog grooming tools), not in anyone’s care as promised. Second, she said she showed up, said she was there for my dog and they got him from the “spa” and leashed him up and handed him over, even though they had no idea who she was. 

Took my dog to the vet and it was pretty bad, his paw was ripped open which required stitches and his dewclaw was so badly damaged that he had to have it completely removed, as well as part of the bone connecting. He had to have surgery and was put under anesthesia and had to stay overnight for recovery and observation. He had to be monitored carefully for a few days and the whole thing was scary and painful for my poor pup. 

I called the daycare that day (after my friend picked him up, before I had gone to the vet) and told them I was furious they let him go with my friend; to which they said wouldn’t happen again and “good thing it was my friend” so not to worry this time. I asked if they would reimburse for the vet and they said to email them over (whole thing was around 500), and that was the end of the convo. I also asked for the tape of him so i can see how the incident was handled. They haven’t reached out at all other than a message over Instagram asking how he was doing. No one has sent me the tape or followed up again either. 

While of course I’m so sad for my sweet pup, I know dogs playing is a risk and by taking him, there is risk he could get hurt, which I accept because he loves going and I need the care for him. He hasn’t been back since the incident. 

That said, AITA for being pissed about
1. How they treated him 
2. How they released him to a stranger 
3. How they are not releasing the tape of the accident
4. How they haven’t made any attempt to see how he is doing/reimburse

1083,Not the A-hole,"My friend, we’ll call her Bridget, is one of those “not like other girls” people. She makes those posts on Facebook, talks about it, etc. It can get a bit annoying, but the biggest issue I have with it, is that she “has no filter”. Now, I’m all for speaking your mind because free speech and all of that. But there are times when you need to have a filter. She’s the type to point out when things are awkward between two people, but they’re pretending to be civil for the sake of the group and just get through this outing, before they don’t have to see each other again. Doesn’t happen often, but it’s happened a couple of times when people have had an argument or don’t like each other and then things are even more awkward.

If someone is on their phone a bit, she’ll wave her hand in front of their face and say “Hey there” and then call them on it. If they have a fashion sense that’s odd to her, she’ll make fun of them, even if they ask her to stop. She’ll also tell you really random, graphic stories about her past, the same ones over and over. It’s sad the first time, but your cocktail anecdote should not be “My house burned down when I was 11 and my uncles died two days apart, plus I think they haunt me.” (The uncles didn’t die related to the fire, they died of terrible diseases and these are tragic stories, and I’m sorry they happened, btw, I’m not trying to make light of it.) It makes people feel awkward, which you guess it…she calls them on and laughs about.

If you call her out on any of this, “I have no filter”. A lot of our friends don’t like this, but a bulk of them (including myself for a bit until she did this with me for way to long about the clothes) chalk it up to “That’s just Bridget”.

The other night, we were all hanging out and one of the guys had brought his new girlfriend. We were all talking about fairly, light, funny topics. Suddenly, Bridget brings up her uncles and started talking about their sickness, in excruciating detail. I can tell that the new girlfriend was getting pretty weirded out and I told her “Hey, maybe we can talk about the time they took you fishing. That’s a funny one.” 

But no, she continued until she was done. Then the room got quiet, as it always does after she tells this horrible, awful story about two men dying of cancer and she looks around, bursts into laughter and goes “Well, now none of you have anything to say.”

Our friend’s new girl looks humiliated and I just feel so bad for her. I say, “Bridget, you need to cut this out. If you keep this up, people are going to stop inviting you to hang out with us. No one likes the way you talk to them. We’ve told you in the past.” She looked incredibly hurt and I said “Sorry, I don’t have a filter.”

Apparently, Bridget is still incredibly hurt and thinks I’m an ass. I do feel a bit bad, but at the same time, I am just sick of how she treats us as a group. Am I being an ass here?",1271,10896,0.96

1085,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

2 month's ago I was browsing through Tinder and made it quite clear that I'm looking only for hook up, one night nothing more, nothing less. Eventually I did find a guy I was interested in, his name was Brad. We talk a bit and Brad was also looking for a one night hook up. Brad asked me to grab a pack of condoms and food/drinks if it's not too much of a trouble and that he'll pay his share. Bit unusual, but I did.

When I got there he I send him a text to come down, he read it but didn't replay. I thought his busy atm, so I waited. 2h later still not a single word from Brad, I was quite pissed since all this time he still hasn't answered me, I called him an asshole for ghosting me, but he already blocked me. I went home that night quite upset and ended up finishing both bottle of cheap alcohol I got earlier. If he changed his mind why the heck couldn't he just text me?

So last Friday my friend (Sara) invited me to her party, I'm not sure how exactly to explain it, since I'm quite confident most countries don't have them or atleast thats what I think, it's essentially a Birthday for your name. It's a cheaper version of your actual birthday, but hey a reason to trow a party atleast!

At the party Sara introduces me to her new boyfriend she's been for dating for a week or two. Low and behold, it's the same guy. I was still bit mad about, but wanted my friend to know, so I pulled her aside and told her ""Be careful, that guys a asshole and likes to mess with girls, just few months ago I meet him in Tinder and he got me to buy bunch of food and alcohol, gave me a fake address and made me wait for 2h before blocking me, don't take him seriously."" She dumped him on spot.

Some of my male co-workers think it was inappropriate for me to tell Sara about the guy, since he didn't mess with her and it might be a serious relationship.

So Reddit AITA?

Edit: To the guy in original post who was wondering what would happen if genders we're switched. This, this would happen. Of course there was no need to make this post as it's quite obvious for anyone that's been here for more than 2m that Reddit loves marking everything as red flag, have a minor case of serious white knight syndrome and is in fact quite bias to women, while not always, but there are enough cases for this.

So let's go over what we learned today from this poat shall we?

1. While the guy was called creepy and too pushy, female version was just fine.

2.When telling her/his friend about the person that ghosted them male version was told to shut his fluffing mouth and that it's none of his business while female version was passed of as ""giving valuable information to friend""

3. Male versions co-workers were alright while I saw someone calling out female versions co-workers for being men that would do/did the same.

4. If it's a female co-worker and you're male then it's none of your business and she knows better that it might be a serious relationship, while if the roles are reversed the co-workers are the type of people who'd do same.

5. Reddit in fact is fluffing bias and people with apposing or different opinions are in fact down voted to hell and back.

1087,Asshole,"This is for my girlfriend because she is curious if she is in the wrong. She went out of town Saturday for a friend’s birthday party and came back home this afternoon (it’s a 2.5 hour drive each way). Earlier this week her friend asked her if she could pick her up from the airport at 9:45 and when asked, my gf initially agreed. Now that it’s the night of and she’s tired, she doesn’t want to pick her up. My gf’s reasons as to why she doesn’t think she’s an asshole: it’s late and she’s legitimately tired from the weekend and her friend can easily get an Uber home as well as waiting for a checked bag may take a while. My gf’s reason as to why she might be an asshole: her friend is scared of taking Uber’s alone (the airport is very safe and it’s only a 15 minute ride) and that she agreed to it initially. So is my gf the asshole?

Edit: looks like the tribe has spoken and she’s going to pick her up. I think my gf may have known deep down that she was wrong but needed outside opinion. In her defense, when she agreed she didn’t know that her friend was checking a bag and she thought that if the situation was reversed, her friend would understand her heart was in the right place when she agreed.

1088,Not the A-hole,"My son (22) graduated university in May with BBA, major in Finance and two minors in Math/Stats. We paid for his education including his OSAP loans - it cost us over 100k for 4 years.

He moved back with us and started working part-time as a Lifeguard instructor on the weekends. During the week he reads for the Canadian Securities course, which we paid as well and mostly plays video games, relaxes and goes to the Gym.

We are trying to motivate him to apply for entry level business/finance positions, but he is really not into it. He does not do any household chores and have no real motivation to find a full-time job. I have submitted over 20 applications on his behalf and he had 2 interviews with major banks, however there were no follow-ups. At one of the interviews they asked him what motivates you and he answered ""my parents as they paid for my education and are pushing me to succeed"". I don't think he did this on purpose, he is very honest.

We also have a daughter, who is going to university and we will be paying for her BSc degree as well. We are fine financially and can support both of our children, even though they are adults now. However, we would like them to be independent and start taking care for themselves after graduation. We are first generation immigrants in Canada and started from ground zero, and built our careers over time.

Back to my son, we gave him ultimatum to find a proper job by September and to start paying partially the bills and paying us something for groceries. He thinks that this is not fair, and a lot of his friends are backpacking in Europe or went on vacations after graduation. We refused to pay for a summer vacation (the rest are going) and insisted that he should start a part-time job on the weekends, while looking for a full-time job in his area during the week.

We told him that if he is not happy with this arrangement, he can move out and start supporting himself. WIBTA if I kick my son out in September? I feel like this may give him some real motivation, but I feel bad as he is a good son otherwise.

Edit (additional info): My son chose the double degree Business/Math at the time as he wanted to be an investment banker, but now it seems he wants to be a personal trainer and a professional powerlifter. He should have accepted the Kinesiology offer then, now it's a bit late for changing fields and we are not paying for it. My son is smart and hard-working when it is something that interests him and he feels motivated. 

Thanks to all who replied, including those who think we are assholes for enabling him. We had a serious conversation last night and talked about chores, timelines, budgeting, contributions, etc. My son has already passed the first CSC exam and we gave him until September to pass the second one. I will continue helping him submitting applications, but with him at my side. A lot of people have an issue with this, but I am simply much better than him in this area and his chances of getting a job interview are much higher this way. I don't understand why they don't have more career coaching in school.

Our main goal is to motivate him without actually kicking him out of home. He needs to understand that he is not our dependent kid anymore and needs to grow up and be an independent adult.

Anyway one of the guys seems adamant that he must have his kids there because it'll have a pool and they will enjoy it there but is refusing to accept that it's not appropriate for them to come. A big part of the problem is that his kids have zero discipline and whenever him and his Mrs come out with them the kids essentially are left to run riot while mum and dad drink and smoke, leaving the rest of us to try and stop them eating crap off the floor or from falling off things they shouldn't be climbing on in the first place, essentially we all end up on edge and not able to relax because there are two little children that are up past their bed time, full of sugar, running around feeling tired and miserable. Generally they are good parents and as someone who doesn't have children I wouldn't dream of telling them how to parent their children but I really don't want them to come on this weekend and know that many of the others in the group don't want them there either. Am I being a selfish asshole wanting to celebrate our 30th without any children or am I justified in saying no children allowed?",38,105,0.93

Tl:dr SIL wants new adopted sister (niece) to be kicked back to her family in her home country because she is pregnant but is secretly pregnant herself and doesn't think her parents who they live with should or need to know. If we have a family meeting I would most likely say that she should worry about her own pregnancy.

Background: So I (26F) have been with my husband (25M) for 8 years. Since I was 19/20 we lived with his family but recently me and my husband have moved out on our own. Now at his family house it was his parents and two older siblings living there as well. Also his nephews. Throughout the years his sister (33) had a husband and his daughter move in (then seperate and leave), and then had another child (and a new boyfriend move in and out as he is not a resident in this country). This is important because she has expected my in-laws to help fund her family. Now my in-laws have moved nieces in with them as well (from their home country).

So when my SIL was pregnant with her second son she told me. By 8 months we (the family) still hadn't met her boyfriend, AND I was still the only person in the family to know from her (I had told my husband). So, at 8 months I begun hinting to my MIL that her daughter was expecting. My MIL told me she suspected because people were asking when her daughter was due. Anyway she had a beautiful baby boy and bought him and he boyfriend home (first time we met both). Since he's been born my MIL and FIL have had to foot the bill for her and her family.  Not long after her son was born we found out we were expecting and shortly after moved out.   
My in-laws then moved in some of my husbands cousins from their home country because there is more opportunity here. However we have just found out one of the girls is pregnant. So my SIL says her parents NEED to know and tells them. They start talking about her options, but say they do not want to send her back. My SIL however is adamant she should go back to her parents.  
What my SIL doesn't know is we (me, my husband and my MIL) know she too is pregnant again. (She posted it to facebook and blocked her family from seeing the post - but someone screenshotted it and sent it to me anyway). So we three know that she is only wanting the girl to go back because their house is over-crowded and she doesn't want to leave.

So my question is if we have a family meeting, and my SIL says anything about sending the girl away for being pregnant WIBTA if I told her we know she is pregnant too, so why should the cousin be sent back and she allowed to stay and live off the parents (her cousin is legally adopted by my in laws by the way). My husband is a lot harsher to his sister so I think it would be better coming from me.",18,59,0.9

Their schedule on those 2 days are already booked with friends.  They have not offered to reschedule to see me instead.  When I asked why they don’t schedule dinner with me first before their friends I got a guilt trip about how I never drive out to see them.

My roommate absolutely sucks. He is just inconsiderate, an asshole and self centered.

He's 17 and was with his friend (that I know and trust) yesterday which was the last time I communicated with him. He's not a bad kid. He smokes weed here and there (we live in a legal state) and skips classes occasionally but that's the extent of it. What I see as pretty standard teen-boy behavior. 

Anyway, AITA for using his phone location finder feature (he doesn't know I know how to do this) to get his location? Its location showed a house I didn't recognize so I looked up the address to figure out who owned the house and it was someone I had never heard of. Then I found the guys name on Facebook and looked at his profile where I discovered he's a family member of my son's friend. I remembered my son talking about swimming at his friend's cousin's house so this must be them. He must've forgot his phone charger and he's just having fun and not even thinking about mom.

1101,Not the A-hole,"My husband was having a reunion with an old high school friend of his from out of town that he hadn’t seen in over 20 years; they were meeting at a local Starbucks. About 15 minutes into the meeting between just the two of them, I tried to get into our house. Instead of a key slot, we punch in a code to unlock our door, and the code we’ve been using for the past 6 months wasn’t working. 

My husband is the one who does most of the repairs around the house, so I figured he must of have changed it. (After this whole incident I’m writing about occurred, my husband explained that he saw a sketchy guy behind him watching him as he plugged in the code, and thus got the idea to change it; and forgot to tell me.)

I called my husband’s cell, aware that he was meeting with his friend; but I figured he could take just half a minute to answer my call and tell me the code. He didn’t pick up, and I kept calling him back. Every time my call would go to voicemail, I’d just hang up and call back immediately afterwards.

My call history indicates I called him a total of 37 times. Eventually, whenever I’d call him I’d only get one or two rings, indicating he’d blocked my number. This infuriated me, and I started messaging him on Facebook asking, “What is the new door code?” He has the app and has it set so that his phone dings every time he gets a message.

I sent him 25 copies of this message in the span of 10 minutes, and he **still** was not answering. I think after a certain number of messages, he may have just reached into his pocket and powered down his phone without even looking at my messages.

I then called the Starbucks he was at, feigned a worried, scared voice, and told them that I **have** to get in contact with my husband there; I told them it’s a “very serious emergency.” I described my husband, and the employee took the phone over to him and told him that his wife was on the line and “really needed to speak with him.” He **finally** answered me, and I asked him the code, which he gave.

He was furious at me when he got home, accusing me of being a stalker and bitching about how he “can’t enjoy one hour of getting to hang out with an old friend without you ruining it.” I emphasized to him how irresponsible it was of him to ignore his wife’s calls; for all he could have known, I could have been in an accident or in serious danger, and he could have been ignoring me.

1102,Not the A-hole,"Apologies for my English, it is not my first language.

Occasionally I (26f) have a sort of game night with some of my family members, including my sister who I'm very close to. We use a Whatsapp-group to plan this. It's only every few months, because my cousins are all quite busy and have kids, so it is difficult to plan. Normally there is four of us plus partners if they are available. Tomorrow we have another game night, with more people, as another cousin is visiting with her whole family. Because of this we will be in a house which has (by my count) at least twelve people, though not all will participate.

Ususally everybody will bring something (like toast of cake) as to not burden the host too much. The last few times I have been slacking a little; I am the only that  doesn't live in the same town so I have to take public transport to get there and I also work late, so it was very inconvenient for me. Instead I've been bringing fruit bowls or other easy things. I am also vegan, so often there isn't anything that I can (/will) eat.

Very conveniently I have the day off on the day we have planned game night, so I decided to make up for my slacking and bring banana bread. In the Whatsapp-group somebody asked if they should bring something and some other people answered taht they would (like toast or drinks). My sister said she would bring something sweet. She likes baking, so she usually does this. My sister and me both had the day off, so I called her to see if she was available to hang out beforehand. I also mentioned that I would be bringing banana bread. She was very mad, as she feels she had already 'reserved' the sweets-category and she was planning on making buttercake and people won't want to eat two sweet dishes. I feel that there are enough people to have both and that nobody is going to care. She claims it is a social rule I don't understand, because I am autistic.

1103,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys, throwaway for obvious reasons.


So my husband passed during an unfortunate accident about 7 months ago. While I've grieved over losing him, there's still so much in my mind that I can't stop thinking about from before he passed. Mainly, I had found evidence a couple of times that he might of been cheating.


It was a fight I wasn't going to win, so I eventually dropped it. But even now, I can't get it out of my head. I can't stop wondering if he was loyal to me during our time together. I know if there is evidence that he was, it won't make me feel better, but I feel like at least then I can work on moving on from it instead of been stuck on not knowing. I guess I just feel like I need that closure in order to fully move on. But it would also be disrespectful of him, and I know it's not right to invade his privacy, but then I think does it really matter if I did now that hes gone?

1104,Not the A-hole,"AITA for this? Okay so yesterday my son and I stopped in to Domino’s to order a pizza before going to get his hair cut next door.  

If you’re familiar with that particular pizza chain, some of them have a little step up place where kids can watch the pizza chefs work the dough. 

While I’m ordering my 5 year old is watching the workers.  A lady and her kids, looked like maybe 3-4 years old, came in behind me, they are followed by a man who goes into the bathroom. Well, I noticed that her boys went right over to my son... I didn’t think anything of it.  Kids like to play.  

So I pay and I’m on my way out and my son is on the ground and they are standing over him. So I help him up and ask if he’s okay.  He says “They were being mean.”  I say “well they are littler than you so let’s just walk away, okay?” He says “okay.” 

When we can’t get his hair done we decide to just go back and wait until our pie is done. The mom and her boys are still there.  Mom is on her phone and the boys are playing on the floor with chalk.  Yes coloring the floor with chalk.

One of the boys sees my son come in and gets up and runs over to the steps, which if I didn’t mention are big enough for all 3 boys to fit, and opens his arms so my son can’t stand there.  My son just sits on the floor and watches from there.  

About 5 minutes pass and the kid leaves and my son gets up to go take a turn. As he does the little boy that had been on them calls for his brother and they both go over.  

I am watching quietly.  I like to see how my son handles himself. But I do glance at the mom who is now outside smoking. Now it’s just me and the 3 kids in the store.

The boys start yelling at my son he’s “bad.”  I say to him “you’re not bad. You waited, it’s your turn.” So my son says to them very firmly that he’s not bad. 

The man emerges from the bathroom and approaches the boys and asks what’s going on.  Then one of the boys pulls out a golf ball and pitches it at my son, missing him and hitting me directly in the face.  The man does nothing but hold his hand out like he expects me to pick it up and pass it to him.  The 2nd boy grabs it and starts hitting my son with it.

So I put my hand out and block the ball from hitting my child again and I say very firmly, but absolutely not yelling,  “Do NOT do that to my son.” I will admit that my hand did touch the boy’s when he struck. I open handed lifted the ball back towards the child. 

Well the father flips on me. Starts yelling at me for bullying little babies. Says I should teach my son how to walk away from a fight, especially because he’s the bigger boy here.   And some rant about his his kids were “just babies” who “didn’t know better” and “couldn’t hurt anyone anyway.”

I listened but didn’t reply to the man. Eventually a manager came out and asked what was happening.  The man told him I threatened his kid.  The manager gave me my pizza and asked me to go.  I thanked him, left a tip on the counter, took my boy and left.",32,72,0.92

I've always just tried to keep peace and be the bigger person, but the shit hit the fan the night before last and I'm frustrated with the way my family is acting about it. The other night, my parents and younger brother went to my aunt and uncles for dinner. We see them about 3 or 4 times a year, usually at my parents' house. This is the first time in a couple of years we've gone for dinner at their house. My 14 year old cousin, let's call her Anna, is a really shy and quiet but sweet kid.

I followed him, and quietly told him what he just did was ridiculous, embarrassing and completely out of line. He got LOUD. Told me I need to mind my fucking business, that I had no right to speak to him like that in his own house, and that if I didn't drop it I'd be leaving. At that point *I* got loud. I said some things I shouldn't have, including how he was a cold and shitty father, and when my parents came in and started telling me I needed to stay out of it, I told them they were enabling his asshole behavior and that it was a big reason he treated people, especially Anna, like shit and thought nothing of it.

I joined a gym 2 months ago and after a gym staff member became friendly with me. He has been inviting me to come to the gym near closing so we can work out together after closing to be workout buddies. I declined because I don’t want to work out alone at night with someone I don’t know and I like to workout alone. Each time, I’ve been more and more uncomfortable because he watches me workout until it looks like I’m free to talk. I politely asked him to leave me alone during workouts so he started stopping me at the door on my way out. 
 

2 days ago, he asked me if I would be interested in joining him for lunch so we could get to know each other better. I told him I’m married but could get lunch as a friend. His face turned red and he accused me of lying because I wasn’t wearing a ring. I explained to him that my husband and I don’t wear one because we think the money is spent better elsewhere and I never mentioned I am married because it was never relevant to the conversation. He started to go on this rant about how he just knew I was the perfect woman for him and if I gave him a chance I’d also realize that. I repeated that I am happily married to X (his name is clearly Asian). He claimed as a white man he could make me happier than my Asian husband.

That’s when I lost it. I am Asian and received plenty of “me love you long time” shit from all types of men all my life. Not only that, I am angry this man insulted my husband and our race. I called him a racist creep and I’d never even consider dating someone like him and I was sure his d*ck must be withered from all the steroids he’s been on to build his swollen body puffs. He walked away after that, and some other members told me I’d crossed a line. Only one person told me he could understand my anger. I’ve also been banned from the gym for being inappropriate and body-shaming (which also makes me think I may have taken it too far by what I said and I am horrified I have body-shamed someone).

My husband is fully supportive of me putting in a complaint. A friend of ours told me it was harmless and the guy probably just thought I was attractive but didn’t handle rejection well and my words were hurtful to my friend (“someone like you”) because they could be confused for refusing to date a white man due race. Well, this also upset me because I don’t think our friend understands and took an unrelated situation and applied it to himself (he is a white man married to an Asian woman).

1109,Asshole,"My wife and I are vacationing at the beach. We walked into a crab shack style restaurant today right on the beach to get some of that sweet sweet seafood. While we were waiting to be served after being seated a family was seated next to us. It was a grandma, grandpa, and grandson. Grandson was around 7-8 years old and was immediately crying and yelling at ear piercing volume at the grandparents about how he “told them that he didn’t want to eat here!” and “didn’t even want to come to the beach!” The doting grandmother was trying to console him and was basically serving as a whipping post. The grandfather was silently eating and not engaging.

At first we ignored him as best we could, but he got progressively louder and louder and was frankly ruining our lunch. I was wearing prescription sunglasses indoors because I left my glasses at our chair by accident and I needed them to see. I was looking at the drink menu that was in this small plastic stand on our table, and as I was the little kid loudly started accusing me of staring at him. Grandma politely asked me not to stare at him, and when I explained that I was reading the menu, she tried to explain to the kid in a “see, it was just a misunderstanding” type of way. The kid was having none of it and proceeded to accuse me of looking at him again about 5 minutes later.

Once he started accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him, and when he would have an outburst I would just move my gaze slightly somewhere else and play dumb. I’m sure it was obvious what I was doing, but it was amusing, and it was tormenting this entitled turd. At one point, when grandma went to the bathroom and grandpa was still I engaged, the kid just turned in his seat and puffed up aggressively and said “I’m not going to tell you to stop staring at me again!” When he did that, I slid my sunglasses down my nose, winked at him over my glasses, and slid them back up, at which point he had a massive meltdown and asked his grandpa to make me stop. 

In a solid and loud outburst Grandpa slammed his fist down on the table and unloaded on the kid about how he had done nothing but bitch for the last 3 hours, stood up, grabbed the kid by the collar and walked him up to the hostess and paid for their meal. Grandma came out of the bathroom shortly after and saw that they were leaving so she left with them. 

My wife was angry that I had fucked with a little kid, despite his behavior. I defended myself, but she says that I wasn’t THE asshole, but I was AN asshole. I maintain that I wasn’t the asshole, though I did inadvertently ruin the lunch of the old folks he was with by spooling him up more than he already was. We’re at an impasse, what’s your verdict Reddit?

Edit: my first gold! Holy shit, thanks Reddit.

AND a platinum?! Awesome!

Now a silver in the mix? Awesome! Thanks Reddit.

Also, some mid-vote reflection. Don’t have long, we’re still on vacation so I’m updating this during my morning routine. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from this AITA is to not gloss over details, because the premise of one of the points I’ve heard a lot here is based on some things I was definitely not clear on. That’s my bad, and I should have been more clear. Hindsight is 20/20, but you live and learn. Just to clarify a few points: 

While the kid was crying at the beginning when he came in, that was short lived, and was over well before I came into the picture. When I said things like “meltdown”, they didn’t involve tears, but anger and yelling. He was pounding his fists on the table, doing that exaggerated hand fold exhale, and yelling/screaming at his grandma. I wasn’t sitting there reducing a child to a blubbering heap of tears and anguish, that would be horrifying and heartbreaking. Poking a very frustrated bear of a kid? Sure. Childishly making someone as uncomfortable as they were making everyone else? Absolutely. Torturing a helpless child into a lifetime of scars and fear? Hardly. That’s partially my fault for using words like “torment”. It was hyperbole and set the wrong tone. 

Also, when I said, “...accusing me of staring at him the second time. I started actually staring at him...” I should have been more clear. I didn’t just sit there and stare at a scared child who was just hoping the scary man would go away. I was eating lunch with my wife, she was my main focus. What was happening was the kid started to alternate between fixating on me and trying to get his grandma to do something or give him something. There were a lot of times over that two hours that he would stare at me and I either wouldn’t notice because I was talking to my wife or I ignored it. Only periodically would I meet his gaze for 10 seconds or so, and then he would have another outburst about how I was looking at him. I’m not trying to change votes or defend myself, I just wanted to clarify on a misconception I’m seeing a lot in comments, and even more in personal messages. 

The other point I should have been more clear on is the timescale in question. From being seated at our table to the other group getting up and leaving was less than 3 hours but more than 2.

Final edit:

Well it appears I have been labeled the asshole. I stand by what I did, but accept the verdict. Many people voted YTA in a supporting manner, so I take it as a win all the same and feel some vindication.

Some lessons were learned. From what I experienced, I do not believe in the slightest that the kid had anything mentally wrong with him, he was just being a brat. That being said, the thought never crossed my mind during the encounter. I’d obviously never dream of taunting or negatively interacting with someone who was autistic. But, again, I have no reason to believe that he was.

Also, should I ever find myself in another AITA situation, I’ll be sure to be as thorough in the description of the situation as possible. I think the outcome of the vote would have been different had I been more precise with my wording and less hyperbolic in my tone. 

Thank you for the gold and platinum redditors, and the supportive messages. To those people who sent messages threatening to harm me, please stop. I’m not interested in your 10 point plan to “get me”. Remember the words of wisdom from the AITA rules, one interaction does not an asshole make. We are all the asshole at some point.",1233,6297,0.95

My daughter apparently found out she was pregnant yesterday. My wife called me in tears telling me about it. We talked about it, obviously I was shocked at this news. We knew that our daughter was having sex with her boyfriend, and we also knew they were using condoms, so all of this was just very shocking to us. I told my wife to call me tomorrow again, and that we can talk about it on Tuesday when I get back. She then got very angry at me, saying it was RIDICULOUS that I wouldn't come home as soon as possible. I just told her, the business trip is important, I cant just miss it unless there is a very serious emergency, and she got very upset at the idea that this wasn't an 'emergency'. Its not. Its obviously extremely worrisome, but its not as if the baby is going to pop out of her tomorrow. She has plenty of time to think of what she is going to do with her kid, and we have plenty of time to discuss it. I talked to my daughter, I didn't even really know what to say, I knew she didn't intend for this to happen. I felt terrible for her.

1113,Everyone Sucks,"My boyfriend and I are both in our early 20's. We have the resumes (and incomes) of people far beyond our age. Our ambition is a fundamental part of our relationship. My boyfriend's dad (also a successful man, but through the slow and careful growth of his career) seems to despise my boyfriend. My S.O and his dad have each sold me privately that they consider their relationship to be ""rocky"". I think rocky is an *understatement.* 

&#x200B;

The first family member that my boyfriend introduced me to was his dad, who took us out to dinner. My S.O. excused himself to go to the restroom, leaving his dad and I alone for a few minutes. *An hour after meeting me for the first time*, his dad took the opportunity to tell me he ""didn't want (me) to take this the wrong way"" but that he was ""very disappointed with (his) son"" and what he had made of his career. I was completely caught off guard and gently and politely responded that my boyfriend the most impressive person I had ever met. I'm not pulling this out of my ass here--my S.O. has started and sold two software companies before 25. I was in shock, but acted normal so as to not ruin the evening. 

&#x200B;

A number of similar incidents have occurred as I've spent more time with his family. My boyfriend is never there when these conversations occur, and they've been getting nastier. The latest incident culminated in my boyfriend's dad sobbing uncontrollably in my arms after ranting about him for an hour and claiming he ""can't find even one good thing to say about him"".

I haven't told my boyfriend about any of this.

I know for a fact that if I tell him, my boyfriend will probably not speak to his father ever again. I suspect he will probably cut off his immediate family for this. I also think the resulting fallout will push his parents to divorce. I like his family and I don't want to ruin them, but I feel like my boyfriend should know. I also worry that all of this will take a toll on my boyfriend's mental health (it sure is affecting mine). I asked my mom and my best friend (also early 20s) for advice. My mom said I should keep this under wraps. My friend said I owe it to my boyfriend to let him know. I'm curious to see if there's a generational divide over if I WBTA.

1114,Not the A-hole,"So I tried posting earlier but went over character limit so I’ll try and stick to the main details. 

We just came back from a family vacation in which we also rent a boat for a few days and split the cost by 3. The breakdown has always been as follows: my single dad (who uses the boat the most by far and is always the one that wants to rent one/fishing), my sister and brother in law and their 3 kids, and my family which consists of me and my 3 kids. 

SO and I have been together 5 years now and after about 2 or so years started blending our families permanently without (and never) getting married. He also has 2 kids from previous marriage. It’s been tough figuring out holidays, custody times, living arrangements, vacations, etc with 5 kids but we do the best we can. 

This year was the first time they were able to come (its longer than his custody time is so it’s been hard in the past but we made every effort and it’s happening from now on). I don’t want to start a precedent moving forward cause we’ll all be going again in the future and it’s an expensive boat. So my sister texted my dad and I that they had the breakdown per family for the boat. She gave the amount and said, “So this is what we each owe divided by 4 families.”  

Yes, we’re not a family in the same sense that she and her husband and kids are. Yes, we were 2 separate families when we first met, but I consider us a couple just as they are. If we were married she wouldn’t say “per family” and that insults me.  There are 5 paying/working adults here: dad, sister/BIL, and me/SO. So why are we dividing by 4?

1115,Asshole,"I live on a creek and have no yard so I have to walk him to use the bathroom. The creek I live on is not one people swim in or anything, seeing as there is no real bank. It's down about 6 feet from the surface where you walk and there's no way to get down to it, so people don't do anything except walk by it. Also it is lined with trees, which creates a pretty dense foliage of tall grass, kudzu, and other viney messy undergrowth. When the city mows that area, they don't cut or maintain the undergrowth. So it just flourishes like crazy all along the creek. 

My dog has always been the type to hide when he poops so he goes into all the brush to do his business. I don't think I have to clean it up because you can't even see it since it's in all the foliage from the trees and brush that line the creek. Plus, its difficult for a person to even get to it. But the other day someone happened to be walking in the area and was super passive aggressive about how I just walked off after he pooped, but like I said, you can't even see it. There's no way someone would step in it and unless you saw him pooping, you wouldn't even know it was there since he basically burrows into the undergrowth. If he poops outside of the brush, then I always clean it up because people walk there and I'm not a dick. But I don't think I have to when its essentially buried in kudzu and tall grass that you can't even walk into. 

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: okay, so I didn't know dog poop was harmful to the environment. Thank you for pointing that out. I really do appreciate the knowledge. I just thought dog poop was the same as any other animals poop, but it makes sense since they don't have the same diet as wild animals. Also, for those that have mentioned the leash thing, he is always leashed. He just walks into the kudzu patch to do his business. And I do pick up his shit if he goes outside of the kudzu/ undergrowth, I just never did it if he went in that since I didn't think it was a problem because I didn't know it was harmful to the environment.

Everyone was surprised but not as surprised as my sister in law who, in the beginning of the conversation, kept mentioning her organic shopping and how it can be pricey. She told me to try to shop only at Aldi’s for a month, organic only and see how I like it. I just brushed it off and kind of laughed saying nah, I’m okay I don’t really understand that kind of stuff.

Fast forward to two days ago, when I had my appointment. Turns out my symptoms line up pretty good with the cerebellum growth causing this so I need surgery. We were more concerned with getting this taken care of asap so I could stop having these headaches and other symptoms so we went with the first day available.

My daughter who is now 11 has played since the game was released. My son who is 7 has just recently begun playing. Even their Mother has the game and joins in from time to time. 

Last week on our vacation to northern Germany (Hamburg and Kiel) we stayed at a hotel that has a park close by or so it would appear from the map in Pokemon GO. The park had many poke-stops and my kids asked if we could go there. I told them we could do so the next day before we drove on. 

Next day as we walked to the park I quickly realized it was a cemetery. I got second thoughts about our plan and told my wife I was not sure if it would be appropriate to hunt for pokemons at a cemetery.  My kids did not understand my issue with this nor did my wife. So, I agreed to do one round. 

We stayed there for about 30 minutes. The kids caught some new pokemons and so did I. The whole time I was not comfortable about my decision. The cemetery was very beautiful. There was even a WW1 memorial (guess they are all over the place in Germany). We only encountered 10-12 people. Besides playing Pokemon GO I think we acted very respectfully. No running around.

I told her I would and she thanked me and also asked if I could keep this from our parents. 

I didn’t really agree with the second request. I assumed she already told them and i told her I didn’t think it was a good idea. I also told her I’m uncomfortable being involved if they didn’t know, because if they found out, they would be *extremely* pissed at **me** for hiding it from them. She said she didn’t want to get in trouble, and that she’s not going to tell them.

Basically 
   I've had a major surgery to help deal with chronic pains and now I'm going through the after stage where I have to take daily medication for help with the afterpain. (Ironic). If I don't take the medication I enter the worst stage of pain imaginable. Walking isn't impossible, but sometimes the pain is unimaginable and become kinda stiff. However, I've made sure to not let this be a reason to be lazy and have been picking up my medicine (pharamarcy), doing my part of the daily house (well apartment) chores. 


One night I need to pick up a new batch from the pharmacy. I asked if she could please go pick up my medicine (I had listed her as someone who was able to pick up my medicine for me, so no problems). It was mid-afternoon and she refused. Through tears I asked her to please go because I felt my limbs going a bit stiff. She huffed and said no because ""I don't feel like doing my hair"". I told her that no one would care how she looks. The pain started to kick in and she got annoyed by me crying so she left to the living room. I called a friend who worked at the pharmacy and asked if she could please deliever my medication and would pay her back for the favor. She was hesitant but did come through and I am forever grateful (idk if she could've lost her job or not or how that works). I tried to talk to her about how I was pain and that it wasn't fair what she did. The ignored me and said that I was being dramatic because she experiences pain every month and that I should ""get used to it"". 

A week later or so, my gf wakes me up in the middle of the night. She's crying and I turn on the lights and the sheets are the flag of Japan. I know that periods are uncontrollable so I'm not angry, we've been through this before. She's crying that I need to go buy her pads, get her some midol/painkillers and to get comfort foods. The usual. I grab the sheets for the washing machine. She gets out the shower and quickly starts to cry again and looks at me confused, ""you didn't go buy the stuff?"". I calmly answer her no and she gets angry and tells me that she's in pain and that she NEEDS the relief and doesn't want to bleed everywhere. I walked to the living room and told her ""I did not say I would go. I don't feel like doing my hair. And you experience pain every month. You should be used to it."".


AITA for doing what she did to me to her? Some of her friends are telling me that a period is different from surgery and that I should never refuse to get her things - especially pain helpers.

1125,Not the A-hole,"Last year I took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. 

Anyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. The ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love."" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

My sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

I also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

Edit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people.

Today they wanted to make me a smoothie and were being evasive about what they wanted to put in it.  So finally they admitted that they wanted to put lemon and lime juice in it. I said that was fine and went upstairs to take a shower and left my husband downstairs with the kids. 

Came down and the kids handed me a smoothie.  Smelled ok. I asked what was in it as a went to take a sip and my kid said she put cheese in it. It hit my mouth and oh god.  It was rancid.  I immediately vomited twice and was so pissed off that they would trick me into drinking something so bad. 

It had Parmesan cheese in it with pickles and lemon and lime juice mixed with fruit and yogurt. Because I took a long shower, it began to ferment and curdle.  Rotten toe jam is the best description I can give.

1128,Not the A-hole,"Good Afternoon everyone,

For the past six years, my father has been dealing with a wide array of medical issues - he suffered a stroke, had his left foot/leg amputated due to Diabetes (below the knee), is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and is on Dialysis three times per week. He currently lives in the Houston, TX area and I am in the D.C. area. My family consists of me (daughter), my mother, and three of brothers (one of whom has passed away.).

He has asked me to visit him several times and due to what he has put my family through, I am very reluctant. Here is a brief of his wrongdoings:

1) As a teenager (me), he cheated on my mother and emptied $70,000 worth of money from their joint checking account to spend on the other woman.

2) He did not pay the mortgage and got us evicted twice - once from our house, the other from an apartment.

3) He stole $32,000 from my brother and subsequently committed identity theft by forging his signature on bank documents.

4) He left me and my mother without heat for several Winters.

5) He stole $7,000 from my other brother's 401 k. This brother has cut off contact with everyone from our family.

6) He did not pay taxes for 5+ years which resulted in my mother's credit score being ruined; she is also having issues with the IRS, but thankfully they are working with her.

To give you a bit more of a background on me; At the age of 11, my oldest brother passed away. I believe this was the start of my father's issues. He has never forgiven himself and is full of regret. My father coached softball, housed and fed me, and was very supportive throughout my childhood. He helped me with buying my first car. I love him dearly and HATE seeing him in pain.

At the same time, I can not get over what he did to my mother and brothers -- he left us for another woman. He chose to move to Texas to live with his brother (my Uncle who passed away). He left us in the cold. He has never apologized for his wrong choices nor will he admit to anything. Now, his days are spent in bed or at the hospital where he is on Dialysis.

I feel unbelievably guilty for having never visited him in all these years. I spoke to my mother about it and she has essentially stated that he made his own bed and that he does not have anyone because of his choices in life. Still, I feel like the worst daughter alive.  I don't think I am looking for validation - if I am, I apologize.  I really just don't know how to feel.

Skip to now and he has a GREAT paying job, makes a good amount of money, way more than me and has more hours he can work (I'm in school, he is not). Whenever I'm getting close to the end of a pay period and I don't have much money left, or can't afford something, or ask if he minds chipping in, he often throws my savings in my face saying that I have way more money than he does total. Which is true, but I don't touch my savings and otherwise live paycheck to paycheck.  


I was talking to my older sister about this and how him doing that bothers me and she was somewhat empathetic. Eventually she asked me how much I had saved up and she went off on me about how I have no right to say I'm broke and my boyfriend is in the right and she never wants to hear me say I'm too broke for something or to do something because some people actually have to live paycheck to paycheck with no savings and not everyone had the financial guidance I did as a kid. I'm not sure where she got that from since we grew up together (She's only two years older). And how I'm above for having saved my money from working when I was 15. To be clear, my entire savings is money that I earned from when I was 15-18 up until I moved out. It has not grown or diminished as I do live paycheck to paycheck from bills having moved out. It's admittedly nice to have that fall back and I know not everyone is able to have or do that, but I worked for it.  


My sister is very well capable of having a savings account as she inherited a home from when our uncle passed and didn't go to college but rather a trade. Basically, she makes more money than me as I'm in college and pays very very low rent for the home since it's through family. And as for my boyfriend, he CHOSE to not work for an entire year where he could've been saving or even just making money. But now it's two people against me for it so I just wanna know, AITA?",56,62,0.87
1130,No A-holes here,"So I’ve been thinking pretty heavily about this and am legitimately on the fence.

I started talking to this girl about a month ago now. Things have been going well for the most part, a couple of disagreements sure, but it’s good overall. 

Ive brought her around my friends a few times and she’s personable enough to get along with most people. Apparently when I brought her to a work happy hour, she started saying how much she likes the environment and people and has been asking to apply here.

Now I’m not a selfish person by any means, if anything I’m the opposite and extremely giving and empathetic (possibly to a fault). My reason for telling her I don’t want her to apply here is mainly the fact that this is the main thing I have on a daily basis that’s my own. I wouldn’t say my work and personal life are completely separate, but having someone who I’m anticipating spending a lot of time around in an intimate fashion working with me on a day to day just seems like a recipe for disaster. Worst case scenario we suffocate each other and proceed to have to communicate and see each other on a day to day? In my opinion, it feels like a huge invasion of my individual space. 

Another point, I work at a FinTech company and she has a law degree from an Ivy League school. Our legal team is microscopic and she has the opportunity to get her foot at the door at a solid firm in my city. Besides my personal feelings, seems like it would be a detrimental move to her career path.

1131,Not the A-hole,"I've worked at this place for around 6 years, and have had to put up with bullying from senior salesmen, a boss who consistently disappears for days/weeks at a time without notice, an office which is suffering from rot and damp, and despite being the only one who is fully qualified to do each departments job, remained severely underpaid.

So I gave my notice and quit (the contract is now terminated, I am no longer in their employ), and now they have plonked a fresh faced 18 year old in my old seat and are asking me to come in during the week (they've offered a one off payment) to train the new guy.

My new job doesnt start for a couple of weeks so I have the time, but I loathe the idea of giving them any more of it. I feel bad that the new kid is going to have a harder go of it without me, but I dont feel that that should be my problem?

1132,No A-holes here,So I’m new to Reddit. Thought I try it out. Recently I lost my baby at 21 weeks about a month ago. Most moms out there know 21 one weeks is pretty far into a pregnancy. I have been heartbroken and angry since then. I do not want anyone to mention baby talk to me. Am I the ass hole for asking close family/friends to not or show me anything baby related. I feel guilty at times for asking them not to mention baby stuff knowing they might not mean bad but at the same time I am still so very hurt and find it insensitive when someone close to me who knows my loss still chooses to talk about babies.

1133,No A-holes here,"I was upset when she got catcalled, but I didn't defend her because I was afraid of a confrontation/fight. After a few minutes, she got mad at me for not defending her.

Did I make a mistake? Should I have defended her? I apologized initially, but should I bring up another conversation or just let it go?

1134,Not the A-hole,"So, I have a decent amount of animals, and I live at home with my parents (19M). Not great at posting and on mobile.

I recently underwent top surgery, which puts me out of commission for most these pets for a bit. I asked my mom (and by extention) dad, to care for my pets for me while I was recovering; which they agreed to and I showed them what to do. The one thing they had to do for 6 cages of reptiles/amphibians, was spray them down. It's very simple and takes at most 5 minutes if done right.
They're also taking care of the dog that I mainly care for (which is dubbed ""My Dog""). Thankfully, the story doesn't have to deal with him.


Every single day I'd confirm with them that the reptiles and amphibians cages were sprayed down twice a day (morning and night), which received a positive response.

However, after my check up, I was allowed to do more activities which included going to the reptile room on the third floor. Upon inspection, I noticed that 2 of my frogs had passed away due to dehydration and the enclosure was bome dry. Along with one cage open enough for one of my geckos to escape (and a door leading outside open). Naturally I'm upset and confront them about it.

I told them that I found my frogs dead due to dehydration and my gecko had escaped.
What they said shocked me in that: ""they knew they died but didn't want to tell me just yet"" so instead I found out on my own. And then found out that they knew about the situation, but didn't tell me.
I can see the reasoning why, but makes it worse that I didn't know right away and would have much preferred knowing.

That conversation went on and I was eventually the one my parent (not parents, my dad was mostly silent) blamed for the dehydration and escape. I ended up getting angry, so it was more of a heated conversation. I don't remember exactly what was said besides playing the blame game (that was most the conversation).

Note: I did ask for possible compensation, for the $120 frogs and $200 gecko, but was ignored. I wasn't expecting it, but it would have been nice. (I asked before things got heated btw). As that's the costs of both animals.
That was a no go appearently.


My mom's in a bad mood now and is blaming me for her mood. Saying that I should apologize for being ""so mean"" and that she's stressed and tired. And that I should think about how I've been treating her.

1135,Not the A-hole,"On Thursday I went to see Avengers:  Endgame.  I hadn’t seen it yet due to travel and work schedule so I was really excited.  My wife and I went to a 10pm showing, it was almost empty so it was really nice.

About half way through the movie my phone rings.  It’s my best friend, Steve.  I knew he was out at the bar so I figured he was just drunk calling me to talk shit about some girl he took home.  I ignore the call and keep watching.

The calls keep coming, 3, 4, 5 calls.  Now I’m pretty sure dude is just drunk and being an asshole.  My wife asks me who the fuck keeps calling and I tell her Steve.  She tells me I should answer it but I said fuck that I’m watching endgame, Steve is fine.

Fast forward to this morning, I call Steve, but he doesn’t answer.  30 minutes later I get a call from his mom.  He’s been in jail since Thursday for DUI.  The Sheriff let him call me from his phone to bail him out, but since I didn’t answer he sat in jail until this morning when his parents found him after panic calling every jail and hospital for 3 days.

So I got really serious about losing weight in May of 2018 and been working hard since. About 2 months ago I started going to the gym daily to do aqua-aerobics. It allows me to burn myself out and not stress some of my mess up joints.

Well a few days ago the gym had a few people beyond us taking the class in the pool. The set up is at either end the pool there are dressing rooms, one side has the Men's Dressing Room with a shower next to the door and a bench next to the shower so you can place something to keep it dry as you shower off. Well as I head to the dressing room the whole bench and the area around it is full. A woman has 3 teenage kids sitting on the bench with stuff all around it covering everything.

As I walk closer I notice the woman has her back to everyone and is holding up a towel in front of her. I wonder, huh, what is that - until I notice a pair of blond little pigtails pop up and it strikes me.

The woman is holding a towel so her little girl could change RIGHT NEXT TO THE MEN'S ROOM!!! On the other side on the pool there is a huge sign that says Woman's Dressing Room, and next to it FAMILY DRESSING ROOM - and next to them was another bench with shower- which were sitting totally empty.

As I walk up the woman give me a dirty look. I mention to her that there is a dressing room right on the other side she could be using and that changing her daughter in front of the men's dressing room was not the best place to be doing this.

I didn’t ask for it but she gave it to me because she did one and a bunch of people in my family did it and they all think it’s super fun. I was super polite and said something like “thank you this will be cool to see the lineage” and just went home, put it away in my desk and forgot about it. 

Personally, I don’t agree with ancestry tests because you’re giving your DNA to a private company and there’s been reports of them doing shady things with it like selling it and what not. I’m a very private person and I don’t want anyone to have my DNA.

My grandmother called me the other day just to talk and during the conversation she asked if I did the test yet. I told her no I hadn’t gotten around to it yet. She said that my grandfather did one and he’s excited to see both his and my results because I’m his only grandchild and he hasn’t spoken to my mom (his daughter) in 10+ years, so he just has a closer connection to me. I think I upset my grandmother  because I haven’t done it yet and it’s been 6+ months since she gave it to me.

1143,Not the A-hole,"So after some weeks talking about how we both really wanted to play legend of zelda botw, me and my roommate decided to buy a switch together. We previously bought a playstation together which worked out fine, we never have any arguments about using it etc. We would share the cost of the switch and game 50/50. Do note: we could easily afford to buy one on our own but we sharing seemed more sensible. 

I had a day off and he didn't, so we decided I'd go to the store and call him about what options they had. The guy at the store basically told me they had 2 options, a second-hand system and a brand new system. The 2nd hand one was 20 dollars cheaper and had gray controllers, the new one had blue/red controllers.

So after the guy explained all the stuff about warranty (6 months) and such he asked me which one I wanted and I told him I needed to call my roommate first. I tried calling him twice, but he didn't pick up his phone, so I was like fuck it I'll buy the 2nd hand one as it was cheaper and I preferred gray controllers.

About an hour later my roommate called me to ask why I called and I told him I went ahead and bought the second hand version etc. Basically, he got mad at me for buying something without consulting him first and for buying the second hand one because it was only 20 dollars cheaper than a brand new one. He then said he didn't want to pay his share anymore and I told him all right that's fine. 

I don't actually care that I have to pay for it myself because I can easily afford to. He and I are still friends, I'm just not gonna let him use the switch.

1146,No A-holes here,"I'm currently 40 and have two older siblings. My dad died about 7 years ago. My mom is in her late 60s. 

Mom would occasionally refer to how marriage was a storybook marriage: the Facebook version of a happy life. Parents were married at 18 and together for almost 45 years. Mom was understandably devastated when he passed. He'd been having some major health problems for years so my siblings and I all knew it was coming. She is very much is into avoiding any sort of conflict and sugar-coating her world so I think it did really blindside her when he finally died. Similar to how she can't even understand that her current health problems will likely get the best of her sooner rather than later. Though, I've been surprised before: I didn't think she'd make it a year after Dad died.

When my dad died my mom kinda shut down. She had a small income and burned through about half a million in life insurance over the next 3 or 4 years. My sister and I kept advising her to sell her house and downsize but she just couldn't do it. Eventually the stress got to her and she had a heart attack. My wife and I dropped everything and drove halfway across the country for a month to see her and help out. 

While we were there my wife and I went by the house to see what she would need to get rid of. She had done an estate sale which had gotten rid of almost all of the furniture but the 3 car garage was pretty much entirely full of boxes. It took us over a week in 100 degree heat but we went through every single box in that garage to find and save any important stuff.

One of the things we did find was a journal my Dad had written in. He had purchased it when I was 14 and wrote in it very occasionally over the span of about 3 years. There are 14 entries in the journal over that span. It's written in such a way that he never expected anybody else to ever read it. 

It's really, really negative. He obviously treated this as some sort of catharsis at a low point in his life. He writes about how awful his life is. How his wife is stupid and useless and spends way too much money. How his kids have no respect for him. How he can't do anything because they take all his money. While I always was positive on my father I actually gained a ridiculous amount of respect for him reading that journal.

I think this journal would destroy my mom. My wife and I spoke about it after we both read it and decided not to tell her about the journal. We took it back home with us after we left. My mom was able to short-sell the house and buy a small house next to my sister. As her health is getting worse she's now sold that house and moved in with my sister. She's spent a large chunk of the past year in the hospital or in rehab. She has a lot of physical health problems including a kidney cancer that is complicating things.

So, Reddit, I ask you this: Am I the asshole for never telling my mother about my father's secret journal? (full story in comments)

**EDIT: Thanks, everyone. We were pretty sure that it had been the right decision but it came up again between my wife and I in conversation last night when we were reading some awesome AITA posts together, so I decided to write it up. I have never journeled before and many in the comments helped me understand why he likely wrote in the journal. I assume it just got put on a bookshelf and he forgot about it for the next 16ish years until he died and it happened to get moved to a box during the estate sale.

1149,Not the A-hole,"So, some background info and backstory.

At my job we have a mobile coupon that saves customers $1.50 when they two packs of cigarettes. The ONLY prerequisite is that you download our mobile app and opt into tobacco promotions. I've seen customers do it in less than 5 minutes. However, for customers that are less tech savvy or simply forgot their phones in their cars, I ""lend"" them my mobile coupon because I don't smoke and I want them to come back because the promotion does bring people into the store.

So, in walks this one elderly [60s or late 50s] gentleman. I don't know his name, but I'll call him Boomer. He asks for two packs of the cigarettes that go with the mobile coupon. I had a previous interaction with Boomer where he comes up and simply demanded my coupon, citing he had a ""flip phone"" and ""didn't have that sh*t"" and being very entitled sounding. That time I did give it to him to be professionally courteous and I just went with the rule of ""everybody gets one"" and I did just give them out essentially.

Flashforward now to this interaction and he's asks  if the promotion is still available. I say yes it is and  ask if he has the app for the coupon, literally the only prerequisite. He again spouts the same response: ""I have a flip phone, dude. I ain't got time for that sh*t"". So, in my most customer service type voice, I tell him that I cannot give him the coupon/promotion. He then points to my phone that I wear on my belt clip and says: ""There's a phone right there."" To which I reply, not breaking tone: ""My phone doesn't work for entitled people."" To which he got upset and restated his reasons as well as: ""Other people do it for me here, why don't you?"" I didn't say anything else to him as I rang him up for the normal price, to which he still paid for and left without saying anything else back. 

Afterwards, my knees were shaking and I felt this guilt hit my chest. I'm usually not a confrontational guy and I want people to like me. So, I'm looking to reddit to make sure

One morning, my GF got very very sick pretty much out of the blue; sick enough that I had to take her to Urgent Care. I can’t remember what she was sick with, but we were there all morning. In the early afternoon, they cleared us to go home. We lived in the same city as her parents, so I took her to their place as she wanted to just relax at home and get some mom-care. 

As she was still recovering, all she really wanted to do was sleep. I figured that’s fine; she’s been cleared by the doctor and has her mom here in case anything happens. I asked if she’d be ok with me going to the gym, she said yes, so I went for about an hour. She was sound asleep when I came back, and I spent the rest of the afternoon there with her and her mom until she was ready to go back to our place.

So, she was fine with me going, but she told me later that her mom thought it was shitty of me to ‘abandon’ her while she was sick. In my defense, she was ok with it, she was asleep the whole time I was gone, and her mom was there in case anything else happened. So, AITA?",42,172,0.85

1152,Not the A-hole,"A couple of years ago, my brother and I entered Job Corps together after becoming homeless.   My brother was always a much slower learner than me though, so I went through the program and graduated and moved on in 10 months or so.

They moved to the opposite side of the state from me, which was closer to her family, and seemed to be doing fine.  I got a call from my brother one night a few months later explaining how he was struggling to get by in the area that he was in and he needed help.   I had an extra bedroom and we lived in a better area for jobs and whatnot.  I brought them back to the trailer and settled and started helping them get jobs.  My wife got the girlfriend a job at the convenience store she worked at and I got my brother a job at the fabrication shop down the road.

I told them upon moving in that I didn't expect much in terms of payment due to their baby being due soon.  I wanted to allow them to save up as much money as they could to provide for themselves and the child in their own setting eventually.  I told them both that the only thing I expected is that they act as decent human beings, do nothing illegal, and keep the trailer clean and livable to an extent.  This specifically included keeping dishes clean since we didn't have very many to begin with.

After a while they started slacking off on the cleaning.  I kind of blew it off and just let it be equated to the stress that they were under.  After another month or so, though, it got continually worse.  I got to the point where I laid out specific dishes that were to only be used by my wife and I and the rest were ones they could use, but had to keep clean.  They refused to keep them clean.

One day, I was looking through the dishes and I noticed that there were several plates and cups with mold now growing on them.  There were also small bugs crawling all over them and flying around them.  I waited until my brother got home from work that night and confronted him and his girlfriend about it.  I reiterated that I had told them plenty of times that I expect the dishes to be clean and the house to be in a livable manner EVERYWHERE.  He then tried to throw the blame on me saying that I dirtied some of those dishes and that I should have to clean them, not him.  I told him that I need him to wash the dishes because it's becoming a health risk with the mold and bugs, especially since I had pets and he had a pregnant girlfriend.  He again refused saying he's not going to clean the dishes. He then said that he'd do half the dishes and just leave the rest for me.  I told him that I'm not bargaining and they need to be done.  He again refused and scolded me for being unfair.  At that point I had had enough and I said that if he doesn't want to live by my rules he can just leave.

I thought about it and tried to think of her point of view and am now worried about confiding in my friends about it if maybe I'm wrong and I'm the asshole.

So I live in Thailand and if any of you who's been here know that this place has alot of street vendors and people selling pork, chicken on skewers. Since I've been vegan for almost 2 years I now avoid these kinds of vendors obviously but I never try to make anyone feel bad about eating meat. I live by a I just do me and you do you attitude. 

Anyway on my way out of my house I thought I'd stop by a convenient store to get some food and I pass by one of these vendors. (This vendor is a regular and since I lived here I used to see her all the time) before I moved to college (2 years ago) I used to buy food from her often (she sells barbecue skewers -kind of like kebabs- and she also sells rice that she grills) since I became vegan I started to stop buying meat from her and only buying the rice since it still tastes pretty good despite. 

She had a man that was helping her so I asked him if he had any rice left. They only had about 5 or so skewers left since it was pretty late. He showed that he had 3 left so I ordered 2. (I had my big smile on since I havent eaten food from her for about 2 years now) she proceeded to say (translated)

Vendor : ""She only comes here to buy rice shes asking how much we have""

Me : ""Yes can I have 2 please""

Vendor : ""You only come here to buy rice all the time I cant sell it to you""

Me : ""I dont understand.. why not?""

Vendor : ""Save it for the people who order meat""

Me : ""Ohh I dont eat meat that's why-""

Vendor : ""No I cant sell it to you you only buy rice""

Me : ""I can pay you more for it since I'm not ordering the meat"" 

Vendor : ""No it's not about the money""

Me : ""So why cant I buy it??""

Vendor : ""Because you never give me service you only buy rice""

Me : ""Ok..? I'll just have 1 then?""

She kept aggressively preparing the rice still saying the same thing so I told her again I dont eat meat if she sells grilled vegetables or mushrooms (like most other vendors do now) I'd buy more from her. She says Its not worth it that I'm just buying rice. And kept not listening to me and giving me such a horrible attitude. She wouldnt even look at me while she was talking all the while I had a smile on my face to stop myself from calling her a piece of shit.

The other man just kind of sat down slowly like ""nope not getting into this""

I went through alot of scenarios about what to do should I buy a meat skewer as well as the rice and just give it to a dog? Should I buy 5 skewers  1 rice and just leave the meat on the floor infront of her face??? In the end I decided she doesnt deserve any of my money and walked away without buying anything.

It ruined my whole appetite anyway.

AITA for walking away and thinking that she is totally unreasonable?

Edit: Alot of people seem to have some misunderstandings about this. Ill try to clear some up...
1. Vendor sells meat for 10-15 baht per stick (Grilled- No grilled)
Vendor sells rice for 5 baht per 1 serving (Grilled -No grilled)
Its just one serving of sticky rice grilled. To me that is a meal and not a side dish that comes with the meat. 
2. I offered to pay her 20 baht for 1 rice grilled since she made me feel bad about not making it worth her while to sell me the rice (And i wanted to know what the hell she wanted from me) she continued to say no no no and say its not about the money. So i was at a loss of what to do to solve the situation. I didnt want to fight her and im not stingy about money if that was all she needed (when you live in thailand you learn to do that as to not get in trouble) and i felt bad, she obviously wasnt making much money selling meat for 10 baht even tho her stall was almost empty anyhow but i wouldve helped her if she wanted it.
3. Idk why it matters or maybe because there might be the factor of cultural difference but I'm Thai.
Tl;dr : Vendor refuses to sell me rice since I'm vegan and wont buy her meat.",97,55,0.69

A week ago I won 2 VIP tickets for a big sports event and decided to take my Girlfriend to the event, she doesn‘t like the sport but I thought It‘d be a really nice experience since those tickets included all you can drink + eat in a really fancy environment. 
When I received the tickets I realized that those tickets weren‘t VIP tickets but ‚only‘ premium ones.
At first I didn‘t know if I should contact the operator of the raffle but my girlfriend told me I should at least try so I did.
Luckily they apologized for sending the wrong tickets and send me the VIP ones, they told me I can do whatever I want with the tickets I already got.
Those tickets were already sold out so I decided to sell them for basically half the original price since I thought someone’d surely be happy.
Given that I was the one who won the tickets I thought it‘d be obvious that I keep the money from the sold tickets. 
She wasn‘t happy about my decision to keep the money from the 2 sold tickets because ‚one ticket was hers‘ and she wants the money from ‚her‘ ticket.
I told her that I‘m already taking her to the VIP Area for FREE and that I‘ll pay for the transportation cost so basically she has a 300€+ experience for free. 
After arguing a bit she called me an asshole because I don‘t see why she should get the money, not that I won‘t give it to her, I just don‘t see why she should be getting the money.

TL;DR: I won VIP Tickets for a sports event, they sent me the wrong ones and after calling them they send me the VIP tickets.
After selling the ‚wrong‘  tickets my Girlfriend, with which I wanted to go to the event, demands me to give her half the money since 
‚on of the tickets is hers‘. 



Edit 1: Sorry for not making it clear from the beginning.
Her argument is that since she told me to contact the operator of the raffle I owe her one of the premium tickets because I wouldn‘t even have the VIP tickets without her.


Edit 2 (for context): We‘re in a relationship for 2 years now and she never even showed a sign of beeing a ‚gold digger‘ so I guess I‘ll just keep an extra eye on that.",107,519,0.96

1156,Not the A-hole,"So friday evening around 6PM I decided to have some friends over for a saturday night 7:30PM to hang out. I text 4 friends and all 4 of them say they are going to come. I tell them that I'll buy beers if they buy snacks.

Saturday comes around and at lunch 1 dude says he cant make it.  Ok, cool. That's fine as long as he told me.  I ask the other three guys if they can still make yet. They all say, ""Yes, I am coming""   One guy, Jr, even says ""Yes, I'll be there and I'll bring wings for everyone""  Again, I sent them my address and told them to show up around 7:30PM.  

7PM rolls around and the first guy shows up early.  I was already getting the beers set on counter and bring out some snacks and food I bought.  Then, the one guy who said that he would bring wings text again and says,""I'm running late"".   That's no big deal. It's just a chill hang out night.

Well, then 8PM rolls around, the 9PM, then 10PM and then 11PM and the two other guys never show up.  I keep texting them and asking where they are.  No answer.

Then at 11:30 I text them both and says, ""Mel, thanks for not coming over loser. Jr, thanks for blowing me off a second time and also for not bringing the wings. Fuck you.  I'll keep all this beer and snacks for myself""

Jr messages back and says, ""dude, I'm almost there, I've got the wings and everything""

I said for him to just turn around and go home. I'm over it and dont want them to come over so late. Im already tired and just because he is ready to hang out doesnt mean I wanna hang for another 4 hrs.

He responded by saying that its not his fault I texted him last minute about hanging out and that he already had a busy day planned so that's why he was late.  He also stated that he told me he would be late and he disnt know when the party would end. I didnt feel like I texted him last minute since I texted him the day before and he also said he would be there.

1157,Not the A-hole,"I'm new to Reddit, so I'm sorry if this post(which is my first) is written horribly.

Just for some background, I am a 17 year old African-American female about to enter my last year of high school before going to college. My mom is African-American, raised in Georgia, and my dad is African, raised in Nigeria. 

My entire life, my father has been closed off, harsh, and unloving to me, my brother, and my mother. He has never viewed anything I've done as good enough or worthy of his time no matter how hard I try. I get a 95 on a test? Get a 100 next time. I earn one of the highest spots in my band through hard work and practice? Doesn't even know what instrument I play. I get a 32 on the ACT? Get a 36 next time.

Not only does he disregard all of my accomplishments, he constantly disrespects and belittles my mother, chiefly because of what the culture he comes from has taught him. He honestly believes that she should be seen and not heard, despite everything that she has done for him, including taking care of him through the four years of chemotherapy he went through due to contracting leukemia. 

He's never gone as far as to hit her, but I'm afraid that he would if she ever tried to divorce him, things would go south quickly. He did hit me as a child, but only when I'd acted up some kind of way.

My mother insists that I'm far too hard on him, but I've long since lost respect for him after hearing the way he treats to her. Am I The Asshole for wanting to cut ties with him after I finish college?",453,1566,0.94
1158,Not the A-hole,"First, I wanna throw out that I don't hate dogs/animals. I consider myself a generally caring person for all creatures and I've owned plenty of dogs prior to this. 

So, my SO and I have been together for a little over 2 years. This past April, we bought a house together and moved in. Prior to this, he was staying at my place most of the time anyway and his dog (small breed mut, if that makes any difference) just stayed at his apartment because I couldn't have dogs in my place. 

He's a nurse now and we met when he was finishing up nursing school. His schedule was hectic and things were all over the place. Needless to say, his dog ended up having free range of the apartment and it was absolutely disgusting. (On top of the fact my SO is not the cleanest person to begin with). 

 I work full time 5 days a week, and I'm a full time student online as well. We also found out that I'm expecting and due in Dec. I have zero energy most days but still have my own circus I've got to work on. I also primarily handle all of the housework minus my SO pitching in sometimes. 


So. We've been in the house 3 months. Pupper still has accidents all the time even when we take him out as often as we can, but he'll opt to go in the house instead. We've gotten to where we have to keep all the doors closed or he'll make a mess in whatever room didn't get closed off. There's a few other behavioral problems, but this is by far the biggest issue. I cannot stand the smell of dog pee yet almost every day, I'm having to clean it up or wash something because of it. My SO knows about all these problems yet seems relatively aloof and okay with how things are. 

Also, last week my SO took him to the vet and there's nothing physiologically wrong with him, so it's 100% a psychological thing. 

So, am I the asshole for telling my SO that he needs to dedicate the time to retraining his dog or we need to find someone who will?",206,1265,0.95

However, she is forced to work nearly 60-70 hours per week. The extra time she works she isnt paid for, so in total she is technically being paid well below minimum wage. She has told me her mentors are very unappreciative and harsh, and I can tell this job has taken a toll on her. Her job ends in 2 weeks, but last night I felt I couldnt see her like this, so I sent an email to the dean of research and student affairs. The email basically mentioned what I told you all above, and I explained that I found it very hypocritical how a university that prides itself on student health can allow such an environment to exist. I told my sister about it and she was very angry that I sent an email without talking to her about it, saying she will now have to deal with consequences from her mentor if he finds out. My mom feels the same way and took it further saying the professor may give her a bad recommendation out of spite, but my dad says I did the right thing.

When the kids were younger, before wrapping their presents I would “field strip” them — open the box, cut any zip ties, remove extra tape, take out any of those diabolical screwed-to-plastic-plates-on-cardboard fasteners, install batteries if required, etc. then put it all back in the original box and wrap it. My idea was that the kids could just open the box and start playing immediately. My wife thinks ITA because being the first person to open the gift is part of what makes gifts special.

1161,Not the A-hole,"So my grad party was yesterday and my grandma decided to put up this hideous picture of my that I told her WEEKS in advance not to put up. When I arrived and saw the picture I took it down and put it in the back room because like I said the picture is ugly and I dont want it up. A few minutes later my grandma noticed and asked me to put it back, I said no, I told her weeks in advance not to put it up and it's an ugly picture.

 She then says, ""Atleast let me make one decision"" which is fucking BULLSHIT because she made all the decisions, and I mean ALL the decisions. She decided the date  (july 27th) which I told her was way too late considering I graduated May 19th but she said she didnt care and she already picked the date and it's not changing, she also picked the time (1-6pm) which I told her was WAYYY TOO LONG and even I wouldnt wanna be at my own party for 6 hours but again she said she didnt care and made that the time anyway. She also picked the dessert, I told her not to get cake and to just get cookies or icecream because I dont like cake, well guess what she got, cake. She also picked the decorations and the room (she moved the party to an unnecessarily large room without asking me after we agreed on the smaller room). I literally got to make NO DECISIONS.

 After I take it down she starts complaining to guests who then HARRASS ME TO PUT IT BACK UP. I don't mean politely asking, I mean asking once and when I say no they keep pushing basically demanding I put it back up. Atleast 5 people did this and I got annoyed and gave them all a firm ""no I got to make 0 decisions with this party so the one decision on making is that picture isnt going up"" then about an hour and a half into the party my priest shows up goes into the backroom and PUTS THE PICTURE BACK UP. He then comes up to me and starts going off telling me not to take it down again and it's a pretty picture I tell him it's an ugly picture and I dont like it then he says ""everyone else likes it"" I then walk away from home because he was pissing me off and he FOLLOWED ME and continues going off about the picture.

 Today my grandma said I ""hurt her feelings"" and I ""shouldnt treat guests like that"" well i think guests shouldnt treat me like that. If I went to a party and harassed the person the party was for she knows damn well she would be mad at me. In my opinion I shouldnt have been harassed at my own party and I dont feel bad for getting annoyed because anyone else in my position would've been annoyed too. I didnt raise my voice or call anyone out of their name I was just annoyed and firm as anyone would be.

EDIT: I offered to throw the party myself but she got pissed at me when I brought it up. I gave her 4 other photos she could have used and I did NOT give her the ugly photo.

You are supposed to let it steep for 7 or 8 minutes or more if you want stronger coffee. She will not wait any time for that, and just presses it immediately after pouring water. It doesn't even taste like coffee, it's hot brown water. I have shown and explained these things to her multiple times, and she will not follow any instructions at all, and I have no clue as to why, but it is infuriating telling someone the same thing all the time, and they just don't think you are right.

1166,Asshole,"Using a throwaway since fiance and I are several of the same subs. 

This is a scenario where I know I fucked up in so many ways but was I the asshole? 

Last night was me and Fiance's 4 year anniversary of her asking me out. We have a great relationship, wedding planned for December and I really do love her. We went to a semi upscale but casual Italian place that she loves. Served seemed friendly but after her fried few trips to the table my fiancé said ""babe she's flirting with you."" I was like no way (I'm not one of those guys who gets flirted with) but I started paying attention and sure enough she was defintely being super polite to me and sort of under handed and dismissive to my fiancé. I tried to tell my fiancé I saw it now but let's not let it ruin our dinner. It just got worse as the server was making far too many trips to our table and as the bill and card was being returned the server did this pouty look and told me ""i didn't get so many likes on my last Instagram post will you check it out?"" And she shoved her phone oh my face and it was her in bikini.

my fiancé finally exploded and told the server how she'd been rude and dismissive all night and she wanted to see the manager. The server was pretty rude in her tone and said ""how about I get you a piece tiramisu on me?"" My fiancé said ""that's fucking it, we're leaving!"" And stormed out of the restaurant. 

I was so stunned I had no idea what to do because I didn't want to leave her outside by herself and I assumed we weren't dining and dashing so I grabbed the bill, hurriedly filled in a tip amount that made sense, copied it over to my version of the check and left.

We drove home and my fiancé was on fire, she was so mad I was totally agreeing with her and saying that the server had crossed so many lines and we'd never go back. At a light she said the server probably wrote her number on the check and she wanted to see it. I fished it out of my wallet and then she really freaked out. She said I tipped her $50! I was like no, I did $20 or somthing because i was in a hurry to catch up with her and didn't do exact math. She was like ""no you fucking asshole you tipped her $50!"" I asked her to show me the check and sure enough $50 on a $76 tab. I even totaled it to $126. I was ao sure to copy the numbers over exactly from the server copy of the bill I'm so afraid this right.

Well fiancé is even more furious now because she thinks this is solid proof I enjoyed the flirting and is questing what went on in the restaurant after she left. I tried to explain I was nervous and in a rush and I literally didn't see the sever again. She doesn't believe any of it. We were supposed to have a romantic night at our new house but she wanted to go back to her apartment and didn't even say goodbye as she slammed the door to my truck and I think she has my number blocked.

Was I the asshole here?

1168,Not the A-hole,"I work at a summer camp where you drop your children off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon after your work. The camp is funded from the state so the parents have to pay only about 30 USD per week while we take care of their children. It is an IT camp, children from 6-15 are taught how to work with 3D printers, build and code lego robots, make youtube videos, use computers, etc. It was required that the children have some sort of relationship to these kind of things or at least take interest in them. 

On wednesday we had a new kid show up because he was sick the first two days of the camp. His mother told me how he's only 6 but he's clever as a 9 year old at least. Also she told me how great he is with technology and how awesome his lego building skills are. I believed her and was very happy that we have such a kid. So I take him to the classroom and show him his computer. That's when he tells me that he doesn't know how to read and has never been on a computer, smarthphone or a tablet - basically everything this camp is about. Well, I gave him some lego robots which he could build. He came to me every 2 minutes saying that it's too hard and he can't do that. So basically there was nothing for him to do for the whole week. 

Later when I talked to the owner of the camp he told me that the mother signed him up for two weeks and he allowed it after she told him her lies. I was really pissed at the kid's mother for abusing the price of the camp and using it as a really cheap daycare. Me and the girl who works there with me persuaded the owner to kick the kid from the camp for the next week because there was nothing for him to do and his mother was lying about his skills.  

Now my friend and my girlfriend think that I'm an asshole for this but In my opinion work with children is really exhausting and I can't give all my attention to this kid. So AITA?

So when I showed him a picture of my girlfriend he immediately recognized her as the girl who ghosted him almost ~~a month ago~~ two weeks ago (girlfriend confirmed that) from the same dating app. While he said it was a shitty thing what she did to him, especially since she led him on in a way (would flirt with him and say they should meet up but she'd always be busy). They talked for about a month. He said he would support my relationship with this girl if it went better than it did for him, but he said he didn't want her near him for the time being, as he said he was pretty hurt she did that to him and moved onto his friend instead.

So for the next week he'd make jokes every time I brought her up. I asked why he was being so jealous, he said he wasn't, he was, ""using humor as a way to cope with me rubbing salt on the wound"". He told me he honestly felt like hurt about it all, so me constantly talking about wasn't helping, he was happy for me and all that but he couldn't rub that feeling away.

Flash forward about two weeks, I had started dating that girl for a few days, we were on a ""date"" when I get a call saying my friend is in the hospital. His mom explained that he was being tailgated and got hit in the rear. He was injured pretty bad but not life threatening. I tell my gf what's up and without thought rush to the hospital. I get there and nobody else was in the room, his mom was there but she was down in the cafeteria. My friend, still kind of dazed looks up, squints and sees my gf and goes, ""I must be dead because I'm seeing fucking ghosts now, just kidding, what's up"".

I had enough of this bullshit from him, him and my girlfriend laughed, but I pulled her away and said we're leaving. My girlfriend was confused and asked what happened. I'm sick of the constant ghosting jokes and all that. I don't know if this is his way of coping but it's ridiculous. He's salty.

My friend called me to apologize, he said he thought it was funny and mixed with the injuries, he just blurted it out. But he also says he didn't want her near me and I should've respected that, but he didn't make a big deal out of it so imo he didn't seem to care. So AITA in this situation or did I over-react?

1171,Not the A-hole,"CONTEXT: 

I (23 F) left my family due to the abusive (physical and mental) nature of the relationship. I'm Asian and my father is a pastor who is quite traditional and sexist. I am not in touch with them.

My husband (26 M) 's parents got a divorce when he was little and they both remarried to other people. He lived with his mom and occasionally visited his dad whenever it was convinient for my FIL. Needless to say, he saw his mom the villian and his dad as the saint.


I left my family after years of struggle and moved in with my now husband. We shortly married and found out I was expecting a month after the wedding. Our first child was thoroughly planned (ovulation kit, daily temperature check, preseed, etc) so it wasn't a surprise. 9 months later, my daughter was born. 

I tried to get MIL to like throughout the early part of our relationship. I visited her often by myself, cooked with her, went on walks, shopping, etc. She called me her daughter, etc. So when I was expecting, my husband and I announced. She was upset saying how she is not ready to be a grandma. She's now 47. She told me to get an abortion. 

We disagreed as the child was thoroughly planned and we already set aside a lot of money for her. 

I gave birth full term and my husband sent out a message to his father and his mother that I did. They both didn't reply. MIL came to visit a day later to see her grand daughter. Here is more drama.

1. She kept commenting on my belly for not going back and how I looked bloated. I just gave birth 24 hours ago.

2. She did not wash her hands to hold my daughter.

3. She did not ask me if she could take pictures of my daughter.

4. She reeked of perfume like she took a bath in it. 

WHO DOES THAT?

She later shared photos that she took of my daughter to people without letting us know. 

We got angry and she called us disrespectful and said all her friend's kids don't mind etc. I studied cyber security. I do not want pictures of my daughter on the internet. I explained that and she called me stupid and said it's her family and why should that be a problem. They are not her family or my husband's. She callS EVERYONE HER FAMILY.

Months later, we were hit by a hurricane, coincidentally on her birthday, and forgot to wish her a happy birthday. She came at me for it. Saying I made her son into a terrible human being (he left home at 17 due to abuse from her, I met him at 24). He always just sent her a e-card and that was it. 

She called me names and saying I'm broke her son with my influence and my background with my parents. How she has been a good grandmother to my daughter (at this point she has only seen her twice and never spoke to me about her).

I threatened to take all the evidence, email threats, to the police and told her I refuse to see her and that my daughter cannot see her either. My husband agrees with my decision. However, AITA here for not letting her toxicity be part of my child's life?



EDIT to answer some questions

I realized I made an age mistake, unfortunately I've let age get to me without realizing it did. I have edited the age.

Yes timeline is tricky, we married within the year we met. We planned for a child in that same year. This was because we are financially stable and the timing was perfect for paid maternity leave. In addition, we thought it would be best to child while we are younger in order to have more energy for our child and when we're both ready for a child. 

I apologize if it comes off as a validation post. Part of me is aware of this. I unfortunately from time to time wonder whether it was the right choice to no longer keep in touch of MIL and wanted to know what others thought.

To everyone that responded with something other than NTA, thank you. It really made me think from a different perspective. 

I saw that people made comments about perfume and washing hands, we have actually informed MIL of this in advance. She disregarded it. I apologize for not mentioning this. I totally support bacteria, however, it is crucial for under 3 months olds to not be exposed to too much because it could be life threatening.

I have been seeing a psychologist ever since my interaction with the MIL.

1179,Asshole,"So I recently started selling old stuff on Ebay that we no longer use. So basically old shirts, our old rollerskates, and most recently my sisters old bike. I asked for her permission to sell it and she gave me the greenlight. I sold it for a good 130 euros and gave my sister her portion of thr money. I decided that she would get 35% of the money cause it is her bike, I woukd get 35% because i repaired, cleaned, and sold the bike, and my aunt would get 30% because she originally bought the bike. But now my sister is mad saying she should have gotten 50% cause its her bike. 

AITA?

Edit: Because a few people asked. My sister originally didnt want any money but then after i sold the bike she wanted a share.

Edit2: For people wondering why i gave my aunt money. Both me and my sister lice with our aunt and i thought that because she bought it in the first place she should also get a cut.

Edit3: so based of of judgement i gave my sister enough money to make her share 50% and after i told my aunt she said she didnt want a share anyway and gave me her share. Ive decided that since my aunt doesnt want any money in the future that ill just put a bit of money from my cut on the side whenever i sell something to buy her a birthday present.",66,106,0.89

All throughout the build up to this wedding, he has been a groom zilla, his mother has been offering help and paying for things left right and centre. Time after time I've seen him shout at her, change his mind over things that were agreed months ago and she just takes it. Mainly I assume because she doesn't want to spoil his day. 

Tomorrow is the wedding day, she went to his hotel room to perform some pre wedding ceremony (I'm not sure what this was) but as she walked in, he screamed at her again and told her to ""hurry the f**k up"" . She just left the room. My fiance found her mum in tears... She just couldn't take it anymore and after spending all this money and time on this wedding, she is considering not going. Her mother is lovely and does not deserve this, I'm so mad right now. 

My fiancé's dad should be dealing with this in my opinion, but he has always let this boy get away with treating his mother like this and I cannot understand it. Logical me says leave it alone because it's his wedding , but angry me wants to tell him about himself and how shitty a person he is.

Many times in the past I've had problems when my birthday came. My father forgot a couple of times.

The latest issue was last year, when my friends just didn't care. I tried to make something happen, asked to hang out, anything really. But apparently everybody had something better to do.

What makes it worse is that these friends have gone out of their way to buy gifts for another friend even after his birthday. Basically he couldn't throw a party because either he was busy or the others were, and since two years ago we buy a gift and celebrate his birthday some days later or even weeks.

This really hurts me. They leave me alone because they have other things to do but they don't try to celebrate later like they do with this other friend. Plus, this guy is kinda rich, doesn't need any gift. I'm broke as fuck, I am the family's head, I try to keep my mother alive and I'm alone in doing this, I can't really buy stuff for myself.

Just to be very clear, I was not asking if I am asshole for standing up for my friend, I stand by my actions 100%. I am trying to figure out if I should have done more to convince my parents to come rather than simply accepting they won’t be there. 

I am going to take the advice many of you have suggested and have another sit down with my parents and reiterate my feelings. I will be firm with them and remind them that they are welcome to come but that if they do I expect them to be kind and courteous to all!


I will do an update when I speak to them, thank you again reddit x

____________________

I (28F) am marrying my fiancé (32M) in March.

I was in my parents home recently and I was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. For some background. This male friend, we’ll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fiancé said he’d love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!

Then, I told my parents, and they were like “oh we didn’t realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She’ll be in all the photographs, we don’t think that’s appropriate”  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren’t going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. 

So I basically told them that if they weren’t comfortable they didn’t have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.

That was 3 days ago and I haven’t spoken to them. I’m shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I’m upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

I don’t know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I’ve spoken to have said I’m being a bit of an asshole because they’re my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it’s something I don’t agree with. That I’ll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I’ve had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I’m being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I’m choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won’t be attending if my parents aren’t, and the same for other members of the family. So it’s basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

My view is that I don’t think it’s selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

Also to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I’m not considering either option (my fiancé is in full agreement). But I just want to know if I’m the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won’t be coming to my wedding?",2015,17505,0.87
1183,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory “I’m on mobile, sorry about formatting.” start. 

So my cousin (F15) and I (F18) have always had a fairly close relationship. We used to live 3 houses away from each other, and saw each other practically every day. She’s always told me that she has seen me as a big sister figure. She confides in me about the usual “close friends” stuff (what boys she likes, family problems, etc.) partially because we’re close, but also because she doesn’t have the best relationship with her mother. That being said though, her mother/my aunt is trying her best, and juggling being a single mom with 4 kids, 2 jobs, and going to college on top of it. She genuinely cares for and loves all of her kids, and wants them to be safe. But she also doesn’t have time to monitor them all at once very closely.

But within the past year, my cousin been starting to get into some things that are kinda concerning to me.

Last time she came over to visit me, she told me about how she goes over to an older guys(20-24ish) house regularly, to sleep over, drink alcohol and smoke weed. She said that she tells her mom she’s sleeping over at someone else’s house, and goes to his instead. She’s also told me that she really trusts him and feels that he’d never take advantage of her. Although hearing that didn’t sit with me well I’m a very non-confrontational person and wasn’t sure how to react to it, so I kept quiet and debated what to do/say.

Cut to late tonight, I clicked on her private snapchat story, and she’d spammed a bunch of videos of her and her friends on speed. One of them looked really really out of it, stumbling around and couldn’t keep still, and my cousin was giggling the entire time. All of them are under 16-17. I sent my cousin a message, asking her what was going on, but she’s ignored it so far. I’m getting worried about the fact that she seems to be escalating the risky things that she does.

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting by wanting to tell my aunt what her daughter is doing, or if this is even a big deal. I’ve never done any drugs, not even weed, so I’m not sure how bad this is. On one hand, I know being a teenager is all about experimenting. But on the other hand, she’s only 15, and I kind of feel like it’s getting out of hand. 

But it could also be none of my business, and I wouldn’t be very happy with ruining my relationship with my cousin. It would also cause even more tension between her and her mother, and probably cause her life to be miserable. 

Basically, WIBTA if I told my aunt that my cousin was doing speed?

Update: Thank you to everyone who commented and gave their input. I tried to call and message my cousin to have a heart to heart, but she’s been completely ignoring everything I’ve sent. I could still see her posting things on her snapchat story though, so I knew she was around.

I gave her the entire day to reply and or call me back, but she never did. So I brought it up to my father, and he thanked me for looking out for her and said that he would call his sister/my aunt immediately. He called and handed the phone to me, and I explained as best I could about what was going on, and provided her with video evidence.

My aunt already had suspicions, but she said she didn’t have any solid evidence until now. She said that my cousin has a therapy appointment tomorrow, so a professional will be also stepping in. She also mentioned that she might send my cousin to live with her father, who lives in a different city, so that she’s not around the 20 year old, and the people that have been enabling her.",68,45,0.91
1184,Asshole,"I know Im an asshole but just wanted some clarification I guess.

A few years back, my dad promised me to get tested to see whether hes allergic to cats/dogs. My mum and I have always wanted a cat, ny dad being the only hindrance. So, when he found out he didn't have hayfever before, he said he would get tested. So, me being around 13, I bothered him about it for a while until he snapped and said he'd never get it now. I was heartbroken since I'd gotten my hopes up. But I forgot it.

Ariynd 2.5 years later, I gave my dad a painting for his 50th. It was unfinished but I was planning in finishing it within the month. I later realised that I had overestimated my skill and lost the motivation to make it. I told my dad this and I started making a new one. Its finished now since I just finished college and have time. However during the year and a half, he talked about it, every. Fucking. Week. Like I'd have finished a big project for school, gotten a good grade, and his response would be ""and my painting?"".

It was especially bad around birthdays and Christmases. When he got my present, he'd  exclaim ""I wonder if this is the long awaited painting, actually it'd be cheap of you to give a present twice"". I never did this so it always hurt when he I did it.
Not only that, when I said I was going to pain something, he always said that it better be his, even though he knows I also have a big project that I want to give to my grandpa to his 80th. 


I finally snapped at his last bday and said I'll give ot to him when he gets tested for his allergies. He shut up. Because of all of this I've completely stopped painting and always feel guilty if I try.
So, AITA?

Edit: I have finished his new painting. I however don't paint anymore after that. Just wanted to make that clear. I was planning on giving it to him soon and dont know how to approach him.",18,35,0.93

1186,Asshole,"Some background: I'm a hobby writer and regularly participate in writing events where I also met my acquaintance. 

We were never best friends, but we got along quite nicely at first, even though I started getting strange vibes from her a while back. About a year ago, she mentioned that she was writing this huge project and I expressed some interest in reading it. At that point, the story was already over 600k words long, which is why I had a hard time getting around to reading in. Over the course of this year, we sometimes got back to her story and I always had to admit I hadn't read it yet. By now her story is almost at 1M words and is technically a book series, which would take me probably 2-3 days straight to read, no sleep or breaks.

 I messaged her a couple days ago to ask her opinion about a book I was considering buying that she'd read. It's about 400 pages so something I can comfortably read in about 10h. She recommended the book and I bought it. Then I mentioned that I was planning on reading it on a train ride that would take me about 12h. She got very upset and said that ""this is the kind of thing that one should reconsider saying, especially if one has promised to read someone else's book for a long time"". (I had only expressed interest at first and never thought I'd actually promised to read it immediately, but this might be a misunderstanding) 

I understood immediately that this was a jab at me for not reading her book yet. Attempting to keep it light, I said, I could download her story as well and start reading it. She replied that she now sees that me wanting to read something only means that I find the thought of reading it entertaining but never actually plan on reading it and that she will take this into consideration when judging everything else I've ever told her. I pointed out that it also took me a year to read the story of a mutual friend (150k words, took me one night. this friend never pressured me to read the story) and she replied that she didn't care.

I apologized for not reading it so far and left it at that. She added another jab about applying this to my overall character from now on, but I didn't reply. 

Some things I failed to mention to her because she didn't even give me any space to say it: (1) I hadn't read anything online for a long time because college was very stressful. (2) I would be in a country without wifi during some of the trip and wanted the printed book so I had something to do that didn't require an internet connection. (3) I really planned on reading her book, but I wanted to really take my time with it since it was so long and I didn't want to have to stop before I was finished. That was the same reason why I hadn't read our mutual friend's book until I really had the time. 

Am I the Asshole for expressing interest in her writing and then buying another book to read on the train?",9,39,0.95
1187,Not the A-hole,"Okay. On phone. Super long maybe

I belong to to AR game in my town and we are a rather tight knit community. We go to lunch, walk together, chat online. The whole shebang. Well, there is this guy who I shall call Eugene. Eugene likes me. I do not reciprocate his feelings and when informed of this he said ""I'm so nice to you, I don't know why you don't like me"" (yuck). So, I'm  out walking here and yon to achieve things and everyone tells me the crap he's now talking. I don't deserve this, I shouldn't have gotten that. Blah blah blah. Well I thought maybe I could write him a letter detailing the behaviors that I and others find off putting. 

For example: he does not drive, which is fine, but all those who refuse to drive him anymore say it's because he's bossy and entitled. He never offers gas money but offers randos rides and tells people where to go and what to do. If you give him a ride once he'll assume you'll be willing to forever and doesn't ask anymore, but will just tell you when HE'S  ready. He hits on everything that moves, including girls with boyfriends and will continue to do so after being told repeated that such advances are not appreciated. Like I said before he talks crap about those who spurn his advances.  The biggest, flashiest, most neon of red flags though is his temper. He is known to yell, scream, and throw his phone when he does not get his way. It is unplanned and to be quite frank, gives me anxiety.  

So I thought maybe I could write him a letter outlining these behaviors and why they make people uncomfortable because I couldn't say all this while maintaing a calm and civil tone for he upsets me that much. WIBTA?

EDIT: Thank you all for your time and advice in this manner. I've taken it to heart, and should I see him in the future (sometimes I hope he'll suddenly move, is that bad?) I'll be civil but non engaging. Seems to be the best course of action, unless pressed for an answer, then I may tell him.

1188,Not the A-hole,"So I (21F) and a few of my friends all in their twenties were out a coffee shop one day. Im much closer to one then the other. I went up to order and there was a guy about our age behind the counter. Two of my friends were behind me in line. I asked for a coffee. As I was swiping my card and waiting for it to authorize I looked at those huge cookies they had behind the glass and commented to my friends behind me that they looked really good. One of my friends said they did and she would get one since I already paid. 

As the guy was getting my receipt he told me to wait and went and got one of the cookies out of the thing and said it was on him. I thought that was very nice, thanked him and went to wait for my coffee. The other girl with my friend said she wanted a cookie and got one after me. When she had to pay for it she said to the guy “oh so they’re not free” it was awkward but brushed off by everyone. 

When all three of us went to sit down with our stuff the other girl with us said to me “Pretty privilege is real huh? Must be rough.” she was smiling when said this so I assumed it was a joke and said “yeah getting things for free is so hard.” We all laughed and continued with the convo. Nothing was weird or awkward at all. 

Then later my friend tells me that when she took the other girl home she commented on how arrogant I was and couldn’t believe what I said!? I was so confused and didn’t understand because we all laughed about it. My other friend said she saw where she was coming from even though the girl made the joke because I acknowledged that it was something I benefit from.

She gave me a funny look and asked, “Was the park empty?” Thinking she was surprised because I’m a shy person, I said no, it was pretty busy. 

It turns out that she thinks it was inconsiderate of me to practice for an hour in front of a captive audience. She asked how I’d feel if someone played music from their phone for everyone else to hear. I hate when people do stuff like that, so now I’m wondering if she’s right. 

The park I usually go to is big enough that you could move away from me, though I’m not sure how far the noise carries, and I stay in the only provided shelter area since I need to be sitting down. The reason I practice at the park is that it’s one of the few times my kids are happy to do their own thing while I practice (I can see them the whole time). If it matters, I play the harp.

1192,Everyone Sucks,"Normally I am so against the phrase “I told you so”. This is due to the fact that I am one of those people who have to just learn along the way-not from others mistakes. 

Recently I was on vacation in Maui. While there my family and I went to Big Beach. If you’re familiar with the island-you’ll know that the waves on big beach can be huge. If you’re not an experienced swimmer, being close to the shore could be dangerous for you. 

We went on a particularly rough day. The lifeguard every 20 minutes would say to not bring out boogey boards or surfboards. It would be dangerous for all people if you brought that sort of equipment out. 

Well of course that’s exactly what some family did. My brother and I repeatedly told the dad that they shouldn’t do that especially as they didn’t seem to be very experienced swimmers. Although we were rather far away from them one of there boards hit my brother in the face. So we decided not to risk our own safety and leave. 

I kid you not, at the end of the week while waiting for our flight we see that family. The dad is in a neck brace. Already assuming what happened I kindly ask what happened and if he’s alright. 

He then explains that while attempting a trick on his board he got caught in the undertow- the board hit him and he ended up hurting his neck. 

Even though he looked sheepish- I quickly said “well we told you that would happen dude. Stuff like that happens when you have equipment that isn’t suited for those waves. Good thing nothing worst happened. “ 

My brother followed up quickly saying. “Well you know Jacqueline stuff happens.” 

I did say it not necessarily with ill intent-but more annoyance that they didn’t listen to the rules and risked  the safety of others and themselves.

1195,No A-holes here,"Title sums it up really. I was with my ex for 4 years. Broke up last Christmas. New girlfriend and I started dating in March and everything has been great. 

My ex and I liked to take weekend breaks. We had no kids/pets and it was easy to decide to go away somewhere for a couple of nights just to explore a new place. They weren’t always super romantic places and not always for an anniversary/birthday etc. 

New gf and I like to do the same thing. We said we’d take a trip together and last weekend we went away. We had a great time, went to a few bars, ate some great food, sat on the beach etc etc. 

I’m the planner in the relationship. I’ll book hotels, work our trains etc. I got her view on the place, she liked it from the photos, the reviews were good so we stayed there. 

At no point during the weekend did I compare my visit with my ex. No “last time I was here we..” “I went here with ex and it’s good”. I don’t like to compare so I just went with what happened. 

As we were checking out, the owner said “thanks for coming back again. I hope we’ll see you again for your 3rd time with us soon” and my girlfriend flipped her shit. Apparently this weekend was ruined because she knew I’d been here with my ex and that it a special hotel between me and her(ex), and I should have found a different hotel for us to stay at.

1196,Not enough info,"Would I be the asshole for ignoring my nephew/family members and refusing to babysit him for the next few days over a save file?

 Its may be a stupid reason, but looking into it I feel like I have a right to be mad about this, but really need to see if its even worth the time and energy.

I've been working on the game ""Detroit: Become Human"" which I've fallen in love with, and on my second round and which I was close to finishing. I haven't been able to play it because of my work schedule and everyday responsibilities because adult life, yay, but was looking forward to one of my upcoming days off to play it.

Anyway, my nephew lives with us and now and again wants to play on MY playstation, to note here he has his own playstation, which I told him was fine as long as he didn't save over files and only played a few selected games. He knows this.

Today, asked my nephew to watch my dog in the house (it was reaching up to 100 and more degrees today and had a 8 hour shift) with deal where he can play on my playstation as long as he doesn't delete or override files and only plays certain games he is allowed to play as long as he checked on my dog so he didn't mess up the room, and didn't use the bathroom well in my room.Came back to from work to play game. Game has been played and file saved over.

All that effort I put into my game, the progress I made gone now. A game which he could have gotten on his own console for free because it was promotion for awhile.

He's still a kid, and I get it that mistakes will happen. But he is also at the age where he understands and where he should start taking some sort of responsibility for both himself and his actions.

I put effort into this game and did a lot of different choices from the first round and it helped me relieve stress and now its gone. I know its childish, and maybe a few of you think so as well and maybe you're right, but I want to be angry about this! This games, my games that I'm invested in, have a lot of value to me and it's going to be belittled because it is viewed to be ""just for kids"". And it makes me so angry because its not anything worth being mad about. 

Tomorrow they'll probably try to have me watch him and honestly I don't want to watch him, or be near him as horrible as that sounds. I want to be let to be angry. 

I told my nephew what he did, which I will state I told him calmly and wanted him to at least understand why I am becoming upset by it, when my mom butts in with ""Oh, I was in your room and dropped your controller, that probably did it.""

Dropped my controller=game resets.

That is my breaking point right now.

The game wasn't only reset but clearly also played on because the point I opened up at was at where you get to play as Markus which in not where you begin.

1198,Asshole,"So, a bit of background. My grandpa and I go out once a week for church, dinner, and to let me practice driving. Every week, he lets me pick where we go to eat, but I don't want to be greedy or take advantage so, we typically just go somewhere like Wendy's to get something small. Plus, paying for the gas money used up with the hours of driving I do. Now, I don't mind going to church. Given the choice, I would much rather not. I don't have a huge issue with it or anything, I was raised in it so I'm use to how it goes, I'm just indecisive about what my religious beliefs are. But, he is the deadset, super strict and religious type, and doesn't know that I don't feel the exact same way. I just sit through church with him, and don't speak my mind about everything. 
Now, there's this huge youth church trip out of state coming up. I had to make the decision about 5 months ago if i wanted to go or not. I never WANTED to to begin with. But his whole side of the family is religious, and I was tired of them bugging me to, so I just agreed to it. My grandpa's been very excited about this, giving me a little money for it and talking about how much of a 'life-changing experience' it would be. 
But after going on an hour and a half drive this month and feeling throw up nausea just from that, I knew I couldn't do the 8+ hour drive for this youth trip. The more I thought about this, the more negative things I remembered. Nobody who went on that trip from my church didn't even notice that I didn't go last time they went, they asked if i was there or not. I wasn't missed or cared about. The air conditioning had also broken down during long drive last time, and I'm not even sure i fully believe in this religion anymore, why would I waste all this effort, 330 dollars and time to sit through a bunch of big, exhausting services? So, I cancelled it about a week ago. I tried to tell my grandpa this, but he was in denial and wouldn't listen to me. He does all these nice things for me every week, we just don't have all the same beliefs and opinions.

my best friend S has been a gymnast and cheerleader up until she was 12. when we were rising freshmen, she tried out for (and made) our high school cheer squad.

this year, our cheer coaches changed. so before, they used to tumble/stunt, leaving me, a hip-hop dancer, unable to try out. this year, they have a coach who is a dance instructor. she despises all star cheer, and has made it into a dance team. something i really love, but isn't something my school has.

my parents have been insistent about me joining a team sport to become ""coachable"" since it's good for college. i didn't much enjoy swimming so i decided to try out for cheer. i didn't make it come the first round of auditions, but i went to makeup tryouts and tried again.

at the end of these tryouts the coach said we would hear from her regardless of decision in 48 hours. i went months and months without the email, and finally got told ""no"" a few days back.

as a freshman, S was both on the school cheer team and the school's highest dance class, which had a show. she would always  show my friend group the dances, even ones who didn't dance. a lot of them told me to my face that they found it annoying and brag-like. i tried to hint that she should stop, but it never got across. she'd pull up rehearsal videos, play the music and dance, etc. not sure if she was bragging but it got irritating.

all cheerleaders go to a three-day camp to learn all of their dances for the season. S is there now, and sent me a video of the entire team doing a dance, captioned ""Why is this not that bad?""

at this point, me not making the squad had kinda gotten to me. i've never trained in dance and only picked it up at my school in 7th grade, so it kinda sucked that some kids in my predicament had made it while i hadn't. this was what i said to her:

*hey, listen, i don't wanna be rude and i'm really happy for you ab cheer. i am and i mean that, the dance is good. however, if you wouldn't mind, could you please stop sending me pictures and videos of the dances/talking about them? i think its great that u guys r doing well, and i'm proud of u, and i know that i didn't get on bc my audition just wasn’t good enough. i'm not trying to put you down at all, and i want u to know that i care and will be at as many games as i can to support u. but tbh, it kinda makes me feel a bit bad when you send me these things, not bc its bragging, but it js makes me sad ab the season in general. i hope i'm not hurting ur feelings (and if i am, pls talk to me ab it) by saying this, but yea, thank u.*

i know she's happy about the season starting and about her dances, and i'd be 100% happy to go and watch all the games, but AITA for not wanting her to send photos and videos to me, since the whole cheer-squad thing is kinda a sore subject?",27,46,0.95

1201,No A-holes here,"TL;DR is the title. Long time lurker, first time poster. Disclaimer, this happened a few months ago, but I am still torn about what I did and if it was the right thing to do. 

 To give some context, this is at a starbucks I frequent so I somewhat know every worker and the day I went was a nice young man that was early twenties that I have seen before. 

That day, I was going in to get my mother and I some coffee and as I was sitting down I noticed a woman staring at this man but didn't look into it much as it is quite mesmerizing to watch a barista do their magic. Then out of nowhere she just yells a loud ""Hi!"" Like when people are just enjoying some silence until someone says something and it takes the other person off guard. That type of hi. He seemed flustered and ushered out a little ""uhhh hi"". They then chatted a bit about her daughter mainly, the man seeming a little awkward. It seemed as though the two didnt even know each other, so it would explain why he seemed a little awkward. Then all of a sudden the woman sat in front of me, so I got to see her every move. The woman pulled out her phone, started to text someone and then i saw her flash a picture of this man. I wasnt close enough to read the conversation but I definitely saw her send a picture to the person.

I sat there feeling a little weird that I witnessed a woman take a picture of a man that she doesnt know, that is just doing his job, and didnt even see her do this. I didnt know if I should have told the man or not. If it was a man that took a picture of a woman barista, then I feel it could be justified. So why wouldnt it be the same vice versa?

She left when her drink was called and as my name was called, I made my decision and when I came to the counter I told him that the woman took the picture of him. He seemed irritated that I said it, and his mood seem to sour. I thought I did the right thing but his reaction made me think otherwise.

some backstory...

my best friends mum is currently in hospital after being hit by a drunk driver, she was given little hope to live. so I told him to call me if she passes. i told my girlfriend that he might call but gave no date or mentioned that it could happen during the wedding. 

come to the wedding..

just after the bride and groom dance I feel a vibration on my leg, I give my phone a quick look and it was my friend, I ran into the bathroom and answered it, I was in the toilet for 5 minutes or so making sure he was allgoods. 

after I got out I explained the situation to my girlfriend who was less then pleased and told me that I embarrassed her as people where asking questions as to why I ran off.

1204,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! So one of my best friends is getting married next year in Ireland (this is where she’s from), we all currently live in the United States.  I am going to be one of her bridesmaids.


She’s getting married on a Friday and recently revealed to us (the wedding party) that she also plans on having her bachelorette party in Ireland the Saturday before that.  


So a little information about weddings in Ireland- they’re a 3 day event.  So the main event is Friday, but there is still another wedding related event the Saturday after the wedding.  This would mean we would all have to be in Ireland for 10 days for the wedding.


This is a financial strain, and is also a lot to ask considering the limited vacation time we get at work.  And I say we because I know a few other people in the wedding party feel the same way. 

So- am I the asshole for not wanting to spend the 10 days there?   She’s a great friend and of course I want to be there for her, but I think it’s unfair to put people in a situation where they have to spend that amount of time and money on your wedding.

Also welcoming any advice on how to broach the topic with her.  I absolutely don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I also want to be honest with her.  I’m hoping we can discuss either moving the bachelorette up closer to the wedding or possibly doing something state side beforehand, but idk...  I’m aware this could potentially hurt her feelings and I want to avoid that.",250,1109,0.95

1206,Not the A-hole,"This actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong, I figured I’d ask for an outside opinion.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I’ve never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real “mother”  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn’t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer’s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn’t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she’s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won’t even know I’m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn’t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn’t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

So yeah that’s the back story. We have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. Will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my GF.",3145,14421,0.94
1207,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend [22F] and I [23M] have an ongoing debate about what temperature the apartment should be at most of the time. 
I like it at 69°F-71°F. She likes it at 73°F. I keep telling her that 73 is too hot and heat makes me angry. She says anything below 71 is basically freezing cold and she’s always shivering. I tell her heat makes me angry for reasons beyond my control and that at 73 I’m sweating and I hate life. She thinks I should just get over it. Any time I’m not looking, she turns he AC UP. Any time she’s not looking, I bring it back down. I can tell immediately when it’s warm, but she isn’t always cold when it’s at 71, even though she claims otherwise.

AITA for demanding the apartment stay at 70°F-71°F because you can make yourself warm when you’re feeling cold but you cant make yourself cold when you’re feeling hot?

Please help me settle this never ending battle.

Edit: it seems like some of you assumed the absolute worst about our relationship based on this dynamic. We are very happy together and very rarely argue. This is not something we yell at each other about, more like a disagreement we’ve had since we moved in together a couple weeks ago. By getting angry I don’t mean it as a threat to her or that I et violent over a couple degrees. Heat just makes me uncomfortable and irritable that’s all, and yes I can absolutely tell the difference between 73 and 71, almost immediately.

1210,Not the A-hole,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way.

1213,Not the A-hole,"I recently cleaned out my bedroom closet and found a bunch of board games that have no reason being there. So I put them in the games closet (GC) with all of the other games.

2-3 weeks later (today) my stepmother (SM 53F) finds the games in GC and dislikes where I put them (I put them, on a [small movable drawer, something like this,](https://s.shld.net/is/image/Sears/854185712-qm-$cq_width_160$-qm-$cq_width_160$) as there was not that much room in GC). SM told me I should put them back in my closet. I responded by telling her there is no room in my closet and it belongs in GC with the other games. So SM told me that when she is ready she would be able to put the games in GC, but in the meantime, they have to be in my closet. I asked her what she meant by ""when she is ready,"" to which she tells me they can be in the attic, and I agreed. (To clarify, she doesn't want me to be the one to put them in the attic).

A few hours later SM tells my father (DAD) to call me to tell me to put the games in my closet. So I come downstairs so I can handle the situation. SM immediately jumps to start telling me how all the games have to be in my bedroom closet (this is all in front of the guests we had over for the weekend). I take a look at the games and take out the ones that nobody will ever play, put them on the floor and say that they can go to the attic, and the remaining 3 games, people might want to play with at some point (Risk, Monopoly, and Chess if that makes a difference ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ).

SM tells me that her kids won't use them, and they should not be in GC. So I take one of the games and put them on top of some other games in GC and the other 2 can go to the attic. SM doesn't like this and starts telling me how it doesn't belong in GC anyway and should all be in the attic or my room. So I say that the one game fits in GC. SM responds by throwing the three games on the floor breaking one of them (it was in a wooden box) in the process. As this is happening I start to walk back upstairs.

As I am walking upstairs SM got more upset and told me to come back downstairs, and DAD that I have to clean up after her. DAD told me I should clean up her mess or leave, so I agree and go to pack my stuff.

A few minutes later, DAD comes to my room to yell about how I have have to clean up and I am not allowed to take his second option. So I tell him how I'm not cleaning up after her and that what she did was wrong. He tells me that he'll deal with her later but now I have to clean up. I say no and he leaves.

   I(17F) recently was in a huge misunderstanding with my boyfriend. My sister(26F) found out when I went downstairs to do laundry. She asked me if we broke up, I said no. Then she asked if we got into fight and I told her that I did not want to talk about it. After my chore, I retreated to my room to cry some more. My sister went upstairs, knocked on my door and asked why I was still crying. I said nothing and she tried to hug me. I think I was in the wrong for noticeably blocking the hug. I told her that I did not want any comfort and that I just wanted to be alone. She got angry and physically aggressive, calling me selfish and a brat. She claims that she’s trying to be nice and all. My older sister has always been like this. Maybe it’s because she basically raised me that she thinks there’s no barriers between us. I have tried talking to her about me wanting space or things like this but she always gets angry and I get a few hits and scratches.

My wife and I researched, booked and paid  for a venue. Made, printed and mailed out invitations earlier this week and have gotten rsvp’s already. 

Tonight my mother in law calls and says that my wife’s sister is upset she can not come to the shower and the we need to change the date entirely to allow sister to attend. That “sister will never have a relationship with the family again if she’s not there”.

First, if not being able to attend a baby shower is going to end our relationship with her, she’s got bigger issues. 

Second, we didn’t account for her schedule because she is a stay at home mom with one kid. Please, please, please don’t think that I think stay at home mom’s don’t have a hectic schedule. I DON’T!! I respect the hell out of stay at home mom’s because you are all strong empowered women! In this case, I know that complaining sister’s schedule doesn’t compete with the rest of the family.

Are we the assholes for not wanting to change the date?

Even on the best of days our production site is an oven and with recent summers it became a necessity to grant more breaks for employees to cool down, drink up and to losen some guidelines. However there is a group of 3 young professionals that shows major double standards in their oversight. Our good looking temps were treated as expected and the terror squad was constantly concerned about their wellbeing, but you wouldn't notice any of that with everyone else. Any breaks they took were questioned, just like their attitude etc. and they'd be writen up all the time for nothing. Any temp calling it out was immediately shot down with bs about authority, accusations of sexism, sometimes even accusations of sexual harassment. They'd also fawn over the ""eye candy"" and have a good laugh whenever they managed to make someone quit. 

Since I always helped with documenting the inspections I didnt know where they were coming from and thought maybe there's some background I wasnt aware off, but noticed that even temps hired after me were bullied out of the job and decided to do sth about it.

Basically for the last half year I've been collecting all those write ups, resignations, CVs and records of temps, personal documentation and even some voice recordings of their harassment and office gossip. I had enough and decided to bring it up at our monthly department meeting. The terror squad went OFF on me, calling me every name and hinting about me sexually harassing them and I'd have crapped my pants right then if it wasn't for my bf and browser history vouching for my disinterest in their gender.

As you might expect my next week was quite eventful. Appearently boss told the terror clique they should start looking for new employment, but he also pulled me into the office and told me that my work was also under scrutiny ""in the light of recent accusations"". I politely told him it wasn't the professionalism I expected and went straight to HR. 

Basically I spend all my time in HR meetings since. They got all the evidence and interviewed everyone they could get their hands on. My boss and the terror clique were bascially standing in front of a execution squad. They are all out of jobs and the whole department is under review now. But apart from the temps everyone is giving me shit for it. They say how I got 3 young professionals and a good boss fired and didn't understand ""subtle"" sexism (yes the department skews young and woke)

1226,Everyone Sucks,"I work at a hotel that is part of a large, multinational hotel company. This company gives us a certain number of discounted nights for employees and a certain number of nights for Friends and Family. 

F&F discounts are usually 25% to 50% off regular rate. They are usually a very good deal for the type of hotels (mostly mid-range, extended stay, or higher end), but lower-tier hotel chains or motels may be cheaper (and a bargain shopper who only cares about price can almost always find a cheaper room at one of those lower-tier chains.)

A friend of mine was traveling from the Pacific NW to Ohio for a funeral in the family. Due to physical issues that would make sitting in an airplane seat for hours be extremely painful, he was going to drive so he could take frequent breaks.

Before he left, we were hanging out and talking about the trip, and he kept dropping obvious hints that he wanted to use my discount for hotels along the way. But he would not come straight out and ask. He would say things like, ""I'm not sure what all I'm going to do. There might be nights I have to sleep in my van if I can't find a cheap hotel."" He is on a fixed income, and paying for the trip had been a concern for him.

I sympathized with him, but didn't say much about it. Enough to show I was listening and move the conversation forward. Over the course of the evening, he brought this up several times and made several hints. I would not have minded him using my discount, but I felt (and still do) that he should've asked, not just drop overly dramatic, obvious hints.

When he came back from his trip, and we were hanging out again, he brought it back up, got angry, and yelled at me for not offering him the use of my F&F discount. He said I should have picked up on his hints and offered the discount, that's what friends do, and I have issues picking up on social cues that I need to work on. (Note: I do have social issues, including picking up on cues or second guessing cues. My friend knows this. But this was not the reason I didn't offer.)

He called me an asshole and basically accused me of being a bad friend. I told him what I said here: I feel a person should ask to use a discount, not just passive-aggressivly hint at it. He said he doesn't feel comfortable asking people for discounts and stuff like that, and I should have offered after he mentioned he might sleep in his van.

Every other friend of mine, and family members, will ask to use my discount when they need it. If it's available, I help them book their dates. My friend knows this. 

I would have helped him with the discount if he asked, but him just dropping hints made me feel like he was trying to manipulate it out of me, and I didn't like that. 

We have barely talked since this last argument, and the way he came at me about it (along with other things) has made me reconsider my friendship with him. So, AITA for not offering the discount, instead of playing dumb and waiting for him to ask?

Edit:
Regarding the financial aspect of this and how the discount works. The discount is per night, with a certain number of nights per year total. The discount is different at every hotel, depending on a number of factors such as location, brand, regular rate, etc. This is why it can range from 25-50%. When a hotel gets to a certain occupancy percentage, the discounted rate becomes unavailable and cannot be booked, but existing reservations at the rate are of course honored. This is why I cannot guarantee the discount will be available.

As to the financial circumstances, yes, he was worried about it. But I have explained how the discount works to my friend when I previously let him know I'd be willing to let him use it if he let me know he wanted to. He knew it wasn't always available and he knew it wasn't always the cheapest. If price was the only factor for him, I know for a fact there were cheaper options he could have stayed at. They would not have been as nice of a hotel, but also not a sleazy, dirty horrible place either. Him hinting at having to sleep in his car struck me as emotional manipulation, and that is what I objected to so much.",37,31,0.87
1227,No A-holes here,"Mom and I both work 2nd shift hours 2pm-11pm and prefer to wind down before going to bed.

My neighbor is a middle-aged male with a teenage son. 

The letter I received verbatim.

I first want to say I know condominium living isn't perfect and we all need to try and live in harmony in these tight conditions.I wanted to take a moment to let you know a of a few issues I have regarding noise from your condominium unit. We can literally hear every footstep from your unit and can tell at all times where someone is walking. The walking is not only very loud but it is so hard that on occasion things will move on my walls. It is especially loud starting in late afternoon and going until nearly midnight sometimes. I understand you may be on a different schedule but we hear the washer and dryer going late at night making a noise that is loud in our unit. This goes until 11pm quite often. The sliding of your kitchen chairs on the tile is extremely loud. One night in the past few weeks we counted the chair(s) being moved 73 times in a 1 hour time frame. I have wood floors in my unit and I bought small stick on felt pads to put on the bottom on anything that slides. This not only protects my floors but it also makes it so my neighbors below me don't hear the chairs sliding.Someone up there has a wonderful singing voice but I don't need to hear Broadways tunes being sung at 11pm while we are trying to sleep.I'm not trying to be picky but these are very real issues we deal with in our unit on a daily basis and all I am doing is asking for some consideration in these matters. I realize you didn't have anyone living below you for over two years so it didn't really matter but we are here now and the noise is actually embarrassing when we have friends visit. It has gotten to the point where my high school son goes to bed listening to music in his ear buds so he doesn't hear the noise from above.Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Some are easy fixes. The singing can stop and I put sticky pads on the chairs already.

There are times when we must wash our clothes at 11pm when we work long weeks.

Unfortunately our lives revolve around our work schedules, we get home and the last thing we want to do is go to bed. Mom is flat footed and can try to walk quieter, but am I expected to lose weight to stop cracking and creaking that follows me everywhere I go? or go to bed as soon as I get home, not hang with my friends online and become a morning person instead? I already go out of my way to tip-toe 24/7 because of my weight. From how specific the letter was it feels like we would have to change how we live to satisfy him. Truthfully, I don't feel like we're obliged to do ANYTHING.

I feel bad but at the same time ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

my sister suggested that I get her a american to new Zealand plug so she can charge her phone, I agreed that it was a good idea  and went out and brought one (with the last of my money) 
my parents heard my sister tell me to get her the adapter as they made a comment about how good of a gift it is. so I assumed I was in the clear. i also had 0 clue on what to get her. 

my parents then decided that they would go out and get my sister the same gift I got her even though they could easily pick something else. this means I have no gift for her and I feel like shit. 

I called them up and told them how shitty it was that they brought the one gift my sister wanted me to get her (she even said hey throwaway you can get me an adapter for my birthday) 
I also added that I now have nothing to give her, they got annoyed that I was so angry over this so I told them that it's there fault that I now have no gift for her and I thanked them for making me waste my money. (I had already brought a adapter so had no need for this one)

my mum is telling me im overreacting and some of the family think that I'm being really dramatic.

1230,Not the A-hole,"Alright so a couple of parts to this. I don’t like human contact too much unless it’s from a person I’ve chosen and become comfortable with (like an SO). 

Ever since I was young, I didn’t like kissing family members on the mouth. But my mother has always forced me, saying it’s rude to refuse. Even as an adult (23F now) she will make quiet comments like “it’s really disrespectful/impolite not to kiss your grandmother.” And up until a couple years ago she would get really angry that I didn’t like kissing her on the mouth either. It just makes me very uncomfortable. 

Very recently, my father was leaving for something, asked for a hug goodbye and I said “I don’t have a bra on so I’m really not comfortable with that, give me a moment to go throw one on.” Mother got angry. Saying “Really? It’s your father! Jesus Christ, don’t be so weird about it! You walk around the house in your underwear sometimes!” I caved and gave my father a very uncomfortable hug. Mom always presses the issue. 

Second part that is slightly different: Sometimes I just don’t want to hug people, not necessarily because I’m “uncomfortable,” but I just don’t like it, don’t want the physical touch, my space invaded, etc. My dad understands and makes little jokes about it but accepts a fist bump as the same sentiment. Strangers at bars also usually accept the message. Mom, takes it as personal attack and tells me how terrible that I make her feel that I don’t want to hug my own mother.

1231,Not the A-hole,"I live in South Louisiana and few weeks ago we had a tropical storm that turned into a hurricane (Barry). 

I with my legal guardians (my brother and his wife), and they decided that my sister-in-laws family should stat at our house during that storm. Which meant that her grandparents would take my bedroom, I didn’t have a problem with that at all. But in addition to that her parents and younger sister took the guest room. 

I’m not very close to this family, I go to many of their gatherings but its not because I want to its because my sister in law does and i want to be nice. But when i do go to their gathers they almost pretend I’m not there (some of them ask why do I even show up) and I end up standing in a corner doing nothing for the next 2 hours. But i still like this family but we’re mostly just acquaintances not really friends. 

I decided that in our 3bd house, 8 people would be kinda pushing it and since I had the option, I stayed with my sister at her place for the storm. 

My sister in law thinks i was rude for not staying the week with her family, but I DONT KNOW THEM. Her grandparents took my room, her parents took the guest room and her sister had the couch, their idea was to put me on the floor in my brother and his wife’s room with them. My sister had an open guest room with a bed for me, plus she lives outside of the flood zone in a part of town that doesn’t often lose power so my choice was obvious.

1232,Not the A-hole,"So I (M 33) was at the grocery store and just started to walk down an aisle when a mom and her 5 children turned the corner at the opposite end of the aisle and started walking toward me. The mom had two young (maybe 6-10yrs old ish) children in the cart and three older children (middle school age) walking in front of her. The older children were all grabbing random boxes and knocking them off the shelves for no reason. The mom saw all this happening and did literally nothing. She didn’t tell them to stop. She didn’t pick up the things they were knocking over. Just no regard. We passed each other about halfway down the aisle. I could see at least 9 or 10 boxes on the floor that her children had thrown off shelves, and she had not done anything to reprimand or correct them or clean up after them. So as I passed her I looked at the mom and said “you’re being a sh*tty parent” and kept walking. I picked the boxes up as I passed them and restocked them.  

In my mind there is no excuse for letting your older children wreak havoc in a store and not even telling them to stop. The only exception is if the kids have some developmental or neural issues, but even then you don’t leave the mess behind for some store clerk to have to deal with, right?

Anyway for the AITA part, I told this story to my girlfriend and she got super pissed at me. She believes that as a person without children I should never criticize someone else’s parenting and as a man I should especially never criticize a mother, and that she was probably trying her best and I probably ruined her day. It became a huge argument between us and she clearly believes that I’m the asshole for telling this woman she was being a crap parent.

1233,Not the A-hole,"This happened last year but in light of recent events I am revisiting the matter.

Last June my dad finally succumbed to ALS after an ugly two years. I asked my best friend of over half a decade if she would support me at his funeral since I didn’t have siblings or anyone else to turn to for it besides my mom, who had enough to worry about. She said she would, even though it fell on a workday for her, and that she was honored I asked.

A little about her work: At this time she worked weekends as a server while living with her parents rent and expense free. 

The week of the funeral came around and I got in touch to get her the where/when. At this point she told me she could not get out of work and that she was sorry. I replied angrily and that I was really hurt that she didn’t make more of an effort to be there for me, and then she got mad that I was getting mad, saying, “it’s not like you’re going to come for my birthday” (because I was about to start my first year of a PhD 2000 miles away and her birthday is in early November—during midterms). I told her I hoped she fared better with her friends when her dad died and ceased contact for awhile. A month or so later she apologized, and I accepted her apology while also admitting I was worn out by, well, everything lately and didn’t really know how to feel about anything

Anyway, cut to November. Her birthday. By this point she had moved out of her parents into a house with monthly rent to cover. I was at school. I called to wish her a happy birthday and asked what she was doing for it. She answered that because her birthday fell on a weekend, she requested it off from the restaurant so she could celebrate by going to this porn festival that fell on that weekend but they wouldn’t give her the days. So she quit and went to the porn festival. 

I was amazed at the admission, but still so mentally frazzled that I just ignored it. The mind does what it needs to conserve its energy. But now, as I am again feeling cast aside by this friend for different reasons this year, I am livid. What is pretty inarguably one of the worst days of her best friend’s life? Sorry bro gotta make paper. Porn festival bday? Byeee! 

I do think it was good to quit the job eventually. The place was chronically understaffed and only scheduled her weekends. But I think her final motivation for quitting speaks to her values...right? AITA?

ETA: I never asked nor expected her to quit her job for this funeral beforehand. That is why I accepted her initial apology. I was just disappointed to see what was a quittable event and what was not come November.

1236,Asshole,"To preface, this happened while my friend,
her bf, and I were all in high school. Let’s call my friend Monica and her boyfriend Chandler. Monica and Chandler’s houses are never completely empty (their parents or siblings are always around) and have mainly been having sex in their respective cars. However, my house is usually empty since I’m an only child and my parents are never home during the day. 

One day, Monica was complaining about how uncomfortable car sex is and as a joke asked me if I’d ever let her use my house to have sex. At the time, I saw no problem with that idea, even though I knew it was a joke, and told her that she could have sex in the spare guest room. 

(Side note: I’m also really good friends with Chandler, he’s not just some random guy, which is part of the reason why I agreed in the first place) 

We arranged a day for them to have sex, I gave them a spare key and then went to hang out with another friend while they had their fun. We met up hours later and Monica and Chandler were incredibly appreciative. When I got home, they had cleaned up after themselves, changed the sheets, and had even made the bed. 

Several weeks later, my mom starts ranting to me about how much she hates the idea of teenagers having sex and that if she ever finds out I had sex in high school she’ll be incredibly disappointed. 

While I don’t agree with my mom in the slightest, I began to feel guilty that I let my friends violate her rules in her own home. 

I start to spend less time with Monica and Chandler because every time I saw them it reminded me of what I had done. Eventually, this guilt manifested itself into anger towards Monica and Chandler because I felt they had taken advantage of how easy going I am, despite knowing the consequences we would all face from our parents (their parents are also vehemently against teenage sex). 

Finally, Monica was like wtf is up with you and I told her I was angry at them for taking advantage of me. Monica said I was being ridiculous and if anything, this was all my fault for letting them have sex in my house in the first place. We proceeded to have a huge argument and haven’t talked since. 

AITA?

Edit: 

To clarify this a little more, Monica has asked me to do lots of stuff outside my comfort zone before and I always end up saying yes because I feel pressured to - often times because I feel insecure in our friendship and don’t want to lose her since she is one of my closest friends. Monica also knows that I feel bad afterwards since I’ve explicitly told her in other cases, but she’s always said in these situations that it was my decision and I shouldn’t get mad at her. In this case, I got completely fed up because she asked knowing full well that she could pressure me into this situation, even though she knows my parents’ rules.",87,194,0.84
1237,Not the A-hole,"Hello reddit! 

So me and my fiance have been engaged for just over a year, but the wedding planning is just starting (my parents have said they will pay for our wedding once my dad leaves the navy next year, blessed). I've always known I want my 4 younger sisters to be my bridesmaids, and my baby bro (6) to be ring barer or page boy or something. 

My Fiances sister thinks she should be a bridesmaid too because it's unfair for all of my siblings to be involved but not her. 

I have never really got along with my future SIL, shes conceited, selfish, and cant have a conversation that isnt about her without making it about her. I also dont want to expect my amazing parents to have to spend a fortune because shes guilt tripping me into including her. 

The problem is this: shes autistic and has severe arthritis, so she doesn't really understand that the wedding will be about me and fiance rather than her. My brother is also high functioning autistic so I have no problem with autism in the slightest, its just I dont think that it should be a reason to include her in our wedding if neither of us want her to be part of it. 

I dont want to start our marriage with bad blood between us and his family. AITA?

Update to add: my fiance doesnt want her involved in the wedding either. She cant do a reading because she cant read.

Edit 2: my mother in laws cousin is getting married in october, and MIL and FIL are invited, but fiance, SIL and myself arent (me and fiance dont care, I've never met the couple, and they're having a small ceremony). I was talking to MIL about our wedding plans and how I was worried it'll be a disaster if I dont let SIL be a bridesmaid. She told me that when SIL found out she waant invited she said to MIL ""make them miserable so they know how I feel""... on their wedding day... yikes.

1242,Not the A-hole,"Heads, up. This is kind of long, sorry.

So I (27F) am a lesbian, engaged to a lovely woman (24F). My family is from a Pentecostal Christian background.

Last night my youngest sister (21) and I went to their house for dinner. This is the second time my sister has spent any time with her in years. She was trying to give her a chance. We sat down to dinner when it started.

It started with debates about politics/religion. They’re very bigoted. I told them they need to give other people more respect. That who cares what other people believe (we were talking about Islam), that they should be allowed their own religious freedom as they expect their own freedom. It began to get heated with him saying “I do not *have* to respect everyone.” And I told him he should give people the same respect he expects in return. Well, somehow it got shifted to my sexual orientation.

First they were saying it was “unnatural” which I countered that homosexuality exists frequently in nature, and cited a few examples. He said “well I wasn’t talking about *animals*. Are you calling yourself an animal? So it would be okay for you to marry a dog then?” And I told him that was so off the point and ludicrous to compare my relationship with my fiancé to a dog.
Then he began saying well “you can’t procreate! So it’s against God! You’ll never be able to have your own child!” And I told him that wasn’t true. I could have a donor, or I could adopt. And he said that it wouldn’t be the same if I adopt. You can’t love an adopted child like you can “your own flesh and blood”. I told him that was absolute bullshit. So I flat out asked him “So you’re saying we (gestured to my sister and myself) don’t count *for you*? You could never love us like you do your own children? (he has five daughters)”. Well he flipped out after that and yelled that I had offended him and how dare I challenge his love for his children, and he said no he would never love us like he does his own children. And I told him that “wow that’s not what I said at all, but it’s okay for you to offend me by equating my relationship with a woman to one with a dog, but you’re completely out of control that I *offended you*?”

It became a yelling match that my mom just sat there quietly and let happen. Only chiming in a few times to agree with him. So, my sister grabbed our things and walked out of their house with him trailing behind us and yelling as we walked out the door. I hugged my sister as we were getting into my car and we both just broke down and cried.

Today he had sent me a half apology. Only about the part of blowing up about the children argument. That he was wrong. He didn’t realize how much he loved me until I challenged him on it. So he was sorry. But nothing about my relationship.

So WIBTA if I don’t wanna try anymore?

Throwaway because I’m pretty sure my friend’s fiancé is a Redditor. I’m going to try to keep this as neutral as possible. I don’t want any political debates. 

I’ve been friends with Laura since undergrad. We were freshman year roommates, then became sorority sisters. I’ve always been very political: I vote in every single election, I volunteer, I donate money to candidates, etc. I fall very squarely on one side of the political spectrum. Laura is apathetic politically, at best. I’m pretty sure she’s never voted in an election. Ever. And that’s fine (well, I’d prefer her to vote, but). 

In our senior year of college, Laura started dating Mark. Mark is very outspoken about his political views, and he will argue with anyone. We’re on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. I’m fairly confident that they just never talk politics, because Laura doesn’t care.

Fast forward to now, two years post college graduation. Laura and Mark got engaged about three months ago — YAY! She asked me to be a bridesmaid. I accepted, and the wedding isn’t until next May. 

I think it’s important to mention here we live in Texas. I live in a very liberal city (I’m sure y’all can guess it!), Laura moved down closer to the border with her fiancé. I’m used to being around people who disagree with me in my state. 

Mark took a politically leaning job (keeping it vague here) and is constantly posting things on facebook. Whatever, I have him muted. He’s always been on one side of the spectrum, but he has gotten so much worse with this job. He shares horribly racist and sexist things. He spews those racist things anytime he’s around others. I left a party one time when he started *defending* white supremacists, like at the Charlottesville rally a few years back. 

My own fiancé is furious with Mark’s views and refuses to go to the wedding. I am legitimately considering backing out of being a bridesmaid due to this. If Laura wants to marry him, that’s her decision. I am not here to condemn her decisions. But I don’t know if I’m comfortable standing up watching my good friend marry someone who believes and spews such hateful things. 

AITA if I back out of the wedding? Of course if I back out, I won’t be like “your fiancé sucks and I rock.” I’m just not sure that I should stand in the wedding if I don’t support a racist jackass? Support her, always. Support him, no.",405,643,0.89

1254,Not the A-hole,"Today my wife and I had a pretty big fight about me not supporting her dream of being a YouTube star. 

Her channel, which has one video, is going to be comprised of her making paintings, talking about her experience being pregnant, and DIY projects.

I generally wouldn't care, she can do whatever she wants as a hobby. Which in fact was the comment that triggered this blow out fight- my contention is that she will use this new endeavor to do less as a part of the family. 

As I said earlier, she is newly pregnant and because she is pregnant she has said that she can't cook anymore. Cooking was her one responsibility around the house. I take care of all of the yard work, finances, repairs, dishes, general maintenance, shopping, laundry, and am working finishing up a large renovation to our sunroom. Normally I don't mind, I enjoy listening to audio books and getting work done. I work from home 2 days a week, and am fortunate enough to be able to do laundry during work hours.

Recently she decided that she would start an online boutique - to which I supported and funded. She spent a few weekends developing her logo and buying stuff before she gave up. During that time she refused to help me with the occasional thing that required two people (i.e. hanging a fence) because she was too busy. Mind you she was watching TV with her computer open on the couch. But in her defense she took care of making meals (Hello Fresh) and that's all I asked of her.

The YouTube thing really strikes me at the core, I really don't like that whole subculture of YouTube celebrities. I don't have a real reason why, but my best guess is that I hate how much time my wife spends watching these silly videos ""vlogs"". 

AITA for being unsupportive of her dream to make money as a YouTube star? Or am I fair in holding my ground in being accommodating to it as a hobby ?


TLDR: My wife wants to be a YouTube star. I support her doing it as a hobby but not as a task that she uses as an excuse to not contribute.

Edit: Thank you for the support and feedback, it have me the confidence to hold my ground and have a long talk last night. The conversation went well and she seemed receptive to my criticism and offered to assume the cleaning responsibilities that didn't involve chemicals (dusting, vacuuming, etc.)- which I will consider a win.

The most difficult part of the conversation was me being quite direct about the idea of her being a YouTube star. I can't say it was the easiest conversation to have, but I will say that my understanding was skewed. She said that she understands that it is highly unlikely that she will make a dime doing this, and under no circumstance will she quit her job to pursue this dream- unless by chance she happens to be making more on YouTube. Which she acknowledges is unlikely.  

As quite a few suggested, we scheduled an appointment with a Marriage Councillor and are going to join an newly wed small group at our church.",67,160,0.95

1257,Update,"[Original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c60m3b/aita_for_forcing_myself_to_bond_with_my/).

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows. I love all the hugs/appreciation I've gotten from her, but she's enriched my life in so many ways. 

So no, Reddit, my boyfriend and I are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making me really reflect on my thoughts/potential behaviors towards her. I know see how suddenly withholding love could really be harmful towards someone who's gotten close to me (and someone I've grown really close to also). 

I think my fiance's daughter and I will just continue as we are and hopefully grow even closer throughout the years :)",464,1636,0.86
1258,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time posting.

I'm 6 months pregant and my relationship with my MIL has been rocky for a while now. More so since I got pregnant. She's overstepped a lot of boundaries including getting rid of my beloved pets because she has access to my home but that's another story.

She was deadset on buying us a stroller, I didn't mind much and had shown her a few that I absolutely loved, were very practical for us and were on the less expensive side, but still safe. My anxiety disorder forces me to research things till I can't anymore and making sure everything is safe and reliable. Things were going great until she informed us one day that she had gotten one, I jokingly said I hoped it wasn't brown since that's the only request I really had. Not brown. I was excited either way because hey a stroller! 


She had gone out and bought a stroller that was impractical, and well brown. I can't reach my baby in it since I'm too short, and it can't adjust. I mentioned the height issue and the car seat that came with it not being the safest or the stroller really. She said ""I don't care if you like it, it's for my baby you don't have to like it""

Maybe it's because she's treating me like an incubator, and keeps referring to our unborn child as her baby (which has been happening more frequently. Even going so far as to buying a crib for her place because ""her baby will need it"") but I absolutely despise the stroller. I would have been more comfortable getting one myself that I did the research on and actually tested out. Maybe it's because she had gone behind our backs to get it despite us asking to please take us with so we can pick one that works for us.


Everyone says I'm being difficult and ungrateful, maybe I am and I'm not seeing it because she drives me insane. 

Am I being the asshole? Should I just accept my gift despite me knowing it was bought just to upset me?

1259,Not the A-hole,"Around my community there have been several poster signs for a lost cat. About a month ago the cat was found and the public was informed via social media. The signs are still up. Today I used one of the numbers on the sign and texted the owner this:  
""Hi, I saw your sign for your lost cat, CATNAME. Pretty sure y'all found them about a month ago. Could you please collect your signs and dispose of them properly. Otherwise they are just going to be another piece of litter in our environment.""  
This is the response I received:   
""You have the wrong number, and honestly if you're really concerned about the environment you should pick them up yourself. Don't be pissy to people just because you have an opinion.""

I don't think it was the wrong number but I have yet to double check. We texted back and forth for a little trying to explain our points. If anybody is interested I will post the rest of the chain in the comments. 

The jist is that they think it's ""uppity, pissy, ignorant, entitled and passive aggressive"" of me to ask someone to remove their signs instead of just doing it myself. I think that this is a rare opportunity to ask the owner of trash to please clean up after themselves and that we have a moral responsibility to do just that. I don't know where all the signs are posted to even collect them myself. 

AITA for asking them to pick up their signs? 

There were two numbers on the sign and I'm considering texting the other number the same request.

1261,Not the A-hole,"My older brother adopted his grandson a few years ago.  We live in separate states, so I rarely see them.

A few months ago, I was in town and my mom hosted a get-together.  It was mostly adults, except for the 12-year-old boy.

He's a great kid, and he and I hit it off immediately.  I teach science and we invaded the kitchen after dinner and I showed him some fun little science demos with household items.  

I had a feeling early on he was autistic.  He had speech patterns, repetitive hand/body movements and even at one point had a meltdown over being told by his grandpa to put away his toys and get ready for dinner.

Later on, I was chatting with his grandma (my sister-in-law).  I mentioned what a cool kid she had, and asked what kind of services he was getting.  

""What are you talking about?""

""Well, he's on the spectrum, so I was just wondering what kind of services his school has arranged.""

""What is a spectrum?""  Oh, oh.  Trouble coming...

""Does he have any special classes at school?""

""We home school him.  His school kept complaining about his behavior.""

""Well, he is probably on the autism spectrum.  There are many ways he can learn techniques to deal with his disability.  You should have him tested.""

Mom lost her shit.  She told me he was just a normal boy and didn't need to be tested for anything.  She told me not to talk to him again.

1262,Not the A-hole,"I was riding the bus to work one morning, and the driver was a large, cranky older guy whose bus I’m usually on multiple times a week. There were three guys on board playing the “penis game” - for those not familiar, it’s a game where you see who can shout the word “penis” as loud as you can without getting caught. Two of the guys appeared to be a set of brothers who were sitting next to one another, and the third was a stranger at the back of the bus who heard them and joined in.

The shouting of the word “penis” grew louder and louder, and much more annoying. The bus driver groused about it for a while, and when he figured out who the culprits were he pulled the bus over to the side of the road. He ordered the two brothers off; they grinned and laughed and exited without much of a fuss. The third guy scowled and stormed off; but I was completely shocked when the driver approached **me**, and ordered me off of the bus.

I swore to him that I wasn’t part of the “penis” shouting trio; that he must be mixed up, but he insisted that he heard/saw me shouting. I was infuriated, both because of the false accusation **and** due to the fact I’d have to walk a mile and a half to work and certainly be late. I debated with him for a while, and then flat out told him that I refuse to get off the bus.

He didn’t fold and get back to driving the bus, as I expected; rather, he continued arguing and threatening to call the cops on me. I sat back in my chair, tried to look as calm and cool as possible, and over and over like a broken record told him, “I’m not getting off.”

Lots of time passed, and finally he got out his phone and told me that I had one last chance. I told him smugly, “Go ahead, call ‘em.” He called the police and asked them to come remove me, and I continued to sit in my seat nonchalently.

Other passengers started pleading with me to get off, telling them that I was making them late for work or personal committments, and I told them to direct their pleas to the driver. “He’s the driver,” I told them. “It’s his job to drive the bus, not mine, and instead of doing his job, he’s throwing a temper tantrum like a little kid. This bullshit is all on him. Blame him.” I said this all in front of the driver.

The cops showed up a little while later. I was as calm, dignified and friendly as I could be to them, explaining the situation to them in full. The driver, on the other hand, was angry, dramatic, interrupted them frequently, and overall made a terrible impression. I think they really sided with me, but for the sake of keeping the peace, they peacefully escorted me off of the bus.

This incident delayed the bus by a good 30 minutes, and I would bet that this driver’s schedule was off for the rest of the day. I stand by what I did and feel proud that I stood my ground in light of a false allegation. Do you guys think I was an asshole for doing this?",107,485,0.97

1264,Not the A-hole,"Hello! i would like to start by saying that i have no problem with pitbulls or any other type of big/""dangerous"" dog breed even-though i own a small purebred dog i love all dogs the same :3

okay so here's the situation, i live in a decent neighbourhood in relatively nice and big city and one of my neighbours own a pitbull dog. my problem is that he takes it out for walks without putting a leash on it nor a mouth guard, i have also seen the dog roam the streets alone without his owner one time.

it all began when i  heard a man looking for a dog outside my window for like 15 minutes (or so i thought) i quickly found out that he wasn't missing his dog, but rather, his dog just didn't come to him when he called it a million times, i than saw his pitbull running towards him (after 15 minutes of him calling it to come to him).

after that i saw him again walking his dog without a leash and me and my family yelled to him that he must put amouth-guard on his dog or at least use a leash

a couple of days after that we again saw him walking his dog without a leash and so again we yelled at him that it is not allowed nor okay to that and that if we ever see him doing it again we will call the police, we also told him that we don't want to have his dog taken away from him but we also cannot let him continue doing that.

a few days ago i was walking my dog at the evening and when i passed a corner (maybe 20 meters away my door) i saw the infamous dog. he started growling and barking like crazy at my dog and showing his teeth. i was very frightened so i picked up my dog and went home.

So... would i be the a-hole if i called the police at this point?

because ill feel really shitty if they kill the dog because his moron of an owner

i am really not sure what they do with dogs like this in my country, i have a gut feeling that if the police will take the dog he will not have a good life

thank you for reading and sorry about my broken English

1266,Not the A-hole,"I come from a household with conservative values - my mother is a Korean immigrant and my father was born in the 40's.

For the most part of my life I've been a very obedient child, the only time we've had major issues was when I was in high school. My mother was very strict with me, one time she found out I had a boyfriend and didn't talk to me for months. She also was bitter towards me for months because I wanted to go to a college three hours away from home - she wanted me to live at home and attend a nearby university because she thought I couldn't take care of myself. I ended up going to the college I wanted to go to because it was pretty much all paid for through scholarship.

My mother has established with me that she knows best. My parents have supported me a lot through my education. My dad financially supports me and my mom pretty much raised me all by herself - she's very attached to me. She also treats me much differently than my brother because I'm a girl, she's said explicitly, ""I know I'm sexist but it's for your benefit.""

Now I want tattoos, sleeves specifically. Aside the fact that I've wanted sleeves since I was 16, I want them even more now so I can cover up my scars. My mother absolutely hates tattoos. I told her how I plan to get them after I graduate college and get a steady job. She expressed her disapproval, but she said she'd compromise - I could get tattoos once I turned thirty. The sound of that really pissed me off, I'm sick of her and other men telling me what I can and can't do with my body - I want ownership of my body back. My dad said that he could care less, however he had in mind small cute tattoos that are on the back of shoulder. He also said that I should humor my mom and not ever get them, he said it's not worth ruining my relationship with my mom over something like that. He said that her having control over the family makes her happy and to let her enjoy the one thing she has going for her.

My mom has had a hard life growing up and I recognize that. She still doesn't have it easy now because she has to take care of her old disabled husband. I respect her commitment to the family and how much she has supported me. I would hate to ruin our relationship and to take away the one thing that she has left that makes her happy, but I also am exhausted with having to hide who I really am and holding back on things that I want to do. The stress from meeting her standards and making decisions is overwhelming.

Anyways I just don't know if it's okay for me to go ahead and do something knowing that it'd jeopardize our relationship or if I'm being selfish and should do what makes her happy.

&#x200B;

TLDR; I want to make my parents, specifically my mom, happy but getting tattoos would potentially make them cut me out of their life. I really want tattoos but I also feel like I should respect how much they've supported me financially and getting tattoos would be seen as a large sign of disrespect.",30,40,0.92
1267,Asshole,"This might seem like a mundane situation, but hear me out.

Work is quite far and my commute to work requires switching between two public transport routes. This means that if I miss the first bus, I will be late to work by upto an hour, or have to use a much more taxing route (to reach earlier but still not on time).

Also, my mother has taken it upon herself to cook lunch for me every morning. This is because the food options near my office aren't too great and she is always concerned about my health.

I love the sentiment and the food she cooks tastes amazing, but here's the thing: She always takes a little too long to prepare the food. This will often lead to me missing my intended route.

Now. I've tried telling her about the problem gently (still keeps happening). I've tried asking her to not prepare lunch for me if it will take too long (she takes this as me not appreciating her efforts). I've tried leaving at the last moment I possibly can, leaving the food behind (this makes me feel the worst).

All of this has lead to this scenario: I wake up, remind her to finish cooking earlier if she is doing so (She would already be up at this point). I freshen up, remind her again. I get ready for work, another reminder. As my time to leave gets closer I get more stern and she gets more frantic. Eventually, this leads to me scolding her when it gets too close to leaving time, and her rushing to try and hand me the lunch before I leave.

This will make the next couple of days go by smoothly after which the scenario repeats again. Everytime this happens, I always wish I could take back the words I said, right as I leave the house. I feel like such an asshole for chiding someone who is taking such pains for my sake.

***Edit***:  
A lot of people think I'm an asshole here, so point taken. There is certainly some ideas here which I will at least try out.

* For the people asking me to make my own lunch, I will need to learn that first. So I can start doing that by helping Mom out in the kitchen during the mornings until I start to get a hang of it. Who knows, maybe that will be enough to see to it that lunch delay isn't a problem anymore.

  
* I like the idea of storing lunches for the next day or preparing them the previous night too. (Mom will put up some resistance to this, she only likes to give me fresh food). This can be my backup if point 1 doesn't work out some days.

I planned to do something for my b-day (Friday). My husband and I still make big deals of each other's b-day, so we planned my party for that Saturday.   Nothing too fancy- just cake and presents with my hubby and the kids, getting a babysitter, and going out to eat at a fancy restaurant.  We set the reservations and talked to my mom about babysitting the kids. 

A few days before, I get an invitation in the mail from my SIL and brother for my niece's b-day party.  It is set the same day I was going to do something for mine.   My mom calls to cancel babysitting.  It was easy enough to get someone else to babysit, but I am torn at this point and consider canceling my own b-day.   I told my mom that I was kind of disappointed because my niece's birthday was still far enough out that if the party had been scheduled in upcoming weeks, it would have been closer to her actual birthday.  My mom actually said ""yeah, it's crazy they are planning so early, but I don't think they knew it was your birthday.""    

My mom follows up with my SIL and asks if she knew the party was scheduled the day after my birthday.  My SIL apparently said that she knew, but figured she gave me enough advanced notice that I wouldn't plan anything.   TBH, that kind of pissed me off.  Until this point I had genuinely considered canceling my plans and rescheduling,  but this was under the assumption that they didn't know about my b-day.   In my head, it was more forgivable to forget my birthday than to intentionally plan something despite it being my b-day. My SIL did the latter.   
I reached out to my SIL to let her know that I wouldn't make it because I had b-day plans, but would get the presents to her at a later time.  We planned to have a get together at their house to celebrate all the kids' birthdays together. She reiterated that she thought I would just be able to plan my birthday around their party.  

Thing is, they blow off plans and ask people to change their plans constantly. Last Christmas, for example, I was going to have a family get together/meal starting at 3 pm.  My SIL told me that they would not come unless I had it earlier because my plans interfered with naptime (nieces don't nap anywhere but daycare, home, and her parents' house).  I changed the time to 10 am and had a Christmas brunch instead.

Anyhow, shortly after, another family member reached out and yelled at me for being so selfish.  I think they might have a point and feel pretty bad about not going now.

In December last year they found a brain tumour and in February husband was diagnosed with glioblastoma (stage 4 terminal brain cancer). His life expectancy is 12-18 months and we are 7 months down the road.  To say that life has been turned upside down is understatement of the century. Devastation, depression, anxiety, stress, chemo, surgery and two young children all add up to the worst time of my life with worse to come. I feel like a salmon constantly swimming upstream only for a bear to be waiting at the top. 

Although brother and I are close in age, I have a very maternal role with him. We have been close for a long time, he comes to me for advice, support and food! I’ve become close to his wife and the four of us have socialised many many times. 

When husband was diagnosed some people ran and some people have been very supportive. It’s true when they say you know who your friends are when you hit hard times. My sister has been amazing, as have close friends. Brother and wife however have been nowhere to be seen. 

I have been deeply hurt and upset and frankly fucking furious with brother and sister in law. Had the tables been turned I would have been there for anything and everything they needed. 

I now refuse to see brother and sister in law. Fuck them. I know they are devastated by what’s happening, she lost a close aunt to the same disease. Both are immature and have handled it badly. They are heartbroken. But still, my response has been “fuck you”. They haven’t reached out to me, I think they’re scared of my reaction. 

Anyway, Husband had a bit of an outpouring last night and along with two friends they made me wonder if I am the asshole here? Husband thinks so and friends this I’m being unreasonable now. Husband says he misses his friend and that I should get in touch with them. He says that my mother is upset by the feud and that it’s not fair to my brother to be shunned when he may not know that I am mad at him or why. 

We used to see them once a week or so and haven’t seen them for months. They both got VERY drunk at a family party in February and behaved like everything was great. I wanted to die and to kill them all.

She told us her situation at home was overwhelming and she'd love to be roommates. We agreed and wrote up a roommate agreement. We also set up a date so she could come over and see the place before making a decision. 

Well, she never came over. She started making excuses to not come over whenever we'd set up other dates. Our deadline was coming up pretty soon so we were really desperate to get a concrete yes from her. 

A couple days ago she texted my husband and said that we were actually her backup plan in case she couldn't get the place she applied for. She hadn't told us this from the start and only just sprung it on us as we neared our deadline. I was upset. 

I tried one last time to get her to come over but she didn't answer at all. So when I got an offer from a family member I was eager to accept it. This was a concrete plan in my eyes. We hashed out the details and now that family member is ordering her furniture to our address. 

I told my husband to let the friend know that we no longer needed a roommate and that she'd have to find another backup plan. He told her, but left the option of still moving in open to her. He said we'd figure it out if she needed a place to stay. 

I was livid at this point. I told my husband that she needed to find another backup because there was no way she could live on our couch. She repeatedly missed dates and wasn't honest in the beginning. He said I was overreacting and that she's a friend in need.

I'm contemplating texting her myself and letting her know that we can't accommodate her. Does that make me an asshole?",34,306,0.95
1276,Asshole,"Throwaway account and some details changed because I don't want anyone to identify me through this

So basically I have known my best friend - let's call him Adam - since we were in high school and we have been pretty much inseparable since we first met. We went to college together, I introduced him to his wife - we'll call her Eve, and I was Best Man at their wedding.

They had been married for two years and no mention of even trying for a baby. Unbeknownst to me, they had been struggling to get pregnant from pretty much when they got married. They had been to doctors and everything and basically they found out that the problem is with Adam but decided to keep trying ""naturally"" for a few more years because they're still young and IVF is really expensive.

Anyway I found all of this out about two months ago when Eve and I went away together for a work conference (we work in the same field and occasionally attend the same trainings/events etc). One night we got really smashed at the hotel bar and she basically burst out crying that she just wants a baby and she's afraid that it's never going to happen.

One thing led to another and after a lot more drinks we went up to my hotel room together. I feel sick even thinking about it - Adam is my best friend and I never meant to do anything like this. Eve was really upset about it too, and we both agreed to pretend it didn't happen and never mention it again.

Fast forward to yesterday, and Adam calls me absolutely over the moon. Eve is pregnant. He asked me out for some drinks so I go but the whole time there's this horrible nagging guilt.

Adam tells me about all the difficulty that they've been having conceiving and that he thought he was basically infertile. He's calling it his ""miracle baby"" and I've never seen him so happy about anything.

I don't know if I should tell him that the baby might not be his. They haven't had the first scan yet so they're not 100% sure about the dates, but I called Eve and spoke to her afterwards and she's pretty sure she's about 2 months along.

I don't know what to do. To clarify - I don't want anything to do with the baby even if it is mine. The thing with Eve was a mistake. This isn't about money or anything either because Eve makes more than both Adam and me anyway. I just don't know if I could break my best friend's heart - I feel like I would be destroying his whole life - like if I tell him, he will lose his best friend, wife and baby.

So, WIBTA if I just don't tell him that the baby probably isn't his?

**Also - I know that what I did was awful. I'm not asking about that. I already feel so terrible about it. I want to know whether I should tell him that the baby's not his when he is so happy.**

**Update 1:** I know I'm the biggest asshole in the world for what happened. I spoke to Eve this morning on the phone and we're coming up with a plan. She has the scan next week to determine how far along she is. If the dates don't align with the work conference then we're both going to just thank our lucky stars and be incredibly happy for this ""miracle baby"". If, however, it looks like it could be mine based on the dates, then we're undecided. Based on the pretty unanimous feedback here I guess we should come clean to Adam, but at the same time I'm still pretty torn up about destroying his - and the unborn baby's - lives. I appreciate that things always come out in the wash, but I don't know if maybe everyone would be happier if the story is just that this great and loving couple finally had their miracle baby.

Either way, I'm looking at quitting my job and moving to put a bit of distance between us all.",735,1487,0.9

I had stayed sober to take them home, because they were in a VERY sketch part of the city and my girlfriend is my priority. 

I have just bought a brand new (to me) car which is my pride and joy. My girlfriends friend is a mean drunk and she has never liked me. 

Throughout the night she kept making shitty comments to me about my new car (she didn’t know I could afford it, why am I so stingy with my girlfriend but I spend so much $$ on myself, how come I’m charging the rest of them gas money etc if I’m able to afford a new car, etc) and I just stayed quiet because I was there to make sure my girlfriend was safe and that was it. 

Towards the end of the night they were stumbling out to go home and my girlfriends friend looked at me dead in the eye, wet herself, and since she was wearing a skirt it obviously went all the way down her legs. 

Her friends thought it was the funniest thing in the world and so did a few other guys spilling out on the street except my girlfriend who was like ew wtf Clara why would you do that. She laughed and said it was an accident. She did stagger over to me and apologize but I just wasn’t having it. 

I didn’t even bother getting angry, I just told them that they could get her an Uber but they weren’t getting in my car. I got my girl in the front and locked the door, told them they weren’t getting in when they were pulling at the doors. 

I repeated that they needed to call her an Uber and I wasn’t no way in hell paying, but they were screeching at me calling me a jackass and an asshole so I told them to find their own way home and left. 

That night my girlfriend sobered up and was 100% on my team, but she’s had to deal with her friend group aftermath the next day all telling her that I’m a piece of shit.

1278,Not the A-hole,"My husband is a NSFW furry artist on Twitter. He has gained a crazy amount of followers over the last month, and is very excited, for a good reason, he works hard and loves what he does. 

Before he had as many followers as he does, I found out he was cheating on me with one of his followers. They would sent each other artworks they liked from other artists, they would role play sexually, and send each other photos of themselves. 

I now have a love/hate relationship with Twitter. He is on it constantly, because people are always writing him & talking to him about his art, etc. I have asked him to stop being on Twitter, just around me, so I don’t have to see the NSFW art that he retweets/likes/follows people for. (I am not a furry.) I hate it because in my opinion it’s a form of porn, and I feel like his past cheating put a wedge between us, which all started on Twitter. 

This morning we got into a fight because he was on Twitter again, and he told me if I loved him, I wouldn’t be ashamed of the art that he creates. I told him I’m not ashamed of him, I just don’t want to see him on Twitter since that was the place his past cheating began. I DO NOT think he’ll cheat on me again, it just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Edit: thanks so much to everyone for your judgements. I know I’m not the asshole, but as I am married to my husband, I need to learn that this Twitter thing is a part of his life now.

1279,Everyone Sucks,"TLDR: Girl who’s heavier than me constantly nagged me for my eating habits telling me that she eats more than me and “it’s fine.” I tell her that if she wants to eat how she does, fine, but I don’t want to look like her. AITA?

I’ve lost some weight recently, nothing too crazy. I’m 5’0 and down from 115 to 102.

Anyways, anytime I’m out with this group of friends, they always start the night by eating at the same place, a restaurant called “Cheesies” where—you guessed it—everything on the menu is some kind of buttered up sandwich smothered in cheese.

Since I’m trying to keep off the weight I lost, I tend to not order any food there (it’s a bar and grill type place so only having a drink is fine). It’s not only that I’m trying to keep the weight off, I also just don’t like cheese. So nothing on the menu really appeals to me. 

There’s this one girl (G) in the group I don’t know too well, and every time we go out she’s all over my case about not eating and is always nagging me to get food. G is an inch taller than me, but probably weighs closer to 160 if I had to guess. I’ve regularly explained that I don’t care to eat anything. I don’t make a big show of it or complain that I don’t like the menu, I just get a drink and happily chat until we head elsewhere.

The first time G brought up that I wasn’t eating, I simply said I wasn’t hungry because I already ate. By the third time, G started questioning me as to why I would eat before coming. I truthfully said that I lost some weight and am trying to eat healthier. I’m also monitoring my calories so if I want to have drinks tonight, I’d rather eat chicken for dinner instead of a calorie loaded cheese sandwich.

From there, G starts ranting about health and how I shouldn’t be worried about calories. She keeps saying stuff like “I eat so-and-so calories a day and I’m FINE.” I told her that’s fine for her but I’d rather stick to what works for me.

For the past year now this has been the routine anytime I’m out with these people. G gets on my case about what I’m eating and rants about how she eats more than me and that it’s fine and that I shouldn’t be so restrictive. The last time I was out, I finally got fed up with her complaining. When she said how what she eats is “fine” I snapped and just said “well that’s fine for you, but maybe I don’t care to look like you.”

The next day I’ll admit I did feel a little bad and like I was out of line. I don’t want to hurt her feelings. But at the same time, I was getting so annoyed with her constantly trying to criticize my eating habits when she was not exactly the pinnacle of health.

1283,Not the A-hole,"Edit: Spelling and grammar.

I was on a considerably empty flight. It was a 4 seat row plane, with 2 seats on each side. There was a family of 4 sitting near me, mom, dad, daughter and son that moved around quite a bit as there were many available seats to move about in and the kids (my guess girl was 8-9, boy told me he was 6) were for moving around but for the most part behaving. 

After take off, I took out my switch to pass the time and caught the little boys attention. He started asking questions, and I got the nod of approval from the dad so I started showing him BOTW gameplay. We still had about an hour of fly time, so I figured, why not, I’ll let them play Mario Party. 

I asked the dad(he was closest to me) if it would be alright if they played a game. He seemed happy with the idea, until I handed one of the two controllers I had to his daughter. He said something to her in a different language I didn’t understand, she fussed a little and then handed me back the controller saying she “can’t play”. It doesn’t take much to put 2 and 2 together. 

I didn’t want to defy her fathers wishes or make a scene, but I couldn’t help ask why she couldn’t play, hoping I was wrong. 

“Girls shouldn’t play video games”, his face and tone so matter of factly. 

He said this to me, a 27 year old woman, and I admit I got upset, but I couldn’t argue. I just told him that if she couldn’t play, I wouldn’t let his son play either. This is when things went really south. 

The son, of course got upset and started to cry a bit. The dad started raising his voice at me, and the daughter was trying to assure me it was ok, even though she was clearly sad. The wife tried calming her husband and kids, but she wasn’t getting anywhere.

I collected my controller from the son, and it hurt to pull away, but it just wasn’t fair. I hated upsetting him, but as a girl who was once also told video games were boy only, I wasn’t comfortable with that rule apply to my system. 

We were near the back, so a flight attendant came around to check what was going on, and the dad went into a tirade about how I purposely dangled the video game in front of his kids then changed my mind to be cruel. I couldn’t really explain myself, I just said I couldn’t let him play if the sister wasn’t allowed too. The flight attendant just looked at the father and said I didn’t have to share if I didn’t want to since it was my system, and he started ranting in another language. 

I asked to move, and he said yes as it was fairly empty flight. I moved to the front, but at this point all the passengers had turn to look at us, the now two crying kids and the angry father. 

It been bothering me since it happened and I’m wondering if I should have just let the boy play. It wasn’t his fault his father set those rules, and I really tore me up having to pull the controller away from him.

AITA for not finding a better solution? Or for offering in the first place? What should I have done?


Edit: I came to this subreddit because I felt/feel incredibly guilty. I made a very impulsive decision based on my feelings and didn’t consider the feelings of the boy until after I’d changed seats. I was embarrassed because no one in the plane had really started paying attention until after both kids had started crying and the father was making a fuss. During the rest of the flight I kept thinking that if I had just played with the boy, and instead of upsetting the entire family and myself, it would have only been one person, not to mention the scene would have been avoided. I was embarrassed and mortified the flight attendant had to come over. Flights are tough on everyone and I definitely created waves, plus who doesn’t feel guilty after making little kids cry? I’d been torn about whether I did the best I could do or if I could have done something better. There’s no way I’ll make any impact on the girls life, but I also ruined the flight for the family. Regardless, I’ll probably forever remember this day as one of my least favourites, it’s been a battle just trying to get over it.",755,6575,0.96

1288,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at the end.

Ok, so about 2 months ago, a teenage girl ran into the back of my tiny kia with a large jeep, doing approximately $2500.00 worth of damage. Her insurance  only gave me $1100.00, and refused to pay a penny more. Now, I cant fix my car and, barring a miracle, I'm stuck with it for 2 more years. Fucking sucks to be me. Because of how she hit it, my trunk is messed up. Once I open it, it will not close back. My options will then be to drive around for 2 years with my trunk bunjee corded shut, OR somehow pony up the other $1400 to fix it (definitely not an option). 
Well, for some reason my genius 14 year old brother put his marching band sneakers in there, a few months before it happened, and we all forgot. Well, now I've made the decision to not open my trunk until I sell the car. I tried to get into the trunk through the rear seats, but it wont work, so now he can't get his shoes out. Like, I feel bad, but I am not opening my trunk, period. 
Well, my stepdad found out about the shoes and ORDERED me to get them out. Mind you, I am 24, I don't live with them, I am financially independent, just visiting for the weekend. Other than being my 'parent', he has no authority over me at all. I flat out told him no. He flew off the handle on me, saying that I am a piece of shit because I won't save him the $60 to replace the shoes. I explained to him that if I open the trunk it will cost me $2500 to fix, but he says thats not his problem and I need to just suck it up and put bunjee cords on it. I told him I'm not doing that, sorry. He then stormed out and went to do it anyway. I told him if he touched my car Id call the police. He threw a massive fit, called me a bitch and threw his car keys at me. I even offered to just replace the shoes, and he got even more angry about how its ""the principle of the thing"". 
So now hes not speaking to my mom or I (shes on my side about it) and generally just pouting, and stomping around mumbling about how shitty we are. So, AITA?

TLDR:
Got in a wreck (I'm not at fault), insurance screwed me, now brothers shoes are trapped in the back of my car. If we open the trunk to get them, I either have to drive around with bunjee cords holding the trunk down (fpr 2 years)  or pay $2500 (that I simply dont have) to fix it. Stepdad is EXTREMELY angry, tried to get into my car after I said no, and won't even accept my offer to replace the shoes because it's the ""principal of the thing""

UPDATE: I have replaced the shoes, with a nicer, more expensive pair to boot. He's still not speaking to me. I will likely cut my visit short because of the tension, but at least he no longer has an excuse to break in to my car

 ETA: Thank you all for your sage advice! I wish I had received it earlier. At the time of the accident, I explored several options, and ultimately took the money from the insurance. I didn't fully understand what rights I had, but its been 2 months and I am no longer interested in fighting the insurance. It was awful, but I have made my peace with the bullshit I was handed. I am just pushing forward. I just want to move on with my life honestly.",44,107,0.94

We are pretty quiet people, we both work full time and I am in school full time so we aren’t home much. We don’t have people over since we live in a city we usually go out to see our friends. We have two small dogs who don’t make too much noise. One day our downstairs neighbors confronted us and asked us to stop ‘stomping’ and that we were making too much noise. To be honest, I know sometimes you just don’t realize when you’re walking loud and I tend to put the weight on my heels when I walk so my boyfriend and I apologized and have been trying to walk quietly and softly. However, they don’t ever leave their house.. I don’t know if they just don’t work or what but they are literally always home and have been angry at us for things out of our control.

We have 2 kids, she works an 8-5 job, 5 days a week.  I work, but the nature of my job is that I have a lot more time off than she does.  

Now, I'm an early bird, always have been.  I watched my wife sleep 12 hours a day before we were married. Obviously with 2 kids, that doesn't happen.   

Here's the problem as I see it.  My early bird nature means I'm always getting the kids first thing, and holding my own with them until she gets tired of trying to sleep through a toddler playing and 6 month being a  6 month old.  This doesnt bother me, it's nice dad time with my kids.

However, 2 twice a month, I play TTRPG's with friends.  We all work, so these are good nights to recharge and catch up on the week.  These nights tend to go super late, late enough for me, that I don't want to wake up until 8 or 9.

But my wife tells me that IATA for sleeping in regardless of whether I busted my dick with 70 hours in 4 days or game night.   I'm no slouch any other day, and I always felt a little quid pro quo was in order.

1300,Asshole,"Title says it all really.

I recently found out on Instagram that one of my exes is pregnant with her husband. Like, I'm super happy for her and everything. Not really an axe to grind on that.

The problem is that she always had a reputation (even when we were together) as a massive party girl (drinking a lot and drugs too). Even though I think that she has calmed down over the last few years, she still posts photos of her out with friends with massive cocktails and stuff.

Anyway she did this stupid post announcing her pregnancy on Instagram, and it's a photo of her and her friends sitting at a booth in a bar. She's wearing a ""mom to be"" top and has a GIANT BOWL of a cocktail in front of her.

Well that was the final straw for me.

So I message her and make sure that it's really carefully worded. I'm a doctor and so I felt like I have an obligation to intervene when she might be putting this unborn child and risk. I sent a message to her Instagram account saying ""Hey \[ex's name\]. Look I'm so happy to see that it's worked out with you and \[husband\]. Congratulations on the pregnancy! But lol I think I would be a bit remiss if I didn't say something about the drinking. As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the impact that alcohol can have on a developing foetus. You really should be careful with what you're putting in to your body during this time!""

She responded by calling me an asshole and telling me to mind my own business. Now she's blocked me. I sent a similar message to her husband because maybe he can try to talk to her about the drinking, but he hasn't responded.

So reddit, I will accept your verdict. AITA for caring more about the health and wellbeing of an unborn child than the feelings of my ex?

**Update:** So one of her friends just sent me this ridiculously long and angry text basically accusing me of all these horrible things I ""allegedly"" did while I was dating my ex. Calling me manipulative and a narcissist as well. Apparently that's why none of them talk to me anymore. Anyway apparently I should have magically *known* that my ex has been sober for three years ever since - wait for it - one of our mutual friends from premed was killed by a drink driver. No idea how I was supposed to know that when everyone had decided to cut me off, and no one seemed to care that finding that out might have been really upsetting for me too.

I made a new Instagram account and messaged my ex to tell her that it's really irresponsible to make it look like she's drinking while pregnant even if she isn't because people are impressionable and might copy that and it makes her look like an idiot.",444,480,0.88
1301,Asshole,"I was at work and these two woman work alongside me, to be honest I don't even know their names, since they constantly speak in their own language to each other.

It doesn't bother me, as I have no immediate reason to talk to them. Well yesterday one of them came up to me and started talking to me in their language,  I was really busy and said: ""sorry I don't speak whatever language that is""

Well she got really upset and left, now this is where ITA... she was actually trying to talk to me in English,  but her accent was so thick and my attention so focused on something else that I guess my brain dismisses it before I had time to process it.

1302,No A-holes here,"Every year the husband of my sister goes away for 1 week and my sister, who has 2 kids (5 yo and 2yo) always asks if I can come live with her for the week. She is very scared alone in the house. 

Normally I always go, but I never like it. It's always super chaotic with the two kids, I always feel like I'm more a burden than a help and she lives away from all my friends and I don't have a car, the only thing I can do when I'm there is sit at home, study, watch tv, use my laptopt etc, but most of the time I have to entertain the kids, I'm fine doing it for a day, but man I hate having to play with them 24/7 for the whole week. And even if I tell them no, they just keep asking and bugging me about it. When I go to her place I feel like I'm wasting a whole week in my life, that I'm living just to please her. 

I only do it for her, but last year was the worst year of all. She kept telling that I could go home early, that she's actually fine on her own, asking me why I'm actually there etc... I was there for her, but it seemed like she didn't even want me there even though she did ask me.

This year she asked me again, I told her I didn't want too because I don't like doing it and last year she was so mean. She told me that she doesn't remember that she told those things to me last year and keeps asking me to come sleep at her place for the week and that she is very scared.

1303,Everyone Sucks,"We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",5276,54123,0.92
1304,Asshole,"My brother and I both run small restaurants. His has been open and successful for a couple of years, and I only opened mine a few months ago but am having some good success as well. I have recently been looking into bringing more waitstaff on and have been actively scouting competitors to poach from. I'm gonna say this outright, I don't think this is an asshole move, it's a legitimate business tactic and I don't feel any guilt. However, about a month ago I was eating at my brother's restaurant and was incredibly impressed by one of his employees, she was insanely good at her job and I decided to do my usual routine of offering her a pay increase if she wanted to work for me. Thankfully, she rang me the next day and we negotiated a good deal, including that she give a months notice to my brother. I wanted to make sure he had more than enough time to find someone else to replace and get trained up, and an entire month is ample for that. 2 weeks after she let him know she was leaving, he essentially told her she wasn't needed anymore and so she started working for me. This was great for a couple of weeks, all my customers like her and she works great with the other employees. A couple of days ago however, my brother came in and saw her working for me. He was and currently is furious that I poached from him and won't even speak to me beyond telling me to go fuck myself.

&#x200B;

Like I said, he's not talking to me, but looking at his recent reviews, there has not been a noticeable drop in customer satisfaction, but my recent reviews are slightly higher with a couple of people even mentioning her by name. As far as I can tell, nobody has lost in this deal, his restaurant is doing the same, I'm doing better and my waitress gets a pay rise. He thinks I'm an asshole though, so I'm curious what the hivemind thinks.

1305,Not the A-hole,"My best friend has been in a relationship since January this year. We're all in our mid-twenties and I'm happy that she's finally with a man who puts as much effort into their relationship as she does, but it's been somewhat taxing as I rarely get to spend one-on-one time with her, but since they're still in that early stage I've been willing to put up with it.

My best friend and I have been planning to go on a summer vacation together since last year, and finally booked it a few weeks ago. This week I was on a trip with a group of people when my best friend's boyfriend messaged me and talked about joining us for our vacation. My best friend has already been on a vacation with another friend of ours this year, and as her boyfriend joked about joining them as well, and I was half-drunk, I was playing along saying stuff like, ""Yeah right, haha. That's gonna be fun."" I honestly had no idea he could be serious about this, because the thought of joining your significant other on an eight day vacation with their best friend is absurd to me.

Thursday came around and it turned out he actually was being serious. He said he wants to surprise her, I said I want to spend this vacation alone with her as I rarely ever see her alone these days. I asked him to put himself in my shoes, and how he would feel if I had joined them for their vacation together. He said it's just the last two days (although with the date he's given me, it'd actually be three days). I told him it doesn't matter. They're at a wedding together prior to our vacation. They're literally gonna go on a vacation (their second one this year) with my best friend's parents after our vacation. They spend a shit ton of time together, they're not in a LDR or anything of the sort, it's absolutely not necessary for him to join us. He said he has already booked the flight. I don't even know where he planned on staying. I'm absolutely livid at this point and have since stopped checking my messages because I didn't want to ruin the rest of my trip, and I don't know what to do if he insists on coming, or if he can't cancel the flight.

1309,Asshole,"Wifey (37F) and I (38M) have been married near on a decade and have a couple of little human alarm clocks together. Relationship wise, we have our ups and downs but generally speaking it’s all good in the hood. 

At any rate, my wife’s family has 2 group chats;
- one with her parents, their 3 kids (including my wife) and their significant others (including me) 
- one with just her parents and their 3 kids (let’s call this the ‘family only’) 

The exclusive ‘family only’ chat dings away daily and l, you guessed it, the one with the significant others gets about as much use as a push up bra in a convent.

It’s been grating me for a while that they continually post stuff on the family only chat, mainly cause a lot of it is about my kids and I’ve also seen it used to post photos of me in a joking manner without my knowledge. 

My wife tried to show me some photos from the ‘family only’ chat tonight and I told her I wasn’t interested at looking at it and if they wanted me to see something their could post it on the chat I am in. She said that I’m being “weird about it” and that “it’s no big deal”. She said she would just add me which she has said previously when I’ve bitched about it but it never eventuated. The name of the group is all of their initials so I wouldn’t want to ruin their little acronym anyway. 

AITA for even caring about this? I  honestly don’t know why it grates me but i just think it’s BS family politics. 

For the record my family has a similar chat and my wife is in that group, 

Over to you reddit.

Edit - point taken. I’ll stop being a whiney self centred POS. Some people on here need to chill the f out though, all I’ve done is have a whinge about something that’s grating me on here and I’ve barely mentioned anything about it verbally. Just thought I’d post to see if my personal compass is out of whack, but some people are just scathing as anything. Guess it comes with the redditory

Edit 2 - also strikes me as odd that I’ve been banned from posting on this sub for a month meaning I can’t respond to any comments. Don’t think I’ve said anything mildly controversial. I did write YTA in one response but it was only to remind the person that they forgot to include the judgement in his response, in which they made it abundantly clear IATA.

Edit 3 - it really dawned on me reading these responses that it is people’s opinion on what constitutes ‘family’ which swayed their views. The blood is thicker than water gang (about 70% at a guess) were quick to label me the A as I am not family so should never expect to be in their family chat. 
Those who subscribe to the idea that once you get hitched you are ‘welcomed to the family’ and are engrained from that point on were very much in the NTA camp. 
What’s funny is that almost every wedding I’ve been to someone throws out the ‘welcome to the family’ kind of comment but it is all just bollocks really. Hardly anyone really means that and save to say, most posters here don’t seem to think that is actually the case. To be fair to my wife’s family, they have never ever said anything like that and generally laugh at those cultures who see marriage as an extension of the direct family unit.

Towards the end of the quiz I said it'll be good to get home and get an early night because I've a run in the morning. My friend's head pops up and he said ""I thought you were driving me home"" and I said ""I am, right after this quiz"". He'd got it in his head that I was going to stay out until 1 or 2am and then drive him home. He didn't like that and gave me dirty looks for the rest of the night and then said this morning that my ""attempt to drive him home left a lot to be desired"".

1312,Not the A-hole,"So some back story. Me and my partner met in Australia. We were having so much fun, up until she went away on a month long holiday. I took this opportunity to travel the areas of Australia I haven’t already seen. Which happens to be on the other side of the country (4 hour flight).

Whilst travelling I was missing her very much. And suggested I’d get back as soon as possible upon her return so we could continue our lives together until my Visa ends in May 2020. When this ends I’ll have to return to my home country which is on the other side of the world. I even suggested we move in together for the remainder of the short period we have together, and solve the issue when May rolled round. Only reason I didn’t return upon her arrival, 2 days ago, was because I’m broke beyond belief! 

Whilst out on the opposite side of the country. I came across a job, I didn’t think much of it, but it sounded promising, and I needed the money to get back to my soon arriving girlfriend. 

I’ve just finished the first week of this job. And I get paid based on commission. I ended up impressing beyond belief. To the point where I earned close to $1000 a day. Which for someone with $2.24 in their bank account is amazing. The director took me aside and told me he wants me on the management program, and that comes with sponsorship! And wants to expand to my girlfriends city where I could work in the future!! I WONT HAVE TO LEAVE MY GIRLFRIEND IN MAY! amazing. NO, apparently not!!!!

I have received 0 support from my SO on this fact. Even though the money, the sponsorship and everything could set us up to spend the rest of our lives together. But she keeps saying it’s a terrible thing. And that I’ll fall in love with someone else and I’m not doing this for us, I’m doing it for myself! And being selfish by doing so, she wants me to drop everything I’ve built in the last week to return to her! Even if it’s only for a short while until I’m booted out the country! Even though the only reason I want sponsorship is to continue our relationship!!! 

She believes that I’m not taking her side into account, and she wants me to make some money and get back, then work out the issue on May when it rolls around, which IMO is the stupidest thing to do, why would I turn down a chance of spending the rest of our lives together, by leaving this job to see her immediately, but still on a limited timer. 

I’m absolutely distraught by the fact I’m receiving no support by her, and also by the fact she thinks I’ll cheat or fall out of love while away. 

AITA for telling her I’m not leaving the job, and if she can’t support me, then she needs to make a choice to end or continue this! 


TLDR: Relationship became long distance temporarily, now I’ve found an incredible job who can keep me in the same country as SO via sponsorship, and I’m receiving no support.

[EDIT] A lot of people questioning the job or saying it sounds to good to be true. The job is purely commission based with a near enough minimum wage base salary. But I’ve been doing really well at it and naturally fall into this kind of job with the person I am. The job is an appointment/promotion based solar sales job.

1313,Asshole,"Last Sunday my sister and I were scheduled to board a flight home. We had been visiting another country together to visit some extended family. Said family lives in rural villages so takes quite a while to get there from the city.

Anyway, on our way through airport security my sister gets taken aside for a random pat down search... not sure what the proper name is. But my sister refuses as the person is a middle aged guy and she doesn’t want to be “groped by an old man” as she put it. She insists that a female pats her down. The guy explains in broken English that no females are available today and to let him search her, which she continues to refuse. This goes on for about 10 minutes, during which I continually ask my sister to just let him do his job, at which point I simply ask the guy if I can continue on. He says I can, so I apologise for my sister’s behaviour and do so. 

I don’t know what happened after I left, but after about 30 minutes of sitting in the duty free area my sister txts me to come out. She says she was made to leave the security check point and is now being refused entry. I simply replied “I’m not delaying seeing my kids because you couldn’t swallow your pride and let the man do his job. I’m not coming out.”

She kept blowing up my phone, so I turned it on flight mode and eventually boarded my flight home. My parents (and sister obviously) think I acted incredibly cruelly by “abandoning” her. I disagree, she’s an adult now and should know better than to pull that nonsense in an airport of all places.

AITA for choosing adoption over having my mother raise my baby?

I recently got out of a 2 year relationship and not to get too much into it but, he cheated on me, and I decided to throw caution to the wind and give Tinder a shot. I matched with someone and one thing led to another and we ended up at his place, no need to describe what happened next ;D. Just my luck, 5 weeks later, I noticed my period was late and I decided to head to the dollar store and buy a pregnancy test… SURPRISE I was pregnant. Being a 21 year old living at home with my mom and step dad, going to college full time, I was freaking out, this wasn’t what I had in mind. 

Let me stop here and give a little background on my mom. She too was a young/ single mom, had me at 20 and coming from the south, abortion was out of the question  for her and she had to have me. Growing up I had to pretty much fend for myself, my mom was busy either working or trying to recover her lost years by going out to parties, and hanging out with the wrong crowd. She eventually met Ron, my now stepdad, a corrections officer and got her life together. Two story house, picket fence, and two dogs. Because of this, let’s just say that our relationship isn’t exactly the ideal mother/daughter relationship. However, since I live with them, I had to tell her that I was pregnant. 

When she heard the news she was very happy and excited to be a grandma, I had to then break it to her that I was not planning on keeping the baby. I am pro choice, and abortion is not for me, so I decided I would place my baby up for adoption. I did not make the decision lightly, however, I am a college student with the goal of becoming a doctor and did not want this to stop me in my tracks. My mom offered to raise the baby as her own, and I refused, that is not an option. She was offended and asked me why, I told her that this baby was not going to be her make up baby, to make up for how she raised me. 

I am now almost full term and the baby can come at any moment, I have an adoptive family lined up and as the day is quickly approaching, I am now wondering if I should have had my mom just raise the baby. AITA for not letting my mom raise it in the first place?",140,740,0.94
1315,Not the A-hole,"My wife (37 F) and I (35 M) have been married for almost 10 years.  We love each other very much, but we rarely find something that we both do in terms of entertainment.  But besides that, if it wasn’t for her pushing me in my career, I wouldn’t be in the position I am now making tons of money and doing what I love to do!

Bit of a backstory:  She is originally from Turkey and I met her when I was stationed there.  She WAS a huge soccer fan and supported Fenerbahçe. I have no clue about Turkish soccer and choose to support Galatasaray...I don’t know why I picked them.  When they played each other, we had our friendly rivalry moments, but nothing serious.

 We got married and then when we moved to England a few months later.  I didn’t really support a team there, but just enjoyed the soccer culture overall.  However, apparently I “overloaded” her with soccer during our 4 years there that she doesn’t find any joy in watching it anymore.

We came to the states in 2014 and if she felt overloaded with soccer in England..she absolutely HATES baseball! Her complaints about it: She doesn’t understand it, its too boring, there are too many rules, opposite fans are sitting next to each other and not fighting (no joke, that was a 100% honest true complaint she has).

One night, we had a talked about something we can do together.  Naturally I say “let’s go to a baseball game.”  There was no bargaining or anything, she said no.  She suggested the music fest at the local Turkish Community Center.  

Now this is where the talk turns deep...when we do stuff, 90% of the time we do what she wants, 5% its with her friends, and 5% its something neutral we both “agree” to do (movies, hike, or stay in).  My choices of what to do are (according to her) usually too boring (sports, musicals/plays, museums), too far (wine tasting), or we’re too old (raves, clubs, concerts).  I debated this with her and we talked for a long time.  But the main points I brought up was my unease to go to the music fest because:

1.  I don’t know Turkish and don’t know the music.

2.  I know of her friends, but I can’t relate to their husbands who are all Turkish.

Finally, we compromised:  I’ll go to the music fest on Saturday IF she goes with me to the game on Wed night.  With a big SIGH she says “fine.”  I jump online and book the tickets for the Wed night game and even mark it in her phone.  

Wed morning and she calls me asking what is this event on her calendar.  I remind her of the deal we made and she completely denies ever making a deal with me!  I told her she said “fine” which I took it as a “okay lets do it.”  But it wasn’t according to her and I should’ve asked to clarify.  I told her if shes going to the game and she downright says no! I remind her that the deal was if she went to the game, I would go to the Music Fest with her...this leads to a huge argument of her calling me immature and selfish blah blah blah.

2. He's the only one who drives it, so my opinion doesn't count as much.

I'm mad because:

However, there are things that simply do not happen, or are forgotten. A bill didn't get paid on time. A child was not picked up from an activity. She cannot recall key conversations or interactions. She would tell me that she would handle something, or arrange or confirm plans, and then it simply doesn't happen. 
When confronted, she either doesn't recall anything, or recalls events, details and conversations differently. The denial is so adamant, I often wonder if I am crazy. This has put a strain on relationships and our marriage. 
We had a summer vacation planned to take place after summer semester finals. When we were discussing this vacation at the start of summer, she was excited and stated she would handle the camp ground reservations as well as tent trailer rental. 
Monday night, I am sitting at the dinner table, studying for finals. She comes up and asks me how I want to handle the tent trailer reservation. The vacation is the first weekend in August and renting a tent trailer this late in the season has slim to no chance. Even the camp group told us good luck when we called. 

This turned into a serious, serious fight. Everyone has been looking forward to a week camping near the lake. We took a break from arguing, in hopes of calming down, and I realized that I hate my wife. I honestly hate her for the doubt and feeling that I am taking crazy pills feeling. For all the times things have been forgotten or recalled incorrectly. For all the times that she was so adamant in her often, incorrect memory. She has admitted that her recollection is often wrong, and others have gently told her. 
We resumed talking/arguing, much calmer this time, and I calmly told her I hated her, and I told her why. She broke down and stated that I am the worst human ever for tearing her down and making her feel worse. There is a part of me that was shocked at the whole conversation, but the overpowering, and calm hate that courses through me is overwhelming. I packed up and left. These events took place on Monday, and my calm hatred has not abated. I journal every day, and this past week I've been reading back entries, and I realize that this has been building up for a long time now. My kids want me to return, but I cannot bring myself to return...the hate is still too strong. Finals start Monday and I cannot sleep.

1322,Everyone Sucks,"I'm half Japanese and my family recently moved into my stepdad's house.  I speak English with my brothers but Japanese with my mom. At the dinner table, my stepdad will get angry if we speak Japanese because he feels left out.  He frequently stands up and declares that he is left out and leaves the room to watch TV.

I have major problems with him as he frequently trash talks my dad and screams at us.

I live in Australia and my mother is the only connection I have with my Japanese heritage and being able to speak Japanese is really important to me.

I don't feel obligated to speak English around him just because he wants to hear what I'm talking to my mom about.

Edit:  To clarify Japanese is the only language I have ever spoke with my mom and it feels incredibly weird speaking English with her. I speak Japanese with her even around other people e.g my dad or friends and family.

1324,Not the A-hole,"Some backstory, my dad ran away when I was a young kid, and my mom died when I was 15. Nobody else was willing to take me in, and I was about to go into the foster system, but my cousin ended up stepping up and taking me in. She was 24 and she was not exactly fit to raise a kid but she did as much as she could. I spent the next two years in her cramped apartment before I went to college, and while it wasn't perfect, it was better than nothing. Of course, I am extremely grateful to my cousin for this. 

Anyways, I went to college and got a relatively good job for a 23 year old. Not a great one, I don't make that much money. But my cousin had an even rougher time, she ended up dating an abusive guy and she quit her job when she got pregnant, only for the child to die soon after she gave birth. Her asshole boyfriend then left her after the kid died. Not only that, but she was burdened with medical bills. 

My aunt started a big charity thing to help her out (note, not her mom, another aunt). My aunt asked me to donate some money, and I put in 400 dollars. Just some context, I only had 1,200 dollars in my savings account. My aunt was pretty upset at the fact that I only put 400 dollars in the charity fund, saying that I lived in a nice apartment (I didn't, its in nyc but it isn't 'nice') and that I had a good job (again, not a good job, it just sounds fancy because its media related) and that I should put more in. She also said she noticed a lot of 'electronics' at my place which are likely worth a lot of money and that I could sell them to make money to give to my cousin (once again, not worth a lot of money, probably like 350 bucks max if I was to sell them). She said if it were her, and that if she was taken in by her as a teen, she would be giving as much money as possible to the charity fund. 

The thing is, there's already like 5,000 dollars in that fund. My cousins new apartments rent is 650 a month, and she has experience working and will likely get a new job soon, not to mention that my aunt and other family keep giving more money. I have a strong feeling that this doesn't have much to do with how much money I am putting in and more that my aunt views me as entitled and greedy. I mean I already put 1/3rd of my savings into the fund. I explained this to her and she just sort of acted like that doesn't matter. Then my uncle also came around and said the same thing basically. That she helped raised me, and I should do more. He said I was lazy and that I am selfish and don't want to help family out despite her being there for me. My uncle even said that maybe I should move from NYC, where my job is, to get a cheaper apartment to have more money to help her out. 

My cousin has barely said anything. She just thanked me for the 400 dollars and said we should get lunch sometime. That's it. This is entirely my aunt and uncle saying this stuff. But I can tell they are ranting a lot to everyone else in the family.",18,31,0.98

1326,Not the A-hole,"Last Christmas my wife and I were to attend a party. We decided to drive separately as I had to help get things ready and she was going to meet me there when it started. The road leading to the building was a very busy two lane road where the speed limit was 40mph. To turn left into the parking lot other cars had to go around you.

This particular Friday night while cutting a ham I got a call from my wife saying ""I just got in a wreck outside, you have to hurry! It's bad! It's so bad!"" I immediately ran out of the building and saw the crunched Subaru she was driving and the Chevy Cruz that a business man was driving. The entire trunk of the outback was squished in half, the wheel wells were sticking out and neither back door could be open. The guy I suspect was texting and didn't see my wife waiting to turn left and drive straight into the car going 40mph+ totaling the car. Now neither my wife or I had been in a wreck before so there was quite a bit of adrenaline going through us. The man who rear-ended my wife was fairly nice and took responsibility saying that it was his fault and that he was sorry.

After taking pictures, pulling the car off to the side of the road, and calling the police we were asked if we wanted them to call an ambulance to make sure she was ok. Now I would have said yes no matter what to make sure my wife and unborn child were ok, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't want the guy that hit her to know that he just rear-ended a pregnant woman because he was texting and not paying attention. I said ""well she's pregnant, so we should call an ambulance and make sure she's OK"" loud enough so the guy could her.

1328,Not the A-hole,"I’ll try to keep this pretty short. So, I graduated college a little while ago and my parents decided that they would get me a graduation gift to reward me. My mom wanted to pay for me to go on a trip and my dad wanted to get me a bike, so they decided to try to do both. My dad eventually found a *very nice* used mountain bike on Craigslist that was listed for less than $2,000. For a bike for that quality, this was an incredible deal and I really wanted this bike so I was stoked.

My dad took me with him to buy the bike so I could check it out and make sure the size was right before he sealed the deal. The bike was in fucking glorious, perfect condition and it fits perfectly so he told the seller that we’d take it. However, *after* telling the seller that we would buy the bike, my dad casually mentioned to me that he was using pretty much all of the inheritance money my grandfather had left me to finance most of the purchase and asked if that was cool with me. Since we had already agreed to buy and I didn’t even fully understand what he was saying, I was like “yeah, ok, I guess”.

Now, I feel kind of weird about the whole situation. I love the bike and it’s possible that, had I been given the money, I would have just spent it on the exact same bike. However, I feel like I was robbed of a choice in the matter, as I didn’t know the inheritance money existed before this. Since I just graduated, I have rent/deposit on an apartment, student loan debt and a whole bunch of other expenses looming over my head. If I had more time to consider what I wanted the money spent on, I might have made a different decision. Maybe I would have set it aside to pay rent and deposit on an apartment or buy furniture or help with expenses until I get a job and get my first paycheck. I could have always bought the bike later. I also feel weird about the fact that he called the bike a gift, but bought it with what is essentially my own money.

I'm afraid that, if I confront him about this, he will be furious. Honestly, I’m afraid to even ask if there is any more of my inheritance left for me, as he might get angry. He will say that I’m ungrateful because he made the effort to find the bike and score a great deal on it, therefore saving me a ton of money if I attempt to buy the same bike in the future. He might also argue that he is entitled to decide how to spend it since he's my dad. And it’s not like he spent it on himself. Maybe he’s right. AITA?",29,52,0.92
1329,Not the A-hole,"Sorry in advance for the long post:

I recently moved to a large city and began renting a room in a house. It was essentially month-to-month as long as we found our replacement when we left. New tenants fill out an application, pay for background/credit checks, and need to be approved - the whole process took me 3 days.

Earlier this month, I email my landlord letting her know I found a new place and would be moving out at the end of the month. I ask for the application info via email, and later text with no response. I’m told she prefers calls, so I go that route. I’m given the details and am told to send applications to her before she leaves town at the end of the month. New tenant fills out an application and pays that night, I confirm with the landlord that she has it, and am told she should have no issue being approved.

After 4 days with no update, I call. I’m told we’ll have a decision in 3 days. 3 days later, I call and am told she’ll let me know when the checks come back. New tenant calls the next day and is told the same thing. This goes on for over two weeks with no decision or information. It looks like I’m going to lose my tenant, so my coworker recommends I contact the city's tenant advocate service. An attorney listens to my situation and tells me what to email my landlord. I wait two more days as my housemates try to contact her with no luck - she will not respond to any emails or text messages, and pushes back the decision date in every call. I finally send the attorney’s recommended email. Two hours later, my landlord emails back in all caps asking if I’m serious, and leaves me a rude voicemail that she’s working as fast as she can. The next day she has approved the application and is furious with me.

My housemate are telling me I did the right thing (since this has happened before - it took one girl a dozen emails and 4 months to be able to sign the lease). This is a better outcome than losing thousands of dollars in rent because an application is ignored, but I feel like an asshole for sending the nuclear option, “I’m working with a free attorney” , email just to get her to respond to me. I relied on my midwestern niceness up until I sent that final email (despite it getting me nowhere), and now I feel gross and manipulative after having sent it.

1339,Not the A-hole," So, about two months ago (as of 8/1) my friend from high school needed some help. He was having difficulty living with his mom / sister ( he's 31 ) and was hating everything. Thoughtlessly, I asked him if he wanted to move in with me. I live 13 hours away from him.

I set the ground rules: He'd need to get a job, he'd need to start saving for a car so I wouldn't have to drive him everywhere. I wouldn't make him contribute to rent until he could afford it, because I'd be paying that rent regardless of whether he's here or not. At most, I'd expect him to help out with the utilities - but not up front.

He asked if I could help him break in to the tech field, and I agreed I could at least help him learn some stuff, and introduce him to a couple recruiters for at least entry level tech jobs. I gave him access to my codecademy account to get him started 

Things started going awry after 2 weeks. He'd done approximately 5% of a class. No visible job progress. He was eating everything, even things I'd ordered for myself, despite having gotten groceries specifically for him. 

He leaves dirty dishes everywhere with the idea of ""I wash it when I need it, and then we don't have to do dishes regularly."" Fine. But at least dump them in the sink? Idgaf, but on the table / counter / random boxes covered in food bits != the answer. He leaves trash in communal spaces. At one point, he somehow managed to leave a poptart wrapper in the water filter part of one of my water pitchers. 

His primary function after two months is nothing BUT gaming. In an attempt to try for SOMETHING, I even gave him some equipment he could use to try and start up a twitch stream ( something he's expressed interest in in the past, and he's entertaining enough to pull it off, usually. ) and he... didn't.

I've taken him to his interviews a total of 3 in 2 full months, that he hasn't seemed to put any real effort in until today.

I'm just frustrated at this point. If he were making ANY sort of progress I'd be all for it. But alas, I can see during the day when I'm at work: ""Currently playing DOTA 2"" on his Discord.

I'm ready to kick him out. But if I do, he will be 100% homeless. No car, no job, in a city that isn't his, with no one else around to help him.  I've had a few more conversations about his status and what he's doing but nothing. I offered him a hand and a new place to get started - I didn't intend to adopt a 30 year old man as a new child. I wasn't ever offering to subsidize his entire life.

I asked him if he reached out to any of the recruiters I specifically sent to him, or filled out any of the online apps I've thrown his way, and he's said no. So, I need to know:

1340,Not the A-hole,"So. Last night, I was at a party full of people I didn’t really know. My good friend invited me, it was his girlfriend’s party. I really wanted to make some new friends, so I figured a lot of drinking would do the trick. My girlfriend, who was there too, suggested a drinking game, and I downloaded an app and everyone there (8) put their names in. It was a pretty generic drinking game app, rules of game were simple- a category is read aloud and each person has to state a word relating to it. If they repeat themselves or freeze, they have to have 3 drinks. “Female erogenous zones” was the first topic, and I asked everyone what that meant. I had a vague idea that it meant sensitive areas, but I wasn’t 100%. Things got weird. 

Everyone fell silent and wouldn’t answer my question. My girlfriend assumed the discomfort was due to people not being confident in discussing female anatomy, so she was quick to answer my question and fill the silence. There were a few things muttered before that, which, in hindsight, were indicating to just skip that question, but nothing was obvious. After the question was asked and each person answered, a person to the left of me was the first to drink because he couldn’t think of anything, so the topic was over. It was then that all girls in the room, minus my girlfriend, got up pretty abruptly and left the room. I didn’t think much of it, I didn’t know these people. It was not more than a few minutes later that two of the guests left, without any goodbyes. 

Fast forward to the end of the night. I’d had a pretty good one- I was really social and friendly and I hadn’t gotten too drunk. It was just me, my friend, and his girlfriend (the host) sitting and having a beer. She’d said to me earlier that she needed to talk to me, and I figured it was about another issue. 

She told me that I’d made two of her friends incredibly uncomfortable, to the point where they had to leave. I was pretty shocked and asked what happened. She revealed to me that one of the people who left the party early was non-binary, (gender nonconforming) and I shouldn’t have read out that drinking game question about female erogenous zones. I was super apologetic, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt it was really stupid. The issue was, apparently, that I had mentioned gender in front of them. The host began crying and yelling that this was ‘fucked’, and ‘how could I not have read the room’, and that the hints they were giving me were obvious. She claimed I ruined what was supposed to be a special night for her, and stormed out of the room crying. 

Upon reflection, I am confident I never once misgendered this person, or referred to them as ‘she’. Not that I knew not to at the time, but I know I didn’t.

She replied that just because other people were making a mess and making the workers' lives harder didn't make it right for me to do so and that she had similarly always put her peanut shells back in her bag when she went to the ball games growing up (and that is what her parents taught her to do).

Her arguments made sense so I just went along with bagging up the peanut shells, but I also felt that I was following the social norm in this situation and therefore not the asshole. Am I (and everyone else who leaves trash at their seat at the ballgame) an asshole, or is my friend just particularly conscientious.

Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

EDIT : Thanks everyone for your responses, its good to hear your honest thoughts. I accept the asshole verdict, but I don't think I'm going to bother throwing away my shells unless they give me a cup when I buy my peanuts or I already have trash the shells could go in (i.e. a beer, fry bucket, etc). And as always, I will throw away my non-peanut shell trash myself.",62,40,0.79
1346,Not the A-hole,"My mom died a few years ago from cancer. While she was sick, we did a lot of crafts together. One of the things we did was to repaint a little table that belonged to my mom's dad a long time ago. When we painted it, my mom and I got the idea that it would be nice to put our fingerprints and names on the top of the table as a kind of remembrance thing, since we knew her cancer was terminal. My dad was upset about the idea (he hadn't come to terms with my mom's illness yet) and refused to participate. He said the idea was stupid. She was annoyed he wouldn't do it with us, and after we tried to get him to join in a few times and he still wouldn't, she said it could just be our own little thing. So we hid our fingerprints on the bottom together and didn't tell him about it.

My dad lived with my husband and I for a year after she died, so ownership of the table hadn't come up yet. Now he has his own house a few states away and is asking me to bring some things over when I come to visit, including that table. I told him I'm sorry, but he can't have the table, and I told him my mom's and my fingerprints are on the bottom. He said he doesn't care who painted it or whose fingerprints are on it, it was in his house for decades and it's his. He said he repaired one of the table legs for her years ago and he wants it because it was hers. I feel sick at the thought of giving him something my mom and I shared. I feel like he didn't want to be a part of the memory we made with that table, when it could have been something all three of us shared, and so I can't stand for him to take it from me. I don't think he cares about it the same way I do. Am I being completely unreasonable?",37,68,0.96
1347,Not the A-hole,"I have been in a relationship with my BF for about two years. One rule I have is that I do not date men that are in the closet. I have no desire to keep my relationship secret. When I first started dating my partner, he was aware of this rule. I was also aware of the fact that he was not out
to his parents but his friends knew he was gay. I didn’t care at the time because I figured me and him were just a fling anyway. 

Well, 2 years later, me and him are still together and in love. He still is not out to his parents, and I haven’t said anything to force him to come out, but he knows how I feel about it. He himself is from a country that for the most part has acceptance of homosexuality, and does not live at home or is dependent on his parents, but they are his parents nevertheless and he is worried how they will take it. 

I work for a large, international cooperation and often move to other countries for work. So far, it has all been to places where he can go visa free so it hasn’t been an issue. However, once I return to the US for work or to a country with different visa rules, we will most likely need to be married. Us getting married would also allow for him to be placed on my insurance, get free flights, and he could get a job easier. 

However, there is one issue: he is not out. As much as I love him and I want to get married, I refuse to marry him unless his parents know about me. I refuse to be someone’s “ roommate” for the rest of my life. I want to have his parents at our wedding. I want to have in-laws. If they themselves do not want to go or refuse to meet me, then fine, but I want them to make that choice.

In the past, I made this clear, and he agreed and said he would come out eventually. Recently he has said he won’t come out until his grandparents (he has 3 left!) are dead (I don’t care if he comes out to them). 

So, AITA?

EDIT: Since some people don’t understand why i mention citizenship. We met in his home country and when I was sent to another country for work, he moved with me. He has able to do this because he did not need a visa to live in that country. However, when I move to US for work, he would not be able to stay for an extended period of time unless we married. He also will not be able to work in US. Once I have to go back to US, if we are not married, we will have to break up or do long distance, with him coming to stay with me for a few months at a time.",119,1300,0.93

1349,Not the A-hole,"So we have a 6 year old daughter and she loves playing card games. We mostly play uno and war. I love card games and growing up my dad and his side of the family taught me how to play a lot of different games. Our favorite was always gin. So I decided to teach my daughter it by having her watch me and my wife play as I had taught my wife when we first got together.

If you dont know the game its worth looking up. Its so much fun. Its a mind game but you need luck and any little advantage you can get from your opponent gives you the edge. Some of my best memories with my dad were when we played together. He always wooped my ass. Unfortunately he passed away when I was 18. The last time i saw him before he died he wanted to play but the medicine from his cancer treatment messed up his mind so he was able to. He was an awesome dad.

My parents were divorced and i lived mostly with my mom. She wasn't a great mom. I left home when I was 16 because i couldnt stand her life choices.  I tried to have a relationship with her after I was older but long story short on this is i stopped interacting with here about a year ago but my wife still talks to her. 

Now my mom always told me about how she left my dad because of a lack of intimacy. Now I never wanted to hear that honestly but it is what it is. I also know that she has talked to my wife about that. 

So as we're playing I'm having a blast as she's never seen the game and I'm telling her things about it my dad taught me. Showing her what i do and what my dad would've done. So this is where the joke came up that bothered me a lot. In the game there is a thing you do called ""knocking"" and you also call it ""going down"" as you put your cards down when you do it. You can play this part conservative or aggressive. I told my daughter that my dad used to be very aggressive when he went down. My wife chimes in with thats not what your mom tells me.

I get it was a joke. But here i am not only be nostalgic of something I loved doing with my dad but telling our daughter about him and things he used to say since she will never meet him. It hurt honestly. She knows I miss my dad and that I'm sad our daughter will never meet him. I told her why I was mad but she thinks I'm being ridiculous.. Aita?",22,25,0.84
1350,Asshole,"It's 2 am. Half an hour ago I heard heavy footsteps outside my house and, thinking they sounded like running, I looked out the window to see a woman staggering past. She wasn't running so much as her feet were having trouble keeping up with her head.
She turned into my neighbours' yard, and collapsed on the grass.

I ran over to check on her and to make sure nobody was following her. She was fine, early 20s, no injuries from the fall just very very drunk. I tried to talk to her but she was slurring and giving me the Forest Whitticker eye. What I did get from her was that she was staying with my neighbour but wasn't going in yet. I said I though she should go inside and asked for her hand. She refused and lay back down.
So I go back in to mine.

10 minutes pass and she's not moved by herself yet so I think I'll give it another go.
I go back out and she's laying on her back snoring. I talk to her but she's sound asleep. After gently shaking her she rouses enough to tell me to fuck off. I rolled her onto her side so she didn't choke on her inevitable vomit, and left.

Trying to justify my in action, she clearly said she didn't want to be touched. We're lucky enough to live in a very safe, rural area. I've slept in fields, ditches and gardens several times before when I was her age. It's a warm night. My neighbour is pretty strict and I don't think he would react well to his house guest (daughter) being in this state. Nor me waking him up to help move her inside.
I've looked out the window to check she's still there every 5 minutes or so. 

Regardless, I do feel guilt about not carrying her into the house. AITA?

Edit: she walked into the house at about 2:20.

Update: Thanks for the replies.

I stand by not calling the police or ambulance. If anything police would have escalated the problems for her and my neighbour.
And I've dealt with enough drunk people to know the signs of alcohol overdose. As I said, this is Scotland. 

However.
I realise IATA and should have got the neighbour. I let my fear about inconveniencing him, her getting into trouble, and the risk of being accused of assault get in the way of protecting her.

For anyone still concerned about her I've seen her this morning and she's fine other than a stinking hangover.",200,562,0.93

1353,Not the A-hole,"I need judgment. I really want to know if I WBTA if I cut contact with family. I feel guilty about even wanting to ""shun"" my family and I think it will hurt my dad. But this has been going on for years and years and I don't want to try any more. But I think my reaction could be unreasonable. So WIBTA in this situation:

My  brother and step-brother are good friends and had their sons at the  same time. My son is 3 years older than my nephews, my daughter is 5 years older. My nephews spend a lot of time together and never included my son. I understand this dynamic, given the ages and the friendship. I have peace with this.

What hurts me though, is my brother, step-brother, their wives, and their sons get together with my dad and stepmom all the time and almost never include us. Some examples: my stepbrother has a cabin and they all go and have holidays together, we've never once been invited; they do special Christmas outings together and don't invite us; and the most  recent exclusion was my step-sister was visiting from out of town, and they had a party, invited everyone, including their extended families, but didn't invite us.

Two years ago, I tried to talk to my dad about it, asking why we are not included in big group events. My dad didn't really know what to say and then went and shared our conversation with my stepmom, who shared it with her son,  etc, etc. Everyone knew. There was a big conflict. My sister-in-law blocked me on social media. It was a mess. And it was never resolved. Nothing changed either.

Since that conflict, I've had a great deal of anxiety whenever I feel required to attend an event (in fact, since then, my husband refuses to go. His point is even when we are invited, they sit around and talk amongst themselves, ignoring us, so why bother).

WIBTA if I refused to go with my children to the few events we are actually invited to? The next family gathering is mid-August and we've been invited. I'm already full of dread. Or should I just pull up my big girl panties and soldier on? I know it'll hurt my dad if we don't attend.

TLDR; we're excluded from 90% of family gatherings. I know my dad will be hurt if we don't attend. But I am filled with anxiety anytime I am faced with an invitation.

UPDATE: I called my dad last night, just to chat. Missing him. He was on the way to my step-brother's cabin. So we'll try to connect later in the week. I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to say, but all your responses have been so helpful in sorting out my thoughts. And maybe it will help me to let go of feeling like a total loser.

I can't believe how common this is!! How many people are left out of family events. Thank-you for sharing your stories.

Also, people are asking for INFO and wondering what I'm leaving out. Obviously, it's too hard to describe 20 years of family history. But truthfully, there are no big hatreds or conflicts (besides the events from two years ago). I'm an average person, not a saint but generally liked by people. My kids and husband too.

We used to be included in all events, even going on family holidays together. I think things changed when my nephews were born. My stepmom was drawn to her biological grandson, and they included my brother and his family due the close age. To this day, I continue to invite everyone when I have a family gathering, but I may change that. They end up clumped together anyways, talking to each other for the most part.

But I really think they are acting this way out of a combination of thoughtlessness, selfishness, and circumstances. I will probably always wish my dad wasn't allowing it to happen. However, in other respects, he is a great father and grandfather. For instance, always showing up for my kids events.

PSA while people are listening...it is a really shitty feeling being left out by family. So if you can, consider your family dynamics...are there people who are being left out? Are your reasons actually justified (sometimes the reasons are justified of course)? Be kind everyone. You would hate to be the one on the outside like me.",372,2237,0.97
1354,Not the A-hole,"I don't know if they can even get fired; AITA for trying? 

I ordered Ubereats tonight. Right after I had placed the order, I realized the delivery address was set to go to my work, not my house. I called customer service and gave them the correct address. This is before my order was even finished. They called the delivery person to see if she would be willing to bring the order to my house instead of my work. She said no, that she wasn't going to do that, and that she'd deliver the food to my (empty, closed) office instead. 

Ubereats will compensate the driver for the change. For context, my house is 8 minutes away from the restaurant. My work is 7 minutes away from the restaurant. 

I called the restaurant, and they said they couldn't cancel my order, but they wrote the correct address on the bag and asked the driver to bring it to the right place. I finally got the driver to answer the phone. She said that Ubereats had never called her, and that she would bring the food to my house. Cool. 

But then I got a text message that the driver was trying to contact me, I didn't answer the phone, and my order would be cancelled without refund. 

I called Ubereats and was able to get a refund, but I'm honestly so upset that this woman lied and took my food. I understand if she didn't want to bring it to my house--I could go pick it up at work. But she said she would bring it to my house, and then lied and said I didn't answer the phone when I did. And she got a free meal out of it.

1356,Asshole,"My daughter (17) has an unfortunate history of stealing money from her family.  As far as I know she hasn't done this to anyone outside of our home.  It has escalated over the years, despite punishments being handed out (taking away car and phone privileges).  She has taken cash that's been left on the kitchen counters or my desk.  She once swiped her younger sibling's Christmas present, a target gift card, and emptied it.  She took the money that another sibling earned for a school fundraiser and had set aside in a separate envelope.  Essentially we've learned not to leave cash out in the open.  Every time she's accused of taking money, she initially denies it but then eventually owns up, apologizes for her behavior, and pays it back.  We don't really know why she's taking money that doesn't belong to her.  She has a part-time job and all of her school and extracurricular expenses are paid for.  I am 99.9% certain it's not anything drug-related.

Today while going through our main bank account, my wife discovered that she had somehow written three checks ($200, $300, $300) to our daughter over this past month and that she had deposited them to her own checking account.  When she examined the transactions, she found out that our daughter had taken the last three checks from the checkbook, wrote the amounts to herself, and signed my wife's name to them.  I don't know why she thought we wouldn't find out.

Her phone and car are gone, for sure.  Her social life is over.  On top of that, I just don't feel like doing anything to help her with college applications.  She has pretty much burned away any desire or motivation to help her out.  No money for ACT and AP testing and test prep.  Nothing for college application fees.  We had plans to visit some of the schools that she was interested in.  Not gonna happen.  She has been taking voice lessons and acting classes to prepare for auditions (she's planning on majoring in voice performance or theater).  I don't feel like paying for it anymore.  My wife is concerned that she won't earn enough from her part-time job to pay for everything she'll need for a competitive audition portfolio and application fees, and that we would be sabotaging her chances for getting into the college of her dreams.  She feels that it's only my anger talking and that the usual punishments are enough.  I, on the other hand, feel extremely disrespected.  My daughter has not wanted for anything in her life.  For her to steal from us by committing check fraud is the last straw.  At this point I'm not even sure about paying for her college tuition.  Honestly, if she were 18, I'd be asking her to leave.

So, AITA for not supporting our daughter through her last year of high school?  

ETA: So we finally had a discussion.  She spent the money on stupid shit: clothes, going out with friends, personal items.  I checked her bank account and that seems to pan out.  It doesn't seem to be a drug problem because she recently applied for another job that required a drug test and she didn't fail (wife overheard her side of the conversation about coming in for training).  My wife is also going to contact therapists on Monday.  My daughter started crying upon hearing that.  Doesn't seem like she wants to go, maybe she's finally embarrassed about her behavior, I don't know.",883,7493,0.96
1357,Not the A-hole,"The cat in question was jointly adopted by several people who all agreed to pitch in for care costs. I paid for the entirety of the set-up fees out of pocket and continually bought food/litter over the years. But the cat was registered to O's name b/c I knew I wouldn't be able to take it with me after the inevitable move out (family is allergic). O is now under the impression that the cat is solely theirs and dubs it their therapy animal. Fine.

Time passes and inevitably all 5 of us are parting ways and all moving off to different places. O wants to take the cat, but other 4 of us are INCREDIBLY uncomfortable for these reasons:

1. Cat has become bonded to a cat that belonged to the other roomate's, they basially grew up together and were  
very co-dependent. Roommates were more than willing to adopt the cat and also have a stable income. O does not.
2. O has demonstrated a clear pattern of animal neglect. Many instances with this cat (ex. underfeeding when it was a kitten, leaving all care like feeding and litter boxes to us roommates, never respecting the cat's boundaries, etc.) and some leopard geckos too (neglected, dirty cage, admitted they should be re-homed but waited 6+ months to do this).
3. O was moving into a studio apartment that didn't allow pets. Landlord was going to let them bring the cat as long as it didn't destroy anything. It would. Going from 4 doting ""parents"" and a cat ""sibling"" to only one person would not have been pretty.

Eventually we have an intervention. Long story short O leaves without the cat and turns in their keys. We take this as them finally being sensible and agreeing that the cat was better off elsewhere. Their neglectful behavior was never brought up during the conversations.

Over two weeks later, we get a letter from some cut rate lawyer saying we have to return the cat or they'll ""take legal action"". I'm a sobbing mess for days over a cat I'd help raise off. Really puts a damper on my fucking college graduation, the wedding of a close family friend, AND the birth of a close family friend's baby girl.

My dad tells me to write the lawyer back with pet abandonment info. I say we'll take it to Small Claims court for all the money we've spent on the cat during the 30+ days its been out of O's care.

Months later, nothings happened. Cat is safe and sound with people who love and care for it.

SO here we go.. we (husband and I) have been paying my husband's little (step) sister (we will call her Trish) to watch my son a few days a week for several months on an as needed basis. The as needed is important. 

The agreement was that we would pay her 20 quid a day, regardless of how long she is there (2 hours-5 hours max) and regardless of how many days a week.  I message her at the beginning of each week and let her know when I need her, what times, etc. 

My mother in law (not her mother) was recently injured and offered to watch my son while she is off work. I accepted, A. Because it's free, B. Because she does a much better job with my son.  I work from home, and there are times when I have to intervene with Trish because she cant settle him, won't change a nappy, cant make his bottles, etc. We basically pay her to hang out at our house and make sure he doesn't hurt himself. Not saying it isn't helpful, but you get the idea.

So mother in law breaks her ankle, I message Trish to tell her that I wouldn't need her for the next few weeks because my mother in law has injured herself and cant work. Her response was ok that's fine. An hour later my husband's dad calls and reems him out saying that we are being unfair to Trish, that she feels used and like we just threw her to the curb AND THE KICKER.... that she was really depending on that money to go to a festival.  And that he (husband's dad) and his wife (Trish's mom) are very upset with us.

Other small details: she is on holiday right now has been posting bags from Gucci, Holister, etc. We went shopping the other week and she spent 200 on clothes. My mom was staying with us visiting for two weeks and it wasn't a problem when I didn't need her to watch him then.

1359,Asshole,"I work as a manager at a store that is very popular for high schoolers to be hired at because it starts at minimum wage and has flexible hours. Think of your Subway type of store.

Currently at work, we have two teenagers who are good workers. They do everything we ask, are kind to customers, and in general are very competent.

Well, the other manager staff and I had a meeting last week to talk about how shifts will be decreasing once August begins due to winter approaching, which means generally less customers. Since everybody would be working less, I took initiative and decided to let go of the two teenagers who are on the workforce, since they would be busy with school soon and it would be unfair to continue to give them shifts when there are people who need this job to pay bills.

My boss was not happy with this decision of mine. I told the two teens in a respectful way what the situation was and that it was no means because of their work ethic, but simply because there wouldn't be enough shifts to go around.

One of the teenagers came in to work the next day to ask how to pick up his last paycheck, and my boss was working then. I got a call saying I was fired for attempting to fire them and the two teens have been rehired.

1361,Asshole,"My girlfriend of nearly ten years is graduating from university. She has done very well and may have even come top of her class.

Over the course of an evening it came up that her parents are buying her a graduation present for all of her hard work. Although I don’t know exactly what she will be getting, from my understanding it will either be a set of fancy jewellery or a set of expensive heels.

To put it bluntly I find this sort of gift giving bizarre. I have always been raised in a family where the reward for working hard towards something was whatever result you ended up getting. At a push we may go out for a nice meal. 

Over the course of this evening conversation it became apparent that my girlfriend was also expecting a gift from me, albeit a less expensive one, in the £30-40 range.

I am very against this idea. Partially this is down to my aforementioned difference in expectations surrounding results but also the fact I am broke. I am also a university student who will not be graduating for a couple of years yet and I have next to no disposable income. I am heavily reliant on my parents for support with my living expenses which I dislike as is let alone with them effectively having to buy gifts for my girlfriend via proxy.

I broached this with my girlfriend who became very upset stating how she had already bought my present for my graduation. She had stated that she “will understand” if I don’t get her one though she will be really disappointed. We have let the discussion die down for now to discuss again later, though she keeps sending me links to things she would like.

1365,Not the A-hole,"My friend Taylor (F26) and I (F28) got a 2bed, 2bath place together around 2 years ago. At first we got along great. About a year ago, she moved in her boyfriend Jake (M24). Jake was a semester away from a degree.

I agreed to allow him to move in without paying rent until he was able to get a job. To make up a little bit for this, I asked Taylor to pay 2/3 of the utilities. We split the rent 50/50 while Jake looked for work. 

8 months go by and her brother Mark (M30) was looking to move to our city. I agreed to allow Mark to stay with us while he looked for work. He paid \~$200 to me to pitch in. However, this changed once the landlord learned someone was in our apt that was not on the lease. He now pays $200 to the landlord and none to us to help with rent.

 We came to the agreement that once Mark got a job, he'd look for his own place, or so I thought.

 2 months passed. Mark got a job, but was still in our living room.  Jake still did not have a job after 9 months. I had a chat with Taylor to see what the plan was moving forward, and to ask why Mark hadn't been looking for a place. She was under the impression we were all moving into a house together. I told her that there must have been a miscommunication, as this was not relayed to me. I was open to it, but only if Jake got a job and everyone had to split the rent fairly. I told her this had to be done in 2 months, or I'd be moving elsewhere.

The boys are messy and take up a lot of space. I feel suffocated. I share my bathroom with Mark, and he often forgets to flush. Taylor insists that Jake is working hard to find a job, but just hasn't gotten results. He also has made no progress toward his degree. 

Earlier this week, I started planning with another friend to move into a new place. I immediately informed Taylor that I would be moving out in September. We had a long chat that got contentious - I reminded her of our conversation about Jake needing to pitch in. She claimed since they shared a room, him paying $0 was fine. We ended up agreeing me moving out was for the best. 

However, the next day Taylor texted me, upset. She said she was too high to understand the details. We'd have to give our 30 days notice to our landlord in 1 week and she didn't feel comfortable doing that.

1366,Not the A-hole,"So I am eloping and getting married on a monday. Only 3 people are attending one of which is officiating my wedding. 

My sister just sobbed on the phone and hung up on me because she wont be able to come. My date has been set for the last month. Everyone at this point has 3 months to figure it out if they want to come. I am not specifically inviting anyone because it is a destination wedding and an inconvenient date. I dont want anyone to feel pressured or burdened about it, however I have made it known to my friends and immediate family they are welcome but no big deal.

I feel all this pressure now to change my date. We chose this day because we have enough time to save, and the day itself is our anniversary. 

My sister thinks I should move the date up an entire month. We wont have all the money ( spending money ) saved that soon. This is a very small thing. Like were talking $1500 for the whole shebang including spending money.

This is one day that is suppose to be about me and my future husband. Of course I would love to have my family there, but ultimately it is about us. We are the ones paying for everything. Its not like I was invited to her wedding.

1367,Asshole,"Pretty self explanatory.. I’m on the second night of a trip with my husband and I moved the coffee tray and BOOM. All of a sudden, there were multiple $100 bills spread over the counter. 

I must say, at this point.. I start laughing like a complete lunatic and look at my husband. 

Me: “what the fuck? How the? Why the fuck did you put $900 under coffee tray?” Insane laughter continues.

Him: “I didn’t.”

We debate about what to do with the money. I said turn it into the front desk. But, husband makes a fair point that no one leaves $900 at the hotel and doesn’t call the hotel or come back and get it. Also, no way the hotel could prove whose money this is.. no one knows how long it’s been there, the front desk might just keep it, etc. 

I suggested giving it to charity. 


So, WIBTA if I keep $900 (even if i give it to a charity) knowing that it obviously belongs to someone else?


Edit: thank you for your responses! After much discussion, we have decided to notify the front desk that we found money in our room and that we are taking it to the local police department.

1368,No A-holes here,"I just started a new form of birth control a week ago, my emotions have been ALL over the place and I don’t know if I’m rightfully upset over this or not. 

I was on the phone with my boyfriend last night and I was so excited about the new season of orange is the new black. I went to load my Netflix and remembered that I don’t have T-Mobile anymore and therefore don’t have Netflix anymore. I’m on the phone, and I’m like “crap I totally forgot about T-mobile providing my Netflix”. 

This was after talking about the show for a bit. Now keep in mind, I didn’t ask my boyfriend for a thing. I was just thinking out loud. 

He goes “oh I would totally let you use my account but there’s already a lot of people on there”.

I don’t know WHY, but that really hurt my feelings. Like who else is on there? Why are they more important than me? Why even say that? What did it add to the conversation? I got a little petty and said not to use my Hulu anymore because one person is already on the account, it’s me and that’s just too many people. Then I felt really bad for saying that and apologized. I let it go and chalked it up to me being unreasonable.

I was then talking to my best friend this morning and I was like “dude I’m so emotional lately” and explained what happened and how I got so worked up over nothing. She said he was an asshole for saying that in the first place and not automatically giving me a password, and then she, without me asking, gave me her password and told me to use her account. Now I’m thinking over it again and don’t know should I be upset? Do you let your SO use accounts like Netflix? AITA?

1369,Not the A-hole," I have an at home daycare. Now, I do have a dog, but I keep him completely separated from the kids and the areas I use for my daycare, the dog has never been in and he will never be in. The kids don’t play with him or any of that. He’s not dangerous or anything, he’s well trained, has never bitten anyone in his life, it’s just a liability thing. Also, I’ve found that parents are more relieved this way, even dog owners themselves. I have one child in my care, that is also allergic to several things, including dogs. So even if we were to previously allow it, I would stop for his benefit.

Anyway, one of my new kids is occasionally picked up by his grandfather. The other day, I answer the door to let him in and in runs a tiny, furry dog. The little boy that’s allergic (he’s very aware of his allergies and will tell you flat out “I can’t have xyz”) jumped back and screamed. I told the grandpa “You cannot bring this dog in here.” The grandpa gave me a weird look and put the dog on my porch, shutting the door. I explained that the child has allergies and the grandpa said, “Not to my dog, it’s hypoallergenic.” Okay, yeah, maybe but not taking a risk. Then he says “That’s my service dog.” I’ve never seen this guy with a dog before. I asked him to please not bring the dog.

Some time later, he comes to pick up again, dog is with him and runs inside. Allergic Kid freaks out. This time his mom is there picking up and gets pissed. The grandpa says “Yeah, well she has a dog.” The mom says “Yeah, but her dog is never around the kids.” He once again repeats it’s a service dog. I said that he can’t pick and choose (sometimes he comes without dog), he said he has the paperwork and I said I don’t care, it’s my private property, please do not bring this dog back.

This guy’s daughter (mother of the child I watch) called me all upset, saying her father is threatening to not pick up her kid and she doesn’t know what to do. Can’t I just let the dog thing go? I told her no and said the grandpa is welcomed back, but his dog is not. She said I was making things difficult.

At that point I got really pissed, waited for the conductor and informed him about the situation. He asked the lady to leave and I was able to sit. However, everybody was staring me into the ground.

1372,No A-holes here,"Last weekend I was out at a local bar in town that has live music. There’s a “stage area” in the center of the space where the performers sit, but no raised stage or anything. It’s a small bar with a max of 50 or so seats that all face the stage. There’s always a cover during live music (usually $5). There’s also always a large metal bucket on the floor in front of the performers for tips.

Usually I’ll tip the band/performer around $10 on top of that, because I know they likely do not see 100% of the cover proceeds. This time, I only had $20s in my wallet. I still wanted to tip the performers but didn’t want to give $20 (I’m not rich by any means), so I walked up to the bucket, dropped my $20 in and took out a $10. I made sure to do it in between sets and when one of the band members could see so they’d didn’t think I was stealing money out of the tip jar. I made eye contact with the drummer and told him I was grabbing change and he nodded, smiled, and said thank you for the tip.

The problem came later when I took my seat back at the bar and I had a few people shoot me dirty looks. One man also came up and asked me if I took money out of the bucket. I explained what I did and he still sighed and called me cheap. I started to wonder if everyone there either thought I was stealing or that I was being a cheap asshole and should’ve just threw my $20 in there. Am I the asshole here?

My GF at the time and I decided to live together, she moved in with me. She was still good friends with one of her exes. I was fine with this but expressed that I wasn't interested in befriending him or being around him. Before she moved in, one of my rules was that her ex was not allowed in our home. This rule applies to me as well, but I am not friends with any of my exes because I don't see the point. 

This rule didn't sit well with her because she felt like she had the right to have any guest over as it was also her home. My response to that was that under no circumstances should I feel uncomfortable in our home. If a person's presence makes me feel this way, then they are unwelcome. Her ex's lack of presence in our home doesn't make her uncomfortable, therefore my preference overrules hers.

My friend Liz (20F) is living in New Mexico for the summer. While there, her ID expired. She used to smoke cigarettes but has moved on to juul. I (22M) absolutely despise cigarettes, and tolerate juul/other vapes at best. She knows this about me. 

Here is a verbatim conversation we had, formatted a little better to read here. Most sentences are split to unique texts.

Liz: NM fucking sucks. They have this fucking law that I can't use my old ID for anything and I understand it. But I can't get juul pods. I mean, I understand it. But like I'm just not supposed to do anything? wtf. IT SUCKS

Me: That's all states. Can't use expired ID. Can't say I have any sympathy about being denied nicotine *shrug emoji*

Liz: Shut up.

I don't respond.

Liz: Okay. You know we all have vices. Sometimes we drink too much, or eat too much. I'm not proud of the juul but I'm not smoking cigs anymore. I don't need you to tell me it's bad because I know already. That was a dick move and doesn't sit right with me.

Me: Those other vices also don't hurt surrounding people or the planet. IDK what you expected from me. I'm pretty vocal about my hatred of that stuff.

Liz: I don't need to hear it from you. I know you don't support my choices but that doesn't make it okay. I don't need a lecture. I need to quit on my own time and I'm not ready to.

I don't respond.

Next day she wants to talk about it, I'm not really too interested in talking about it and fine to disagree. We talk anyway, basically her argument is that I hurt her feelings. I think she just feels bad about her own poor choices and wants me to coddle her while she makes them, which I won't.

I noticed a guy that was hitting on a really (visibly) drunk girl so I just kept my eye on them. I didn't personally know either of these people. At some point, he started to walk her upstairs (presumably to hook up) and I wasn't totally convinced she was cool with it so I ran over and asked the girl ""hey are you cool with this?"" as they were heading up the steps. She wasn't happy with the question and responded pretty loudly something to the effect of ""dude, don't be that guy, i can make my own decisions.""  At that point, I figured that there was consent all around and I stopped being involved. I thought I was doing the right thing by making sure the girl wasn't too drunk to make a smart decision. Getting yelled at kind of harshed my vibe for the night. My friend says i'm TA for sticking my nose into other people's private business and I should've kept to myself.

1377,Not the A-hole,"Tonight I went out to eat with a friend. We were seated in a booth on a raised platform. In the booth behind us were 2 women with a toddler around 2. The platform made it so we were looking down at this family with a clear view of the table, no real privacy. The child was in a high chair at the edge of the table sort of in the walk way but not really obstructing it.

We'd been seated for about two minutes when baby started to cry very loudly. The Mother was on her phone and Grandmother (I assume) kept eating. No one made effort to console the baby. I was at the side of the table facing them. 

After 5 minutes the Mother got up and went outside for a smoke. Baby was still crying. Grandmother handed the baby a fork to play with and kept saying no, no, sh, etc. She eventually moved to the corner of the booth and left baby to cry and now slam the fork on the table. Mother returned and took out her phone again. Every so often she'd pat the baby's head or hand but it was clear that the baby wasn't going to stop crying soon. 

It was loud enough that I couldn't concentrate on my conversation and I started to worry that the baby needed something, so I leaned over and said ""Excuse me, sorry to bother you but I think your baby might need something."" 

Grandmother ignored me. Mother told me that she preferred to let him cry it out. 

I said I understood but he'd been upset for about 15 minutes at that point. Mother told me to mind my own business. So, I did. 

I asked the waitress if we could move tables but the restaurant was too busy, so  we ended up leaving. Friend told me I was kind of an asshole for getting involved in someone elses parenting. I know that it can be good to let a baby cry it out so they don't just cry for attention, but in a public space surely it's more assholey to let your baby scream for 15+ minutes.

My hub has one of those habits where he puts his lips together really tight but instead of whistling he squeaks, like a mouse or a door that is in serious need of oiling.  He goes through phases where he does it a lot....like several times an hour.  Sometimes he'll squeak at me to get my attention.  Sometimes he'll squeak at me to wake me up.  Sometimes he'll squeak for no apparent reason, what-so-ever.  

Many years ago I asked him to stop squeaking to awake me.  He still does this about once a month to wake me.  I get mad at him.  He laughs.

A few weeks ago I let him know that after 25 years of being squeaked at, I can't take it anymore and can he please stop.  He hasn't stopped.

Note on hub: he is the biggest contrarian I have ever met (and I'm full-on Irish) and it's his history to NOT stop when someone asks him to do so.  He thinks he's funny and cute if he continues.  He's like this with friends and family.

I am actually very patient but I really can't take anymore.  (Remember the movie Chicago?)  And I'm becoming more adamant and aggressive about my requests and now I'm starting to feel like, well, an a-hole, but if he were to ask me to stop a habit for him, I would.

Now I was annoyed so I mumble (loud enough for him to hear me), ""Thanks for holding the door"". He turns around and says ""I don't even know you. Why would I hold the door for you?"" To which I responded by rolling my eyes and telling him he was a weirdo. 

When we got inside to HQ, he proceeded to walk over to the security desk demanding he speak with HR so he can report me for verbal abuse. Now I was already struggling bc the day before I learned my SO's cancer had possibly moved into his brain - I probably didn't use the best judgement when reacting to co-workers request to go to HR. I responded by repeating what he said in a mocking tone. Of course this made him angrier and if he was only debating going to HR before, he was now hell bent on reporting me. 

I lost it.  I started to cry. And I was really upset, not phony crying. When the HR rep came down I told her about my SO's diagnosis and that I was really struggling.

So I wanted us to both walks to the concert during the daylight. She told me that she was walking but that she would meet me there because she was already out and she needed to drop off something with her cousin who works close to the venue. I was a little annoyed because I wanted to walk into the concert together and showing up alone 5 mins before her was embarrassing to me. She was kind of annoying the whole night saying that she didn't want to get too drunk etc., when the whole point was to go out and have fun.

 The concert ended around 12:30 am and then we ran into her friends who wanted to go to a diner down the street for sober up food. I was completely sober at this point and not having any fun. She and her friends have boyfriends and husbands who are all friends and were currently on an out of trip state to vegas. They were making tons of stupid jokes saying that their boyfriends are probably all in bed right now because they act like old men and we are still out and blah blah blah.

1383,No A-holes here,"My ex husband (32m) and I (33f) were together 13 years, married for 7.5. We had two beautiful daughters who are now 6 and almost 4. In early 2018 I was fighting to save the marriage and he was being standoffish, cold, borderline emotionally abusive and refusing to communicate or work with me. One day in early March I decided I had had enough, I asked him to leave and he was happy to go. We have always been on the same page as far as coparenting amicably, not using the children as weapons, fair visitation, etc. He's a great father, but a terrible partner.

May 2018-- I find out he's dating someone-- seems a little fast to me but not a big deal. She's someone he knew from work, he promised nothing was happening when we were still married and I believed him. 

June 2018-- he informs me she's pregnant! Doing some rough math by the due date, they conceived 6 weeks after he moved out. Again, not great decision making on his part, it's a lot for the kids to process when they don't even fully understand why their parents dont live together anymore. 

July 2018-- the bomb drops. I find out that not only was he sleeping with this girl 6 months before he and I even split up, he had previously gotten her pregnant and taken her for an abortion a few months before I asked him to move out. This was tough to deal with. I don't think a person ever really recovers from that devastating blow to their self esteem. 

I have always encouraged my kids to have a relationship with this woman, her existing children, and the new baby. However, I dont care to have a relationship with her at this point. I might get there but I'm just not there yet. I have been struggling with my mental health lately and I'm trying my best to just deal with the day to day sometimes. I have primary physical custody of the kids, I have 2 jobs, 3 dogs and I take care of our previously shared house on my own. I have a lot on my plate. 

Ex husband moved in with his parents after the split-- almost 15 months on he's still living there. His parents have a pool. 6 year old wants a pool party/slumber party for her birthday this week. We planned the party so that the kids can go swimming at his (parents) place, then walk the 2 blocks to my house and have the slumber party at my place. I planned it this way in the interest of peaceful coparenting, so that my 6yo knows that even though her parents are split, we will always be family. 

Ex informs me this week that he wants mistress to be at the party. I said no, I'm not mentally ready for that yet. To be clear-- I don't have a problem with him having a girlfriend (I've been dating someone for 10 months) -- I just haven't developed the strategies to deal with my anger that I feel toward this particular woman. He told me that she's ""family now"" and I ""need to learn how to deal with it"". He also stated it's his call because it's ""his"" house. 

AITA for putting my foot down and saying I'm just not ready for this yet? I don't want my kids to see me upset on what's supposed to be a happy day.

So I (20M) come from a really traditional Korean family just for heads up, it is an important fact to keep in mind for this stupid scenario, I will explain later why.

So my little cousin (19F) had her birthday yesterday, we all went over and we celebrated. Respect is a really important aspect of our family, and even if it is your birthday, it is extremely important to not act all entitled within our family. My uncle and aunt (the parents of entitled birthday girl) are probably the least traditional out of all of us, but out of respect for the elders, I heard them talking to their daughter about respect and good behaviour.

We all sat down to give her gifts, me and my little cousin have actually a very good relationship, we joke around a lot and she is basically my little sister who I have known my whole life.

During the gift exchange, she got a lot of iffy presents, just petty cash and the occasional education gift card to indigo or something, to the older generations of the family, she was expected to bow and thank them in Korean. I could see in here attitude she was really unhappy about doing it.

When she got to my gift I actually gave her this small little gag I thought would be funny, it was a CD Kid's bop 2019 *'just for girls*' playlist, however I put a gift card of $100 hidden inside the CD case to a very high end outlet store for nice brands like gucci, valentino, off-white, etc. When she opened it she couldn't contain herself and she actually threw my gift across the room and told me I was a fucking asshole because she expected that I was ""the one person I actually thought would get me something I wanted"". I paused and I told her to look inside and she told me to fuck off. I paused again and asked her if she was sure she didn't want to check, she said ""oh, fuck off"". I grabbed the CD and pulled out the gift card and pocketed it. She saw and she ran off crying.

My family says I need to give her the gift to cheer her up but I said no, the whole family is upset at me right now.

AITA?

Which I was obviously still hesitant of, because what sound-minded mid-twenties adult wants to be friends with a highschooler? Now, 5 years later, they are interested in eachother romantically.

AITA for being unsupportive? I think this behavior is borderline grooming. He was an adult who majorly influenced her teenage years. It seems irresponsible for him to pursue her romantically given the dynamic of power that they have had.

Am I being too sensitive about this? Or is he crossing boundaries?

EDIT: To be clear, it's not the age difference that bothers me. I have no issues with age gaps between legal consenting adults. It bothers me that this man played a large role in her formative years. He is somewhat of a big brother/father figure to her. It just rubs me the wrong way, knowing how much of an impact he had on her during a very vulnerable time.",97,276,0.95
1389,Not the A-hole,"So I just got a new job at a fast food franchise and several coworkers of mine are mentally slow, for lack of a better term. There's one such man, I'll call him Bob, that works with us. He is an older man (About 55) and he is very, very slow. Really the only thing he can do is dishes, which we always have plenty to do. I work the closing shift with him. He is unable to drive himself home, so many coworkers often give him rides. The other night, his sister (who also works here and is only a tad bit smarter than Bob) showed up abut 4 hours before closing and asked if I could give Bob a ride home so she wouldn't have to come out here at whatever time we finished closing. (I'll call her Sally.) I was very polite when I told Sally no. She immediately berated me, saying that I work every shift with him so I should give him a ride home. I told her that the only older men I've had in my car are my dad, my grandpa, and my uncles and that I don't feel comfortable giving an older man a ride home, especially as a 17 year old female. Sally pointed out that I always give my best friend a ride home, to which I responded that my friend (we'll call her Nicky) is 19, female, and lives with me. Nicky also jumped in and said that she didn't feel comfortable letting an older man into the car. Sally accused us of just picking on Bob, not liking him because of his mental delay. I finished the conversation with saying that even if I did feel comfortable taking and older man home, my dad would have a fit about it, but I'd still be happy to help him call a cab. The truth is is that Nicky and I have driven guys home before, but Bob really does throw us off because of his mental delay. He has always been harmless at work, but still makes us really uneasy. He will often blankly stare at you, nibble and bite on his tongue, and breathes very heavy through his mouth. He also has a very odd body shape, and this might be the reason that he walks with a very odd gait, or this could be related to his mental handicap. He also will get random erections and seem to not notice them. Nicky and I are not from America, and our first language is not English. Bob has a speech impediment/slur related to his mental handicap, and neither Nicky nor I have the English skills yet to understand someone with a severe slur/impediment. So we feel uncomfortable also that we can't understand what he's saying. Again, he's always been harmless at work but he makes us too uncomfortable for us to drive him home. Other coworkers have called us a-holes for saying that we won't drive him home and several managers expressed their annoyance with us not wanting to drive him home, since it is usually only Nicky, Bob, and myself working closing and then the manager has to deal with getting Bob a ride. Since everyone at work thinks were a-holes, I'd like more opinions to see what others think.",43,81,0.91
1390,Not the A-hole,"I'm struggling with this as I don't feel like the asshole here, but I am feeling a bit guilty and would like some perspective.

Relevant background info: I live in Southern California, and we just had a very rainy winter.

My neighbor directly behind my house, who I've never met, recently knocked on my door.

She immediately opened the conversation very aggressively, and stated the following:

1. Her grandmother just got malaria from mosquitoes.
2. Said malaria mosquitoes were coming from the trees/bushes that line my back fence because ""they are too tall""
3. That I need to remove the trees.
4. That she knows it will impact privacy (read, we will both be able to stare directly into each other's living rooms as the only thing separating our properties is a five foot high wall), but that I still need to remove them because they are a ""health concern""

I was so shocked by this information, and the sudden appearance of her at my door, the only thing I could really get out was, ""I'm not sure that's how mosquitoes work?"". The conversation ended with her insisting it was a health concern and that I need to cut them down.

Now, after processing the initial shock, here's where I'm at:

\-Yes I know mosquitoes don't work like that. We've had a lot of rain, and the city sent out a pamphlet a few months ago about clearing any standing water in on our properties because mosquitoes lay eggs there. Not trees.

\-Malaria in CA isn't a thing. I've checked with the local vector control unit.

Now, knowing all of that reasonable information, and that for whatever reason this neighbor is lying and decided that BS story was a better way to getting me to cut down my trees instead of the truth, I have decided to just ignore her and go on with my life.

I'm struggling a bit as I really don't want this to escalate, we still have to live next to each other. I'm not confident enough to go over there and address it as I'll not be able to stay calm because this is some insane people level situation I'm dealing with, and I don't want it to escalate that way either.

Thus, AITA for just ignoring her?

Edit/Update:

1. Thank you for the point over to r/legaladvice , I will definitely consult them if it comes to that.
2. I do have security cameras already up that point in that general direction anyway, I've been keeping an eye out. 
3. The trees are more like high bushes, that grow up rather than out (I believe they are called Eugenias). That being said, if she'd like to trim whatever small part hangs on her side is fine by me. 
4. The petty bitch in me really wanted to leave some information packets along with some citronella candles on her doorstep, just for a passive aggressive touch. Not going to. 
5. I went away for the weekend and came back and everything is fine so far. I will definitely update further if anything else happens. Thanks, reddit!",53,163,0.94

1392,Not the A-hole,"Ok so to preface this I'm a girl (16) still living at home with my parents and am a closeted bisexual because they are very religious/homophobic. 
 So anyway I've been seeing this girl for a little over 2 months and since I know they would absolutely never allow me to be in a same sex  relationship, so I introduced her as my friend and frequently  have her over to spend the night on the pretence that our relationship is completely platonic. I assure you there is nothing platonic about these sleep overs. 
  My parents are good people and I wouldn't want to hurt them by them finding out I've been lying to their faces and breaking there two biggest rules( no sex, no gay shit) in their own home. 
  I have a friend who is very insistent that this is very messed up and that I'm completely betraying my parents trust, but as it stands I have no intention of stopping. 

AITA?

Edit: ok to everybody saying that I'm the asshole because I would be if this were a straight relationship, I think is missing the point a little because if this were a straight relationship I wouldn't have to sneak around in the first place.

Edit 2: ok number one criticism seems to be having sex in their house is disrespectful and would be disrespectful regardless of their thoughts on gay people. The thing is that I would way rather be able to be in a public normal relationship and not have her be able to sleep in my bed vs having these secret little slumber parties  but that's not an option and it's their fault that I have to be in this  situation. I get it, I don't HAVE to have sex but if your 16 and your gf is right next to you in bed that's what's gonna happen fam. 
Other criticism is that I'm putting her in danger. 
I don't get this, she's not a child(I mean I guess we both are but were the same age) she knows my situation and we cant spend the night at her house. (Her parents don't allow sleepovers of any kind)",205,463,0.87
1393,Everyone Sucks,"Pretty straight forward; 
My sister has been cheating on her husband for about 3 months (or at least that’s what she told me when I found out). They’ve been married about 18 months. 

So I found out when the idiot accidentally sent me a paragraph of pretty strongly incriminating flirting and instructions to meet up while in the bathroom at my house while her husband in the living room watching movies with me and my husband. It was very evidentially not intended for her husband, and even talked about when he would be at work - so on. 

I confronted her later that night and she flipped out. She first started saying he was abusing her and that she was doing it out of revenge (I found that hard to believe) but when I pushed on it she tried to play off that when she said abuse she just meant he wasn’t fulfilling her needs. 

I told her to grow the F up and talk to her husband instead of betraying him. She said she would. I promised I wouldn’t say anything. 
2 months down the line and she still hasn’t. 

We play a weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons, which I run for my husband, her and her husband, and a mutual friend of ours. 

Conveniently her and her husband’s characters are married in game. 
Eventually I boiled over and created a situation in the story which heavily implies her character was cheating on his, and I used real world locations and people (thinly disguised) to push the point. Finally it clicked in his head, and he thought it was a joke at first, but I kept a straight face and stared at him. He caught on and she started crying and stormed out. He went after her. 

This was two days ago and I’ve not heard from either. 

I feel like.. I betrayed her trust, while telling her not to do that to him. But at the same time.. I feel like she doesn’t deserve my respect given the situation. 

TL;DR - my sister is cheating on her husband, I promised not to say as long as she did. She didn’t tell him so I used D&D to tell him. I feel I betrayed her. But also don’t know if I should care.",293,1457,0.96
1394,Not the A-hole,"My husband got a DUI a few weeks back and had his license suspended. I’m not thrilled about it but he’s quit drinking and seems to be trying to do better. However he now needs rides to and from work (hour round trip) and has been an absolute bear about it. I get that it’s embarrassing to not be able to drive himself in but he’s picked a fight with me most mornings he’s needed a ride. This morning I’d had enough. I didn't want my entire day ruined by a pointless argument in the car. So I asked him to apologize for his attitude and to find a way to be kind to me this morning, and said I’m not driving him in before he can. He thinks I’m being absolutely absurd, I think it’s absurd to expect me to continue waking our kids up early, piling in the car and chauffeuring him to and from work when he can’t be decent to me in the mornings. Not that it’s super relevant but tomorrow is my birthday and I’m pretty sure he’s going to roll today’s argument right into making my birthday miserable.",68,192,0.94
1395,Not the A-hole,"So I'm a very tall guy. I'm 6'8"". I know most people see height as a purely positive thing, which is true up to a point, but I'm a few inches past that point. When you live in a world that was designed for people who are quite a bit smaller than you, problems such as this one tend to arise.

When I began going to concerts as a teenager, I quickly realized I tend to piss people off at shows. Almost without fail, part way into the show I was watching, I would get a tap on the shoulder from someone behind me asking me if they could go in front of me because they can't see around me. These requests would be given to me with varying degrees of politeness, ranging from ""please and thank you"" requests, to expletive filled demands. 

In the beginning, I felt really bad for those people. After all, everyone is just trying to enjoy the show, and I can see perfectly fine behind them, so I let them go in front of me. Unfortunately, this would lead to a cascade effect where, every time I let someone go in front of me, the next person behind me would also ask to go in front and so on. Several times I would start the concert near the stage, and end the show at the back, unable to see the stage at all. 

Eventually, I decided that I couldn't accomodate these people any longer. My routine now, if I want a good spot, is that I get to the concert as early as I can. I get the closest spot I can, and I stay there. If anyone is behind me it's because I was there first. In my opinion I have the right to stand where I'm standing. When people ask me to move, I politely explain that I can't accomodate everyone or I'll end up at the back, and that I had this spot before they showed up.

I want to make it very clear that I never push up. Sometimes I'll be at a show with my girlfriend and friends and they'll want to wind their way up to the front. I refuse to push through the crowd because I know wherever I stop I'll be blocking someone's view. They were there before me so I don't think that's cool. I just let my friends move toward the front without me.

I would also like to make it clear that I have no problem moving for someone with a disability. 

Usually people are fine with my polite refusal and explanation and they'll squeeze to the side or just deal, but even after that sometimes people are just plain nasty. I've had beers thrown on me, and people scream at me. I even had one guy try and fight me at a Toadies concert. He had to be kicked out of the show. 

Honestly even some of my shorter friends think I'm being unreasonable when I don't let eveyone ahead of me. I understand their struggle with tall people at concerts. I'm sure it's frustrating, but I just don't think I should have to stand at the very back of every single concert I attend my whole life just because I'm tall, and honestly I'm kind of sick of all the huffing and puffing from people behind me. 

So AITA for getting my spot and sticking with it because I was there first?",39,68,0.88
1396,Asshole,"So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. 

When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her. It’s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",6385,28048,0.8

So I studied CS, and then got a job in tech, left it because my assigned mentor harassed me, got another job, left due to a toxic work environment, and then went for my MBA and got into product management. I'm so much happier now. 

I recently saw that the mayor of my city tweeted about getting women into STEM careers. It came off as rather oversimplifying, he was saying that parents just have to introduce their girls young to math and science. 

In my experience, that's not been the biggest obstacle to women's success in STEM careers, by a long shot. That would be the shitty toxic culture in school and a lot of workplaces. Something me and a lot of my friends have seen firsthand.

So on an impulsive moment I got out my phone and took screenshots of some of the most disgusting stuff my past classmates and coworkers had texted or emailed me. 

- Hitting on me without leaving me alone when I asked them to. Including married dudes who persisted after I reminded them of their wifes.

- A random dick pic, that I censored before posting.

- Getting called a b*tch for having hit a classmate who had grabbed my ass.

- My old mentor whining at me over text for rejecting his ""friendship"" to which I said that I just wanted to be left alone after work, and be able to work with him productively at work without him asking me nosy invasive questions about my life.  And telling him that even if he was trying to be my friend, friends don't ignore friends boundaries about talking about sex.

I replied on Twitter, saying ""The real reason STEM has a problem attracting and retaining women; the toxic culture. All texts from professional colleagues! And classmates!"" And I attached all the images without censoring names.

The tweet went pretty viral in my city; it was shared by a local news page's Twitter and it got a bit of attention outside my area too.

Some good, some bad. I got some accusations of making things up for attention or taking things out of context. 

But the worst thing was that my mom (my wonderful mom!!) Got dragged into it, when two of my coworkers from an old job wanted me to take the tweet down, couldn't get in touch with me because I'd blocked them, and found my mom's work phone number online. And so I had to explain the whole thing to my mom, who was equally shocked by people sending me those things in the first place, and by me sharing them on the internet.

I haven't  taken the tweet down yet, and I don't know if I should.

1398,Not the A-hole,"I’ll try to keep this brief. I am an operations manager for a busy distribution center. We recently had new offices built and the construction plans called for one restroom for the production/warehouse employees and one for the office staff. The restrooms are in different parts of the building. A few of the women on my production staff have gotten pissed off over the new accommodations and are demanding to use the office restroom because they “don’t want to share with the men” my response has been absolutely not.

My reasoning is this. First, I don’t want nasty boots tromping all over the brand new carpet of the offices. Sometimes we have clients in there. Second, we are partially a production facility and the extended walk to the other bathroom negatively impacts productivity. Third, the bathroom only allows the use of one person at a time and the door locks. There should be no privacy issue unless someone doesn’t lock the door.

1399,Asshole,"I am not a very good writer so this is pretty hard for me and I'm having trouble getting started. I guess it's to say that I work for a pretty typical ""cube farm"" type business. My cubicle is on the corner closest to the elevator so it's my ""thing"" to have a huge candy bowl that I keep stocked with a big variety of candy. People are a huge fan of it for obvious reasons. 

Our school district starts school next week and every year there is a week where there are no camps and child care can be an issue so our regional supervisor allows co workers to bring kids in that week, sets up movies and xboxs in the conference room, trips to the park and mall, etc... of course the kids flock to my desk because of the candy and I love being the ""candy lady."" 

I guess this is a second part but there is a coworker who I don't really like for a myriad of reasons but her daughter is my absolute favorite of all the kids who have been her this week. Her mom is an advocate of every crazy diet you can put a name on so it broke my heart when the mom said that her daughter is on all the same diets. I am in eating disorder recovery so this is literally heart breaking because when I hear fad diets like fasting and protein I just see my past in this little girls future. Her mom said she could have one piece of candy a day from my bowl but I could tell she was starving so every time I saw this girl I would ""sneak"" her a piece of candy. It just gave me real joy to see her face light up. It wasn't a problem this week but today I went to McDonalds and ""just so happened"" to get an extra coke and fries and when I got back I went in and set up a little picnic and asked the girl if she'd like to join me. I gave her the fries and coke and she said she's never allowed to drink soda and can only have fries when they go to her grandmas house and she said she was loving this. I asked her if she was hungry a lot and she said she was always hungry. It just broke my heart, like literally broke my heart. 

The person who works across from me saw me feeding the girl the fries and coke she said that I majorly screwed up and that if the girls mom found out she was going to flip her lid. I made a joke about her blood sugar being low and my coworkers said this really wasn't something to laugh about and while he wasn't going to say anything, if the mom finds out she's going to go ballistic and want me fired.

So it's been over a month since I first posted and I thought that I'd post a last update for you guys as part of closing this chapter of my life. 

Short story: My fiance and I have broken up. During pre marriage counseling he realized that he still loves his ex. She also broke off her own engagement for him. They are now back together.

I took to heart three things from the replies in my original thread. Those who said I was YTA told me not to look at my fiance's ex as his ex but as his friend. Those who said I was NTA adviced that I should talk to my fiance about my insecurities. Some suggested pre marriage counseling. So I swallowed my pride and told my then fiance that his ex is welcome in our wedding because she is his friend. I also told him of my insecurities and asked if we could go to pre marriage counseling. He was supportive and agreed. 

After our second meeting with our counselor, my ex fiance talked to me. He said that counseling has made him realize that he is still in love with his ex. I was in total shock because he has always been the perfect boyfriend, I never felt like I was competing with anyone for him. He said he never meant to hurt me and that he did love me, but he could not marry me knowing that part of him will always belong to someone else. 

It's been a few weeks since we broke up and surprisingly I have been holding up well. It hurts because I miss him but I just tell myself that he's not the right one for me. I'm 23, I have my whole life ahead of me and it's an exciting new adventure to try to find the right person. 

My ex fiance and I are civil. He is a good guy and I appreciate our time together, though it sucks that it has ended. From what I know he told his ex that he still loves her and I guess she felt the same way because she also broke off her engagement to give their relationship another try. Good luck to them.

So there, I just want to thank everyone who commented whether it's YTA NTA or NAH. I had great advice from people especially those who said we should try pre marriage counseling. It changed my life. Hopefully for the better.",530,10842,0.98
1402,Asshole,"A bit of background context. I’d been happily single for 5+ years. I never really had to cook for someone else apart from a BBQ which I don’t count.

It’s not that I can’t cook, I just don’t particularly love cooking. In fact, whilst single, I basically ate the same thing every day. For example, dinner was just skinless chicken breast, brown rice (or potatoes) and a salad (no dressing, because I didn’t think it needed it). I have my routine and can autopilot that stuff particularly when I’m tired from work.

I’m getting chastised by my partner for not cooking “tastier” or more “complex” food when I cook for us both. Thing is, yes, I have tried to cook something she requested, I honestly didn’t find the taste gains were worth the extra effort and the extra clean up. My partner ended up saying she’d stop cooking the meals I like from her until I get better at cooking, but I’m happy enough with what I cook for myself.

In the end I’m saying to her if you don’t like my “bland”, “flavourless”, “repetitious” food you don’t have to eat it. I’m not locking down the kitchen here, it’s open and you’re free to cook for yourself. I’m just not trying to look for another solution to a problem I solved yonks ago.

**TL;DR**Don’t love cooking, more than happy to cook and eat the same basic meals every day. Partner isn’t happy with that and wants me to cook better. I don’t feel like fixing what isn’t broken.

1403,Not the A-hole,"A little bit of background: I'm a 15 year old girl in a relatively conservative part of the Midwest/America. I don't actually recall my mom's male friend saying this to me or this event in general as my mom recently told me what happened, so details may be fuzzy. It should also be noted I have a larger chest and hips from my dad's side, which might also have influenced it...

I like wearing leggings and long sleeve crop tops/sweaters during fall because of how comfy they are and how they look at me. It's something I've been doing for a little over a year now. It must've been October or November, but I was wearing my usual crop top and leggings and walking around my house. My mom's friend, let's call him DM (for dungeon master, since he also ran my mom's D&D campaign), was visiting with his daughter we were just talking or something. I wasn't trying to be provocative, but he texted my mom saying something along the lines of ""virgoate shouldn't be wearing those clothes. They're really distracting and inappropriate.""
This pissed off my mom and they must've gotten into an argument. My mom picked my side, as well as two other friends in their group, while DM refused to apologize and got the rest of the group (about 5 others) on his side. My mom no longer goes to the D&D group and I feel like I ruined their friendship because of what I wear. We've known DM for the last 6 or so years and his daughter is my best friend. Should I have just changed? Am I the asshole?

1404,Not the A-hole,"We recently travelled overnight for a family holiday and stayed in an Airbnb that I booked. I told my cousin that my daughter (dd) and her boyfriend (ddbf) would be sharing a room. She made a comment but I thought she was joking. 

When we arrived at the Airbnb we were all tired from the busy day. My family and I ran out to get some groceries. We arrived back and I noticed that she had made a bed on the couch. I thought it was for her son (15) so didn’t think anything of it. We all headed to bed. 

The next morning my family woke up later than hers. I was still upstairs when dd and ddbf went down to the kitchen. The first thing my cousin did was tell dd that she wasn’t happy ddbf didn’t sleep in the bed she made. I told both dd and ddbf not to worry, that I was the only one that they had to worry about and I trusted them. I honestly didn’t think she was mad and was just giving him the gears. 

Two important things to know at this point. 1. Dd and ddbf are not having sex. They have been together for over 9 months. I am very close to dd and we talk openly about sex, alcohol, drugs and whatever.  I’m not one of those naive parents who just choose to turn a blind eye. Ddbf knows how I feel about things.  Dd has big plans for the future and is very goal-driven. I ask dd regularly if they are progressing to the stage of their relationship where they are considering having sex. Recently she told me that they have been talking about it but are not quite ready. She asked if she could make a dr appt to discuss birth control. I told her she could. Based on all of this I trust them completely.  2. My cousin got pregnant when she was the same age as dd. I’m sure he’s done the math. 

At one point in the day, I joked to my cousin about the bed on the couch. It quickly turned ugly and I was completely caught off guard. She said it was disgusting and she wasn’t impressed that her son had to see them share a room. I said well you were pregnant in high school so I’m sure your son has figured it out. She said he’s naive about that stuff to which I responded that the naive ones are the ones you need to educate. I told her that the only person dd and ddbf need to worry about is me as I am her parent. It wasn’t a heated discussion and I was respectful but now it’s kinda put a damper on the rest of our visit. Dd and ddbf don’t really feel like hanging out with us as they feel judged and untrustworthy.

Am I being unreasonable?  Am I too lenient with my daughter? I just know what I was doing at her age.  I want her to make educated decisions.  She will be moving out and going to university next spring.",283,1994,0.96
1405,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. 

I am a cashier in a bank, occasionally the bank's head office will send it's financial specialists to the high street branches to observe our work and make sure everything is running smoothly. One of these visits happened this week, and it was a young woman called Becky. She isn't much older than me, but as a top finance graduate she was fast tracked into a high up position at the office. She's absolutely gorgeous and well spoken and to begin with I thought she was really nice, until she started being cold and dismissive towards us customer service staff. She wasn't particularly nice to the management either since she is waayyy higher than even them, but our manager Sarah threatened to report her if she spoke to her like that again. 

Maybe I'm imagining things but she seemed to dislike me the most. I always change out of my work clothes when I leave, and in the staff room she said ''surely even with your wage you can afford better clothes than that'', interrupting me when I speak, even saying that I'm too ugly to work a customer service role. 

It was her last day today, and she was in a bad mood about something. On my lunch break I was chatting to one of my coworkers, when she barged in and demanded that I move so she could set up her laptop. I was moving my stuff when she started getting on to me about not being quick enough. I got frustrated and argued back with her. She started laughing and asked me if I was going to cry. She said if I didn't like how she talked to me, then it was my fault for being stuck in customer service while she had ''a proper job''. She also said she could ruin my career if she wanted.

At this point she was getting right into my face. Instinctively I shoved her back. The problem is that she was wearing high heels, and ended slipping and falling onto her back. Not only that but she had a burger in her hand for her lunch, and when she hit the floor she got sauce all over her white blouse. 

Becky was sobbing loudly. I tried to help her up but she swore at me and told me to leave her alone. Sarah ran in wanting to know what was going on, and Becky cried that I had just walked up to her and pushed her. Sarah said she would have a word with me afterwards. 

Becky got her stuff and left in tears, but luckily for me there is CCTV of the staff room which clearly shows her getting into my face, so thankfully Becky can't accuse me of randomly attacking her. 

Even so, as someone who was bullied and pushed around alot when I was growing up, I can't help but feel like I completely humiliated Becky. My coworker James who was with me during the incident said that pushing her, ruining her suit and making her cry was a step too far.

1409,Not the A-hole,"So, quick backstory. My fiancé and I were originally going to have two people stand up with us at our wedding when we started our planning, and as we set up our budget and got our venue, we decided to only have a matron of honour, (my sister) and a best man (his best friend), as it would have been cheaper and we didn’t want that big of a wedding party anymore.

We mentioned that we had shrunk down the numbers when the 4 of us (me, fiancé, best man and friend) went to brunch, and as such, friend would not be in the wedding party. She didn’t respond, and I double checked that she had heard me. She said yes, and I thought the situation was solved, no problem.

Later that day we were at her house drinking and playing cards against humanity, when she blurts our that “she’s so looking forward to shopping for her bridesmaid dress, and that I had better pick something that was flattering for her”. We were a little tipsy, so I just reminded her that she wasn’t in the wedding party anymore. Again, no response, and she seemed almost pissed at me for the rest of the evening. So now I’m worried that she still thinks she’s a bridesmaid.

My fiancé thinks I might have been too quick to get rid of her as a bridesmaid, but here’s the kicker: she was never supposed to be MY bridesmaid. She’s closer with my fiancé than me, and if we had stuck with the original plan of 2 people standing with us, she would have been on his side, not mine.

1411,Asshole,"My SO of 4 years and I (both in our 20s) were having a conversation about culture. She was born in China and immigrated to Canada when she was a baby with her family, and is very white-washed. She is a Canadian citizen and has only been to China a few times to visit. She acts the same as anyone else, doesn't have an accent, doesn't watch Chinese TV/movies/news. I am white, my ancestors were one of the first settle to Canada as traced by genealogy.

So the conversation goes, she says ""hey it would be nice if you learned a bit of Chinese"" and I don't want to do it. I have no patience an a bit lazy, and tell her this. She responds ""Well it'd be nice if you did it, because it's part of my culture."" And then I ask her, ""What's your culture?"" She responds, ""I'm Chinese"" to which I say ""no you're not, you're white."" Because honestly apart from the Chinese food she sometimes eats, there's nothing ""Chinese"" about her. When she comes over to my family for holidays, she is the same as the rest of my family. She does speak Chinese to her parents when they are together. She speaks mostly English to her sibling. When we went to university together and there were Chinese international students, she did not hang out with them.

Anyway, when I told her this, she got very upset. She said ""How dare you tell someone what their culture is or isn't. You are in no place to say that and it's highly offensive and out of line."" I was just trying to say that I think she's as Canadian/White as me, and when we are together I don't see her as ""Chinese"". Am I the asshole for pointing this out?",1690,3989,0.85
1412,Asshole,"My wife had her guitar stolen before a gig four months ago. She had a backup so it never affected her work but she said she would save up for a replacement of comparable quality to that one because it meant a lot to her.

I thought I'd be a good husband and today, for her birthday, I gave her a guitar. I bought it two weeks ago and kept it hidden until this morning. I don't know much about guitars so I tried to get something a similar color to the one that was stolen and let the shop employee guide the rest of my purchase. I spent $600, her guitar that was stolen was $1800.

She got upset at me for ""spending \[our\] money foolishly"". She said she'll never use it because it's not the same or even close to what she had or has in other guitars. This sounds like NTA territory but she followed it up with ""you should never buy someone a musical instrument because it's a personal decision"" which made me question whether I made the right choice at all. 

She told me she appreciated my attempt to help but this was money spent that will go to no use, and if I wanted to do this again, talk to her beforehand. She said we could have pooled our money and got a replacement for what she had stolen.

I don't know anything about guitars or even instruments in general. If it wasn't a good guitar I'm sure she could upgrade it or something to be good, right? It's a pretty piece of wood with strings on it, isn't that what determines the price? She doesn't think so and now I have to try and return this when I know it's past the return/exchange period.

1413,Not the A-hole,"Last night my boyfriend and I were driving home and I had a craving for some fries. I start turning into a local fast food chain restaurant at 9:47 and they close at 10:00. He tells me it's too late, they're trying to close. I told him I just wanted some fries and I could at least try to order. He tells me the workers will hate me and think I'm an asshole. I explain that they aren't closing for another 13 minutes and they're used to last minute orders. He got really pissed, said I have no respect for minimum wage workers, I don't know what it's like to work fast food, I'm going to make them work late and they just want to go home, etc. I ignored him and pulled into the drive thru because everything he was saying seemed ridiculous to me. I ordered my fries at 9:48, got them a minute later, and we were on our way. He says I'm just lucky they happened to have some fries still left and remained pissed the rest of the night.

1416,Asshole,"My mom just showed me the ""mother of the bride dress"" she plans to wear to my wedding, and it is \*very\* clearly a bridesmaid dress.  I wouldn't care too much, except that my bridesmaids will be wearing a more casual off-the-rack dress as a cost-saving measure, so I'd rather my mom isn't the only person at my wedding wearing an actual bridesmaid dress.

For my sister's wedding, she wore a standard MOB dress and looked gorgeous, and today I asked her if she could wear either that dress again or something similar.  She responded that that dress had felt like a sack, and she wants something more fitted and feminine (which is why she bought the bridesmaid dress).  I offered to buy her another dress that is fitted and feminine (anything she wants, as long as it isn't as obviously a bridesmaid dress) and she started to get all defensive so I dropped it.

AITA to ask my mom to wear something a little more classic for a mother of the bride?  Or am I being a bridezilla and need to relax and let my mom enjoy herself?

She didn't tell me she was shopping for a dress beforehand, she just mentioned she had bought her dress.  She didn't like the other dress (for my sister's wedding) because she didn't think it looked as pretty as this one since it didn't have much of a fitted waist. The reason I don't want her wearing it is that I don't want her to look like she's trying to be a bridesmaid.  I am perfectly happy to have her in a short, fitted, sleeveless dress, or whatever she's comfortable in and finds attractive.  I offered to take her shopping or pick out a dress on amazon (I would pay for it), and that's where things started escalating so I backed down.

1417,Not the A-hole,"The background is we've worked with each other for a couple years. We have a perfectly find work relationship and are very nice to one another. At work religion and politics almost never comes up. However, with pro life bills gaining popularity there was a bit of an impromptu victory celebration between her and another female co-worker. I felt this was in very poor taste being at work and all. Truth be told believe what you want for religion and politics both, but I think there's a time and place for certain things. 

I am personally not religious and a Democrat. Because we are friendly I let her know that I saw/overheard the celebration which she did not initiate herself to let her know that stuff is best left for off work hours. Our subsequent conversation turned towards views of pro life and pro choice. As a man who could never fully appreciate the enormous gravity of a situation where one mightchoose abortion I  very much pro choice and let it be known that religion has nothing to do with it. The woman asked that I consider letting Jesus into my heart. She does not say these things too often. 

Just today she asks if I'll listen to a podcast episode about Christianity and it's relationship to women. I say I will because why not. She sends me the link via text but then goes into say may the ""message bless you and encourage your heart."" That kind of follow up text just ribs me the wrong way. Bottom line the takeaway of the podcast is that women should just have faith that God will enforce divine punishment on those who do evil. Even rapists. I very much disagree and know that we the living can handle these things just fine and should punish wrongdoers. That's justice. 

WIBTA if I asked her to stop blessing me?

Update: I know the post hasn't been up long. At this point I'll just share my view on the podcast I said I'd listen to and just ignore her blessings and offers of Jesus. Definitely no need for HR. But moving forward I plan on quickly moving away from religion and politics in conversation. Thanks everyone.

Update 2: we had a brief conversation about the podcast. I feel it went well, but by the end I did say that maybe our conversations should avoid talking about religion because we just don't share the same views. I felt that was best.",72,127,0.88
1418,Not the A-hole,"So, my sister is a single mom and works in shifts. Usually she works the 2pm-10pm shift because she usually requests it. She does it because I usually end my classes around 2pm, sometimes 4-something, and asks me to babysit after. Her elderly neighbour takes care of the kid during the time window where I cant be there.

Thing is.. I am really, really tired of going to classes and then coming to babysit her daughter for hours while trying to maintain my grades and a semblance of social life. It's not an easy thing to do it every day, which includes cooking and cleaning for the kid as well as trying to parent it as she is incredibly hyper and prone to destroying things/getting hurt.

I was getting more and more frustrated and it all culminated in a fight when she asked me to babysit (let's call her) Carla over the weekend because my sister wanted to go on a date. I refused. She kept insisting, saying it's only one weekend. I kept making excuses, she kept calling my bullshit and finally it all resulted in a fight were we both screamed at each other. She called me selfish, I said that she never thinks how things affect me and stormed out.

We will have to eventually patch things, she IS my sister after all, but I still dont want to keep babysitting her child. I literally have no time for hanging out or dating because from Monday till Friday I am either in classes or babysitting and during weekends I am catching up on all of the schoolwork. And yeah. I am bitter.

Point being I hate his guts and want nothing to do with him anymore.

I never have to ask her for money. She brings in about 4K a month from disability between her and my dad. She gets her check monthly. Yet she still always has to ask me for money every pay day.

Another huge thing that has hindered our relationship is that I bought three cars with no help from them, gave them two. They didn’t take care of the first one and it’s screwed up now. The second one, they let someone that isn’t on my insurance drive it and they totaled it. Now they are driving my brand new $10k car every day, leaving me to sit at work all day and I have to get dropped off like I’m in elementary school. 


TL;DR: parents always ask me for money and when I say no, they get so upset. I try to help as much as I can but it’s never enough and I’m tired of doing without because of them. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to cash out hundreds of dollars every check? Even though they eventually pay SOME of it back...

EDIT: Today IS pay day. So there was a lot of arguing this morning as I wasn’t about to give her $100+my rent. I told her she could have the rent money to use until she gets her check and that’s it. That escalated to “don’t call me mom anymore” and “you dont care about me”.

One of my oldest friends recently got engaged and asked me to be a groomsman. I was incredibly honored and would absolutely love to be in that role as I’ve never done it for anyone else and most likely won’t get the chance again. 

Recently however he came to me and said he wants me to cut my hair because he doesn’t want the wedding photos to look weird if I have long hair along with the other bridesmaids. I was completely blown away by this and told them that there’s no way that would be happening and this is just the way I am, he knows this. 

Still he persisted and said that if I’m unable to fulfill this request then I won’t be able to be a groomsman anymore. My other friends are telling me that I should’ve done this for him as it’s a once in a lifetime event and I can always just grow my hair back. 

I’ve had long hair for as long as I can remember, over 15 years and it has always basically been my identity.

So basically for Christmas one year I decided I wanted to get my husband a fleshlight for Christmas. I thought it would be super hot to use together, that it was something that would bring him pleasure when we couldn't be together (he was in the military), and frankly watching men use sex toys is a big turn-on for me so watching him use it would be awesome.

I did the whole 'build your own' thing on their website and tried to choose everything I thought he'd like best. We had been together for six years, had an active sex life, and were into experimenting with new things from time to time so I was stoked; I truly thought he would love it.

To cut to the chase...he didn't love it. When he opened the package on Christmas morning he got really quiet for several seconds and was basically like "".....wow."" But not in a good way. Then he proceeded to barely speak to me the rest of the day. (It was just the two of us for the record, I would not give someone a sex toy as gift to open in front of other people.)

I was genuinely shocked by his reaction and how deeply it upset him. We talked about it that night and he said it was a ""fucking insulting"" gift, and it was an insult to him that I would think he's so pathetic that he would need to fuck a pocket pussy, or that I would rather him fuck a toy than me. I explained to him all the reasons I wrote above why I got it for him, that he was waaaaaaay misinterpreting my intentions, but nothing I said mattered. He was so pissed you guys, holy shit was he pissed.

I ended up selling it on Craiglist to recoup some of the money (those junkers aren't cheap). You'd be AMAZED how many men emailed me about it too. One hasn't truly lived until you've met a guy in a parking lot to sell him a fleshlight. I consider it one of the highlights of my 20s.

ANYWAY so like I said, this was years ago and we're divorced so it's irrelevant now, but....was I the asshole for giving him that as a gift? Was I really out of line?",337,1472,0.96
1426,Not the A-hole,"I lost a schedule bid at work recently to an employee with far less seniority. The reason given to me was ""he is a single father, and that schedule works better with his sons school schedule"". Not to be insensitive, but so the fuck what? My time is not less valuable because I have no kids. I get the logic, but I could give a shit about his schedule and problems. I have done my time and I earned that bid plain and simple.

I have filed a grievance with HR (the crux of it is that I was discriminated against for not having kids), in an attempt to get the schedule I bid on. A few coworkers have mentioned off the cuff to me that I should let it go because he's a single father (full time, mom is out of the picture), and that I ""don't get it because I don't have any kids.""

Quick details:

* The son in question is 15
* I have been with the company 6 years, he has been here 2 years.
* The schedule in question is M-F 9-5, right now we are both working 3pm-11pm Thurs-Tuesday, so obviously it's more desirable.


So, AITA?",1476,3246,0.94
1427,Not the A-hole,"I have never been the reason someone got fired and I am wondering if IATA.

I was working as a consultant. This required travel to perform installations while the company found someone who could take over. After about 6 months, they found someone and it was my job to train this guy. Lets call him The Mole (TM). This dude was short, round, and squinted through his glasses everywhere he went (He never cleaned his glasses, ever). Anyway, I spent a month teaching TM things like basic diagnosing of issues, how the thing works. TM didn't take notes even when handed a pad and told ""You're gonna want to write this down"". After a month, its time for TM to go on an installation.

We land and start driving to our hotel.  At this point we realize there were 6 service calls that came in and we needed to deal with them. I divide them up, I give TM the easy ones. We check into our rooms and start making calls.

Remember in Die Hard the advice about making balls with your feet in the carpet? For the last couple of years my feet started swelling on planes and that advice actually works.  I get to my room, off come the shoes and socks, and I start gripping the carpet with my toes as I make calls.

I finish my calls when TM knocks on my door. I let him in. You should note that TM used to be a chain smoker but had switched to vaping. It wasn't one of those Juul ones that smell ok, it was more like the ones that sound like a jet engine with every drag he took. Whatever he was smoking smelled like burning motor oil. TM asks me how to solve his first customer issue. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a .5.  I sit down, TM notices I am not wearing socks and goes into a tirade about how disgusting I am, how it is awful and that I need to put on socks. At some point a switch in my brain flips. I remind him he is in my hotel room, stinking it up, and that he came to me for help, TM settles down. We get back to his question and I ask TM, ""So what do your notes say about this issue?"" He gets flustered, sucks on the tail pipe of his vape and says he doesn't have any notes. I ask if he has written anything down that I taught him from the previous month. Nope, not a single word. I tell him not to worry, I will take the 3 calls I had given him.

After sorting out TM's calls, I call the owner to talk about the situation.  TM had placed a call to the owner as well to complain about my sockless antics. I've known the owner for 10+ years and when he picked up, he said ""I can't continue this conversation unless you put your socks on."" followed by a laugh. I explained the situation and said TM was a buffoon and should be fired solely for what he had said to me about my socks. I also let the owner know he wasn't cutting it when it came to learning anything that had to do with our product. When we returned from our trip TM was fired.

So AITA for getting a guy fired, mostly because he didn't like that I wasn't wearing socks?",201,1819,0.91
1428,Not the A-hole,"My friends informed me last weekend that they had rescued an adorable dog. They said they picked it up off the street. The next day I figured it was worth looking at lost dog ads in the area and immediately found an ad posted by the owner saying they miss the dog and that their house is ""lonesome"" without their ""baby.""

&#x200B;

I texted the ad to my friends and they explained that they knew the owner was looking for it. The owner lives next door to their friends and their friends had told them that the dog often escaped and wandered around the neighborhood. It also was left outside in the cold too often and was left in a trash-filled yard, they said. This is third hand information for me, since it was my friends telling me their friends told them this about their neighbor.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my friends said they planned to keep the dog. Queue me freaking out. I immediately Googled the woman who posted the ad hoping she was some kind of deadbeat shitty person and learned she was a 60-year-old church lady who sews and bakes and has grandkids. By this point I was sobbing thinking about this woman not knowing where her dog was. She had posted to Facebook that she'd contacted animal control and the Humane Society.

&#x200B;

I felt like the right thing for my friends to do would have been to file a complaint with animal control or the humane society if the dog was not properly cared for. Maybe that would have gotten the owner to shape up. Or, they could offer to buy the dog. Or, they could offer to help the owner out fixing their fence or whatever they needed to better care for the dog.

&#x200B;

Alright, so instead of doing the grown up thing and coming out and saying that to their face I proceeded to ask them about six questions by text about why they'd decided to keep it and what the process had been for how they got it. Like, ""did you pick it up or did your friends?"" ""Did they try calling animal control first?"" ""Look, I'm really conflicted about this and sad thinking about the woman who lost her dog, can you tell me more about how you made your decision?"" Etc, etc. It was probably pretty stressful for them, but after all, they stole a dog.

&#x200B;

Finally, the guy in the relationship texted my boyfriend and said ""why is your girlfriend investigating us?"" And then they sent a series of text messages essentially expressing their displeasure with me ""digging"" into it. A day later they discovered the dog had a chip and they had to return it anyway!!! But they said it ""broke their heart"" to return the dog to what they thought was an abusive situation and they were hurt that I was ""rubbing it in.""

&#x200B;

I hadn't meant to rub it in. I was honestly trying to 1) assess the situation and 2) convince them to return the dog and take an alternate path like calling animal control if they were worried about it.

&#x200B;

Was my investigating and digging wrong? Was I just plain wrong about the dog? Was stealing it the right thing to do?",31,49,0.89
1429,Not the A-hole,"So I met this guy on Tinder, we started having sex the day we met and it was really enjoyable for the both of us. But for the 9 month we were hanging out, I didn’t cum once. Still I obviously really liked having sex with him.    
I didn’t really like his personality, he was a lying cheating manipulative narcissistic sociopath(his words). But I was cool with it since we were just hanging out like friends.    
So one day we were having dinner, and somehow our relationship status popped up. I told him from the beginning this was just a friends with benefits situation. He said he always had the same dynamic with women but let the women name it. I didn’t want him to get the wrong idea, so I told him I didn’t feel anything emotional with him, but that i loved having sex with him.    
At this points he sarcastically asks “So what, am I just your vibrator?”. I think of a response and chuckle, but didn’t say it because I kinda knew it would hurt him. So he’s like no tell me what did you think. So I said “Well not really, my vibrator makes me cum” which he got REALLY upset over. I kept telling him i liked the sex and i was sorry for making the joke, but to be honest it was the truth.    
He sulked and made sarcastic comments for the rest of the day, but we did have great sex that night. And no,  I did not cum that night neither.    
So am i the asshole?   
   
Edit: No I’m not seeing him anymore, no I never faked an orgasm, no I had no problem with not cumming, and no I wasn’t going to lie to him and say some other shit in response.   
Edit 2: Me not cuming was not news for him, earlier in the relationship I told him I didn’t cum but also that I didn’t mind it, he suggested I masturbated when he was done, which I didn’t wanna do with him standing there.",116,250,0.92

1431,Asshole,"So basically my wife, who practices good oral hygiene (as in she brushes her teeth on the reg) somehow has consistently bad breath. 

She is also very quietly spoken meaning I have to get close to hear her speak at times. 

When I do get close, she will breathe on me and I’ll typically get a rather large whiff of the stank hit me right in the smell sense. 

Every time this happens I tell her that it smells and I’m not attracted to her when I smell it as I genuinely want her to see someone (perhaps a dentist) to check if there is some underlying issue causing the halitosis, not because I enjoy pointing it out. 

AITA for speaking the truth in this situation? She says I am. 

Side note, she does have some self confidence issues of which she says me pointing this out adds to her low self esteem.

EDIT: for further context, my comment about finding her unattractive has only come about recently after an ongoing gentle conversation about the issue with complete inaction on her behalf.

EDIT: WOW, this has blown up more than I thought it would, and truly value the opinions. Possibly too late, but just to bring some further clarity on some possible poor wording from me. 

As noted above, I’ve been very gentle until recently, raising that there could be an issue and she should get it checked. Over time it has become firm, and honestly only twice ever have I mentioned that I find her unattractive as a result. 

Obviously I understand how hurtful that can be and that I should be more tactful, but don’t consider myself to be “emotionally abusive” based on this situation. I certainly don’t think a divorce is on the cards...",148,194,0.92
1432,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I (I'm female if that matters) have been together 1 year. We live 40 minutes apart. When we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. 

Three weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.

Except. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. 

He doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. 

But he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. 

Which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. 

He basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. 

I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. 

I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. 

He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"". So he thinks it's my fault. 

I plan to spend tonight and tomorrow with him and go home on Sunday just like I did this week. 

AITA?

Tl;dr: I refused to stay with my boyfriend until he stops wasting all of the hot water in the morning. AITA?",2053,8148,0.96

1435,Not the A-hole,"My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.

My husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our “real” one. 
We were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.

The bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

Our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

We have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

Well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to “slave” and live as “peasants” while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

This is bora bora we’re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. 

There was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would’ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would’ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn’t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

I obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn’t one just sit back and be grateful they’re on a free vacation instead of complaining?

My grandparents freaked out. Saying I’m holding money above their head and that I’m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

Idk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it’s falling apart. 

I don’t think I’m the asshole at all, but I’ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

So Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?



***UPDATE***
Even though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it’d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.

During breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we’re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

I made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn’t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

They kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

Well, I’m not doing that. 
I’ll pay for their flight back home, but I’ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. 

So there you have it. My grandparents weren’t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. 

After breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn’t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

Staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn’t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words “they kill the vibe”. So everyone’s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

I’m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

I have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can’t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. 

I did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago.

1441,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory. I (18m) have gotten the same haircut from kindergarten to junior year in high school. Imagine your typical Asian kid buzz cut. And being a chubby kid, this haircut only made my round face and big head even worse. 

So starting senior year I decided that I was gonna grow out my hair. At first I wasn’t sure about it, but after I started to let it grow longer and longer, I started to like the look of longer hair. However, one person who didn’t like it was my mother.Again imagine a very stereotypical Asian mother. She hated and hated the lol, and constantly told a me to cut it. But me as an adult now, thought that I should be able to decide my own hair style. So I kept letting it grow. So as of today my hair falls to about an inch below my chin. Both my parents have been nagging me to cut my hair at least a couple of times a day, although my dad doesn’t seem to really give a damn if cut it or not. Tonight me and my mom got into a HUGE (and by huge I mean like really really really bad) argument. It wasn’t solely based on my hair, as she was saying that I do not listen to what she suggests, but my hair did play a major key in the entire thing. 

I don’t want to get too deep but my hair is more than just hair to me. It symbolizes just a little bit of individuality and freedom from my mom, with her being a very stereotypical Asian mom and me being a very non-stereotypical Asian.

Because it might be relevant in some issues, I'll go ahead and say I'm from a country in Europe, so some details are different from what is usually posted here.  


What happened is pretty straightforward. Basically I came into an intersection where I had green light so I went straight through. Unfortunately, a cyclist who was coming from my left side ignored his red light and I ended up hitting him at \~50kmh full impact on his side. He was wearing a helmet but he didn't move with the impact and had to go in an ambulance to the hospital.  
The police arrived almost at the same time as the ambulance and I was cleared since several witnesses confirmed that it was the cyclist that ran over a red.  


Now, with the impact, the front of my car was pretty smashed in, the lights on the left side were completely shattered, and as luck would have it, one of those metal ""radiuses"" from the bike's wheel lodged itself between the grill and into the engine of my car. The total to fix it is around 1100€, and my insurance won't cover it. However they told me I could get the cyclist to pay for it, as the accident was his fault.  
This is quite a bit of money for me to spend on something that I had no blame in, but I feel kinda douchy making someone who's in a hospital bed to pay, so I wanted some opinions.

PS: Hospital bills aren't exactly cheap but they're not absurdly expensive like in the US. ",931,3825,0.96

She told me that dab pens gave her a different high than her smoking, and she didn’t like dab pens because of that. But she promised me she would try to keep the smell down to a minimum. Usually when we are together and she smells like weed, I grin and bear it. If I had to put a number on it I would say she smells like weed 25 percent of the time we hang out. Three days ago, she texted me and asked if she could come to my house, and I said yes. When I walked over to her car to greet her, and she got out, she stunk of weed. Like this is the strongest she’s ever smelt of weed, it was crazy. I told her that she couldn’t come in my house because she smelled like weed. She told me it was fine, and could just take a shower in my bathroom. I said no, and told her to go home. She again  told me it wasn’t a big deal and she could just shower in my bathroom.

1446,Not the A-hole,"I took a short trip with a well off friend of mine along with my children. She makes it a point to pay for everything when we're out which makes me uncomfortable. Everytime I offer to pay, she makes a big fuss and will say ""You can get he next meal"", but then then she does the same thing for the next meal. I do not like feeling like I owe anything to anyone so I'd rather pay for myself. I told her it makes uncomfortable when she does not let me pay for myself.  She say it's just how he is and she feels like it's her obligation since she's the one who invited me. I said yes, but I really didn't expect her to foot the bill for every single meal on her trip. She just tells me to get the next one, but it doesn't happen.


Now I mentioned that my kids were with me. We know kids can be finicky eaters.  My 10 yr old can normally eat  full adult size meal and complain about being hungry 20 minutes later.  I do not have my kids split meals anymore. My  10 y.o.  hasn't split a meal with his 7 year old sibling in a couple years.  During one meal he didn't  eat everything on his plate. This pissed my friend off, apparently but we won't find out until later. My 7 year old is one to get full quickly, but she usually eats her leftovers later. I dont make her split meals since my oldest would usually still be starving if he had to split a kids meal. 


So the next morning my friend really wants to get breakfast but tells me she thinks the kids should only have water because their meals were too expensive and they should be splitting anyways since they never finish their meals. I told her I would pay and she started making a big deal about it. ""That's not  the point, blah, blah, blah"" I told her we brought food with us anyways and I didn't expect anything from her. She said she really wanted to go out and to just make the kids split. So I said ""Kids, you're getting water and splitting your meals"". They did and everything worked out, though my oldest was still hungry when we left. I'm  extremely non confrontational, so I didn't say anything but I was so ready  for the trip to be over.



Looking back, I should have just said ""We're on vacation, I don't want to feel like I have to watch everything we do just because you refuse to let me pay"" I know this would have made her upset so that's why I didn't  say anything, but the more I think of it the more annoyed I am. 


It's not just that alone, but I'd be here forever if I went over every single thing. She basically dictated our every move since she was paying. I could tell my kids were just an annoyance to her. She never had children and is constantly offering her parental advice.  


So am I the asshole for not ever wanting to go anywhere with this ""friend"" again?
_____________________________________________________

Update: I realize I suck for not standing up for my kids. My initial reason for asking this is because I wasn't sure if I was being unreasonable for being upset by her request. This only happened during the last meal we had. The rest of the time we ordered whatever we wanted, I did feel a little guilty because my 10y.o. wasn't eating as much as he normally does but I think it's because he was excited, so he made it look like he was being wasteful.  I should have put my foot down. I've apologized to my kids and of course they've already forgotten.  I will not be going out again with this person.

People are really comparing my judgement on how I handled this to pedophilia. Let me tell you I stand up for my kids when necessary. Splitting a meal isn't THAT bad, folks.

1447,Not the A-hole,"Several years ago my then 26 year old brother started dating a 16 year old girl. They met online and somehow she ended up moving across several states to live with him. (Apparantly she was emancipated or something? I really don't know.) She pretty much started controlling his life and saying that he couldn't speak to us anymore or come over to visit. When I would try to go over to his place to see him, she would show up at the door and refuse to let me see my brother and threaten to call the cops, saying that I was trespassing. 

She ended up having a serious problem with me because I didn't like what she was doing to my brother (keeping him from his family, sending hateful messages to my mom and me from his phone, etc.) She and my brother would show up at my place of work and harass me and then make complaints to my boss to try and get me fired.

He realized that the whole thing was crazy and tried to get back in touch with my parents to ask for help to move down with us because she drained his bank account and totalled his car.

I live at home while I'm in college because my parents insist that it's cheaper and want me to. But after all the shit that my brother caused, even with all the threats and stalking, he is allowed to have a key to the house and come and go as he pleases, even when it's just me at home. 

I have expressed my discomfort and told my parents that I do not feel safe with just me and him in the house, but they do not care. 

He is a 28 year old man still relying on his parents to survive. I am a 20 year old female college student just trying to get an education and focus on my studies. But he seems to come over primarily when it's just me at home. He has his own place, that my parents pay for. I'm starting to just leave the house whenever he comes over and tell my parents to call me when he's gone. But they are getting mad and saying that I'm not 'family orientated' and need to fix my attitude. Being completley honest, he terrifies me and I don't feel safe around him. So I avoid him at all cost. But my parents insist that I'm overreacting and am being mean.

I moved 10 hours away and switched schools to get away. It almost feel like he moved down here just to spite me.

1448,Asshole,"Short version is the title. Here's the longer one:

My husband, some friends and I were hanging out at a bar for a few hours last weekend before deciding to grab a bite to eat. The place we were headed was a few blocks from where I live, so I offered a quick smoke session before we went to the restaurant. Only one person took me up on the offer: Zack.

Zack and I have always had a slightly closer relationship than my husband had with him but it has always been platonic. Since I've known Zack, he's been married to a wonderful woman and has two beautiful kids with a third on the way. He's always come off as the ultimate family man -- respectable, loyal, kind. This particular night, his wife stayed home so he could have a night out. 

Keeping in mind that my husband and I saw him as a trustworthy guy, Zack and I went back to my place to smoke while everyone else went to the restaurant. As we're sitting on my porch passing the pipe back and  forth, I make a jokey, off-hand remark about how hot his wife is and he says that she's got nothing on me.

I could hear the record scratch sound effect in my head. I'm pretty drunk and well on my way to being stoned so I take another hit instead of address the bomb dropped in front of me. He tells me that he's had a huge crush on me for years. I tell him it's flattering but we should get back to my husband and  our friends.

We go to the restaurant and everything is normal. All of us are having a great conversation and downing several bottles of wine. My husband invites everyone to our place once dinner is over to use the hot tub. Only Zack accepts. I don't stop it because I figure that as long as my husband is around it'll be fine. 

Zack keeps inching closer to me in the hot tub as my husband is starting to fall asleep. Zack says something about how it'd be fun for him to bring his wife over and we could all have a real good time - he wouldn't even care if me or my husband had sex with her. I try to laugh it off as a crude joke and suggest we get out of the tub.

While my husband is in the bathroom changing, Zack asks me for a kiss. I tell him no and my husband comes out a moment later. 

He offers to let Zack crash at our place because all of us are clearly wasted. Zack agrees. My (sweet, dear, oblivious) husband says he's going bed but Zack and I should smoke up more. I honestly don't know why I didn't just say I was tired and  go to bed.

I find myself back on the porch with Zack. At one point, he looks me up and down and  says, ""Can I get one little kiss? No one will ever know.""

I say no and remind him of how much I love my husband, how much Zack loves his family, and that it's not worth it to throw it all away. I ask him to leave, which he does without protest.

I haven't talked to Zack since and don't plan to. I also don't plan on allowing myself to get into a one on one situation with Zack again. Ultimately, all of us were in an intoxicated fog and nothing happened, so WIBTA if I never mentioned it to my husband?

Edit: Thanks for opening my eyes to what a dumb asshole I've been to try to avoid drama. I know I didn't handle the situation the same way I would have sober.

My husband is a wonderful guy (I couldn't love anyone more) and I know that telling him is going to be uncomfortable but it's the right thing to do. I'm ashamed it took the internet to get me to do what my gut has been telling me to do since that night.

Edit 2: My husband and I talked. He handled it super well, understood my hesitation in saying anything and appreciated that I eventually did. We're cutting Zack out.",76,217,0.93
1449,Not the A-hole,"Im a highschool sophomore and visited korea (home) for a week in summer vacation. 
Very first day I ride a bus w my mom to the dentist and at the end of the ride notice my wallet is gone, we checked the whole bus and its nowhere to be found.

It was really early in the morning so very few people rode the bus and as we travelled for over an hour 2 or 3 people kept changing while we stayed on the whole ride. 

Anyway we get off and instantly go to the police.
It was a valuable wallet with lots of money inside that I had saved up to spend for a week and also as we rode that bus and checked everywhere, we concluded that it was likely a theft, not me just dropping it somewhere.

Anyway we get back to HongKong, where I live, and after a month we get a call from the police department that they had found it and could give it to us if we come again on August. 

As we submitted it as a theft however we had a choice  to either send her over to the criminal place (not sure what its called in english) where she would get a line and a history of criminal activity or we could just sign the paper saying its all g.

We decide to sign the paper with an apology from her. However later we get another call from the police saying she can not be there on that day so we should just go and sign without apology. Obviously we were not happy with that as she should adjust her to time to meet us, so we decide not to sign if shes not there.

Now thats when the police goes bat shit crazy on my mom saying we’re entitled victims and not all victims are good and we should just sign as we live away so we’re obviously rich and this wont fuck w us at all.

We get pissed, hang up and just instantly send her over where she gets a criminal record. Its harder to get a job and she was studying to become one of the government workers which she cannot get now because of this. 

I honestly feel bad and ppl tell me im an asshole for ruining her life over a wallet. AITA?

Edit: I do understand we should not punish the girl for the policeman’s attitude, but as she did not contact us in any way and we got her thoughts through the police, it seemed like there was no explanation from her for us to make a better choice.",75,192,0.94
1450,Asshole,"So I’m 18 and my older sister is 26. She has a daughter who is five, and I love her very dearly, but she acts very strange at times, mostly to get a reaction.

I was babysitting her earlier today, and she sat next to me. I said hi and smiled and she just started...smelling me in the most intense way. 

I asked why she was doing that and she said she felt like smelling me. I was like okay... and then she started smelling the table, and then the couch. I figured if she wasn’t hurting herself or anyone/anything else, she was okay. Like I said she’s very odd at times so I didn’t think anything of it. 

A little bit later my neighbor came over just to say hi, and my niece continued smelling everything after saying hi. 

At one point I thought it was maybe time for her to stop so she wouldn’t break her nose or something. So I asked her to please take a break from smelling everything. Then she plopped onto the floor and smelling my leg.

I asked her to stop and she yelled at the top of her lungs “IT’S SMELLINGTINES DAY”.

At this point I was frustrated so I picked her up and sat her on the couch, and told her to calm down. I looked over at my neighbor and her face was appalled so I asked what was up and she said “That little girl is genius. Smellingtines!! Get it? Like Valentines but smelling. That’s so sophisticated.”

I told her “No, it wasn’t it was stupid. She just took the word of what she wanted to do and put it in front of tines.” 

I guess that angered my niece because she started crying and saying I called her smellingtines day idea stupid. I told her to take a nap and she did. 

By the time she had woke up my neighbor had left and her mom was there to pick her up. I helped her get ready and asked for a hug before saying goodbye and she turned her head with a dissatisfied face, saying how I hurt her feelings earlier. 

I apologized and asked if she forgives me and she ignored me. Then she went in the car and fell asleep. 

I’m afraid she’ll still be mad the next time I see her. AITA?",49,58,0.87
1451,Not the A-hole,"My brother is 22 and I’m 16, and we both live upstairs in our parents house. He’s also my step brother, but we’ve known each other since I was 4 and he was 10, so he’s my brother.

He usually walks around the house in boxers and no shirt, getting food or laying with the dogs. But whenever I come downstairs in a large t-shirt and underwear, he gets upset, saying that I need to wear pants and its weird for me to dress like that.

It grosses me out to think my brother gets upset when I wear no pants because its possibly sexual to him, and he’s even said “If my girlfriend ever dressed like that I’d be all over her.” I don’t wanna call him out for being a pervert, but it’s disgusting, and it’s made me hate walking around the house. Clothes make my skin feel weird, so I usually wear large shirts and baggy pants, so the less clothes I have on the better I feel, but now it feels like a man is forcing a dress code on me because I have to deal with his moobs, but he can’t handle my briefs. So last time he got angry with me I yelled at him to stfu and stop looking at my ass like a pervert, because I don’t look at his boobs and think “Damn I want those on me.” He went back into his room and we’ve stopped talking about it, but he’s not mad. We continued to play dbd later and forgot about the entire experience. AITA?

I won't get into the unnecessary details of those events, but long story short she was caught lying. It was an attempt to get revenge on him. That destroyed her reputation when people found out. She lost most of her friends. At least half of our grade hated her. I'm pretty sure she regrets it now.

Last week I heard that she will be attending the same college as me. Would I be an asshole there if I brought this up?",40,43,0.92

1456,Not the A-hole,"I've (20F) been living on my own since moving out a year ago, and the neighbourhood I'm in is kind of on the... bogan side? For a lack of a better word. But everyone mostly sticks to themselves, so it is generally a quiet street. But bogans usually are rowdy people half the time. 

So I usually just stay in my house inside when I'm there. When I need to get out, it's either to do my job or to let my cat out to play. When I want him back in, I just call him and he comes running instantly. No problem there, I'm just doing a few things. As it is a quiet street though, it is always a surprise to see other neighbours out. Not that I am too interested in knowing anyone mind you, but sometimes... I can't help but observe other people from afar. No one stays out for too long, and I only ever really know if anyone is out if I also am, so I don't feel like I'm stalking anyone. 

At least, that's what one of my neighbours believes I actually am. Let's call her Lady. Lady lives with her daughter and her bf and her daughter's toddler. It's pretty obvious that they don't live in the greatest conditions, however. Their next door neighbour got pinned to the ground and beaten by their dad, and their reaction was to bring a baseball bat and wait outside. Another time, they and the same neighbours got into an argument that could easily be heard from inside. Basically, they're kind of a paranoid group of people. And it always gets worse when I am involved. 

Three months in living at my house, Lady came up to my door and politely asked if I was watching them, because I pulled over near their house. I told them that I did that because I had to reply to a very important message, and apologised for that. But it seemed that she understood. Fast forward six months later, I was pulling out the bins, and Lady suddenly yelled at me for watching her. Weird but whatever. Now fast forward to today. My aunt and uncle's cat went missing and they ask me to look for her, which I said yes to. When I couldn't find her, I went back home, and there was a young couple 30ft in front of me. Turns out to the the daughter and their bf, as they went straight back to their home. I came back out a minute later from my house to call for my relative's cat, sitting out on the front patio in case she shows up. And just like last time, Lady got all huffy and she was waving her arm at me sticking the middle finger. Even though I made it clear I was looking for a pet and not stalking or watching them.

Idk, it has been on the back of my head since this afternoon and I'm wondering if I'm being too socially awkward or creepy without knowing it. I tend to be like that generally, I guess. Also, I do have at least one friend from my street who lives two houses right to Lady and co., and when I go to see my friend she or her bf or whoever would usually be watching anyone who passes by. They do this to mostly everyone.",20,28,0.88

1458,Asshole,"Like the title says: my husband and I took our son to see The Lion King this evening. We thought that since it is a kid's movie and originally came out fifteen years ago, it wouldn't be too bad if our son made some noise. He was generally really good, and we did take him out when he started crying at one point. However, someone sitting in front of us turned all the way around to look at us whenever our son made the slightest noise (such as exclaiming about various animals that he found exciting or cute.) It made me feel really self concious and uncomfortable. Am I in the wrong here? I know two years is young to see a movie, but we tried to be really respectful of those around us. AITA?

Edit: Yes, it was an evening showing. There aren't any ""family times"" offered at theaters in my area, but I normally would have taken him to an earlier showing. I couldn't do that in this situation because I do not currently have a functioning car (brake issues) and had to rely on my husband. I know he's not going to remember it, but I still like providing a variety of activities for him so we're not just in the house all the time. He wasn't talking throughout the movie, but would say one or two incomprehensible words every so often.",167,122,0.85
1459,Not the A-hole,"There is a woman who lives in the same small town and I who has been making my life hell. Starting rumors, telling lies, attempting to make me look like a complete psycho, because she is jealous that I used to date her boyfriend. We live in a very small town, so had/have lots of mutual friends, and I have lost some of those friends because she told them I was crazy. My ex and I remained friendly until he got together with her, because apparently, I have been trying to steal her man. Meanwhile, I am in relationship with someone else.

Anyway, this woman has tried, and sometimes succeeding, in destroying my reputation among mutual friends and acquaintances, as well as with her boyfriend's family, which is really messed up because those people are my child's family as well.

I often fantasized that she would get hit by a car or something, but instead it turns out she was very recently diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She is only 40. 

A tragedy, to be sure, says everyone. Personally, I am not only not sad, but feel satisfaction at this news. Admitting that makes me feel like not only an asshole, but also a sociopath. I do have sympathy for her two teenage sons, for her family, for her boyfriend, but I just can't make myself not hate her.

Now, I keep these feelings to myself, because people are grieving and I don't want to hurt them. I also don't offer up fake expressions of being so, so sad, because pretty much everyone knows I can't stand her. It inevitably gets brought up: ""Did you hear about A? So tragic!"" I just say yep, and change the subject.  It gets harder when people say, ""I hope she's one who beats the odds!"" But, frankly, I don't so I say nothing.

1463,Not the A-hole,"I (16/M) have a pretty decent sized friend group at high school; out of the 18 or so people, there are 2 who are trans (MTF and FTM, referred to as Ally and Justin ) whom I’m not close with.

I think I am bi but either way, I’ve been dating this really awesome girl (Kara) for about eight months. According to my friends, I carry myself in a rather feminine way- I love dressing nicely, think drag is interesting (but I don’t want to do it) and I’ll join my GF at the spa or to get facials or something because I love joining her.

For context, I don't really like Ally and Justin to begin with. Not because they're trans or anything, they just kind of make every conversation trans related and keep talking about privilege. Also, Ally kept weirdly hitting on Kara even though she’s said no a bunch of times. I’m not a crazy controlling guy or anything, I just think it’s weird that she’s asked her if she was single a few times. I also didn’t want to confront Ally about this because I didn’t want to come off as *that guy* you know?

So  eight of us (my GF, Justin, Ally, and 4 others) were chilling at a pool when I came out of the house in swim trunks that were a purple/blue color with pinkish clouds. So, Ally (MTF) commented that my shorts looked feminine and I laughed and agreed because I love the colors and then Ally made a joke that I’m an egg that’s going to crack any moment now. Apparently, an egg is someone who’s transgender but doesn’t realize until later, when they “crack”- I googled it to figure it out. I basically just laughed it off, but Ally kept making jokes about me just not realizing I’m trans and how I’m more feminine than her. Anyway, she joked about how because I’m into drag, I must be repressing my inner trans-ness and crossdressing at home.

Most of them know I’m bi, but I said that I don’t like gay culture in conversation—all the nudity and loudness and the “gay slang” & that sort of thing at which point, Ally says  “how could you not like it, you’re an egg about to crack soon.” and Justin laughed along. So I kind of grabbed my stuff and told them both to F-off & to stop projecting their sexuality on me and that it’s not my fault I was born cis and feel comfortable with myself unlike them, and then left soon after because the mood was kind of ruined. I also said that being a girl/guy isn’t defined by appearance or interests, I’m just innately a guy and feel comfortable as myself. I checked my phone later in the evening and Justin, Ally, and 2 others left out group chat after Ally wrote a long paragraph (longer than this one lmao) claiming that I’m transphobic and a “TERF” and how Kara should leave me because I’m clearly not a feminist because I was being unsupportive to Ally’s transition.  Kara agreed with me and said I could have been less harsh and they’re the ones exaggerating, but a few people in the group called me an asshole. So reddit, AITA?",130,350,0.91

A little background:My sister has lived within 15/20 minutes of my mom her entire life (I am 36 year old male and she is 33) but I have lived all over the US and other countries.  About 6 years ago we moved closer to my parents (about 2 hours away) so they could enjoy their grandkids and we come down and stay every few months.  My sister and I are not close in any capacity, we are very different people that clash and I consider her toxic so I have little to no contact with her outside of my parents.  I have a 10 year old son and a 7 year old daughter, she has a 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter.

Every time I bring my kids down to stay a weekend (wife stays at home because we have pets and she could use the break) my sister swings by and drops her kids off and leaves expecting her kids to stay at my moms the entire time we are their so the ""cousins can play"".  Sleeping accommodations are limited so this forces me to have to sleep on the couch which is less than pleasant.  The house gets extremely loud with the kids screaming etc.

Last time I was down, I told my mom that I don't come down to listen to all the kids screaming and would like to relax without having to parent all the kids etc.  I am coming down this weekend and I asked my mom not to tell my sister we are coming so I could actually enjoy some time with my parents without her or her kids around.

When we met, his son was living with his ex and his daughter lived with him (same mom, but they let the kids choose where to live and based on schools, that’s how it worked out). Now both kids are college aged and the daughter moved with her mom out of state to attend college, and is doing very well. After this, we decided to move in with one another, getting our own place to live.

A little after that, his son told SO that he didn’t want to live in the dorms anymore and asked to move in with us for the time being, so he could easily commute to work, school and gigs for band. My SO asked me and I was fine with it. We have the room and his son’s a good kid, plus it’s not like he’d have anywhere else to go since his mom no longer lives in state. He’s been living with us since Fall 2018 and is now 23 years old, going to be a college junior. He’s respectful of our living environment. He’s not even home much and when he is, he picks up after himself and mostly stays in is room. He doesn’t pay rent, for the record.

My SO is annoyed with this arrangement, however. He thinks his son is way too focused with his job and his music. I’ve tried to stay out of it, because this isn’t my kid and I’m not even a step-mom. But he complains to me about it, so I try to stay middle ground and just tell him to talk to his son, along with his ex as they’re his parents.

The other day, after ranting yet again about him being there and me sympathizing with him, while also encouraging him to talk to his son, my SO asked “Well don’t you mind him being here?” I replied, “Well, not really.” Because honestly, it’s not getting in the way of our life. We can go on trips if we want, he’s rarely ever home. It’s not like we need our spare room for anything. He got mad and said it’d be easier to talk to his son like I’ve been suggesting if I could “back him up”. I said if he’s suggesting we kick him out, I’m not going to back him up there, because I don’t think that’s the right thing. We’ve sort of been fighting for a few days.

1473,Asshole,"My mom married my stepdad when I was 5. We would visit his parents every five years or so. My step grandmother had 4 children with her first husband.

When she got remarried, my stepdad and his brother were both in their late teens so they remember this situation very well. Since I wasn’t there, I will tell you the story from their POV.

When my stepdad was about 17, his little sister who was 15 at the time, got pregnant. My stepdad clearly remembers her being pregnant. Very early into the pregnancy, my stepdads sister was “sent away” and about 7 months later, she reappeared and magically my step grandmother had a newborn baby with her new husband. From the moment that happened, obviously everyone knew that my step aunt had had a baby and given it to my step grandparents. But no one ever wanted to rock the boat and confront them. Also, years later my aunt who had the baby wrote a letter to her other brother detailing what had happened and how sad she was about it. So there is no doubt that she gave the baby to my step grandparents.

That child became what I knew to be my step aunt who was only about 7 years older than me. In reality, she was my step cousin. I along with my siblings, cousins, everyone from that side of the family, grew up knowing the truth. Except for her. 

Fast forward to 2008. I moved to NYC. My step aunt happened to also move to NYC a year or so after me. We had never been super close due to the geographic distance between our families but my parents encouraged me to text her and hang out due to being in the same city and also being so close in age. We instantly bonded. We had the same interest, the same sense of humor and rapidly became very good friends. Friends more than family. We hung out with each other weekly for the next 6 years. All along, I knew this deep, dark, horrible secret but I could never bring myself to tell her because I didn’t know what it would do to her.

In 2015, I left NYC and moved to Florida where she had grown up and where my step grandparents resided. We also were not super close but due to my extremely close friendship with my step aunt, they started inviting me over frequently. 

In January of this year, I was talking with my step aunt on the phone. We stayed close even though I had moved away and would text or chat often. I finally decided that I had had enough of the lies and that if no one else in the family was going to tell her what we all knew, that I was going to do it, because she was my friend. My parents and close family from that side all supported what I had done and even spoke to my step aunt to back up what I had told her with more detail. 

My step aunt on the other hand was enraged. She called me a liar and told me that what I did was beyond hurtful. My step grandfather also called me a liar and asked why I wanted to hurt the family so much.

Needless to say, I haven’t heard from my aunt or her parents since this happened. And I keep asking myself if I did the right thing.

When we first started dating she straightened it pretty much all the time, and her hair was straight when I met her, but after a few months she started straightening it less and less until finally she stopped all together. A few months ago I finally asked her about it and she told me that it damages her hair if she straightens it a lot so she only likes to do it on special occasions. This would be fine, except that she was straightening it ALL THE TIME at first, not just nice dates or parties or whatever, so I know it's total bs (I know it is damaging, I'm just saying it's bs that she cares because she clearly doesn't). Anyways, I played along and politely asked her when she was planning on straightening it again, to which she replied ""whenever you take me out on a date again"".

This is low. She knows I've been out of a job and haven't had the money to take her out very much, plus even when we were going on dates more frequently she hadn't done it in a while, and again she used to straighten it everyday anyway. I kept my cool and didn't call her out on it, but I reminded her that I can't afford to take her out, and it would be nice if she could just surprise me with it sometime. She apologized for her comment and said she could do that for me. A week went by, so I brought it up again and politely asked her when she planned on doing it. She said she thought I wanted it to be a surprise, which is fair, but I told her preferably within the month. She said she'd do it so long as I stopped ""harassing"" her about it, and I hardly call bringing it up twice in a week harassment but whatever, I respected her wishes and didn't bring it up again. Three months later, and she still hasn't done it, so I decide to ask her again. She apologizes and tells me she'll do it wednesday for movie night, and even brings the straightener to my house. Wednesday comes, and I ask her when she's going to do it, knowing that it takes a while. All day she just keeps saying she'll do it soon. Finally when it's like 7pm she snaps at me and accuses me of not loving her for who she is naturally, which is crazy, of course I do. She doesn't straighten her hair, we watch the movie in silence, she goes home, and texts me saying she needs some space. I haven't heard from her all day.

edit: you guys are right about rating her. I wouldn't normally say that, I was just illustrating that she's beautiful either way but more beautiful with it, but I get why the rating thing is shitty

Okay. I’m the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day.

1477,Not the A-hole,"Context: 

I host a weekly to every two weeks game of Pathfinder at my home with a group of people that I've known for roughly a month at this point. One of them is a smoker. At our first session, he went to pull out a cigarette and light up right at my table. It was the first inclination that he smoked. I understand he needs his nicotine and I told him I don't let people smoke in my house, but he was welcome to step out onto the back porch and be around in the big open backyard to smoke. He says ok and does so, no problem.

Fast forward a week and he says he's going to bathroom. He's in there for about eight minutes and has the fans on, but he did bring in a couple of bags of taco bell. Figured it just didn't agree with him. He comes out sans a jacket he normally wears because he's 'used to it'.  I walk into bathroom two hours later, it smells like smoke, but his jacket also reeks of it, so I gave benefit of the doubt.

Third session, I quietly mention that if anyone wants to smoke, they need to go outside. Everyone is cool. He walks into the bathroom, this time with his jacket on.  Everyone leaves and I go to use my bathroom only to see ash and a cigarette butt in my toilet.

I sent him a private message stating that if he wants to come into my house again, he is to hand over his pack of cigarettes to me upon entry and if he wants one I will provide it and escort him outside to smoke since he can't follow a basic rule.

Edit:  So people know the final result. Dude forwarded my message to him to the rest of the group.  Group pinged me back into the message telling him to grow up and he got upset. Long-story-short, we now have one less player.",56,197,0.97
1478,Not the A-hole,"My baby shower was on Sunday. I have 2 young kids and I am currently pregnant with twins. For the shower, I invited many of my friends and family for a relaxed potluck at my house. On the invitations, I wrote “feel free to bring your kids!” and said that activities and games will be provided. A lot of my friends have similar aged children so I thought it would be a fun event for everyone.

One of my friends that I invited is single and does not have any kids. However, she (34) showed up to my house with her dog in tow, a german shepherd. I was surprised but polite and said she could let her dog play in the backyard while she came inside the house for lunch.

She said she didn’t want him outside because she wanted to keep an eye on him. I said I’m sorry, there’s too many children/babies here and I don’t think it would be safe. She got annoyed at me for insinuating that her dog is “dangerous” (not my intention) and said that he’s her child and that they are “better behaved than most of the kids here”.  I said, “Come on, that dog is not your child, it’s an animal.”

At this point my husband came, and he could tell she was upsetting me. She kept on insisting that either she bring the dog in or she won’t come inside herself. Finally my husband pointed his finger and said to her, “Then get out of my damn house.” She started crying and left. Afterwards she wrote me a long message saying my husband and I humiliated her in front of her friends and made her feel bad for not having kids.

1480,Not the A-hole,"This has been an extremely emotional time for my family and I, and I need help in deciding if I was justified or not. 

My mother, who was 62, was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer. She told us in January 2019 during a family together. She said she planned on fighting it and was going to move to Seattle (from North Dakota) for more advanced care. Because our father died when we were teenagers, she was going to do this alone. I decided to move with her to help while my siblings didn't. I uprooted my normal life to help her. 

The last several months everything basically went downhill. She became more ill, and was getting worse and worse. I kept insisting my siblings to come out and see her as she was deteriorating.  Earlier this month, she almost died (blood pressure tanked, and she got a bad infection from the hospital). I again asked my siblings to visit. Only once did my oldest brother come to see her, the other four never saw her once between January and now). None of them had obligations other than a significant other, job, and house (no kids).

About a week ago, she was ready to die. Because Washington is a 'right to die' state, she wanted to end her suffering. I called my siblings and we all went onto video-chat with her. My mom was incoherent, in pain, and her overall health was near death. 

After the call, of them told me not to give the medication that would put her to sleep and stop her breathing. They said they wanted to be there. They said they could fly out the next day (roughly 36 hours). I **knew** my mom would not be able to endure her pain, I couldn't stand looking at her. She begged for her 'sleepy' pills. Eventually, I made the decision to assist her in take the medications. 

She said she loved all of us, and she was sorry she ""couldn't just wait"" and that it was ""her time to go"". 

When I told my siblings, they were enraged. They said I sabotaged them by giving the pills to my mom without them there and that I robbed all of them of her last moment. Now they told me since ""you like making the decisions, you figure out how to get mom back to North Dakota and plan her services.""

So, now I am stressed with that - on top of feeling guilty about ""robbing"" them.

1482,Asshole,"I (21 M) am currently on vacation at the beach with my parents, brother, and sister at our family’s condo. My girlfriend (20 F) came down on Sunday, and left today (Thursday). 

With it being my first summer of legal drinking age, I’ve been really excited to go out to all of the bars down at the beach. Knowing this, I warned my girlfriend in advance that I planned on going out over the weekend, and that I wanted to go out with my family and friends. Being that she is only 20, she unfortunately can’t join us. We have a small condo, and in order to fit everyone, I more or less had to “kick her out” for Thursday evening- Sunday. Additionally I personally found it a little rude to be off doing things while she would be stuck back at our condo. She was totally cool with this plan in the weeks leading up.

Today was the day she left and I wish it would have been a little smoother. It was clear that since we got back from going to the actual beach around 3 pm today that she was a little upset/ frustrated that she had to go. Totally understand a bit of frustration of not being of age/ not being able to stay, but it quickly escalated to a much bigger discussion. She indirectly asked me if she could stay 1 more night. This was a little frustrating for me as I told her well in advance what I wanted to do this weekend. She was totally fine with me going out tonight, but just wanted to hang out at the condo. To make it easier, let my try to break down some of the main argument points.

I didn’t want her to stay because:
-I wanted my own space for a couple days to go out with my friends.
-I felt rude leaving her back by herself, even though she was okay with staying back.
-There was nowhere for her to sleep, other than the couch. She claimed she didn’t mind, but still it felt rude for me. 

She wanted to stay because: 
-She really enjoyed the change of environment being at the beach and liked being away from home/ work. 
-Stated that her parents and work have been stressing her out and down at the beach was a nice change.

Several times she stated that she didn’t care that I was going out, but rather that she didn’t understand why she couldn’t stay. It’s not that I don’t want to be with here, but sometimes I think it’s healthy to spend some time apart to do our own thing.

So, what do you guys think, AITA?.

EDIT: While this post is a only a couple hours old, I just wanted to say thank you to both those who thought I was the asshole, and those that didn’t. I didn’t make this post for karma or to prove my point. I seriously wanted feedback on how I reacted and what I could have done better even though I didn’t initially state that.

1488,Asshole,"(throwaway because my SO frequents this subreddit)

My SO's family is rich, fly their entire 6 person family out to Cancun for a month without blinking an eye rich (I did not go btw). I grew up very, very poor from another country. I remember times when I didn't have shoes. Times when I had to rummage through rich people's trash in order to find food. Things are different now of course and through goodluck and hard work my parents they got us out of poverty and I now live in the U.S., I have a good degree and I am out of that situation and doing OK for myself. Nevertheless, I carry that experience with me and it has given me a perspective that I can't easily shake.

So when I interact with my SO family, I am often shocked by the amount of money that they spend. Its like they live on a different planet from the rest of the world. New cars. All the children have houses bought and paid for. All their degrees to prestigious universities paid for. The works. I want to emphasize that despite their wealth, these are good people. They believe in paying their fair share of taxes and they are philanthropic in nature. Honestly, good people- just a family that really lack perspective IMO. Anyway, here's the AITA situation:

The patriarch of the family, despite being worth tens and tens of millions of dollars and owning properties across the country has worked in public education as a math teacher for over 30 years. He retired last year and the narrative he spins is that despite being wealthy, he saw his career as an act of public service and literally referred to the money he made from teaching as ""play money"". This idea instantly turned in my stomach. I think that what he actually did was take a good job away from someone who could have used the money to raise a family and that his motivations were selfish. I told my SO how I feel and straight up chastised me for crapping on their good intentions.

I admit that I am sour, but am AITA for feeling this way?

A bit of backstory: A few months before my graduation, my entire friend group ghosted me. The reasoning for this (I can only assume) is because of a breakup I had with another member of the group. (This was mutual, we both agreed it was for the best if we called the thing off) After this most the group stopped talking to me, and I was hung out to dry for the last four ish months of my time in high school to hang as a loner. 

Fast forward to now, I am happier than I have ever been, with better friends at the school I am soon to be moving to across my state. I leave in three weeks if that makes a difference. 

A few of the girls from the group have recently reached out to me to ask how I have been, and saying the want to catch up. I really have no desire, because as I mentioned I am much happier where I am now.

1491,Not the A-hole,"We live at the beach so every summer we're jam-packed with tourists. Day before yesterday I was off from work so I decided to drive uptown and go have lunch on one of the waterfront restaurants out on the deck, have some local seafood and read my book. It was mostly tourists eating at that time because it was a weekday and midday, everyone was at work. There was this family that was acting like they'd never been in public before, let alone at the beach. I get it, not everyone lives at the beach, some people have actually never seen the beach before. And our beach is really beautiful; clean white sand, Banker ponies, nature reserves, the lighthouse in the distance. I'm very fortunate to have been born and raised here. But ask any local, we're sick to death of rude-ass tourists.

&#x200B;

So I'm at the restaurant and this table is just letting loose, acting a fool, letting their kids run around all wild. At one point they were throwing bread rolls and one of them hit me in the side of the head. The kids were throwing things into the water where living creatures like the seafood they were eating, our biggest income being fisheries and wildlife.

&#x200B;

Anyway, the outdoor seating of the restaurant is on a deck that is over the water and it has amazing views. They were taking photos of the view and started posing for them. To be frank they were getting all up in my bubble, and at one point I had a stranger practically leaning over my meal. They started yelling at each other about getting a group shot. By this point I had taken my food and moved my stuff to a table further down. They get lined up against the dock with the view in the background. At first they tried a selfie-stick but it didn't reach far enough to get them all in. Then they tried putting the camera on their table but it was too low, only got their lower bodies.

&#x200B;

""Oh, hey, her! Her at the table! Hey, lady, would you come over here and hold the camera, take a photo of us?"" I realized they were talking to me so I looked up and shook my head, pointed ta my food. They stared pleading, telling me all about how they're on vacation, first time at the beach for the little kids, they just wanted a nice group shot, could I come and help them. I told them no, that if I left my table the 'gulls would land and eat my food (not a lie, our birds are cocky little assholes but they're locals too). I motioned for my waitress because I just wanted to leave, I was sick of their misbehavior. They start hollering at me to just ""take the damn photo"". I didn't think they deserved my help after their behavior. I paid and left. The younger (drunk) adults were cussing me and trashing me. When I told my fiancé he said that I should have just taken the photo for them since I should be used to tourists and just ignored their behavior. He said I was no better when we went to New Orleans and got wasted, but that was Mardi Gras.

Was I an asshole?

ETA: I'm beginning to agree with the minority that ESH. I could have taken the photo but I judged the family based on their behavior. It wouldn't have done me any harm to take the photo. I could have gotten the waitress to take the photo or have her kick them out. But, based on their behavior, I refuse to accept that I'm the only asshole here. My past behavior has no factor in this. Mardi Gras is a totally different hat than our little town. We're primarily fisheries and wildlife, military, school system, and medical. The primary age of locals is 55 and above.",23,38,0.93

Me: What kind of phone did you get?

Her: I don't know, the iphone something. Not the newest one.

Me: How much did it cost?

Her: It's only $20 per month?

Me: How much did the phone cost?

Her: 6-something.

I was stunned that she would spend over $600 without taking to me about it first as I would never even spend more than $100 without discussing it with her. The new phone got delivered, and it's an iPhone XR with a retail price of $750. I told her how mad I was about the spending, and she said it cost $680 since she's a Verizon customer.

She has no need for a phone that costs this much, and my own phone -- which I use every day for work -- was only $150. I thought she would spend something similar, and I just can't believe she dropped something like $700 ON A PHONE.

I came out as transgender (ftm) back in January. I also had to move back in with my parents recently while I was taking care of some medical debt from late last year. As a result, I didnt come out to them as I knew it would be a nuclear fallout.

I have been seeing a therapist, and we agreed that I can start asking my doctor about hormones, meaning I had to come out to my parents. I did, and I was kicked out.

I say yes, but I'm weary of what shes trying to achieve with family counseling. As of now, we have both met individually with the counselor, with an appointment scheduled next week.

We finally said enough is enough the other night. We ordered roughly this kind of order:

1499,Not the A-hole,"So I’ve been best friends with this guy for about 7/8 years and out of no where he has gained very extreme religious views. Now I knew he had been brought up in a Christian household but he never tried to force his religion on to anyone and everyone could do what they wanted and so on and this time last year he was really happy to go to university where he could play music everyday and he didn’t talk to his dad because he thought he was mental.
    
Now to present day, he has dropped out of university, he now talks to his dad (glad he’s sorted things with him) but he seems to have been radicalised by him. Before he dropped out university I noticed he started reading biblical apocalyptic books which linked Bible stories/verses to the end of the world and he started trying to predict himself when the world would end and that was just the start. 

He said he started having dreams that god spoke to him and was telling him to spread the message of god, so he started posting on Facebook and a lot of our friends started worrying about him and eventually have start to not bother speaking to him. I have tried to listen and to understand his views because he used to talk about what he believes in when we did our weekly shop, but now he’s back home, he seems to be getting a lot worse, I spoke to my university about it because if a Muslim did the same stuff that he did they’d be getting called terrorists. 

He’s become very homophobic and started putting a lot of homophobic posts on Facebook and it’s very upsetting considering a lot of his friends are from the LGBTQ+ community. In the end we have had a row over one of his Facebook posts and it became very scary to me because it wasn’t my friend anymore.

Today I made a claim on their insurance, her friend's Dad is now  tripping out his rates are gonna go up, my daughters friends is a mess cause her parents may not let her drive because now they cant afford insurance. I feel like 3 weeks of being dismissed was plenty of time to wait? I still feel like the a$$hole because this sucks for my daughter feeling in the middle and her girlfriend is gonna lose out because her parents dismissed me. (Even worse they could have just cut a check or put it on a credit card for as little damage and this would all be over. 

Oh the guy didnt realize I actually had all their insruance info to make a claim so I think he was gonna put me off until I gave up.

Edit: wow thanks all I feel awful only cause it was such a little thing and itll potentially harm my daughters friendship. BUT guess who suddenly called me...... ya 3 weeks of me doing all the chasing and NOW he wants to talk. He told me point blank when we spoke his life was busy and he was going on vacation and couldnt deal with it BUT now.... now he wants to talk.",59,389,0.95

1506,Not the A-hole,"A friend and wife visited for a weekend. They come into town on a Friday with their two dogs, I insisted they bring the dogs so they didn't have to board. I have plenty of room to accommodate. Dogs were friendly, however would be bark/whine if left alone.

Saturday morning: my friend is already awake, hanging out on the couch. Make breakfast together for everyone. Everything is great.

Hang out all day, go hiking, midafternoon friend's wife gets a headache. Get her coffee and snacks and she rests in their room for hours. I prepare dinner by myself. We all eat and have good conversation. My wife attempts to put our 2 y/o to bed. Around this time we stable our dogs. Ask my friend to come with me in the dark to put them in the barn. I assumed his wife would want to stay as she had the headache earlier and their dogs would bark/whine if we left them alone. Come back to the house, ask friend if he wants to eat more, get a snack together for everyone.

Next morning friend wants to treat us for breakfast. Breakfast place has a special monkey bread on Sundays: cinnamon or Nutella. Ask friend which he would like and order that. He and I eat the majority, his wife didn't touch it. Head back home, they get their things together and head home. Seemingly great weekend.

Monday afternoon: I am going to be near him next weekend for work. Text him to get dinner Friday night and hang out Saturday morning. He replies he is going to check with wife.

Monday evening: Friend texts me wants to chat. Call him, I can tell something is wrong, his tone is somber. Friend goes on to ask if I purposefully was excluding his wife from things during the weekend. I am shocked, flabbergasted, and offended as I spent quite a bit of time and energy preparing for and taking care of their needs while they were with my family. I assure him that I was not excluding her. He cites the three examples narrated above: the trip to the barn, the late-night snack, and the Nutella monkey bread. He goes on to say that he had observed my behavior and wanted to be assured that I not exclude his wife. I defend myself and apologize repeatedly, no change is had in his demeanor. At this point I assume his wife is directing him to have this conversation with me. I am not buying that he observed this and with no pressure from her initiated the phone call. He goes on to state that he naturally includes everyone, and would not have acted like I did. Conversation goes on for longer then needed and is of course uncomfortable at the close. He does thank me for the weekend and assures me his wife really enjoyed her time with my wife. Also shares that he and his wife cannot get dinner on Friday or hangout Saturday morning. We haven't spoken since then and I honestly don't know if I want to.

In my mind if he had perceived I was excluding her, he should have made an attempt to make me aware or he himself could have included her by sharing the invitation.",38,116,0.94
1507,Not the A-hole,"Had an experience last night and wondering if I'm the asshole.

My wife had a particularly trying day with our three year old yesterday (she has dubbed him a ""threenager"", sweet kid but he's definitely in the stage of pushing boundaries with mom and dad). When I got home from work I could tell she had had it, so I offered to take the boy out with me to run a few errands. We get to the small-ish local grocery store we frequent and start to shop. As we walk through the store, my son and I are playing and laughing and talking about items on the shelves as we pass them. We're not shouting but he is laughing plenty and it never really even occurred to me that we might be making too much noise. As the store is fairly small/does not have high ceilings and was not overly busy, you could probably hear us carrying on from the next aisle over or so. 

He's in a good mood and we're just enjoying some time together, he's getting a few compliments from kind strangers on how cute he is and how well he speaks, all is good. Then we round a corner and a woman in her 40s or so approaches me and basically scolds me for being inconsiderate and allowing my child to make so much noise in a public space. I'm a bit taken aback, but realize that we were probably being quite a bit louder than the average shopper and that most people in the store could probably hear us from time to time as we walked past. I told her we would try to keep it down and walked on past her. My son and I made a game of whispering to each other for the last few minutes we spent in the store, though he was still laughing and giggling quite loudly.

So, was it bad grocery store etiquette to play with my kid in the store? Had he been upset/crying/throwing a tantrum I would have tried to calm him and keep the noise down, of course, but it never occurred to me that our volume was a problem otherwise. I know that some people run errands specifically to get away from their kids or other stressors for a moment and wasn't thinking we were being inconsiderate by making noise until this woman said something. AITA for not keeping our volume down?",49,53,0.9

1510,No A-holes here,"I'm 22F and live on my own. About seven months ago I went to Europe and my dad kept calling me even though I tried to tell him not to because of the rates. I was only gone for a week. He called me a few weeks after I got back and said that the phone bill cost a lot more than usual due to data usage. I apologized and offered to pay him back for the extra part. He said he didn't want me to pay him back and that he was getting an unlimited data plan so it wouldn't be an issue anymore. Ok, great I thought. Fast forward to now. A few weeks ago I moved into a new place. They said they had wifi before my roommate and I moved in but we found out that that was only for the amenities, so we went a week without wifi. I used a ton of data on my phone because I thought that my dad had the unlimited wifi plan. Also please note that I did tell him I was going to get my own phone plan and everything when I was done with college but he insisted I stay on his. Now the bill was almost an extra $200, and I would offer to make up for it by paying him back, but he also said he was getting the unlimited data plan seven months ago, so I thought that the data was unlimited.

1512,Not the A-hole,"Posting on mobile, so apologies for formatting.

I proposed to my GF (let's say Gwen) just over a year ago, and for some unknown reason she said yes. We told friends and family, and our friend of 12 years was asked to be the bridesmaid. She lives 200 miles away, so we don't get to see her and her bf often. We'll call her Mary, and him John.

Over the course of this year, she has been under a lot of stress, and we have been as supportive as we can. Gwen volunteers as a counsellor, and has been giving semi-professional advice as best she can without violating her job ethics. This included her spending an hour listening to Mary venting about the fact her life plans weren't happening quickly enough (and that it was John's fault), when she came to visit over Christmas - just hours after Gwen got word that her aunt had passed away. ""I'm sorry, you don't need that right now"" - didn't stop you doing it anyway, did it?

Since then, work stress has been piling up, with her slowly getting more and more angry. Things came to a head about a month ago, with Gwen and John both struggling to get her to consider therapy. She does now have an assessment booked, but John decided to withdraw from the mortgage they were arranging, and asked for a break in their relationship, as dealing with her anger was leaving him drained and withdrawn. In conversations over the phone with each of them, she seems unable to see that she has caused the rift between them, and is alternating between venting at Gwen and biting her head off when we suggest that she just needs to focus on getting herself back into a calmer headspace. Meanwhile, John is happier, apologetic to us that we have to deal with her venting, and considering making the break permanent. 

The kicker is, when he told us that, he said that he would like to do it face to face, but was ""scared of what would happen to me"". As we have already heard horror stories of her throwing a book at him, and when he asked if she saw anything wrong with that, she said ""No"", we are a bit perturbed about allowing her to take part in our big day, when we would feel like we were walking on eggshells, as they are/were engaged, so she would even more emotional than usual.

We are on John's side with this, but we hope that with time and therapy, Mary can find stability again, but until such a time we need to focus on getting everything ready for the wedding, and we can't gamble on her being ready in three months.

Would we be the assholes for uninviting both of them from the wedding? (John has offered to not go so that it seems more 'fair')",19,27,0.86
1513,Not the A-hole,"I am a high school student(17M) who is obsessed with physics. I have been learning it from a very young age and the fact that my dad is an electrical engineer has really helped. Now, a lot of public schools where I come from don't have good teachers, and I have been a decent teacher for anyone who has asked for my help. 

When I finished my middle school in a public school and got a free ride to a more expensive private school, a bunch of guys asked me to help them in physics if I ever get the time. So, during my 9th grade, I decided to make a youtube channel to help them. It was initially private but a lot of guys liked it and I uploaded hour long lectures for a month or so. Back in 11th grade, I felt like the portion I had to cover was way too vast and I got a girl I knew from class(you can call her becky) to help out. 

I obviously paid her a couple of dollars for every video she did and allowed her to plug in her instagram. Before long, it sort of started becoming our youtube channel. I was genuinely fine with this.

The problem started when she made these sexual jokes. About being naked if they got the video to 200 likes, and gave a garbage explanation about waves by  moaning sexually.

Now, everyone I knew did not understand whatever she explained at all, and a large number of new viewers were just watching it to see her and not because it actually helped them. I confirmed this by asking a few people if they understood what she was trying to explain, but they just told me that it was an attractive girl who was having fun.

1514,Not the A-hole,"So  i turned 22 last week and hosted a house party.  My  parents promised me they'd stay at my uncles overnight to not 'intervene  but my sister, who's recently 17, told them she refuses to stay  with them and wanted to 'party too'. I felt bad for her, so i told her she could invite a few of her friends as well. I have all my friends there. Some +1's. Some of  my friends girlfriends. 

Now,  it's my 22nd. So as much as i want to keep the house intact, i also want to get smashed. There's around  100 people at this party as well. So i'm constantly going back and  forth, taking shots with some people, playing beer pong with others,  chatting with others. Trying to be a good host. A few hours into the  night (It's 1am now) and i'm absolutely wasted. I needed to ask  my sister to bring out the birthday cake before everyone passes out or  leaves. I ask her friends, they thought she went to bed. I ask around  since most people knew her, and they told me shes upstairs. I head  upstairs, open her bedroom door and see her on top of Patrick (who's 22)  I slam the door immediately and my stomach drops. Not sure if it was  the alcohol but i start tearing up. I head into my room,  lock the door, and call my dad.  somehow  manage to tell him what happened through my stuttering. He loses it and rushes home.

At  this point i've been in my room for 15 minutes. I'm throwing up and  feel like shit. I just feel betrayed man. Like that's my little sister,  and one of my friends who's known me and her for a decade. What the  fuck. I hear my parents arrive and everyone leaves, i don't get to see  my friend. My parents go to talk to my sister, who hasn't left her room i beleive.  After around 10 minutes they leave and slam her door. Then they come in  and apologize on her behalf, told me that she's so so so sorry, that  she's grounded for a month and all that. Didn't fix anything, i feel  betrayed.

The next day we don't say  anything to each other. I haven't got the balls to contact my friend. One of my other friends, who i've also known for around a decade messages me and tells me he heard what happened. I  barely saw him that night, so i asked him how this happened. He said  that they were flirting and messing around all night. Patrick slapped  her on the ass a couple times and she giggled. And he caught her sitting on Patricks lap showing him stuff on her phone. Then they disappeared. He told me he's sorry for not intervening or anything. I  told him it's not his fault. 

It's  been 4 days now and my sister has said near nothing to me. I messaged  Patrick a couple days ago and he left me on seen. My sister feels  distant. Patrick feels distant completely and  hasn't replied. My parents have been furious at my sister and  barely talking to her. She barely eats. I barely eat. It's a nightmare. I  feel like this whole situation would've been less painful if i just kept it to myself.

1515,Not the A-hole,"**EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone to all of your responses. I feel validated that I am not being unreasonable here. I love my husband and I have no intention of destroying our marriage over this, but I'm going to keep trying to persuade him to see my point of view. There has to be a compromise we can make. A lot of you gave great responses that have given me the words to express more accurately to him how I feel, so thank you for that. Hopefully, we can find a solution.**

Throwaway, for obvious reasons. Apologies in advance for the length.

I am currently 28 weeks pregnant with mine and my husband's first child, a baby boy. We've been together for eight years now and married for three, and things are going really great. I'm super excited to be starting a family with this guy and I know he's going to be a great dad.

We've hit a bit of a roadblock, though. When I first found out I was pregnant, I started thinking a lot about family and legacies and the things you leave behind when you're gone. My husband is lucky enough to be from a big, big family - he's one of seven kids and has over a hundred first cousins. Their reunions are loud and chaotic and full of love. Growing up, he was constantly surrounded by people who adored him - and even though he admits that it was too much at times, I know he wouldn't have had it any other way.

I had a different experience growing up. My mom passed away suddenly when I was seven and I never really had an extended family, so it was mostly just my dad and me. We stuck together as a team and made it through some really tough times, with him often working multiple jobs just to keep us afloat. At one point, I was living with a friend of my mom's while he slept outside in his truck each night, which I only discovered years later. But we managed to get through it and we're both in a much better place now. My dad loves my husband and he's really excited to become a grandpa for the first time.

Last week, I asked my husband how he would feel about giving our son my surname. My husband has eighteen nieces and nephews, so his family name is pretty secure in terms of continuation - but if I died tomorrow, my family name would end with me. I'm an only child and so were both of my parents, which means I don't have any other family to keep it going.

My husband is less than thrilled, as you can imagine. He knows I'm pretty non-traditional when it comes to stuff like this (I kept my maiden name when we got married, much to the chagrin of his amazing but very traditional family), but I think this might be a step too far for him. I suggested a double-barreled surname but he said that double-barreled surnames are ""bougie"" and he doesn't want our son to be bullied for it. I said maybe we could use his surname (or an approximation of it) as a middle name for our son, but he said that we should use mine as a middle name instead.

I don't want to argue with him but I really feel very strongly about this. The more we fight about it, the stronger my resolve becomes; I want our son to carry on my family name. I can't seem to communicate to my husband just how much this matters to me. Last night, he told me I was being an asshole and left our bed to go and sleep on the couch.

I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, but maybe I am? AITA?",888,1481,0.93

She is planning to apply to high end schools, and she wrote about how she was judged and laughed at by her parents for aspiring to be an engineer but they gradually understood her and encouraged her to live her dreams after she destroyed their sexist notions.

Now....my parents have always encouraged my sister. They have spent an insane amount of money to send her to  a private school and I work part time just so that I can contribute. To just undermine everything they have done as parents felt bad to me.

For jokes, they also made up stories about how one of the guys probably got a good final grade because he blew the teacher. Anyway they're not being funny despite what they think, only immature.

1522,Not the A-hole,"So today I went for a hike in the New Forest, lovely please in Hampshire England, the route is about 10 miles and half way is a town called Lyndhurst. 

So because I’m halfway I go to a pub that has a nice beer garden and find a spot in the shade. I drink Guinness and smoke so when I choose a table I sit away from people eating, sit away from people with kids etc. 

Because it’s so hot (for England) the beer garden is almost empty, sit down start to read and grabbing my cigs, cos I’m a dirty smoker. 

Before I finish my first pint a family comes in, Karen, Dad and two kids and they sit right next to me. Shrug continue reading and finishing the pint. 

I get up go get the second pint to enjoy before I finish my hike, come back book out, pint ready and light a cig. 

Karen comes bustling over to tell me not to smoke near her kids as it is a disgusting habit. I say you chose to sit on the table next to me and saw me smoking so if you don’t like it find another table

Karen says she is at the best table for her kids huh? and I should move away. I say you saw me here sat next to me now go away and let me read in peace. 

So as I’m a Contrary B’Stard I pretty much chain smoked while drinking my pint and reading while Karen glared daggers at me. When I finished my pint Karen said “Good riddance A**hole”

I responded “Go F**k yourself Karen” and left to continue my hike. (She obviously had NO idea why I called her Karen)

I get that smoking is a bad habit and it smells and you are damaging your health but AITA for standing my ground

Edit: cos of mobile and AITA doesn’t seem to like rude words. There was a separate NO SMOKING section I was in the beer garden and the pub was very empty

I recently drove twenty hours round trip on a the spur of the moment to say goodbye to a dying family member. The whole event was beyond reckoning and so sad. I'd never seen someone die before and it was traumatic and awful but it was important to be around my family and get the chance to say goodbye. 

When I got home I really didn't want to be alone and I didn't want to just sit there thinking about it. My Fiance works remotely full time from his computer and I asked if he could push back work this morning so I could stay with him overnight and take it easy the next morning. Which he did reluctantly, we had a good morning and then I had some scheduled work to do for a few hours. I asked if I could come back and sit around while he worked and then afterward we could get dinner and watch a movie. 

He told me that Thursdays were DnD nights, he plays with his friends on the computer almost every Thursday and some other odd days during the week. I've asked him if he would skip it a few times before and it was always an ordeal with him telling me that they can't do it without him and he feels bad. However, he has skipped it a few times when we have plans or vacation. I thought surely he would understand this time, and I didn't want to be alone in my big house.

But he's been acting like I'm being unreasonable to even ask, he says he feels like he's being a bad friend to his DnD group his reasoning being ""I'm a big political figure in this campaign and everyone would have to cancel.""

I've always thought it was to an extent that was a bit ridiculous - they mock anyone who goes to university or doesn't work a job in the trades industry. I think they believe they're anti-snob, but they've taken it to the extreme. I'm an an engineer, so they go back and forth between asking me for help with mathematical things they need to figure out on their projects, and mocking me for being ""soft"" and saying my sons aren't going to grow up to be real men because I'm not teaching them the right things. AKA my five year old has never used power tools. Whatever.

&#x200B;

Anyways, onto the actual situation. Yesterday, her husband posted a picture of their three year old holding an electrical socket. It was attached to all of the wiring but not yet screwed into the wall - they were teaching him how to change it/install a new socket. A three year old. Holding a live/powered electrical socket. There were a couple of comments saying things like ""hope he doesn't try to play with electrical outlets now"" (Response: ""He's too smart for that!"") and pointing out that it wasn't even the right kind of outlet/up to code. But most of the responses were their equally idiotic friends patting them on the back for raising their kid right and to use his hands and get it done, blah blah blah.

I know if I say anything, they're just going to get offended, make fun of me, and then stop talking to me for a while. But I'm really worried for my nephew. This just seems so dangerous, and I'm tempted to call CPS because I think they need a wake up call about endangering their kids. (They frequently have the kids around heavy duty machinery and are teaching them to use drills, the ride-on mower, saws, etc.) I don't want to wait until one of the kids is electrocuted or loses a finger or something to act. But...maybe this stuff can be done safely? I admittedly don't know a ton about it. Mainly I'm wondering - WIBTA if I called CPS without talking to them about this first?

1526,Not the A-hole,"For context, I'm 15 years old and she's 29 years old, with a daughter almost 1 year old, who I will call S1. I have another sister, older than her by 1 year, who also has a daughter (this one only around 2 weeks old). This happened an hour ago.

3 months ago, S1 announced she got pregnant yet again, around when S2 was 7 months pregnant. My mom and I travelled to visit S2 in Dubai as she was due in July. Two weeks ago, she gave birth. Right after she gave birth, S1 announced she'd be visiting us in Dubai for a while. I was overjoyed, as I love both her and her daughter. They also said they would rent another room in the apartment we were staying in.

So she visits, and everything went downhill from there. This all started a week ago. I was asleep on the couch at around 9 AM as my mom was asleep in the only other bed here (it's a sofa bed, so it was pretty comfortable). Suddenly, S1 barges in with her daughter and wakes me up, then makes me hold her and starts using her phone. Despite being irritated at being woken up so suddenly, I start playing with her daughter. A few minutes later I ask what she's doing on her phone out of curiosity, and she says ""working"". She owns an online business selling eco-friendly mom products, so I shrugged and kept playing with her. I later found out she was doing something on Facebook.

A few days later, I basically felt like the family mule. I would be browsing reddit, and S1 would say ""Dan, go bring me a can of 7-UP"" or ""Dan, go to the other room and get me some food"" while someone else watches her daughter. In addition to this, I was made to do every garbage-related duty in the house, with no help from anyone else (keep in mind this includes two babies' worth of dirty diapers).

So, today, she walked in with her daughter, and, after waking me up, immediately started blasting Baby Shark for her daughter to watch, waking up S2's daughter and, consequently, everyone else. I then ended up changing the garbage bags, bringing her 7-UP, washing the dishes, clearing the table for lunch, etc. I hadn't slept well at all that night, which may have contributed to my overreaction tonight, but whatever.

So, an hour ago she told me to bring her some cereal. I go up, and as I'm browsing reddit waiting for her to get ready to sleep she says ""Dan, stop browsing reddit. I keep telling you to limit your screen-time. You keep playing video games when I'm around!"". I immediately responded ""You keep making me do everything around the house. You keep making me watch your daughter. You make me do everything for you to just sit and browse Facebook and you have the audacity to tell me to stop using my phone?! You know why I play video games around you? It's so that I have an excuse not to watch your goddamn baby anymore.""

She didn't say anything after that. AITA? Should I apologize to her? I feel I may have gone too far, as she is 3 months pregnant.",326,2842,0.96

1528,Asshole,"So, 4 months ago I was looking for some ""no strings attatched"" on tinder, found someone, sex was amazing so we continued to meet up. I started suspecting something fishy around the 2 months mark but Ive only just found out he actually has a wife and kids.

His side of the story is that they are very indifferent to each other, that the love is gone and they would divorce if not for the kids (apparently the divorce of his parents really fucked him up and he doesnt want his kids to go through it + he is afraid he wouldnt be able to see them much if she got them). He claims he resigned himself to being with her till they grow up and that it's the first time he cheated (which I doubt).

So far I havent decided yet if I will continue our deal. On one hand hell cheat more anyway and I dont even know his wife to feel bad for her. I mean, he sometimes spent whole weekends with me and she didnt even call? Thats odd. Their marriage seems dead. But on the other, I would knowingly be a part of an affair. Which, doesnt seem like a good move.

Though the sex is mindblowing. So. SO. Mindblowing.

1529,No A-holes here,"So, 

I was flying yesterday and I was sitting next to a lady and her husband (It was 3 seats with me next to the aisle, the lady and then her husband next to the window). I make polite conversation with the lady and eventually she asks me what I do for a living. I ask her the same and from what I hear she says ""Cosmetology"". I smile and as some joke/small talk I ask her if she has any beauty tips for men. Turns out, she actually said ""Cosmology"" and I misheard. She seemed insulted by my question and completely ignored my apology. Her husband overheard the conversation and went into a long diatribe about how this is the type of abuse that female scientists have to deal with and he implied that I was some kind of sexist. Frankly the entire ordeal was incredibly embarrassing and judging by the reaction on the other passenger's faces (mainly just the man sitting across the aisle from me), it seemed like they thought I was some kind of sexist too. After that we didn't talk for the rest of the flight. 

AITA for mishearing it? Wtf do I do in this situation?",52,33,0.85
1530,Not the A-hole,"I truly don't know if I'm right here, so I guess I'll come here for advice. I (17f) recently got my first job at a retail store about 10 minutes away from my house. I currently do not have my license, but hopefully in a few months I can change that. Beforehand, my mother encouraged me to apply for jobs, saying she would be happy to drive me to it as long as it was close. So I applied and got a job for $10/hr. I usually work 4 days a week currently and take the bus to and back for half of my shifts while my mother takes me on weekends. Recently though my mother has started demanding I pay her $25 a week for gas. I realized that would be $100 of my paycheck gone each month, which would be 1/4th of what I get paid a month. Now, I would be completely willing to pay her back in some money since she does drive me, but $25 a week for gas for a 10 minute drive seems kind of insane to me. So I ended up calculating it and a rough estimate of what I owe her would be about $20 a month, but honestly I would be willing to double it to $40.

When I went to my mom with this she flipped out at me, now also claiming I need to pay for ""maintenance"" of her car. This was never agreed upon beforehand, and I feel almost I'm being extorted. She's threatened to stop driving me and telling me I would have to quit my job if I don't pay the $100 fee. I obviously don't want that, but am I just being a spoiled teenager for being hanged up on this? Am I just being stingy for no reason?

Edit: I first want to say thank you for all for your judgement and advice. Most of the judgement was NTA, but I also really appreciate the few YTA comments and your perspectives as well. After making this post and reading through the comments I decided to call my older sister and tell her what's been going on. She agreed that $100 for gas was too much and talked to my mom for me as I felt I couldn't really hold a conversation with her about the subject. According to my sister my mom pretty much immediately backed down for the $100 figure and ended up agreeing on $50 a month. This I could get behind more easily, since it was closer to the actual price of gas per month plus a fee for taking the time to drive me. $50 is still a considerable chunk but I can definitely pay for that instead of losing a 1/4th of my paycheck each month.",60,70,0.94
1531,Asshole,"Throwaway because I don’t want this on my account. My girlfriend has very painful period cramps, and she’s had them since she got her period. The doctors were even sure she had endomentrosial because they said it wasn’t normal to experience that much pain, but it turns out she doesn’t have anything like that, just really painful cramps. Well, it was her birthday in the beginning of the summer and I’d seen a bunch of ads online for products that can help with that and I’ve always wanted to give her something that could help with her horrible cramps. So I bought a couple of products, for example I bought some kind of warmth compress you can wear under your shirt to alleviate the pain, and since she’s obsessed with oils and lotions I also bought some essential oils that are supposed to help and shit. Well, it looked so empty with just those so I ended up making a basket and added some pads and tampons as well as a menstrual cup because she’s mentioned she wanted to try it. When she got it she was a bit confused at first, but then she said she appreciates me helping. Well, now it’s two almost three months later and her friend recently had a birthday. We’re sitting and talking and her friends start talking about the presents that her friend got, as to which my girlfriend replies something like “That’s so romantic, on my birthday *name* gave me pads”. They started laughing and her friend said “that’s awful”. I’ve been hearing a lot about it ever since, they’re saying that next year I could get her toilet seat covers.

1534,Not the A-hole,"I hope the username gives it away but I'm using a throwaway to post this since my husband knows about my main reddit account and as far as I know doesn't know about this sub. 

For some background, my husband is a golfing fanatic. I appreciate that it's his thing and I encourage him to play whenever he wants. He was on our university's golf team and played pro for about a year but it's never been his main job. I have no interest in it whatsoever but he's always wanted me to learn to play so we can share it together. I finally said ok to going out with him yesterday. I'm a SAHM to a 1 year old so it took some doing to find a sitter and it was mom's group day so I already felt like I was giving up a lot. 

We got out there and I felt like he was being such a jerk. He critiqued literally everything I did from where I stepped on certain parts of the grass to where I parked the cart to how I was holding my wrists. It was also so hot and he was drinking IPA beer and even the smell of it was making me nauseous. Maybe between the fourth and fifth hole I tried to politely tell him ""I am out here for you and I'm really trying to take all this in, but this is very new to me and I feel very overwhelmed. Can you allow me to try and figure out some things for myself before critiquing everything I do?"" He said that was fair enough.  

As I stepped out to hit the ball I put the t in the ground and he said ""if you aren't going to let me help you, at least you can shake your ass for me."" I was so livid I slammed the club on the ground and took off my glove and threw it in his direction. I just stormed off in the direction I thought the parking lot was. He was yelling something at me like I just can't walk wherever I want. I looked back at him and flipped him off and told him to leave me the fuck alone.  

Well I guess he was right because as I was walking across the grass a guy in a cart came up and said he was the course guide and for my safety I couldn't just go wherever I wanted. I got in the cart with him and started crying and explained to him what had happened and he made a joke like ""your husband has been golfing for that long and he thought it was a good idea to be his wife's instructor?"" That made me laugh and lightened the mood a bit. But when I saw my husband was back at the start already I just got mad again. I didn't speak to him on the way home, I didn't speak to him at home, I didn't eat the dinner he made me and I slept in our spare bedroom. I was just that mad at him. 

He left early for work this morning and maybe some sleep has given me clarity that maybe I overreacted a bit. Was I the asshole yesterday?",111,217,0.93

1536,Not the A-hole,"So I recently graduated high school, and I’m taking fall semester off so I can save up enough money to start in the spring. My parents are 100% against this and have been calling me lazy and irresponsible on the daily, taking every opportunity they have to pry into my personal life. They still take my phone every night to read my messages (I’m 19) and make me ask for permission to leave the house, but also expect me to work full time and support myself. On top of all that, they still try to pick and choose my friends for me, telling me who I can and can’t talk to, and forcing me to tell them everything I do with the people I can hang out with.

Overall I feel like they have repeatedly violated my privacy and manipulated me and I’m ready to move out and separate myself from it. I’ve already talked to
Some friends renting a house and they have space for me. I brought it up to my parents and they said moving out now is foolish and irresponsible, and that I should be more appreciative of them letting me live at home. Plus, once I move out they will never let me move in again and drop all support, so I’ll be completely on my own. They also said that if I moved out I would be a bad example for my two siblings and that they wouldn’t look up to me anymore. (This is the main reason I haven’t moved out yet, I love them to death and I don’t want to be looked at as a rebel and bad example.)

1537,Asshole,"I work in a professional, close-knit office, and we have a new hire. She's practically just out of college and seems to be very young for her age generally. Beyond needing to be trained on normal professional etiquette like answering the phone properly, I've noticed on a number of occasions she has worn shirts that expose her stomach (about 1"") or not worn a bra (she's small enough that it isn't necessary but skin color/nips through her shirt made it noticeable). I'm also not the only one who noticed (someone mentioned it to me separately). To be clear, she is being trained for a professional career that involves interaction with the public.

We aren't a formal office - I wear jeans and sneakers with a nicer shirt most days (though I wear business casual for external meetings). Her direct supervisor who I'm very close to is pretty oblivious to these sort of things but also knows attire needs to be appropriate to the situation. I know for a fact she wouldn't be fired or even in trouble, that she'd just get spoken to about professional attire.

So WIBTA if I reported a young woman to her supervisor for her clothing?

Edit: 

1) When I say ""report"" her, I mean have a quiet word with her supervisor. I 100% guarantee she will not get in trouble for this, but at most, would have a quiet discussion about attire for a professional setting. 

2) ) The reason I'm considering bringing it up is because someone else mentioned it to me, and the reason they brought it to me is they thought I would be the right person to mention it to the supervisor. 

3) I'm not staring at this girl's breasts or saying she has to wear a bra. I was sitting across from her in a meeting and her nipples were visible through her shirt because of the color difference from the rest of her breasts. A tank underneath would solve the problem.

4) I'm in a relative position of authority, though not her direct supervisor. In this office, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss this with her, discretely or not. The most discrete I can get with this is the quiet word to her supervisor.

5) My own attire is on the nicer end of jeans/sneakers, with business casual when I have meetings. I'm actually on the casual side of the dress code for the office already. I'm not trying to be a hypocrite here (though people seem to think otherwise).",466,354,0.88
1538,Everyone Sucks,"I'm posting this here because I'm genuinely curious and I've been feeling conflicted about it for quite some time. 

My husband and I had been married for about 7 years when this all went down, and obviously the fact that I'm posting this means it still gets my goat a few years later. 

So here's the story: husband and I were high school sweethearts, got married right out of high school. We didn't have kids right away, but we had a little list of our favorite names. There was one boy name on this list that was our #1, ""when we have a boy, this IS the name,"" kind of thing. Everyone knew. It wasn't a secret. 

So my little sister gets married about 6 years into our marriage, and gets pregnant right away. They find out it's a boy and they pick some random name. Cool. 

Well, then they decide to change it. To the name we've been hanging on to since we first started ever talking about having kids. The conversation goes something like this.

Sister: We decided we're not going to go with Todwyn (not the real name lol) for the baby's name
Me: Oh, ok. Cool. What are you doing instead?
Sister: We decided to change the name to *insert baby name here*
Me: Oh... You know we've been planning on using that name since we were in high school, right? 
Sister: I know. We just really like it and you don't have any kids, so....

At this point, I felt like I couldn't really say anything else. I cried to my other sister and she was sympathetic. My dad was unsympathetic and my mom was ambivalent. 

It's been a few years, and before and after that there have been some negative interactions that have definitely colored my feelings, so I'm really curious: AITA for 1. being upset in the first place? and 2. still feeling some resentment? 

I get it. It doesn't matter. What has me stung (still to this day tbh) is that she knew we loved that name and that we were planning on using it. I never, ever, EVER would have done that to her. If she'd been saying for 10 years, ""this is the name we're going to use for our first boy,"" I would have considered that name off-limits and never even considered it, so I'm hurt that she wouldn't do the same for me. Thoughts? Feel free to judge harshly.

EDIT: Not to make myself look better or anything, but there is definitely some bad blood between us from other issues as well. So it's not like I wanted to disown her for picking the baby name I liked. It's more like that was the cherry on top of a string of slaps to the face. lol

EDIT 2: I get that you can't really have ""dibs"" on a name, people. The issue is that my sister was mean and I'm hurt about it. Also, this wasn't 10 years ago. We've been together for like 10 years. This all went down about a year and a half ago.

EDIT 3: The name is James. And there's been no one in any of the families involved as far back as anyone can remember.

EDIT 4: “But James is such a common name.” I’ve LITERALLY been telling them for YEARS that it was the first name on our list! Obviously anyone could have come up with it. I never claimed it was an out-there name. I never should have told y’all the name itself because that’s not really the issue lol",359,570,0.93

So recently, I’d say 4-5 months ago he started to go blind, deaf, unable to control his pee poo, basically just all the senile dog things. My dad counters this by locking him in a storage room 24/7.

1546,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m also on mobile if that makes a difference. Me and my hubby are expecting our first child. We decided to find out the gender and were excited to learn that we are having a boy! It took us a while to agree on a name (both of us can be pretty picky) but we finally agreed on a name that for the sake of this story will be David. This past weekend I had my baby shower. Lots of people were asking so I began to tell people our plan for the name. The party was great but then my sister in law asked if we could speak privately. She pulled me aside and said that she is uncomfortable with us naming our son David, as that was the name of her brother who died when they were children. I didn’t know what to say so I just told her I would talk to my husband and see what he thinks. She wasn’t too pleased with that answer but she dropped it for the rest of the party. 
Later that evening I spoke to my husband about what she told me. He also didn’t know that she had a deceased brother. He asked his brother, her husband, about it and he told us that he died when she was around 4/5 years old. 
Now, I was initially leaning towards changing the name but there are a few things holding me back. If she wanted to save the name for a future child I would agree to change my sons name in a heartbeat. But, she and her husband have always been adamant about not having children. He also died when she was very young, so it isn’t like they had a super close relationship or that she has lots of memories of them growing up together. 
I do not want to overstep and boundaries but I am very conflicted. I am seven months pregnant so if we want to pick a different name, we need to do that soon. I am also very fond of the name we chose, and I do not want to change it if it is unnecessary. So reddit, WIBTA if I named my son David against my SIL’s wishes?

EDIT: For a little clarification, I did NOT know about her brother before she told me at the party. I expressed my condolences but I also told her I would need to speak to my husband. 
I am also aware about how a statement of mine is insensitive to her loss. I suppose a better way of phrasing that would be that 30-ish years should be more than enough time to cope and heal from his passing.

1550,Not the A-hole,"I live in a state where MJ is legal. I was in my backyard  smoking a joint with my wife, minding my own business, when my neighbor started doing what I’m assuming is yard work. My guess is he smelled the smoke and he decided to come yelling at me like I’m some mega POS. Basically telling me that he has kids in the house and I need to take that shit somewhere else. 

Let me clarify, that I have always been considerate in regard to smoking in front of children/adolescents. If I see a kid, I don’t care if we are in the middle of a session, I’m putting it out. I don’t agree with smoking ANY THING in front of kids, because I believe it sends the wrong message. 

With that being said. This guy’s kids were not outside. And I was on my property. So I was somewhat surprised with the way he chose to talk to me about it. So naturally I told him, dude I’m not anywhere near your kids, and according to you they’re in the house. So mind your own fucking business. 

He got mad and proceeded to call me names like bum/pothead. He claimed he was going to call the cops, so I called his bluff and told him to fuck off and bother someone else, as I proceeded to puff the magic dragon as if he wasn’t even there. 

(Cops can’t do anything about this, because I’m over 21 and am on my property)

In hindsight, I feel kind of bad for talking to my neighbor like that, even though legally I’m in the right. I think he was just being over-protective of his kids.

Baxter my older dog has started having problems with his hips in the past year or so, to the point that I have to help him get up the stairs for bed.

I have always taken Baxter and Soldier out together whether it's just to do their business or to go on walks. The problem is I have noticed that Soldier seems to be going a little stir crazy since the walks have become shorter and shorter. He will act like he needs to go poop when he really doesn't and he has never done that before. If he says he needs to go then he needs to go.

I know if I take Soldier out by himself for longer walks Baxter is going to get super upset. But I don't want to push Baxter past his limits and cause him more pain and I don't want to punish Soldier because he's younger and is still full of energy.

Edit 2: Baxter is a medium sized German Shephard and Jerky McJerkface mix (I honestly have no idea, I took him from a girl at work when he was a puppy because she got evicted and was going to take him to the pound back when they still put dogs down and didn't treat against parvo) So trying to lift him into strollers or wagons would be a big strain on my back.

And trust me he is Jerky McJerkface.. he ate my Dad's fake teeth one night when he left them sitting on the table wrapped in a paper towel. My Dad was furious but I couldn't stop laughing which made things even worse. I don't call him Snacker for nothing!

1554,No A-holes here,"This is all over the place as it's a truly crazy story so apologies for that. 

*necessary back story* my father in law has lost his mind. He's been having an affair with a prostitute for what must be a year now, we all found out in February and MIL filed for divorce which was finalized in May. Between Feb and May, FIL just disappeared. No one could contact him and Noone saw him around. We were honestly thinking he was dead. Prostitute girlfriend is the epitome of bat shit crazy.

Fast forward to last Thursday, I was driving home from a shopping trip and I saw his vehicle and he wasn't driving so I turned around to check if he was there and saw him so I just carried on driving but a few minutes later I notice him following me, he's hooting like a madman, shouting and making gestures to pull over. I don't, obviously but at this point I'm not too phased, he follows me around for a while and I try my best to lose him but I can't. I try phone the police and the number doesn't go through. I'm driving like a lunatic and true as fuck there isn't a cop in sight(fuck you south Africa) I phone my security company and they advise me to go to the police station, which I do but before I get to the police station I'm stopped by a damn red light, so I stop, doors locked and windows up. My heart is racing and I'm very flustered. I've been driving for nearly an hour. Next thing there's banging on my window, it's the crazy girlfriend, she hits the window again and I race off through a red light. I panic and don't go to the police station but I phone my MIL and ask her what to do. My brain isn't working right. She tells me to come to her house, I'll be safe there. As I pull up to her driveway the gate is closed and he's right behind me and I race off again, drive around two big blocks and go back to my MILs house and luckily the driveway gate is open this time and I race in, the gate closes behind me and luckily they're just too late out the car so they don't make it in but they're screaming profanities at me, telling me I called the girlfriend a terrible racial slur and telling me(using racial slurs) that they caught me cheating and they were going to tell my boyfriend.

I phone boyfriend, tell him how they chased me and scared me and he leaves work to come deal with FIL.. MIL and I went to the police station to open a case against them but were met by them at the police station. Boyfriend came and spoke to his father, told him that if this happens again he's not talking. Left it at that.

My question now is, AITA for being upset that my boyfriend, while he doesn't believe the allegations, didn't defend me, hasn't demanded an apology and has since spoken to his father and not brought up how wrong his behavior was.

I'm extremely hurt by the allegations, I've never been a cheater and it hurts me to my core to be blamed of something like that, and I truly can't understand how someone can try ruin their only child's relationship for absolutely no reason",24,26,0.88

1556,Asshole,"I work in a private highschool in southern Ontario. Seven years ago the administration and I decided to hire a new teacher, Amanda (name changed). Amanda had great credentials, had degrees in both math and chemistry, and as we soon found out was an excellent teacher.

Two months ago I found out she is not who she says she is. I'm part of a Facebook group to help people locally with things for free. You post something you have you don't want anymore, someone else comments they want it, you meet up and give it to them. I've been a part of this group for a few months now and I found Amanda, but under a different name. I have Amanda on Facebook, and this other account used the same photos, just a different name. My best guess is Amanda had a profile connected to her teaching life, and one being her real account.

It took me a couple of days to message her and ask her what's going on. She was straightforward with me: her friend is Amanda who had all the credentials and education, and she let ""Amanda"" apply to jobs using them. ""Amanda"" went to school, too, but not as prestigious a school, and did not graduate. The real Amanda works for some company in another city. So she colluded with her friend to apply for teaching jobs using Amanda's CV and then ""Amanda"" shows up and does the job.

""Amanda"" is a great teacher. The kids love her and she does her job well. She's also a great person. You don't *need* to be accredited to teach in a private school here. You could hire someone straight out of highschool, it's all based on ability/merit. I told ""Amanda"" I'd have to think about it and I think now my decision is to take inaction.

I don't dare tell anyone else, even ask their opinions, because this would put her job at risk. Not only that, but get police involved for fraud/identity theft. That last part has me conflicted because what she has done is unethical and illegal. She gained her position on false pretenses. I wonder to myself at night if I'm wrong for doing nothing and allowing it to happen: someone more deserving and capable could be working this job, I'm putting my neck on the line for admittedly a friend now.

I'd love some outsider thoughts on whether I'm the asshole here.",89,156,0.92
1557,Not the A-hole,"I'll be upfront. I have a sugar daddy arrangement with a great guy, let's call him Mark. Call me what you want, but I've a house in my name, and have enough for me to stop working and live frugally for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I work in sales to pass the time in a highly sought after company. Because I don't need the extra money, I'm extremely alright with coming into work and leaving on time. I use all of my paid vacation too. Mark is not frequently in town, but when he is, I set aside time for him. This has rightly landed me near or at the bottom of the company rankings amongst my peers. I do put in my 100% when I am in office, I just don't stay late or come in over the weekends and I take all my vacation days.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this sticks out like a sore thumb in the company I'm in. The culture is one where everyone works mad overtime just to hit the incentive and performance bonuses. My colleagues have been making many snide remarks about how lazy I am, how my life will amount to nothing and how much more I could be earning if I just worked harder. Because your career is everything, I guess. Just a note, many of them are living decently, but not enough to stop the mad dash. 

&#x200B;

One day, we were out at lunch at a higher priced restaurant (bill came out to be $70 per pax) on a whim. I shocked that this particular group of colleagues asked me, but was happy to join the 5 of them, since it was a while since I went out with them. At one point in the convo, someone commented that we should do this more often because it was nice, and I agreed. Cue an offhand comment of ""Oh AnnualCamel, are you sure you can afford that? We can go to a less expensive restaurant if you want"", and I replied honestly this price was ok, as long as it wasn't /that/ often. Then the bombshell ""Maybe you could if you worked harder, like the rest of us"" was dropped.

&#x200B;

I was so mad, I told them the truth - that I could retire, but was just working because I wanted to stay occupied and because honestly I liked doing the job. They probed more and made a (correct) inference that my money was from a sugar daddy. This for some reason set them all off. They said that I was a massive asshole for stealing the job from someone else who would have appreciated the opportunity to work in the company we were in. And that if I didn't want it I should GTFO and free up the space. They then started rumours in the office about what a slut I was (not even the right insult) and they were sure I was sleeping with the bosses to keep my job (I wasn't). 

&#x200B;

Good grief, so I reported it to HR and the key instigator got her recent promotion removed. I am now even more so the social pariah amongst that group.

&#x200B;

Did they have a point though? AITA for taking up a job I don't really need, and depriving someone else of that opportunity?",615,3008,0.93
1558,Not the A-hole,"My mum (60) is a single mum, with two children me (29m) and brother (32m). When I was 21, I got sick of living at home because my brother contributed nothing to the family and made everything hell. I moved out of home, and rented a shitty place for a few years. I had a decent savings from working a job that was in my study field at uni.


Around the time of me thinking of buying a house (when I was 25) my mum told me my brother decided to get married ??? (never met the girl before), and that the wife was going to move into the rental my mum's been looking after.


I decided to buy a small 1x1x1 flat for my mum, let her live there so she didn't need to worry so much about keeping a roof over her head (she doesn't have a decent job and was an immigrant, my dad gambled the money away before they divorced). This house was under the agreement that she stopped helping my brother and started taking care of herself.


Fast forward to six months ago, brother is now divorced, and moved all his things into my house. I talked to my mum, and she feels guilty about the situation. I told her I would sell the house if she doesn't tell him to move out. 


She cooks for him, cleans after him. He goes to work, plays video games, and doesn't pay rent or contribute to the utilities. I'm at the end here, I gave up purchasing a house for myself so she'd be okay, and now she's gone to the same thing that led me to move out when I was 21.


TLDR: WIBTA if I sold the house and told them to fend for themselves if he doesn't leave?


INFO: I own the house, paid off the mortgage. Mum pays the utilities with her part time job. When she got too old to work, I had planned on moving her into a granny flat on my property (if I manage to secure a good piece of land), or exchanging that small flat into a ""seniors"" village, where there was support when needed.


INFO: reason why I want to kick them out - this enabling behaviour is the reason I left 8 years ago. I didn't want any part in him leeching from my mum, now it annoys me that the one agreement I put in place so mum could enjoy hobbies is more or less ruined. If he had no money for rent, but cooked and cleaned half the time - I'd have no problems with him staying there.w


Edit: thank you everyone for the replies, only expected a handful of replies. I've read most of your comments. I definitely agree that I would be the asshole if I let my mum be homeless. I'm definitely going to look at my legal avenues in terms of evicting him. It will probably hurt my relationship with my mum, but in my eyes it's time for him to learn how to live by himself. I'll stipulate that if he pays for utilities and helps around the house, keeps it clean and cooks for mum, I'd be more than happy for him to stay there. But he has 2 months before I go to legal. Thank you everyone!",249,1561,0.98
1559,Not the A-hole,"So I saw someone else's post about not telling the parents about being married and was shocked that the consensus was YWBTA as I myself am someone who got married and didn't tell her parents (well, mom and stepdad). 

For some background, my mom and I have a long history of relationship issues such that I've nearly gone no contact many times and have settled into a pattern of very low contact and a severe information diet. My stepdad, although a kind man, is not really a parent to me and we don't have a relationship outside of him being married to my mother because I was nearly an adult when they married. 

I was previously married until I figured out how to escape my abusive ex husband. When I left him, my mother sided with him. They were not close before, but he convinced her that the reason I had left him was severe mental illness such that he need her help getting me back so he could control my life. She gave him a key to her house and started inviting him over several times daily, and the two of them would start harassing me by phone. It was a very dangerous time for me but about 6 months later everyone finally left me alone and I moved far away to stay safe.

As a result of all of this, I lost most of my friends and family, but got out safely on the other side. I originally was intending to go no contact with my mom because of the danger I was in, but was convinced to figure out a way to have her in my life even if it was severely limited. That is how it remained for years. I didn't tell her any actual content of my life because it was only ever used to hurl emotional abuse at me. We've now been in a pattern of low contact/info diet for several years and have reached an equilibrium where no harm is done to me.

Against my better judgement I told my mom about my husband (then boyfriend) about 6 months into our relationship because I felt bad for reasons a lot like why people said the other poster WBTA. Unfortunately this resulted in my mother trying to be controlling and saying cruel things to me, including how she doesn't think I'm someone worthy of ever getting married again. To this day she will do things like rescind my stepdad's invitations to include my husband and get excited when I'm busy at work because she's hoping I'm too busy now to have any relationship at all. She simply doesn't support me having any relationship with anyone at all under any circumstances.

So when it came time to marry my husband, I made the painful decision to not invite her or even tell her. I know that if we're able to have kids that telling my mother will probably destroy the tiny bit of relationship I have with her, but my husband still supports me in having what little relationship with her that I can while it's possible. He is not upset or offended about not being included - he just feels sad that my family is not as kind to me as his family is to him.

Despite all this, AITA?

1565,Not the A-hole,"My (33m) wife (32f) and I just had our first kid.  Her in-laws came to visit.  FIL and I have never seen head to head as he is born again and I am an outspoken logical person.  FIL gets annoyed by kid crying the whole week.  When their flight is scheduled to leave, it gets rescheduled for the next day.  That night, he starts freaking out triggered by the kid crying, wife's sister reminding him of ex wife, sleeping arrangements.  Anyway, I am consoling the kid upstairs and he starts screaming egregious shit for approximately 3 hours.  Almost eleven times he whined, ""I don't wanna be here any more"".  Called sister a little bitch, complained that I jokingly called my son a psychopath, said we are doing a horrible job raising the kid (after three weeks and because wife is checking a parenting book), said he never wanted anything to do with our son ever again, never visiting again, not sleeping over the final night and just acted like a complete baby for three hours.  At one point he threatened to walk to the airport and get a hotel, but when we ordered an uber for him, he wouldn't take it.

It seems like emotional abuse, note, no alcohol was involved.  No apology afterwards, just weak rationalization (bad day, kid crying, emotional triggers), it's been a week, haven't heard from him.

1570,Asshole,"We had our 7 year high school reunion this year, and I was excited to meet and catch up with all my friends. I am fortunately doing really well career wise and only wish the best for everyone.

I am indian by ethnicity and was never the looker during school. I remember asking out X, an indian girl in her senior year(right before graduation). Now, I got rejected and she told me that she was not into indian guys. I completely appreciate preferences now, but I overstepped the boundaries and asked her why she felt that way.

So X goes on a long, hate filled rant about how I am sexist, worship my mom, virgin until my parents pick out a wife for me and I shall treat her like crap and America would be better off if I left the country. She received detention for this because a lot of guys overheard her and reported the incident. I was quickly over it too.

Fast forward to last month, she listens to my conversation with my pals and me having the privilege to meet a famous billionaire because of my work, and  introduces herself. She calls me handsome, tells me she would love meeting personally later and seems to be into me.

I only recognised her after she told me her name and a part of my brain wanted to just be amused so I asked her stuff about india and its culture. All my friends know her too, so it was like an inside joke between us.

She just goes rambling on about how much she loves the place and how Taj Mahal is the best thing since sliced bread. Really stupid basic stuff and I tell her to go back there since she is so fond of it.

1571,No A-holes here,"I'm sure we've all seen it, the weird, super-formatted posts on Facebook and Instagram from well meaning women. The strange comments from other MultiLevelMarketing-huns saying that they're going to ""change people's lives!"" 
The weird claims that the company she's with is going to be a huge provider and she's going to change her whole life with this money. 

One of my distant friends is now involved in a MLM. She's a military wife who just moved to the south, she's natively from New York, very religious, and she's been targeted by other people to sell for other companies in the past, although this is the first time she's tried selling. I confirmed that she is in with Modere, a diet and ""wellness"" MLM that doesn't really change the script too much from Herbalife or Young Living.

My question is, would it be an asshole move to message her privately and try to explain that these things more often ruin people's finances rather than help them? I haven't spoken to her in years, she's an old friend from a school I only attended for a few years nearly 8 years ago now.  But it really does pain me to see that she's being used by whoever recruited her, and is probably headed down a road with at least a little financial and emotional wreckage along the way.

It'll start with him venting about the way they treat him at work, then I'll suggest something he should do about it, or say that he should stand up for himself, he claims he can't because he hasn't been there long enough / doesn't have enough credibility at yet to voice his opinion about things. I try to convince him to do something, tell him things like ""stop letting them walk all over you"" and then he gets angry at me tells me I have no fucking clue what it's like at work and to stop acting like I have all the answers. So I say fine then stop fucking complaining about it all the time if you don't want to hear what I have to say. He gives me silent treatment for a day or so then I say sorry then a month later it happens again next time he complains. Its just really frustrating to hear him complaining, but then doing nothing about it. Especially since we used to work together and he was very confident and smart and would never let shit like this fly in his old work environment.

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

TLDR; reoccurring fight with my husband, hes always complaining about how they treat him at his new job and it frustrates me that he doesn't stand up for himself at work. He gets angry at me when I tell him that or when I offer advice. We keep having this fight over and over so I've told him to stop complaining to me if he doesn't want to hear what I have to say.

1575,Not the A-hole,"I am going to keep some parts vague to avoid potential racism and stereotypes. We are not from US and from where we came they called me quite an AH for it.


My partner is from a minority race and went overseas(our current home) to pursue further studies and then we got together. His parents are rather unhappy with his choice of picking an outsider, but not unfriendly to me. His grandmother however, totally despise me.


You see, she is very traditional, religious and superstitious, whatever you call it. She is also a witch doctor(not exactly, but close) of sorts and has quite some power in the household where my husband came from. She was totally upset with my partner and even his parents for raising an only son who ""flew away"". Whenever we visit her to pay respect to elders(tradition) she would speak to me in such a tone that my partner would refuse to translate. Truth be told, I am rather afraid of her.


My partner's parents warned us not to return to his hometown after we announced my pregnancy, as they were worried that the grandmother would do me harm. I wouldn't doubt it, since I could tell from our encounters that she even hoped for my death. I am pretty fine with not going his hometown though, but it bothered me that she may hate me that much to cause me harm, thankfully my partner sided with me.


Fast forward to now, I am being told to go to my partner's hometown to visit his grandmother, as she doesn't have much days left and she wants to see her great-grandson. My partner said I can refuse if I don't want to, but I can see that he wants to. I don't want to, and it sounded so suspicious to me. Why would a person who hates me with everything she had and even wanted to harm my child suddenly had a change of mind? I don't feel safe at all, she scares me.


My other in-laws are very unhappy with my choice, after all it was not like a dying old woman can do anything to harm us now, and I am very disrespectful  to deny her dying wish. They are also pressuring my partner for having no backbone and would rather listen to an evil woman than his elders.

1580,No A-holes here,"So a guy with a mental handicap has had a fixation on me (mid 30s male) for nearly a decade. He is bigger than me and his volatile behavior can be scary at times. I take this bus to work around two times a week and our paths cross often enough. He randomly started talking to me years back and it took me a second to realise that he wasn't all there. I can be pretty socially awkward to begin with, but I *really* don’t know how to communicate with him. His speech is decent (proper verb and grammar usage), but the overall content of what he talks about is mostly nonsensical. I stay polite, but I think it's clear I would rather be elsewhere.

Over the years, he's been getting more aggro, not just to me, but to other passengers in the bus. I think people increasingly looking into their smartphones didn't sit well with him. He'll tap random people on the shoulder, say something that doesn't mean much and continue up the bus (he's only on it for 4 stops). Sometimes he'll spare me, other times he'll outright swipe his hand on my phone or try to grab it, say something nonsensical and keep walking. I usually have my headphones on and it's quite a shock when it happens. No one likes being touched by strangers. But I try to stay polite, smile and nod, tell him to have a good day; other times, and I'm really not proud of this, I ignore him. I've been through a depression and divorce over the years, so yeah, some mornings I am in my own head and didn't feel like engaging with this guy. I've seen him get outright aggressive and yell at other passengers.

I know he recognizes me because 2 years ago I was out in the park with my kid and there was a group of handicapped people out as a group. He was there and started aggressively yelling at me, ""Hey, what the fuck are you doing here?!"" This scared my young son and I went into over-protective father mode, angrily walked in his direction and just said, ""Come on man, please! Why are you always on my back?"" The people he was with calmed him down and apologized to me.

But nothing changed in the bus. It came to a head this morning: middle of a heatwave, 4 hours of sleep, headphones on, minding my own business and I suddenly feel this hard tug on my shoulder. So much that it made me jump in shock (weird, I still “feel” his hand on my shoulder hours later). And I had just had it. I asked him to lean in closer and calmly whispered, ""If you ever touch me again, I am going to break your fucking face."" He seemed a little taken aback and answered ""Then why do you take this bus?"" and kept moving. The usual nonsensical nature of his answer was disarming and a reminder the he's not in total control of his faculties. Really made me feel like an AH, but by that point my brain was in ""you've gotta put a stop to this"" mode and I felt like I had been letting this guy violate my boundaries for too long.

I wish I knew more about the nature of his condition, but at this point I kind of don't care, I just want him to leave me alone. AITA?

1581,Everyone Sucks,"I met a girl about a year and a half ago. We began chatting and hit it off which soon blossomed into a relationship. She is a single mother with a bit of a rough past.

&#x200B;

Not long into the relationship we accidentally conceived. At first it was a shock but I was positive and excited myself. First two months went great. I was there at appointments, we planned, we broke out the news to our families. Everyone was happy for us. Then she got distant. Okay first trimester hormones, it happens.  I start catching her in lies. I press to talk and communicate. She breaks up with me over text. Refusing to see me in person.

&#x200B;

Few weeks later I get a message from her ex, they have been together a while now which is why she is treating me like shit.

&#x200B;

I was cheated on. She's breaking a restraining order(that I supported her getting) to be with a man who abusers her. She kicked herself out of her moms place. She and her child are homeless. We argue.

&#x200B;

I was allowed at the gender reveal, our mothers came, she brought a friend. It was simple, wonderful and I was grateful. Second time I've seen her in months. It's a girl.

&#x200B;

Friend of her tells me shes with a new man. This ones a criminal, abandoned another family of his, nearly twice her age and had an underage relationship with her years ago. I confront her about it. Doesn't go well.

&#x200B;

She offers to meet up a few times, and bails each time. Eventually I get nothing. Her mom tells me her phone is off. Get one exchange of texts two months later to meetup and chat but then no replies for a long time.

&#x200B;

Child is due in a few weeks.  I get a call from a friend of hers. She's still with the same man. They are claiming the child is his on social media. I'm certain it's mine. I reach out to her mom. I get a call from my ex herself.  I tell her I would like to talk, there is a lot to work out, etc. She says no. I ask her what about when we share custody and we have to drop the kid off. ""Someone else can drop her off."" she tells me. I call her immature and to grow up, then hung up.

&#x200B;

I ask for a paternity test on the child, pushing what benefits I can provide. No response.

&#x200B;

I wanted to provide a loving, supportive and caring home for my child. Giving it social, mental and emotional development. Yet now, I'm getting ready to walk away. The mother is giving me an out, letting me take a less honorable path. Letting another kid go into the cycle of abusive relationships and unhealthy environments. The law, attorneys advice, past history of events like this show it not be in my favor. I could ruin both of our lives trying to fight for this and still lose.

&#x200B;

The child doesn't feel like mine. I won't be there for her birth. I don't even know what her name will be.

1584,Not the A-hole,"Recently my brother announced to the family that he and his wife were going to have a baby, they weren't planning it but it happened and they were happy. Now, everyone knows that they have an open relationship ever since they started seeing each other and that they carried it into their marriage. Everyone also knows that last year she had a pregnancy scare that ended up bringing to light the fact that she had not been using protection with the other guy at the time.

A few days after they made the announcement my brother said he wanted to talk with me in private, he came to my house and after a lot of stalling on his part he ended up going on a rant about the current situation. He said he was happy in his marriage and he had nothing to complain about their arrangement, he was very happy with the news as well but now he was feeling paranoid about it because he couldn't stop thinking about last year's incident and he was considering asking for a partenity test once the baby was born. I told him that if that would help him put that to rest, then he should do it but he should talk to his wife about it first.

Well, he did talk to his wife and she was extremely pissed off but to my surprise she was angry at me. I don't know what or how my brother said it to her but she called me very angry screaming every insult at me because I was trying to manipulate her husband into getting a divorce (?) knowing that they were going through a very emotionally charged moment in their lives. I told her that I never suggested that and only worked with the information that my brother gave me but she was not having it. Once she hung up on me mid sentence, I called my brother only to find out he did not want to talk to me anymore and that he agreed with his wife's views on our last conversation and that he was going to put some distance between us.

I asked for some perspective from my wife and she, like me, sees nothing wrong with what I said. But she also thinks that they might be going through or have been through something that my brother wasn't willing to share with me. By now, a few family members have caught wind of what happened and while they don't have any strong feelings on this, the conseus seems to be that I shouldn't have said anything.",282,1132,0.96

so i have a 14 year old niece who has gone through absolute hell. her dad was just sent to jail for what he did to her so she is still dealing with that. 

I decided to call her and ask her if she wanted to be a bridesmaid, she was super excited and agreed. her mum is super excited as she is also a bridesmaid. 

I had a rule that we would have no kids (under 16s not allowed) so I would be bending it for just her, my husband agreed and we thought that It would be fine.

the rest of our family are not pleased that we are bending it for just her and some of the family are complaining on Facebook about how unfair it is. some of them have 15 year olds and think it's fair that we allow them.",72,163,0.95

1588,Asshole,"I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  

&#x200B;

Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.

1592,Not the A-hole,"Gavin and I have been together for 10 years. 2 years ago, he began a stressful job with a lot of travel, and he went on a work trip with a married colleague ('Nicole'). When he got back, he confessed to me that he had developed 'strong feelings' for her, and she felt the same. He told me they had decided to keep talking 'as friends’.

They kept talking for a few months. I knew about this, but not the extent. She felt guilty and told her husband about their feelings. He was irate. She and Gavin  (supposedly) cut contact outside of work, though I found out later that they chatted intermittently on an app over the following months--telling each other they love each other, etc.

She and her husband divorced. I stayed with Gavin, hoping we could work through it and concerned about his mental health. He was depressed and all of his family and friends lived far away. I helped him keep up appearances at work (he would have panic attacks and was terrified to resign, worried to let everyone down). I convinced him to talk to a therapist and helped him get the courage to resign.

We also went to a couple's therapist to work through issues and, if it came to that, split amicably. We decided if we divorced, we wouldn't share details or place blame. I wrote a letter of forgiveness to Nicole, saying, among other things, that even if they ended up together, I wouldn't tell other people when their relationship started. I've told my parents and best friend Gavin and I are ""having problems"", but no specifics.

I got a job on the other side of the country and asked him to come with me. At first, he said 'no', then a few weeks later, said he had a sort of 'epiphany' and that he did want to come and work on our relationship. He told Nicole to stop talking to him. I moved first; he would follow a few months later. The long distance thing went well the first couple months. He was relieved to not be at his old job. Then, he started to get depressed again, anxious about being unemployed. He finally got an excellent job a few hours away from where I work, and I looked into flexible scheduling at work so we could live together.

He moved to the city his job is in, and, while visiting, I saw a notification from her. I didn't read it, but asked, and found out they started talking again about a month ago. Now, divorce seems imminent.

When I visit their old company later this year and am asked why we are divorcing, I am considering simply saying ""Nicole"". Obviously, I feel pretty justified. Neither of them work there anymore, so I'm not costing jobs. However, it is in a very tight-knit (gossip-prone) community; she grew up there, and her family lives there. The community adores her. Outside of this situation, she seems genuinely nice.

And, to be honest, I would be doing it to be vindictive. I know she is terrified of the idea of being labeled a homewrecker. Also, I don't believe they have physically cheated, if that makes any difference.

1593,Not the A-hole,"Hi, obligatory apology for posting on mobile and possible formatting errors.

So I'm currently on a week long trip of sorts with two friends. One of them has this weird thing where apparently she can't fall asleep, in her words, ""unless \[we\] both are in bed safe and sound"", whatever that means. This is mainly because she looks after her siblings back home, who are kids, and it's become a habit for her to make sure they're in bed before sleeping herself.

See, the thing is, I stay up really late. Like really, really late, until the AM's. And apparently me staying up late affects her sleep schedule. She snapped at me this morning for making her tired. A part of me feels guilty because I could go to sleep earlier and save her the trouble of staying up, but also a part of me feels justified in the fact that it's my life and I shouldn't change to fit someone else's lifestyle. I dunno, I feel kind of selfish.

My other roommate tells me I should just go to sleep early, since it's good for me and her.

Note: I'm inside the room listening to music/writing and typing. Not going outside at night or anything.

I'm sorry if this seems like a validation post, I've genuinely been struggling with making her upset and my own ego or something, I guess.",32,63,0.92

1595,Not the A-hole,"My dad is in a significant amount of debt. He owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. There is a lien on his house. He has borrowed about $50-100K from friends. He bought a lottery ticket that ended up winning a small jackpot. However, because he owes so much money in taxes, he thought that if he claimed the winnings himself that all of it would be taken by the government. Instead, he had my family claim the ticket together and split the winnings seven ways. 

When he told us about the ticket he explicitly stated that we were under no obligation to share any of our portions with him, but that he hoped we would help him pay back his friends. He went around the room and pointed out all the ways the money would help each of us and he specifically said to me “you can pay off your student loans!” I should point out that my father paid for my older sister’s college education (tuition/rent) but he ran into money trouble during my undergraduate years and so I had to work and pay for most of my own education. I also went to graduate school, so I came out of it all with about $60K in student loans. 

I had planned to give my father half of my portion since I wouldn’t have gotten any money at all if he had not shared. However, half would not have been enough to pay off my student loans and credit card debt. If I paid those off, I would have about $15-20K left and I was thinking I’d give him $10K of it and save the rest, but I wanted to talk to him about it first. He asked me to get cashier’s checks for $10K to pay back some of his friends, which I did, and when I went to deliver the checks I brought up what I wanted to do with the rest of my portion. 

His tune had changed. Instead of happily agreeing that paying off my student debt was the right plan, he talked over me and said, “Well you can’t.” He instructed me to put half of the money (minus the $10K) into a separate account. He bullied me and implied that I was being ungrateful because “even half the money would make a big dent” in my debt. He also said that because I was educated and am relatively young, I’ll be able to pay off the student loan debt eventually. He also suggested that I shouldn’t pay off the student loan debt because the next election might bring someone who will forgive student loan debt.

Here’s the thing Reddit. This money is a drop in the bucket for all that my father owes, but for me it was a chance to wipe out all of my debt and have a fresh start and financial freedom. After he bullied me and went back on his word, I decided to do what felt right for myself and I paid off all of my debt. For the first time in my adult life I am debt free. I have not yet told him that I did this, so he still believes that I have half the money set aside for him.

Tl;dr: My father won the lottery and shared the ticket with my family, expecting half of each of our portions. I paid off my debt instead of giving him half. Am I the asshole?",55,33,0.9

1597,Everyone Sucks," Just exited what was possibly the most heated public interaction of my life.

I got into an Uber Pool and got a call I had scheduled. I considered bailing on the call for the sake of the driver and my two co-passengers, but decided I would take it because (a) I have been in many Pools where someone was on a call and it never bothered me, and (b) the caller had expressed to me they would not be available for the next few days.

I turned the volume on my phone down, lowered my voice, and picked up.

Five minutes later I hear the woman behind me speaking angrily to the other passenger. At first it was unclear, but then I hear her say, ""What the hell is he even talking about?"" At that point I put my call on mute and turn around. I asked her, nicely, if my call was bothering her. She said, with poison in every syllable:

""Um, YES it is. No one wants to hear your voice for their ENTIRE ride. Who do you even think you are?”

I said: ""I'm sorry, totally didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.""

""OBVIOUSLY I'm uncomfortable,"" she said. ""Can I leave a note to Uber to complain about you? This is ridiculous!”

""You chose to be in an Uber Pool,"" I said, not without venom. ""If you wanted to ensure you'd have your own space, you had the option to take a single Uber. I've been in Pools many times where someone was talking on the phone, and it has never bothered me.""

""Well it was bothering me. I don't want to hear YOUR stupid voice.""

I said: ""You could have told me like a human being that you wanted me to stop. You did not need to bad mouth me and then scream at me after I tried to address the situation.”

We proceeded to exchange VERY heated verbal jabs. At one point I turned to the other passenger to apologize if my phone call made her uncomfortable. She shrugged it off, probably mostly because the entire situation had escalated and she just wanted to get the hell out of there.

While she continued to berate me, I unmuted my call to tell the person I was talking to I would have to call them back.

""I'm sorry, Tom, I'll have to call you back,"" I said as I hung up.

""Yeah, TOM, get off the phone already,"" she called out.

""What is your problem? Did you have a bad day or something?""

""I wasn't having a bad day until you ruined it,"" she said.

I then turned to the driver and apologized for the whole situation. He seemed to just want everyone out of the car. She kept on yakking as I was apologizing to the driver. I said, looking straight ahead, with absolute disdain: ""You, on the other hand, I have no sorrow for you.""

At that point we all got quiet. A few minutes later the other passenger got out of the Uber. She literally ran. Then, when my stop came, I tried to make amends.

""Hey,” I said. ""Just wanted to say again that I'm sorry if my call was annoying to you. I don't intend to make strangers upset in general. I hope you have a great night.""

She said: ""It's okay. I was just annoyed.”

I apologized to the driver again and got out of the Uber.

1599,Not the A-hole,"My son announced his engagement 6 months ago, sent out invitations, the reception center is paid for, and everything is set for his wedding. My son’s wedding is less than 2 months away.

This week my sister in law announced her engagement, and wedding date which is 2 weeks before my son’s wedding. Some family members have to drive long distances to come to these weddings and most family can only take one day off from work to go to a wedding. 

Not to mention, this would be a financial strain for most family members to travel 2 times and to buy 2 wedding gifts within a 2 week time frame. The drive times for family are up to 6 hours round trip. Flying is not an option due to cost.

My husband and I spoke with my s-I-l and m-I-l, they refuse to change the date and are minimizing our concerns. They say that if family has to choose only 1 wedding then they can skip hers and people don’t have to bring her gifts. I’m sure that family will pick my s-I-l ‘s wedding because it is their youngest sibling getting married. My son is the nephew and I’m sure his wedding would not be the family’s priority.

Also, our family is very religious and my s-I-l  is getting married in the LDS (Mormon) Temple. My son is not getting married in “The Temple” so family will already view my son’s wedding ceremony as far inferior. So again, I am sure family will choose my 
s-I-l’s wedding first.

My son and his fiancé feel that their wedding will be overshadowed by a wedding 2 weeks prior to theirs and they are VERY upset about this.

Lastly, my s-I-l has always treated my son with indifference, disregard, exclusion, and has shown extreme favoritism to other family members in their age group. I’m wondering if this fact is why I am so angry.

1604,Not the A-hole,"My life seems perfect from afar. I’m 36 (F), married to a wonderful 38 (M). We met in college, love at first sight it was. We were both scholars in a well-known university and came from impoverished families. It’s like a match made in heaven, our views and goals in life align. Before we got married, we have thought everything through. Career comes first so we can save quickly for a nice house in a decent neighborhood, a small, intimate and budget-friendly wedding, travel, helping our families financially by funding our siblings college. Last on our list is having kids. We adore children and we decided that it’s best for us to wait until we are financially ready. Obviously, we don’t want them to experience what we had experienced growing up. 

Two and a half months ago when we learned that we’re pregnant. All the accolades that I received, postgraduate degrees, successful career combined are nothing compared to fulfillment that I felt when I saw the “pregnant” sign on the PT kit.

Earlier today, I had my prenatal screening with my husband. When the doctor broke the news that there’s a high possibility that my baby has Down syndrome, I was horrified, I couldn’t believe it. It didn’t sink in until I got home, I locked myself in our bedroom and had been crying for hours. Abortion came to mind, I’m so afraid of this huge responsibility. I’m 37 and I’m afraid to outlive my kid who has a disability. I want to have a child so bad but at the same time I feel like it’s going to be unfair for him/her to live such disadvantageous life. Even if I leave my work and devote myself to him/her, what if I’m not enough?

Found my husband at his study researching about Down syndrome. I started out with “Maybe now is not a good time but do you think abortion is an option? It’s only been three months”. He flipped out, first time I’d seen him really mad. He was so frustrated because he didn’t expect me to suggest that. He wanted to keep the baby and said that nothing is going to change with our plans. I got mad because he didn’t hear me out at least. He called me names and I did the same. I feel so dehydrated from crying all-day, my head hurts and my husband went out to clear his head and hasn’t come back.

AITA for considering an abortion just because my baby has defects?",79,53,0.88
1605,Not the A-hole,"So obviously context for this;

My fiance and I weren’t planning on having a baby, but we weren’t against the idea either. We’ve been through several miscarriages, and finding out I was pregnant again we waited until I was in the “safe zone” to announce it (usually after 12wks). 
Both our families were ecstatic, after all they knew our troubles and we’d be the first to have grandkids for both our parents. 

But when future SIL (sister in law) found out, she screamed. “How DARE you steal MY thunder?” Apparently she was trying to conceive too via a donor and wanted her and her wife to get pregnant at the same time by the same guy. I tried calming her down, explaining we had no idea that she was trying, assuming she was pregnant as well but she wasn’t. 

“I wanted to be the first! It’s not fair that a tr*nny like you gets to have a baby first!” I’m a trans guy and she was always supportive of me and her brother marrying me so this came to me as a shock. 

She never apologized, instead making some vague Facebook posts about me and mentioning my miscarriages and saying she never expected me to actually get pregnant again, thinking that I deserved to lose those children. I was furious.

I overhear MIL (mother in law) on the phone with SIL and I hear SIL say she wanted to do the first gender reveal party in the family. My fiance and I were similarly planning one and I wasn’t going to invite her but the fact that she kept making such a big deal about us “stealing her thunder”, I invited her along. We jokingly wrote “The First Ever (fiance’s last name) Gender Reveal Party!” on the invitations and sent them out to our families. 

MIL gets on my case saying SIL is angry and annoyed and that I shouldn’t have done that. FIL (father in law) laughs and tells me I did good and that for a woman in the Air Force he expected his daughter to be more mature. But SIL’s wife and MIL aren’t happy with me and saying I’m being an asshole about it, yet her siblings and everyone else in the family tell me that it’s time someone called her out on her constant need for drama and attention. 

TL;DR: SIL said I was stealing her thunder for getting pregnant, made several awful remarks about my miscarriages and thought I deserved them, so my fiance and I invited her to our gender reveal party to annoy her.

EDIT: Hey thanks for all the feedback! Just wanted to say some things;

-Cut out the transphobic shit, don’t appreciate it and don’t really want to have dms thrown at me for my identity. 

-People are asking why we’re having a gender reveal party, and well it’s actually more of a baby shower. We’re pretty much only doing a reveal so our parents get off our backs and will stop complaining about needing to buy white/green/yellow clothing (especially my fiance’s family since we live near Texas and most of his relatives are too conservative to buy “neutral” stuff). We don’t mind and it’s a way for me to see my parents too after months of not seeing them so why the hell not. Plus it’s not like we’re gonna force our kid to ONLY wear blue/pink, kids don’t care about that stuff when they’re young.",197,452,0.86

We’re all sitting down. I told my girlfriend that if he kept talking about his sex life and his dick that I was going to say something. He told two stories about it and made little comments before I spoke up.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was him saying “I don’t know why women just come to me. It’s just like if I want someone, they come to me.” So I spoke up and said “Dude. I can be your wingman some night. I want to watch the magic happen.” He retorted with “Nahhh I could teach you a thing or two.”

“Well who do you like in here? Let’s hit on someone.”

Suddenly he didn’t find anyone attractive, so we all started pointing out attractive women.

“Ehhh I had sex earlier anyway. I don’t really care enough tonight.” 

My response to that was “When you use a sock, is that it blowing you, or sex?” Everyone laughed. He was clearly pissed about it. He told me that I had taken it too far and ruined dinner. I had made it bad for everyone.

1610,Not the A-hole,"Reddit, this has been on my mind for a while. I am Indian and come from a culture where preference for boys over girls is the norm. Having said that, it is just me (30/f) and my little sister. So bear in mind this is a touchy subject for me. Even earlier today, I saw a reddit article about the lack of females in India and it hit me.

Last year, my mom said she hoped me and my husband have a son and that she cannot wait to see what her ""grandson"" looks like. It rubbed me the wrong way as she is a woman herself and been here in the USA for three decades. So it's not like she's brand new and was in that mindset her whole life. My sister and I are both very successful. Anyways, it raised a stink and my mom said I was ridiculous and she just wanted a different gender. We didn't speak for a while.

Anyways, about a month ago I had to see her at a family friends funeral and offered to drive her around and help her with errands. She ends the trip with saying ""God bless you. I hope God gives you wealth and health and a handsome son."" I told her she ruined my mood and she told me I was ridiculous and she was just blessing me.

I haven't spoken to her since. I talked to my dad and sister about what she said and they both said they understood where I was coming from but ""it's just how she is"" and ""you know she means well and doesn't mean harm"" and ""she's still your mother and you have to respect her "" I told them that may be the case for them but I'm really upset because she knows how offensive it is but keeps doing it. She isn't new to the culture and it has been mentioned several times to her that it offended me. At this point, she is choosing to say it and even told my husband that my sister was her favorite child. It's so hurtful especially being a woman myself and it's just so sad to think that if I ever had a girl, she'd be so disappointed. Would she be unwanted? Unloved by my mom? Openly like that?  This is the toxic crap of my culture everyone always talks about. 

Now, a month later I haven't heard from her and nor have I reached out to her. My dad is saddened by this rift but I am hurt by her. I don't want to get too close to her and keep it low contact.

He has no bills to speak of other than his car insurance and he doesn't pay rent anywhere, he just goes from place to place. He also gambles excessively. This is relevant IMO because I want it to be clear that I didn't screw over some broke old guy that needed help. 

He found out that all of his friends get SNAP / food stamps /whatever and he felt that he needed to also because he was ""entitled to it."" - He didn't have any living expenses so this halted his application process. He informed me that he would be saying that he pays me rent and lives in my house which he does not. I told him that I was not comfortable with this as it was fraud and also rent is taxable income so his scheme would be costing me money. He told me that if I didn't comply he would fill out and sign the forms for me. 

Knowing that he would and not wanting to get in trouble I called the SNAP program fraud line and explained the situation. Within two days his application was canceled and he was livid and my sisters think I'm the biggest asshole in the universe for this and I should have helped him commit fraud.

1612,Not the A-hole,"My future brother-in-law and his wife just had their first child. My BIL is the first of his generation in his family to have a baby, so everyone is so excited about the baby’s arrival. I love the baby so much and I love kids in general. 

However, my wedding is going to be an adults-only event. My mom feels very strongly that weddings are not a place for kids, and, to be honest, I kind of agree. At least, young children who might cry or just make noise in general have been distracting at weddings I’ve been to in the past. I’m sorry to anybody who disagrees; it’s not personal. 

Anyway, my BIL and his wife are adamantly insisting that they are going to bring the baby to the wedding, even after my fiancé mentioned a few times that we were not going to have kids at the wedding. Not only is my BIL insisting on bringing him, but he says it very aggressively, like “f*** that, I’m bringing my m******f***ing kid wherever I want.”  I am trying to be understanding of the fact that they are new parents and probably both excited to introduce family the baby and worried about leaving the baby with anyone else. But they are both in the bridal party, with him being the best man and her a bridesmaid, so they won’t really be able to hold the baby that much. Also I am worried that the responsibility of watching the baby will fall on my fiancé’s mom, dad, sister, or other close relatives and prevent them from being engaged in the day. I really think that would be hurtful to my fiancé in some way. My fiancé and his brother do not have the best relationship as it is and I do not want there to be any added tension between them at the wedding. 

Not to mention, my mom, who can be a very intimidating person, is absolutely 100% not willing to make an exception and allow the baby at the wedding. She said that if my BIL tried to bring the baby she would send him home... and I believe her. 

I don’t think I’m a selfish person and I hate the idea of coming across as one. But in the end, I really don’t like how my BIL is refusing to agree to our request and I don’t know if I can give in.

""They live out of state so of course they won't pay for two tickets to visit on the holidays."" ""We've broken up before so they don't feel it will last."" Etc etc etc 

Last Night he had a conversation with his dad over Skype. I wasn't listening to most of it until he started yelling at his dad (and mom who joined in the conversation.)

When I heard him ask if they really wanted him to choose between his family and his relationship, I took the chicken way out and left. I hid at a gas station getting a slushie until he got a hold of me and told me to come home.

He told me he had made his decision and he was picking us. And that made me really happy. 

But part of me felt really guilty. Even with the long distance he's always been close to his folks. And I guess this Pandora's box never got opened before with them.

No. Then I start getting text messages asking for Rosie. I reply that they have the wrong number. 

Nek minut. I'm getting texts from Rosie's daughters' school asking for my permission for her daughter to go on an excursion. I reply they have the wrong number. They continue texting me that same question for the week ahead.

As of recently (the last month or so). I keep getting spam text messages (i.e Telling Rosie she has won a million dollars or for Rosie to pick up her package from the post office etc.) 

As of two nights ago, the telemarketers started. Again, of course, asking for Rosie. I tell them they have the wrong number and instead give them Rosie's actual number (whose phone numbers' last two digits alternate from mine. Mine is 12, Rosie's is 21).

Now I have on multiple occasions texted Rosie multiple times to let her know that she is using the wrong number. She only ever replies 'thanks'.

Ok. So every so often (once a week), I get a call from a lady who wants to speak to Rosie. I tell her every time she had the wrong number. I keep giving her the right number. She keeps on calling me. Now I'm considering just telling her that Rosie has passed away to try to get her to stop calling. 

Now i do block every number that I can. But most of the numbers who are calling me are 'private numbers' and I can't block them.

Would it be wrong? Yes. Would it work? Probably not. Would it make me feel better? Yes. Is it illegal? Idk.

The job isn't terribly complicated, but I have to be sure and get every single piece correct every time, or the company could end up with a significant financial cost.  When I started the job I had 5-8 cases a day, so it was manageable and easy enough to stay on top of everything within the eight hour workday.

My fiancé moved to Atlanta late last year to start his own business, and has been asking me to join him ever since.  I agreed, and we planned on me moving down around Fourth of July.  However, after looking at the calendar I realized I would be leaving before second quarter bonuses were handed out (about $3,000), and we decided that kind of extra money was worth the wait.  Being apart is awful, but $3,000 will go a long long way while I'm looking for a new job.

My relationship with my mother has been off and on for years because she tends to gravitate toward the drama caused by my horrible sibling. Our relationship, with some issues here and there was pretty good; however, most recently, my daughter (who is white) was dating a black kid. Nice kid, we had him over all the time, he spoiled her. I told my mother about him because kiddo put photos of the two of them all over social media, but it was agreed that we keep it on the DL from mother's husband (technically not anymore but that's a long story), because he is a super racist. We're talking ""disowned his own daughter/has never met his grandchildren by her because she married a black man"" racist.

I replied, ""He's black. Why? Is there an issue? I know there's not one here, because we're not racist in my household."" Then, I added, ""What was the point of this exactly?

I proposed to my fiance 4 months ago on our anniversary. Since then we have both started new jobs, both entry level positions at large companies doing 60 hour weeks. As a result, we've not had time for wedding planning. We agreed to a long engagement and holding off telling people because of the new jobs.

Our anniversary is the day before my birthday, so the morning after I proposed my family decided to surprise me by showing up at my place early with presents. My fiance fell asleep wearing the engagement ring and when we answered the door she forgot to take the ring off, so my family found out before they were meant to. We then had to tell her family.

We got invited to dinner at her parent's house but when we got there it turned out to be a surprise engagement party with both our families. We went with it, and the night went OK, aside from people making us dance and our parents giving speeches in various stages of drunken crying.

My fiance and I talked privately about what we wanted for our wedding. We agreed on pretty much everything. We wanted something small with a dozen people in attendance (our immediate family and a couple friends), registrar's office, non religious ceremony, and a big reception for anyone not involved in the ceremony.

Today we had lunch with our mums, and all our sisters and they had files and schedules and shit.

We have a cake tasting, 2 venue viewings, and a meeting with a priest coming up in the next month. In a few months my fiance is also meant to pick out a dress, and I'm meant to get a tux. They want a spring wedding. Everything they've booked is scheduled on our days off, which we like to have free as we work 6 days a week.

We asked if they put down money for it and they've paid for some stuff. Entry fees to the cake tasting, a deposit on the fittings, deposits on both reception venues (apparently they're refundable), and money to my cousin so she can cater, plus some other stuff. They have a calendar from now until next spring and gave us the binder to take home and look at. They also gave us an email login.

I went to the bathroom, came back and found my fiance crying because the email they gave us had a bunch of RSVPs. They sent out save the dates.

My fiance basically just said she doesn't want this, any of it. We both feel like no one asked what we wanted and just went ahead and assumed, doing everything while we were distracted, and now we feel like we have to see this through and give everyone else the wedding they want, because people have replied saying they already booked time off work and our families have put down money. Some people have also sent us money directly to help pay for the wedding. The save the dates went out to well over 100 people, some we don't even know.

We just want something small, as few people as possible, no expensive outfits or venues or food, just simple and small.

WWBTA if we cancelled it and eloped?

EDIT: They're covering 5k between them but the total cost is 15k so they expect us to put up 10k to pay for it. This 5k comes on condition of the wedding being 15k, as they agreed to pay for 1/3 of the total cost between them.

EDIT 2: I'm a middle child with 2 sisters. The older one is divorced and ""never doing that \[marriage\] again"" and the younger one is just turning 17 so she probably won't be getting married for a while. My fiance's brother and sister in law eloped, and her mum had no problem with it because ""he's a boy, he doesn't care as much about the wedding"" but seems to have put her hopes for a big white wedding on my fiance, and fiance's half sister wasn't really involved in her life before now and seems to want to make up for it. Basically, both families are treating this wedding like it's the only one they'll have for a while, which it probably is.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: We rang them and spoke to them over the phone. We basically said we appreciate the effort that went in to all of this but we really don't want a huge wedding, we were much more comfortable just not doing all of the above stuff and instead sorting out our own, much smaller ceremony on our own time. We said we were grateful for everything they'd done for us and we might be keeping some stuff but the whole binder was a bit too much and we couldn't go through with all of this. They're really mad.

UPDATE 2: They now want us to pay them for the time they spent planning the wedding we didn't want.

UPDATE 3: They are no longer invited to the wedding.

1623,Not the A-hole,"Long time reader, first time poster.

This happened about 2 years ago. At the time I (25M) felt fully justified, but with the benefit of hindsight, I wonder if I was being oversensitive.

Some background on me: I am of Indian descent but was raised in California from the age of 3 onward. Frankly, my English is IMPECCABLE. Now onto the story:

A couple of years ago I was in the Iowa finishing up my Master's. As one might imagine there was a bit of a culture shock, with there be far less diversity than what I'm used to, but for the most part people were respectful.

One night I was at a bar with my GF at the time (She's white). Atmosphere: well-lit, soft music in the background, respectful patrons. Real classy. Even on the busiest days you can have a conversation without having to raise your voice.

I'm on my first drink of the evening, slowly sipping. At 6'3"" 190 lbs, I'm not even CLOSE to drunk, definitely not slurring. This is important. We're chatting with the bartender (BT) who is also a white female, probably late-20s. She seemed nice enough, but at some point the conversation goes like this:

BT: ""Your accent is so exotic. Where are you from?""

Me: ""Um, I didn't realize I had one. I'm American, a Citizen and everything""

BT: ""What? But you sound so foreign!""

I don't know why but I didn't like her use of that last word

Me, slightly agitated but hiding it: ""Well I am Indian but I've been here my whole life. Did you mean like a Californian accent?"" Trying to give her a way out

BT: ""No I mean you sound like, Foreign!""

Really emphasizing that last word

Me, not hiding agitation as well: ""Nobody has ever made that comment before. Here or otherwise. In fact I feel like you and I are speaking pretty much the same""

BT, noticing my irritation: ""Oh it's probably just me, it's so loud in here""

It wasn't. I could hear conversations from across the bar in full clarity. BT was standing right in front of us. That was an obvious lie.

GF must've sensed the tension because she sidetracks us and brings me outside for a smoke. Initially I said nothing. But then GF says that was rude on her part. I agreed; I already felt like a fish out of water being the ONLY non-white person in the bar out of 30 or so people, and her repetitive and emphatic use of the word ""foreign"" only served to make me feel more out of place

So, in retribution, on the tipline, instead of a tip I wrote ""not foreign."" Then we downed our drinks and left. It was a $10 tab so even a generous tip would've been like $3, so I didn't think it was that big of a deal

But in these last couple of years, since I've been back in California, I've had time to think and I'm wondering

Perhaps she was just making an innocent (albeit stupid) remark, and I blew it out of proportion by deciding to take a chunk out of her income. Yeah, not all that much, but in principle, I can see how I may have been a jerk.

1625,Not the A-hole,"To give the full background I got relocated for my job out of college a couple years ago so I don’t get to see my parents in person too often. 

I went home for the 4th of July and mentioned to them that I’ll be moving into a new apartment in a couple weeks. They insisted that they come out and help but I knew this was a bad idea because I know how my parents (maybe all parents?) get in those types of situations so I respectfully declined.  They booked a flight anyway to come out last Friday, pack my stuff up over the weekend, move Monday, and leave Tuesday.

Everything over the weekend went really well and I was happy they came out but sure enough move-in day rolled around and they were short fused and out for blood. There was an issue getting the electricity transferred over right away as well as an issue with my apartment accepting a personal check vs a money order or cashiers check. These caused some delays but by the end of the day everything worked out and I got moved in.  Despite that, my parents took these issues and used them to absolutely chew me out.  I mean, I’ve been chewed out before but they turned those hiccups into full blown rants about how I’ve always been a bad planner and how this will translate over into my job and relationships with friends and future spouses; these went on for almost the entire day.  They really cut me down and made me feel not great and by the end of the day I just shut down on them and kept conversation/interaction to a minimum.

Tuesday (yesterday) we woke up and went to breakfast. They felt really bad and tried apologizing but I just wasn’t having it, I only get to see them in person a handful of times each year and was really looking forward to moving into my new apartment but now I have a really sour taste about being there and how moving in went down. I still don’t have many friends in the new city that I’m in so it upset me even more that my relationship with two of the people I’m closest with is a bit fractured. It was really awkward dropping them off at the airport and they were heartbroken I didn’t fully accept their apology but I still just feel like absolute garbage from that day.

I was just reading the menu when a girl maybe in her 20s approached me and said excuse me. Honestly I couldn’t tell for sure if she was homeless or not. I looked at her and she didn’t say anything so I just went back to the menu. She said excuse me again so I said she could go before me if she was already ready to order. Then she said, “Actually I’m homeless and was wondering if you would get me a little cake.” 
I became super uncomfortable in that moment. 

Living in London, I’m used to being near homeless people. When they go car to car in the tube asking for money, I usually give them some because they’re always polite and it’s a gamble to spend money to ride the tube in hopes of getting more. 

But I was so uncomfortable with being approached by the girl in the middle of ordering my food and being asked if I could get her some as well. I felt like I was specifically targeted and trapped.

He gave us a plan of what he wanted to do (travel a bit, before coming home and getting a job, his own place to live, etc.). It’s a pretty solid plan. We’ve told him we’ll support him.

A little while later, we did decide that we would give his college fund to his sister to help supplement her studies. With the rest of it, she might not need loans at all, at least for her undergraduate degrees (she’s considering a master’s). My son found out about this and got mad. He said that he assumed he’d still get his college fund, because it’s money we set aside for him and we said “Yeah, for college.” And since he wasn’t going, the next logical step was to give it to his sister, who was going.

He said that his plans to travel and having a place to live when he gets back were screwed without the money. We assumed that he had some saved, since he’s been working the past couple of summers. He’s telling us that he’s putting it towards a car. He says it’s not fair if we give it to his sister. I think that because the money was always meant for college, it’s fair if we give it to the child going to college. He’ll still have money to travel, just not all the places he wants, he’ll have to come home a bit sooner, and he just won’t have a car.

Am I being an ass here?

1631,Not the A-hole,"So I [22 F] am a triplet [22F][22M] and we all kind of come and go from my parent’s home. We all lead separate lives and work/college tend to keep each of us busy. 

I happen to be the only person at my parent’s home when a distant acquaintance comes to the door. Let’s call him John. I knew of John from years back when we attended the same high school. We never talked and he wasn’t close to my other siblings. Just simply a classmate who I didn’t think much of.

I answer the door and John explains to me that earlier in the day he ran into my sister at his job (retail). She talked to him briefly and then left after buying some clothes.

He explains that he came to the house to ask my sister out and give her a letter. When I asked how he got our address he then starts apologizing profusely saying he knows it’s creepy but he searched around the internet and found our home address.

At this point I was fed up to be honest. If he knows it’s creepy he shouldn’t of come. He knows our social media stuff, he could have messaged her instead. But more then that- this is my parent’s home. That’s also a breach of their privacy. I felt there was a better way he could have handled it.

I said “please leave I’m not ok with you coming here,” and closed the door before he could answer. I texted my sister about what happened. She had a boyfriend at the time and they both talked it over and handled the rest privately. She was definitely not ok with it either.

When I talked to my own boyfriend about it however, he thought I was overreacting. He said I was too harsh and the guy meant no harm. 

I’m not saying John had ill-intent but it felt wrong for him to show up like that. But maybe I was too harsh. So AITA here?",44,114,0.97
1632,Everyone Sucks,"I'm on the bus home and it's rush hour. There's only one seat left at the back of the bus and it's right next to where I'm sitting. The bus stops, passengers shuffle on and this pretty girl just stands in front of the empty seat and blocks anyone else from sitting.

I'm reading from my phone but after a while I look up and see the girl just staring me so I raise my eyebrow at her but she doesn't say anything, she just keeps staring at me like I disgust her. So finally I ask ""What's your problem?"" She says ""Could you maybe not sit there?""

A middle-aged lady scootches by and asks if anyone's sitting there, and I say no but the girl says ""Yeah, I am, but not if he's sitting there. He gives me the creeps,""

I say ""Woah lady, you got problems. If you don't wanna sit, other people do,"" but the other lady is too polite to ask so I just stare back at the girl. Another passenger, another middle-aged lady, asks me if it's okay to swap seats with me. I see what she's doing and decide fine, whatever.

As we both get up to swap, a dude quickly sits down in her spot. The older lady, seeing how I got jacked, got up and offered me back my spot, but I let it go. The dude quickly put on his head phones and pretended to sleep and I seriously fought the urge to just rip his ear buds out and tell him to get off (but I didn't because I'm a coward).

Meanwhile the girl finally sat down and is smirking at me so now I'm stuck standing for my hour-long commute home. So I tell the kind lady I changed my mind, and I'd like my seat back, which means now I'm sitting down next to the girl, who looks absolutely disgusted, and the poor, kind lady who tried to be a diplomat is now suffering because she tried to do the right thing. Since the dude who's pretending to sleep has his eyes closed, everyone just stares at me for screwing everything up.

I tell my friends about this and the girls say I should've just manned up and let it go. The guys say it's good that I stood up for myself instead of getting screwed over and just taking it. The girls say that by insisting on sitting next to that girl, I'm proving that I'm a creep. I tell them it's her problem to deal with. I was just sitting on the bus minding my own business, so if they think that's creepy, they can go screw themselves. Now the girls are calling me a creep and the guys and I just left.

I’m a pretty die hard fan, and I wanted to do all the audience participation that I saw in old recordings with Freddie. Of COURSE it’s impossible to replicate that without the best frontman of all time, but I was floored by how dead the audience was. If one person clapped, you could hear it from the other side of the auditorium— and it was a huge venue. Everyone remained firmly seated in my section when they came out. No one sang along when Adam lambert or Brian May told us to, even during a song where Queen is known for leaving gaps for audience participation. I mean, I’d understand if this was some low key music, but it’s QUEEN for Christ’s sake. I sat for a while, but could not take it, and proceeded to stand, scream, and sing along per Adam‘s instructions.  The tickets were expensive, and I wanted to have a good time!

1634,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend that’s been telling me been a lot of catcalling stories, for the past few months now. These I wouldn’t question, because it’s a serious issue for women and I deal with it myself from time to time. She also lives in a more city-ish area than I do, so I believe it could happen more often. What I don’t believe, is what she says happens after it happens. 

For example, she’ll say a guy will make a lewd comment at her and then she’ll make a very big comeback, screaming and cursing at them, making them so embarrassed. Pretty much, what all of r/thathappened is made of, or what you wish you would’ve said after you walked away. These sorts of things she claims happen every day to her. Now, she is very pretty and this is a problem in today’s society, but I don’t think it’s an every day problem. Plus, like I said, she almost always ends up confronting them and yet, never ends up putting herself in danger, which to me is weird because as a woman myself, I would be terrified to stand up to a man doing this. It’s good if she really is and if nothing is happening, because it spreads awareness, but I have my doubts and it overall just isn’t spreading a good message, plus it makes her look really stupid. (She puts these on social media too).

The thing is before this, she was super into her looks. She would constantly talk about how pretty she was and just say “God, how gorgeous am I?” It's good that she's so confident! I'm proud of her, just pointing it out for context. S She’s obsessed with makeup and even wanted to give me a “makeover” once upon a time, because I don’t really wear makeup. So, I didn’t know if this was another call to attention to her looks or if it was legitimate for a long time.

Yesterday, she told me yet another story of how she got hit on at the post office and that she pretended to be gay to make him leave. Then apparently someone else made a comment about how she was so powerful for doing so. I made a comment in reply saying “Then everyone clapped, right?” She asked what I meant by that and I said that was just about her fifth story that week about being hit on by a random person, and how it was so annoying that she had to stand up to them. She got really mad and said I had no right to say that. I told her if she was really being harassed, then I was sorry, but it was just happening far too often for me to really believe that she had that many good comeback lines and that she was able to do it without getting hurt. She got even more pissed, called me jealous and hung up the phone.

1637,Asshole,"My girlfriend is 22 and I am 26, we’ve been together for 3 years and our relationship is great besides this one issue. She had 5 tattoos before she met me, all on her rib cage. I find women with tattoos look very trashy but didn’t say anything as they’re not visible unless we’re at the beach or she’s in skimpy clothing.         
          
Lately she’s been showing me various tattoos from Pinterest and Instagram. I haven’t been very responsive to the things she shows me. She asked me what my issue was and I told her my stance on tattoos. She rolled her eyes and said that the ones on her ribs weren’t a problem but now that she wants more, I’m being a crybaby. I ignored her rantings because I figured she wasn’t getting more. We have more than enough money for them but if she hasn’t gotten one in three years, I figured she wouldn’t now.        
        
I was wrong. She came home with another rib tattoo, and even worse a huge piece on her thigh. Her father has an issue with her having tattoos and I’ve witnessed him talking to her about regret and such. I decided to text him and let him know I was worried about her obsession and he agreed. He invited us over.          
           
We sat down together over coffee and her dad started talking to her about wanting to see the tattoos and she shot me the dirtiest look ever, knowing I told him. He went into a rant about regrets and that you want to get tattoos when you’re in your 40s and have permanent hobbies/interests (which I fully agree with). She snarkily replied that taking 45 years to get a cross on your arm really sounds like it took a lot of thought (he has a cross on his arm and it’s his only tattoo).      
        
I told her to cool it, and that she’s ignorant to bash his cross tattoo when her flowers and butterflies and cursive won’t withstand 45 years of changes either. She started to cry and asked why I even dated her if I had such an issue with tattoos and her dad tried to tell her she needed to calm down but she stormed off and told me she’d venmo me money for an Uber home but that she was going home alone right now.

However, I don’t go out of my way to watch my grandchildren. If she asks and I’m not working or if I’m free, then of course I’ll say yes. But I’m not one to offer up a free weekend here or there. It’s just not in my style to do so. I raised my son and while I do love my grandchildren and want to spend time with them, I don’t have interest in helping raise them.

Recently, my daughter-in-law sat me down and admitted to me that she was in therapy for a multitude of reasons. She opened up to me that she was very stressed and said that she had been diagnosed with postpartum depression after the birth of her second child. I apologized for not noticing what she was going through and she said it was okay, that she did what she had to, in order to hide it. She then told me, however, that she was upset with me for never offering to watch the kids, that she had to always come to me. She says that her mom occasionally takes them for a weekend but that it’s not often and that she needs more breaks. I told her I could take them a little bit more, but she needs to tell me what she needs and that I’m no mind reader. If she wants something from me, she has to come forward. She got very upset with this and said I should just offer, as a grandma. I told her that grandmothers are not immediate childcare, though I would be more than willing to watch them more now that I knew about her situation. She was still hurt by what I said and left.

1640,Not the A-hole,"I’ll make this as short as possible. I won’t be repeating it again, but, from my side, this isn’t epistemic of a feud, a massively unbalanced friendship or some kind of SO rivalry; this is all based around the wedding.

One of my closest university friends got married last week. We have known each other for nearly 10 years, had lived together for 4 years, and have been in pretty much constant contact since we stopped living with each other, visiting each other at least twice a year since, even though we live 250 miles apart. In attendance at the wedding was more or less everyone from our core group, including other housemates. I found out about the wedding actually having taken place from a Facebook relationship change  - I thought, and had been told by the bride as soon as she got engaged, that I was invited to the wedding, and it was happening much later on, as the bride and groom needed to save up. To say I was shocked and hurt was an understatement.

I contacted some of the friends that had been in attendance the day after, and was told by all of them that the bride had said that I had said I would never have been able to make it (save the dates had apparently been sent out 6 months before); one said that the bride had told her months before to remember not to mention wedding plans to me since I was apparently going through something that I didn’t want to discuss, which was why I couldn’t attend. I contacted the bride yesterday (she had returned home from her honeymoon) to ask why she was lying about me being invited, and she said that she knew it was petty, but since my husband and I had eloped a year earlier, she didn’t want to ‘reward’ that with an invite to her wedding, but didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me outright. Regarding me, we had always planned to ‘elope’ as we always wanted to get married abroad in the total opposite to a destination wedding location, but had numerous ‘wedding receptions’ when we returned home to celebrate with friends and family, including the current bride and groom. I knew I would say the wrong thing, so haven’t compiled a full response to that yet.

While no one’s outright called me an asshole, I know that ultimately I shouldn’t be hurt over what my friend wanted, but I am.

1643,Not the A-hole,"This is pretty low stakes, but I am curious what people think, and I'll do my best to be even-handed in retelling this. 

About a year ago, my wife and I went to a restaurant near our apartment.  When we got there, the place was basically empty.  We ordered appetizers and drinks, which came quickly enough, and then we ordered our food -- I think I got grilled fish and she got chicken.   About the time we ordered food, a group of about 10 guys came in -- it looked like a bachelor party but I wasn't sure -- but otherwise the place was still mostly empty.

Anyway, our food didn't come out for more than an hour (maybe an hour and fifteen minutes) after we ordered.  During this time, we got no updates from our server about the timing, and she never came by our table to say ""hey, sorry the food is taking so long.""   She was, however, being much more attentive to the party that came in after us.

Our food eventually came out, and it was OK but not great -- definitely not worth a super long wait.  So after we finish, we pay, leaving a normal 20% tip. (I was annoyed the waitress didn't check on us, but it's not like she was the one cooking the food, so I didn't blame her much). 

As we are walking out, a guy who is clearly the owner is standing at the front. I can't remember if he asked us how the meal was, or if I went up to him, but I'll assume I went up to him and said something like, ""Hey the food was pretty slow and no one really came by to give us a heads up about that, which we would have appreciated since we waited for over an hour.""  I didn't ask for or want a refund; I honestly just wanted to vent and probably was hoping for an apology.  Instead, the guy cut me off and smugly said, ""Well we've been here a long time, and we're happy with how we run things.""

I work for a large company as a developer. My boss is not technical, so he only understands results, and doesn't really understand how those results happen. Therefore his management decisions aren't necessarily based on who does the most work, but who looks like they're doing the most work. 

&#x200B;

When I realized this, I made a quick script that basically looks like hackertype (it looks like the movies where the ""computer guy"" is furiously ""hacking back"") and I run it on one of my spare monitors. So when i'm tooling around on stack overflow and what not, it looks like i'm running multiple tests and working at the same time (which, I am working, but not as efficiently as he probably believes).

&#x200B;

Now i'm good at my job, but i'm certainly not the best developer on my team. Monday I was informed by my boss that I am being promoted to manage my own team on account of my work ethic. It's a really big promotion, comes with much better benefits and a pay raise.

When I told my wife I was promoted and she was obviously very happy, but kind of confused b/c I have told her before about some of the other better developers. I confessed about the script and she said it's a bit of a dick move to the other developers, but was nonetheless happy for me.

My thoughts are that being able to read other people is a really important skill for managers, and I was simply able to read my manager better than the other developers were. That said, it definitely undermines the meritocracy aspect of a workplace.

At the reception, my daughter was given a different table assignment from the rest of the family. It turned out to be a ""kids"" table. My relative might have thought that my daughter would have more fun over there, but my daughter was a lot older than the other kids and did not know any of them. The other kids were being kind of gross and annoying, so she asked to sit with the rest of our family. It wasn't a problem to shift over and add another chair so it seemed like there was no problem. When the wait staff brought out the food, we explained to them that my daughter had moved, and getting her food wasn't a problem.

The wedding planner realized that my daughter had moved, and said that my daughter had to go back to the other table during dinner. I said my daughter was more comfortable with the family and wanted to sit with us. The wedding planner said that my daughter needed to stay in her assigned seat during the meal and could see us during the dancing. I said ""she's actually going to eat dinner here, thank you"". The wedding planner stopped arguing and left, and my family thought it was weird that she tried to make my daughter move.

After the wedding, the bride's mom called my mom, angry that I had disobeyed the wedding planner and changed the seating arrangement without asking first. I didn't ask first because it never occurred to me that the bride or her mom would care about this during the wedding.

Additional edit since I’m still getting responses:

1. These issues didn’t exist when the house was inspected or during the tenants walkthrough.

2. There were no other reports of issues until the repair request I received today.

3. Refer to first edit. I’ve seen the light - I’m going to do all the repairs.

While I can appreciate your enthusiasm regarding this topic, please refrain from resorting to these insults - it serves no purpose.

I’m a landlord, and my tenant has submitted repair tickets on every major appliance in the kitchen except the microwave which was replaced 4 years ago.

The complaints are:

* the dishwasher is rusted and doesn’t work.

* the ice maker in the fridge doesn’t work.

* one of the burners on the oven doesn’t work.

* the kitchen sink is leaking.

In my opinion, the ice maker isn’t necessary for the function of a refrigerator. If they want it fixed, they can pay for it. Same with the dishwasher. The sink leak and oven repair I’ll deal with right away, but I’m not replacing anything.

I’m getting the impression from these complaints that the tenant wants me to replace these systems based on the verbiage used in the original complaint, and I’m concerned about how they’ll take it when I tell them I don’t think I’m on the hook for an ice maker and a dishwasher.

Sure, I’ll fix/replace the dishwasher and eventually the fridge’s ice maker, but I’m not going to be footing the bill for a repair guy to come out and deal with it right now because they are non-essential to the function of the kitchen. If the freezer or refrigerator portions of the fridge weren’t working, that’s a different thing - but the ice maker?

1651,Not the A-hole,"I am 27f, my sister is 16 (almost 17). She lives with our parents and has always been very .... Lively ....

She announced a month ago that for her birthday in July she was going to have a ""special"" celebration. She and I have always been close, so I pumped her for more details. She eventually admit it was a ""coming out"" party. 

Normal I would have been happy and supportive, but she had been dating the same guy since she was 13, so I was confused. Was she coming out as Bi? Trans didn't make sense because she has always been a girly girl, but I guess not impossible. 


She wouldn't give me details. It was ""part of the surprise"". It's 3 weeks before the party, and her best friend and I are talking (I get that for some people, it's weird that I'm close to my sister's friends. But she is also very close to mine, we're just one of those kinds of families. Despite our age gap, we are both very close), and she lets me know that this party is actually a ""coming out as straight party"". I instantly became completely enraged, I thought it was so insincere and disingenuous. It just all came across as very attention-seeking and stupid. I told her best friend as such, and her best friend immediately got angry with me for not seeing that it was my sister's job as an lgbtq + Ally to do her part and destigmatize coming out .... 

So here's where the part of our age Gap comes into play, I know that I am 10 years older than her, so sometimes I'm not totally ""with it"", but this seemed super disrespectful to me for what people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans, everything else have to go through .... The way it was explained to me though is that by everyone having a coming out party between the time that they are 16 and 18, eventually coming out won't be such a trauma for those who have ""alternative sexualities"".

Her best friend has asked me to please not talk to her about it because she's super duper excited about the party and having her sister not support her would be a ""major bummer"". I feel like it's my job to let her know that what she's doing is wrong and taking advantage of a community that historically has been super duper taken advantage of .... But that doesn't seem to be the way that her friends are taking it. Am I in the wrong?

 edit: just to be clear, I love my sister. I know that if she is sincere about this, she's doing it with a ""woke"" attitude and she really does believe that what she's doing is to help. If I'm NTA, I don't know how to convince her that she is, cuz I sincerely think she is trying to do her best.

1658,Asshole,"Sorry for weird title

So, for the last 4 or so years, i have loved the show bojack horseman. I have not made that a secret with my friend group. Pretty much every season i would try to convince them to watch it, with little result.

So, finally, i made a deal. I would share my netflix account with a friend for him to watch that show specifically. No other show was mentioned. After a few weeks, i finally heard from him that he watched a couple of episodes. Happy me.

The problem arises today. While hanging out, and him almost done with the show, he opened netflix on his phone to watch it and i noticed he downloaded more than just bojack. He, a full weeb, downloaded at least 2 seasons of some anime.

Now, i don't mind it. I really don't. Maybe a little part of me is annoyed somebody is playing with my toy, but overall i am happy to share. But, i never heard him ask if he can use my account to watch other stuff. And that annoys me.

I told him, and he said he never knew he had to ask. He then asked if i wanted him to delete my account. I said no, i just wish he asked. Since then no answer, but i suppose it is hard to respond to that. 

Now, AITA for being annoyed?

Edit: so i realized, thanks to the glorious power of reddit, that i am quite bad at making rational decisions about sharing. I apologized and just asked him to use the guest account. See ya next week",26,36,0.82

We went out for dinner last night and I was already dreading the ordering as soon as we walked in. 

We get the menus and Jackie doesn’t even look at the menu. She starts talking about her day and then the waitress comes back and asks us if we know what we wanna order yet. 

Jackie has still barely glanced at the menu and I can feel myself getting more and more pissed off and annoyed.

She then gets up and goes the the washroom and the waitress comes back afterwards. She says she’ll come back when Jackie is back but I stop her and say that she told me to order for her. 

I order something for Jackie and she comes back from the washroom. 

I told her that she took so long and was being embarrassing so I ordered for her.

She didn’t say much and got quiet the rest of the night. Which was fine by me.

I asked her to remind me to bring it next time we meet.

My roommate bryan asked me to go out with him on another day. He didn't tell me then but turns out it was a blind date with one of his Gf's friends. We had fun and what not and we exchanged numbers.

Met kate next time and she bugged me about the tickets saying that she wanted to her boyfriend to the concert. I gave her the tickets. She was so happy.

Next weekend I met that girl stephanie again. She talked about this concert and how she was dying to go but tickets were sold out. I thought that I could get lucky with her if I invited her. Forgot even that I gave the tickets to kate. I just looked at her and said "" I have two tickets"". Her reaction told me it was the right call and we decided to go together. 

I had to make an excuse to kate about the tickets so I told her that my aunt who gave me the tickets wanted it back. She was disheartened but gave it to me. A white lie right?

I took my date stephanie to the concert and it was surprisingly good and I had fun. In fact I got lucky that night.

Yeah, she found out later. Stephanie posted on her Instagram and a mutual friend told her about the posts. 

Next weekend she demanded an explanation. I told her that I mean these are my tickets after all and I just lied to not hurt your feelings. I told her about me and Stephanie and asked her to understand the situation. She was just changed the subject and we hung out normally.

I've obliged with drinking the water because I thought thats the *least* I could do. 

I've been a little skeptical about going to the meetings because they feel like a pyramid scheme of sorts and because I sorta feel like this whole thing is a scam.

Her current lifestyle doesn't embody healthy living which is where I get hypercritical. She rarely eats breakfast, doesn't eat the healthiest of foods, skips meals, doesn't exercise, etc. Yet she goes to these water training meetings and tries to tell me about the health benefits of alkaline water. Every time she brings up this subject matter to me I put up my dukes. I find it ironic that someone wants promote drinking alkaline water as a healthy alternative when the other aspect of their life isn't 'healthy'. She thinks I take things zero to one-hundred when I argue with her about this; like one should do their part to be healthy (i.e. drink alkaline water at the least)

1663,Everyone Sucks,"For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement “Never Have I Ever cheated before” came up.

Now’s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my “boyfriend” of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn’t drink, he went “hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex’s name*). You have to drink to that!”

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn’t haven’t any of it and ended things on the spot. I’m numb. I’m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words. I just can’t look at him right now. He ruined my life.

I am 17, I've always been very, very shy and have zero experience with girls. I think because I'm so quiet people think I'm kind of weird but I've never so much as sent a dick pic, dirty text, dirty pm, creeped a girl out or anything. 

My dad basically was worried about me this summer because he feels I'm ""falling behind"" in my social development because I don't have a lot of friends and don't really go out. So he signed me up for this Counselor in Training course at a local summer camp. I thought I was going to hate it so much but I've discovered that I'm actually really good at outdoors stuff and I've had a blast, I've even made a few friends. 

We had an overnight trip this weekend and I was paired up with this girl ""Jessica"" as my CIT partner. She is 16 and we were with a great group of kids who really handled themselves well so we got to do a lot of talking. It's the first time a girl has ever paid any sort of attention to me in my life and it was amazing. We just laughed and talked and had so much fun and she was actually like interested in my family (my mom died when I was really young, like her dad did) my school and that I want to be a pilot in the Marines. 

When we got back to the base camp my guy friend said I had to ask her out. I got up all my nerve and asked if she'd like to go into town with me to see spiderman that was Sunday night. She said yes. But I'm not sure if she misunderstood me or what because when it came time to get on the van to the movies she said she was going with her friends. When we got there I sat by myself and she sat with all her friends like literally across the theater from me. 

I didn't say anything that night and she left with her day group for Monday and Tuesday. I couldn't think about anything else because I felt like such an idiot. I saw her last night with a group of her friends and my friend said I need to talk to her. So I got all my nerve up and just said to her ""hey, I had a really nice time with you on our overnight, I didn't mean to make anything weird and I just want to be friends.""

1676,Asshole,"About thirty years ago, I became engaged to a lady. I bought a set of rings. They were pretty expensive at that time. I spent around $10,000. The engagement was broken and we did not get married. I kept the rings. A few years later, I met someone else. I married her and used the same rings. We were married for about 16 years before we divorced. At the time, I let her keep the rings. That was about 8 years ago. Recently, she needed me to sign some paperwork on a piece of property. At that point, I decided I wanted the rings. She did not want to but did give them back. She told mutual friends about me getting them. They are telling me that I am an asshole for getting them. I intend to get them cleaned and appraised. At that point, I intend to sell them.  What say you? Am I the asshole?


To add a little more to this, there was nothing on my part that made her think I would not sign the paperwork.
As for the rings having sentimental value to her, some maybe. But she wanted none of the pictures from all of the years we were married. During the time we were married, I gave her lots of jewelry. It is much more valuable than just the rings by themselves. 

I made good money while we were married. When she came in to the union, she was deeply in debt. I paid it all off. I also paid for her to go back to school to get her bachelors and masters degrees. I also ultimately paid for her cpa license. 

After our divorce, I severely damaged my back and could no longer work. The money I had saved for retirement went for medical bills and for me to live on as I recovered. I am currently on disability. I recently found out I have eye cancer. That is going to be an expensive deal. By us getting rid of that property, it will completely remove her from any liabilities as to any debt I have or will acquire in the future.

1678,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at end
Background: I have dogs & cats. All of them have been rescued from being strays/abandoned, etc. I’ve also been fostering for 2 years. Obviously, I love animals. I’m 24 & moved out of my mom’s house 3 years ago when my boyfriend and I got a house together because I didn’t feel my pets and I were safe. Without going into detail, my mother has never been easy to live with but my last 7 years in her house were hell.
About 7 years ago (I was 17), I rescued a starving, sick kitten that I found in a parking lot across the street from a burning building. He was screaming, and alone, & starved. I took him home, fed & took him to the vet. I named him Scout. Because I had pets already, my younger brother decided Scout would be “his” cat. I didn’t mind because I was still living in the same house.
 A few months before moving out, I had worked a 17 hr shift and I got home asking about Scout because I had not seen him. NOBODY else noticed him missing. My boyfriend and I put up posters, walked the neighborhood for hours and put his litter box out. My brother did not help us look. The next night, boyfriend and I again searched all day. Around 11pm, we went out to check the litter box again and he had returned!! When I moved out, I took all the pets except Scout because my brother and mom wouldn’t let me. I begged them to be careful.
Well... not even a month after I moved out, I was told Scout was missing again. ONLY boyfriend and I again searched. We did everything we could to find scout. We kept it up for months but Scout never came home or was found. Over the last few years, I’ve continued to look for him and get email alerts for lost/found pets on my city. I check every one in case it’s him. I was devastated and have felt guilty about not bringing him with me.
Yesterday, while checking the animal shelter page, I saw a freshly posted cat I KNEW was him. By then, the shelter was closed. I showed my boyfriend, and he agrees it’s him. I texted my brother right away and sent him the picture. He said it looks like Scout. When I asked if he wanted to go see him at the shelter, he asked if today. I explained it was closed but he could go tomorrow AM since I can’t go till after work, around 5PM. All he replied with was “yea maybe”.
My boyfriend and I decided we will go after work, adopt scout, bring him home, & not to tell anyone. Would I be the asshole if I do this?
TL;DR: Cat that I rescued as a kitten 7 years ago was deemed my brother’s cat when we all lived together. He was let out to escape from mom & brother’s house a month after I moved out(3 years ago). Brother and mom wouldn’t let me take him with me when I moved. They never helped in extensive search for him.  I’ve still been on the lookout and found the cat in my local animal shelter page, posted for adoption yesterday. Brother didn’t react much when I told him. My boyfriend and I decided we will bring Scout home with us without telling anyone.",25,29,0.84

Nate and Ethan wanted to talk privately about some work thing, some disagreement with a client, and at one point I was alone with James.

I started to feel like he was hitting on me, being kind of flirty and touchy, and I was NOT into it. I was giving one word answers and playing with my phone rather than reciprocating. I felt a little awkward telling him to stop it because he was toeing the line of plausible deniability and I felt like he'd probably just say he hadn't been doing anything.

I turned on my phone's voice recorder app though, I always do it when I suspect someone is crossing a line, it's saved my ass before. It is legal in my state to record like that fyi. And it was on when James asked me if I wanted to 'get out of here' 

I asked 'to where' and he said ""maybe we could go to my car and listen to that some music"" 

And I said ""Huh, and what else?"" And he kinda stuttered and said that he'd like to get to know me better and spend some time just with me.

I asked ""what about your wife"" and he started telling me about how they're practically roommates, only together for the kids, how she's probably been seeing other people too. I didn't say much, just nodded along for a while until he was done. Then I said ""Nah, I'm not into that"" and I excused myself to the bathroom.

I was pissed off that James would try to cheat on his wife, I've met her and she's a sweet lady. I was also pissed off that he'd try to get with me, his coworker. I used to work at a different company with really shitty company culture, and I've become fed up with old-ass married engineers who try to fuck the new young employee. I just wanna not deal with that.

So, I sent an email to James's wife, whose email I knew since she had replied to a company mailing list email about a holiday party.

And I said ""I don't know if you remember me, but I'm (OP) and I work with your husband. We meet at the last company Christmas party. I'm really sorry to have to tell you like this, but your husband is trying to cheat on you. I know that might be hard to believe coming from a near-stranger so I've attached a recording of that.""

And I got a reply from her kind of lashing out at me for leading him on. And for trying to hurt her by attaching the recording which really hurt to hear. 

I really wasn't trying to lead him on, the only reason I was asking leading questions like ""to where"" and ""what else"" were to get him to say what he was doing.

But I'm questioning whether it was too much to send the actual audio. I feel for her, it must have hurt to hear.

My husband does have a good job, however, he has quit 2 jobs since moving here 9 months ago. He quit his over the road job, took another over the road job because he didn’t find anything local. Then he quit that one and found something local. Now he wants to quit this one. I am not being very supportive and he is frustrated with me. 

To be fair, his job does suck. He starts at 4/5, gets home a lot of nights at 7/8. He works way more than 8 hours but he doesn’t make DT or OT because he gets paid by mileage. He hates it because he feels like he has no life. He even goes in on Saturday’s a lot. I feel for him and I do think maybe he can get a better job but I’m also stressed because the last 8 months have been really rough financially.

They each have their own friend groups, their own activities, they take different classes, far from being attached at the hip like they were when they were little. I think the fact they went to the same middle school contributed to a lot of rifts with them. They were heavily influenced by friends who would pick on the other twin (this went both ways; son’s friends would pick on my daughter for being “stupid” since she has a learning disability, daughter’s friends would pick on my son for being a “loser” for playing video games). There were lots of times they would come home from school fighting because of what happened at school. Generally, though, they’d get along better outside of school.

This year, my husband and I looked into other high schools in the area to see if it was possible to put them in different schools. We actually found that one school has a really great special education program, much better than our default school, that would be perfect for my daughter, since, as I said, she has a learning disability. We put in the request to transfer her there, unsure of whether the request would even be accepted, and we talked to the twins about it. Neither of them seemed to think much of it. Now, though, we’ve gotten word that the request was accepted, and the twins are both upset. My daughter says it’s not fair she has to go to a different school, my son says that he wanted his sister in high school with him. Ever since we found out that the request was accepted, the twins have been teaming up and trying to guilt us for splitting them up. 

I honestly didn’t think splitting them up would make them so upset. They’ve already been split up these past couple years as they were always in different classes and friend groups. And they didn’t seem to mind when I first told them the idea. But now I’m wondering, should we be splitting them up? AITA for wanting to send them to different schools?",57,352,0.94

1689,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while back, but still comes up every now and then, so I wanted to get another opinion. As a bit of background, I was 22 when this happened, and my friend, who I'll call Dan, was 23.

I was browsing a subreddit dedicated to freebies one night, when I saw a post for free adult diapers. I was about to ignore it, when I thought it'd be funny to order it for my friend, and since it seemed low effort and quick, I did. I filled out a brief form using mostly fake info, but used his real first name and address. Then I moved on and completely forgot about it.

About a month or two later, Dan lost his shit in a group chat with me and a couple other friends. He was blowing up, demanding to know what asshole sent diapers to his house. My friends thought it was pretty funny, but Dan's reaction was waaay too extreme. I confessed almost immediately and explained how I found it for free, and it was just meant as a shitty joke, but he was still absolutely livid. After he spent ~20 minutes berating me and calling me some of the most imaginative, putrid, incredible insults I've ever read, he explained why he was so mad. 

What I had forgotten when I made the order was that Dan's parents, who he was still living with at the time, have always insisted on opening and checking his mail. So when they opened up a package addressed to him and found adult diapers, they were scared shitless. They were 100% convinced that Dan had contracted some disease that made him lose control of his bowels and was too scared to come clean. Everytime he tried to explain that it was just a bad prank, they didn't buy it, and just assumed he was making excuses out of embarassment.

I apologized, and while he was still mad about it for a while, it was eventually forgotten and we moved on. But whenever it does come up in conversation

• I try and explain how I didn't intend for his parents to see it, and just thought he would open it up, be confused, and throw it out. 

•He insists I should've known his parents would've seen it, and that it was idiotic (it was). 

Also

• Yes we both know opening someone else's mail is illegal. 

• Yes I know it was a relatively unfunny joke, but I figured since I had shit all to do, and it was seemingly harmless, why not.

When I came back from vacation yesterday one of my long term employees, who I trust and appreciate, presented me with a list of things this new person had done wrong in my absence.  Most of the things are defects I can work with (too bossy and know it all) however on the list were two instances of her eating chocolate and caramels without paying for them. All told she didn't pay for $8 in merchandise.

I want to fire her. I feel like stealing is a morality issue, which I cannot help with fixing. If she is comfortable stealing even $8, she is capable of taking anything. The owner is on the fence, and wants to give her another chance.

In the end it is the owner's decision, but I'm not sure how hard to press my point.  Am I being to harsh and AITA?

I will be going to a wedding in arizona this year, so double checked with the friend in california if it would be a good time to visit. She said yes, there's lots of room at her place, stay as long as I can, so I booked 10 days. 

After booking flights, car rental,  visa, all that, she tells me a couple weeks before I go that I will be due to pay 1/7 of the rent, as there will be 4 people in the house and I will be staying for 1/3 of a month. I was taken aback and told her I would be happy to buy her food and treat her to fun days out while visiting, but was not expecting to pay rent, and if this is the case I would prefer to just book my own accomodation as I will have more choice where I stay, my own space, and if it is something I will be paying for anyways I would prefer the choice.  I feel a bit like she just wants to profit off my visit now.

1698,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at the end.

Edit to add more info at the end.

Here's a little bit of information for context. My husband and I have no children, and are not ever having any. We also tend to keep quite a clean, tidy and organized household. My sister and her husband have 4 children and their house is not well kept at all. Not only is it cluttered and disorganized (as one would expect a family of 6 to have) but it's quite dirty. Cleaning has never been my sister's strong suit. Her and I are only 2.5 years different in age, so we were raised completely together and in the same way, along side our other two siblings. We were raised in a semi traditional, religious household that taught us a lot of life skills LIKE cleaning, cooking, outside/farm work, crafting, etc...

Now, there are several things that I disagree with about how my sister raises her household, but I'm posting about one specific issue, so I'll try my best to stick to that. My husband and I have my 12 year old niece visiting us this week. She decided to pack up her favorite pillow and blankets to bring with her, which I thought was odd since we have a full spare room and extra everything for her to use in our house. It's not like she was visiting us in an apartment and was sleeping on the couch or floor. I asked her to unpack her things and noticed her pillow case was incredibly dirty. I then took a closer look at her blankets and did a little sniff test and they were horribly dirty too!!! So while my niece and husband were upstairs I decided to wash her things. My washer has a ""sanitize"" setting so they had the cleaning of their lives! When I took her pillow case off of her pillow the pillow itself was incredibly stained as well. Pillows are harder to clean, but I felt it was necessary, so I did. I then went upstairs to niece and husband having dinner, so I sat down and explained to niece that I decided to wash her bed things. She gave me a little look of attitude, but I nipped that quick and told her it's very important to keep those things clean since you surround yourself with them every night. 

WIBTA if I told my sister that I'm disappointed and concerned she isnt attentive enough to her kids and their surroundings?

I always feel hesitant with these situations because she always tells me ""you wouldn't understand"" because I'm not a mother, let alone a mother of 4. But OUR MOTHER was a mother of 4 and she did an amazing job... 

TLDR: Im babysitting my niece, some of her personal items she brought from home were terribly dirty. WIBTA if I told my sister I'm disappointed and concerned that she doesn't care for her kids closely enough?

Info 1: she is a stay at home mom. Dad works.

Info 2: I live 2 hours away so I can't just ""pop in"" to help.

Info 3: I didn't state how I would talk to my sister if I chose to. The wording I chose here was the explain how I feel about the situation.",112,308,0.94
1699,Asshole,"I know this will sound almost made up but I swear on my mothers grave this isn't a karma farm or troll job. For part one we have been inundated with scorpions this year. We think it's the wet winter just caused an explosion of them. We have had them inside, outside, in the drains, clothes...everywhere. We have an exterminator but it takes time. So far no stings, thank god.

Part two is my husband wears a CPAP mask. It works and when he puts it on he goes into super sleep mode and is dead do the world.

He had it on last night and I read reading and out of the corner of the eye I just noticed a little black movement indside the hose that connects the humidifier to the mask. I really didn't think much of it but figured I'd get our black light just in case. In the time it took me to turn out the overhead light and find the black light flashlight the scorpion had moved up the hose much closer to his face. The black light verified that it was a scorpion. I panicked and ran out of the room. 

Husband must have sense my movement and screams because he woke up and took his mask off to ask me what's wrong. I didn't see it but I guess when he did that the scorpion fell into his lap. He screamed at me that there was a scorpion in the bed and to bring him the black light. I said no the scorpion is in your mask! Well that caused him to freak out even more but we were able to find the scorpion and kill it.

He is so furious with me for not ""helping him"" when I saw the scorpion was close to his face. Like so furious he isn't speaking to me and texted me that he doesn't want to be around me for date night tonight. I feel bad but I packicked and I don't know what I should have done anyways.

1700,Asshole,"This has become a topic of much contention among my friend group and I could use some outside perspective.

My friend, let's call him Paul, had just gotten a promotion with bonus, and wanted to take some friends out to a baseball game to celebrate- his treat. This was a minor league game so the tickets weren't too expensive, about $40 each. There were eight of us going including Paul.

This is a bit embarrassing to admit, but it's necessary to understand the situation- I'm a big guy. I'm ashamed and I've been working on it. 

When it came time to buy tickets (which we did so at the booth right at the ballpark), I bought two. I've been to this park before and I have trouble fitting into the seats. I also know that you can lift up the armrest on one side to make a sort of double wide seat. I purchased two tickets because that's what I did- I used two seats, with the armrest up. We had a great time and it was nice to be able to sit without having my insides squeezed out.

A couple of days afterwards, Paul asked for receipts so he could make sure everything balanced up. (He paid with a card). That's when he saw that I bought two seats. He questioned me, I explained the situation, and he got really pissed off. He said it was rude to buy an extra seat on someone else's dime, I could have fit in a single seat if I tried, and even if I couldn't, the park was empty enough that I could have just picked up the armrest without buying the seat and the ushers would have been none the wiser. (I didn't know how full the park was at the gate so I bought two seats next to each other to be safe. I also feel that I should pay for a second seat rather than ""borrowing"" one if I'm going to use it.) He then said some hurtful things about my weight and ended the conversation.

I've offered to repay him for both tickets I bought but he is not responding. And now my friend group knows and is arguing about whether Paul is right to be angry.

I had enough savings to survive for about six months while I tried to find something new, but I remembered how long it took to save that much in the first place and job prospects in my city sucked, so I decided to go back to my hometown to my moms. I figured I could temporarily help her out (even though she refused my money) and save at the same time, while looking for a job in my field in a better market. My mom knew this setup was temporary from the beginning.

I ended up finding a job quickly and about two months later I found out I am pregnant. While unexpected, this put a huge diversion to my plans. Instead of moving out this fall, I’m trying to leave by the end of the summer. After I told my mom I was pregnant she was excited but starting going on and on about how “we” need to find a bigger place, and that she hopes I don’t think I’m still moving out and taking “our” baby away from her. It was weird, but I didn’t respond and left it alone. I thought it was just the excitement talking.


Well apparently it wasn’t, she’s been telling my sister about how we’re gonna get a bigger place and how she’s gonna do all my babysitting because I’m a working mother. She never asked if any of this was okay with me. 

While I appreciate her willingness to help, my mom has been a smoker for years. I don’t like it and I spend as little time in the house as possible. The smoking made my morning sickness 10x worse and even though she knows I’m pregnant she still chooses to smoke indoors. She always says she’s quitting but we all know how that goes. I get it, her house her rules but I refuse to subject myself to anymore smoke, let alone my newborn baby! I don’t mind her babysitting, but it will only be at my smoke free home.

I told my sister I’m gonna tell her this but my sister says I shouldn’t. Our mom knows smoking is bad, she just states she chooses to do it regardless. My mom was raised by my chainsmoker great grandparents (one of which died from complications due to smoking) and goes on and on about how she turned out fine (never mind the fact that she spend half her childhood in and out of the hospital for breathing issues, my mom has very bad asthma). She claims smoking makes her breathing better. My sister keeps telling me by reminding her of the dangers of second hand smoke I’m just trying to hurt her feelings (my mom is easily offended). I was pretty much raised to lie to my mom to protect her feelings and saying anything truthful that she might not like is considered mean. So now I’m conflicted.

1704,Not the A-hole,"I teach swimming to kids aged between 5-12. In one of my classes when one of the kids got in he told me that his toe was stubbed and was a bit sore. I did the usual thing of telling him that the water will be good for it.

When he first starts swimming he's trying to kick with just one leg so I tell him he needs to try use both. After a few laps he's essentially crying. Quite often kids will use injuries as an excuse so they don't have to swim so I tell him that he should try do a couple more laps and if it still really hurts to let me know. He swims the two laps with quite poor technique, even with his arms. 

At this point I tell him that if he wants to keep swimming he has to do his best otherwise he should just get out. My reasoning behind this is that I don't want him to practice swimming with bad technique and there's 5 other kids in the class and I'm having to spend an unfair amount of time on him.

Male,40, two kids and wife,if that matters.

About six families have come on a cruise together. One of the people who's come along is my cousin- she's been an alcoholic in the past and has been in rehab. 

Met up in Italy, got on the cruise and whatnot- everything was pretty cool for the first few hours. The trouble started when i took my kids down to the pool deck and met up with the rest of the gang. I ordered a beer and sat down, when she suddenly huffed and walked away. I didn't pay it much attention- honestly, i thought she was mad at her husband.

I tend not to drink at dinner- so things were cool, that evening. I hit the casino alone and had a drink. No problem.

It started again when we went out for lunch the next day. Ordered myself a cocktail, when she suddenly got up, asked the waiter for another table and moved her husband and kids there. It honestly surprised the hell out of me. That's when the group pointed out that i shouldn't drink when she's around.

This is a cruise- we're always going to be around each other, and everyone drinks.

I disregarded it the next day, and had a drink at the table when things really blew up. She lost her cool, told me that this was her ******* vacation too, and called me an inconsiderate prick for drinking in from of her, when i knew her history- i felt like slappong her when she threw her napkin across the table into my son's plate. This was in front of a restaurant full of people, so i didn't respond- gave her a stare and went back to my meal. I didn't move the glass and her husband didn't get involved either. My wife told me to chill and visit the bar.

Now the thing is I can't stand children, if there were a room full of spiders and a room with only one child, my arachnophobic ass still would choose the first one. So I said no. I think my parents didn't take me seriously and when they had the chance they asked my bf. He also said no.

Susie has a lot of undesirable behaviours due to her parents not being very consistent with her and basically no discipline whatsoever. That’s a whole other story, but I digress. This one behaviour in particular is that she chews her food with her mouth wide open, it’s extremely loud and unpleasant and food often ends falling from her mouth onto her lap, the floor or the table. When I’m around, I actively tell her to try and chew with her mouth closed, try to show her how to do it, and try to be consistent with getting her to start doing it as not only is it impolite to chew with your mouth open but it will be a skill she needs to learn when she goes out to restaurants in public whether with family, or even with friends from school. Yet my boyfriend has told me that his mother has noticed what I’m doing and doesn’t agree with it.

1710,Not enough info,"My ex-GF and I have been broken up for almost two years now. Before that we had been together for almost three. Early in our relationship we filmed a couple sex videos on her phone that later found their way to both our laptops. These videos literally sat in a hidden folder on my laptop untouched for two years and I forgot they existed (we didn’t film anymore after that). If I’d remembered they were on my laptop I’d have deleted them the day I broke up with her. 

Anyway, two of these videos have somehow found their way online to several of the big porn sites. My ex-GF was alerted by an anonymous person on social media and has obviously been on full damage control mode since. The day she found out she assumed it was me and threatened to call the cops if I didn’t take them down immediately. I invited her over the same day and gave her my old and new laptops to hold, I told her she could have a professional examine my laptops in anyway and that I’d done nothing to share the videos. She seemed convinced but took my laptops nonetheless. 

A few days later she informs me that she has engaged a lawyer to have all copies of the videos taken down, and that she expects me to share the cost. Her reasoning is that if I didn’t do it, we cannot be sure where or how this video was obtained by some stranger and should therefore split the costs to fix the problem. 

I don’t know how any of the legal procedure works, but I’m not in a position to spend money on a lawyer for someone that no longer has anything to do with me. I’m also pretty sure that it wasn’t my old laptop that was compromised as it’s purely a gaming laptop that I only used to watch YouTube, play steam games, and do my online banking (never visited any dodgy sites on it, not even for porn). That said I have no idea how this stuff works so I also recognise my opinion on how a video gets leaked like this is worthless.

Anyway I declined and said I was genuinely sorry that this has happened but will not help her financially to get the videos removed. She thinks I’m being a cheap asshole, am I?

Edit: I should mention that my face is not showing in the videos and I’m only identifiable by a birthmark on my back. Her face is showing though. So she has a lot more incentive to get them removed than I do.",245,312,0.94
1711,Not the A-hole,"As the title says, here's some context:

The group in questions isn't anything official or an actual esports team for that matter (Just so nobody assumes this). It's just a big Discord Server (Used to be an X-Fire Group) where people meet up to play stuff. The three big ones that people tend to play are Overwatch, LoL and more recently Rainbow 6 Siege. It mostly became a thing after I got tired of having to play with random people online constantly.

For those that care: Current ratio is 6 females to 25 males on the server. Not counting the two I booted out yesterday.

The two in question joined about two months ago. Usual policy goes: If you want somebody added to the Server, you recommend them in a Channel, and if at least two other members vouch for said person, they get an invite. Exceptions are made for SO's, which in this case got one of the two admitted just off dating one of the people already on the server.

At first everything was okay. One of the two did not use a mic, stating she had made bad experiences with voice chat Online. That was okay, we've had cases like this before and they eventually warmed up. The other had a bit too much of a temper for my tastes. I dislike people who get loud during play too much. I made a personal note to avoid playing with her, as I did with others on the Server who I know get heated a lot.

Then stuff started to go bad. Apparently there had been arguments. The two Newbies were looking for Ranked Teammates and found it hard to find any. When I had a chat with them about it, both were convinced that this was because they were female. I asked around a bit to see if that was the case. The reasons I got back were either A) Microphones were mandatory, and thus one of them refusing to use ones was a no go. Or B) The people playing ranked found them unpleasant to play with.

We never had issues like this before, so I told the two of them that I really didn't think this was a gender thing. In response, they told me that I hadn't dug around enough, and that I was just biased as both a male and one of the Server Admins. They wouldn't budge from that stance, so in the end, I told them they obviously didn't fit and removed them from the server list.

I was told today that apparently that decision had not gone over well, and has apparently even caused a bit of a rift between the couple one of the kicked women is part of.

1712,Asshole,"My brother said that ANYONE would agree with him, so let's see.

He is 24m and gay, I'm 20f. He has a boyfriend and all three of us were hanging out together and just watching YouTube and talking about random stuff. At some point, his boyfriend was on his cellphone and he suddenly groaned loudly. My brother asked him what it was and he said some stupid friend of his sent him a gay joke, and he read it out loud, and I didn't understand it (it was something about going on holiday and packing shit), so they explained to me that it's a joke about anal sex. Packing... shit...

So I was appalled and I asked what the fuck, does that really happen, and my brother said not if you get ready beforehand. And I asked how they get ready. He asked if I really wanted to know how the preparation is done and I said yes, I was curious.

He told me about this whole process of squirting water up in there and jumping in your shower and squirting it back out into the toilet and repeating it until the water comes out clear. I couldn't believe it, and I still can't. I said it's fucking disgusting, but only barely less disgusting than ""packing shit"" and that I can't believe they have to live this way.

My brother's boyfriend said I sounded stupid and to stop embarrassing myself, and we had a fight. I ended up leaving. My brother called me later to tell me that he hopes I understand why his boyfriend got mad at me and that what I said was kind of homophobic??? How is it homophobic to be grossed out by washing poop out of yourself? It was my natural reaction to the idea of this process, and I didn't think them having sex was gross, so I think they're exaggerating by calling me homophobic.",1206,3802,0.82
1713,Not the A-hole,"Okay so after an hour in the bus, I arrived from university to a city near my village, I spot a taxi driver.
I ask him if hes going there, he says: sure, come in.

After driving for around 2 minutes, he said that he needs to get someone and asked me if Im in a hurry, I said: yes a little, how much time do you need? He didnt answer back.

He then parked his car near a gaz station and received a call, I heard him saying: Yes I will get it and keep it with me, I will give it to you back tomorrow. He hangs up and tells me that he needs to get something from the doorway of a house nearby, I ask him how much time he needs, he doesnt answer back.
He then turns on the air conditionner, keeps the car turned on, the key inside and steps out of it.
 
I waited around 10 minutes, he didnt come back, I started feeling fishy about this whole situation, so I said to myself that if hes not showing up in the next 3 minutes, Im leaving it. 3 minutes passed, hes still not back, I step out, closed the door and left it as it was. Walked to a new taxi while looking back, checking if hes gonna be back, he never showed up.
I took another taxi and got home in 14 minutes.

This shit happened an hour ago and Im still feeling shitty that someone might have stolen his car after I left it like that.

1714,Not the A-hole,"My parents divorced in 2009 after 21 years of marriage. They argued daily in the end until they both decided they couldn't do it anymore. I had a good childhood and a great relationship with my parents my entire life. I was already 20 when they decided to get divorced, so it didn't hurt me as much as it may a younger child when their parents decided to split up. It was also very amicable and they split assets equally without any type of disagreement, etc. 

My mom was planning on moving to a city around 40 minutes away. I skipped post secondary education and had been working full time for 3 years already, so I decided to stay at home with my dad as I was already settled in. My dad told me that the only way we could keep the house without my moms income was if I were to split bills/expenses with him. This was fine by me as I would still save more than finding my own place. 

We split all bills equally and never ran into any problems. In 2014, we moved to a new home and my dad put my name on the house along with his, saying ""It will save you from a bunch of paperwork shit if anything were to happen to me"". 

In February 2017 both of my dads parents passed away. Their assets were split between 4 children and my dad received around $400,000. He used some of this money to pay off his home entirely, and invested the rest. With my dad no longer needing both of our incomes, I moved out in November 2017 and purchased a home with my girlfriend.

In September 2018 my parents told me that they planned to get back together (not remarried). I briefly mentioned to both of them that I didn't think it was a good idea, but they're adults and left it at that. My mother moved in with my father and although it was slightly strange, I still visited and vice versa, there was no strain on any of our relationships because of it.

My dad passed away unexpectedly this May at the age of 54. My dad had no will. I've gone through the necessary steps to gain what assets he had. Having my name already on his home did indeed save me a bunch of paperwork shit. Last week I informed my mother that she could stay in the house until the end of this year, at which point I will be selling it. I told her I would help with moving, etc when she made arrangements for a new place to live.

She became upset and said that she thought the home and other assets my dad had accrued would be split evenly between us. My girlfriend has also been under the impression for a month and a half that this would be the decision I would make. I will not be splitting my inheritance with my mother.

I met him in Dubai and he bought me a drink which is how we hit it off. He’s an older gentleman, Indian, and he’s got grown up kids so he’s in a very different place in life to me. When I met him he literally had a private helicopter that he’d take me around Dubai in and I was just a nobody from the Midwest- it was an amazing time. 

Over the past 3 years, he’s bought me some huge amazing gifts- he paid off my college entirely, sends me designer clothes, bought me a car with insurance paid for- it’s amazing. He has never once pursued me sexually, but he does ask me to do certain things for him (dress up in stuff he sends me, take photos, etc) 

He’s hardly ever in the US, he usually splits his time between India/ China/ the UAE, but he invited me to fly to the UK for a summer wedding he’s attending and told me we’d do stuff while we’re there. We don’t often see each other in person but every time he’s in the US he’ll make time to see me and take me on dates and show me interesting places. 

I genuinely like him, he’s handsome, funny, charismatic, ridiculously intelligent- he owns private surgical centers across India and he is invested in his business and he’s just cool to be around. 

I accepted, but my best friend thinks that I’m doing something morally wrong and she keeps telling me that it’s peak asshole behavior and shallow as hell. She was with me in Dubai when we met him and she thinks that I’m using him because he’s an old man.",80,64,0.96

1722,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for bad storytelling, not a native english speaker.

I was walking home from work yesterday and on the way I saw a public electrical kick scooter parked infront of a store. (For those who don't know, you can rent these scooters using an app on your phone and ride and park them basically anywhere within the city boundaries.) I was feeling kinda lazy and didn't really feel like walking all the way home, so I opened the app to see if the scooter was free. Luckily for me it was.

""Nice"" I thought and scanned the Qr code to reserve it, but as I was taking the kickstand off and getting on it, a man with a prostethic leg walks out of the store with his face glued to his phone. He turns left towards the scooter and raises his head to see me standing on the only scooter parked at the store. I froze completely at this point and we ended up just staring eachother without saying anything. After probably the most awkward and longest four seconds of my life I decided to just wave sorry and scoot away as I had already reserved it for myself by scanning the Qr code.

Though it was a bit awkward I thought the whole thing was just funny in the end as the whole thing played out like scene from a Mr.Bean episode. But when I told my coworker what happened yesterday he thought I was a dick for not giving him the scooter. He said ""Why don't you just steal a quadriplegics wheelchair next time?"" 

Was I really being such a huge ass by not canceling my ride and giving him the scooter instead? The initial reservation costs 1 Euro and though it's not really that much I still had payed for it. In addition it is possible to keep the scooter reserved when not in use, but the scooter was set to be available for everyone. Also If I had been 1 min faster to walk to the store I would have never know it was used by a disabled man.  AITA?

Edit: Just to add I meant an electric scooter as in a kickboard used for public transport. Not as in an electric wheelchair meant for disabled people.",127,165,0.96
1723,Not the A-hole,"The wedding is in a couple of months and my mum's side of the family are all telling me to just not go, and I really feel conflicted about it all.

My dad (38M) is engaged to my stepmum (30F). Obviously, I (18F) was invited since the beginning of the wedding plans (around September 2016) and I was one of two bridesmaids. The other was my dad's cousin (29F), who my stepmum gets on with, that my dad had promised could be a bridesmaid at his wedding since they were kids.

I've always had a great relationship with my dad (especially since I didn't get on with my mum), and since moving in with them in 2017, an awful one with my stepmum. We rarely speak to one another in the house (if we are in the same room we essentially take it in turns to speak to my dad even if I try to make the conversation generalised so she could join in), she is majorly anal about everything (have a chore rota that I stick to religiously but still does petty things like not hoover my room if I leave a sock on the floor), and is really jealous of mine and my dad's relationship (said it was weird that we used to cuddle up together on the couch, once told me off for bending over to reach a drawer with my butt in the direction of my dad).

It's fair to say we do not like or respect one another.

Cut to about a month ago at a family party. My stepmum takes me and my cousin aside and says that we are no longer bridesmaids as we didn't do enough to organise a hen do. I felt upset, as she knew at the time I was deep into my exams, and that my cousin had arranged some cool things for us to do, it was more a case of finalising the date. But my stepmum insisted that there was no room for negotiation and she wouldn't be having bridesmaids or a hen do at all now.

This angered me at the time, but whatever. She informs me that I have to pay for my own room at the venue as budget is tight. They know that my current job is going out of business (which is only a weekend job because of school) and that I have no money looking for a new job, but again, I accepted it (it's £60 and I am going to have to share a bed with my cousin).

I was also told that I wasn't allowed to invite my long term boyfriend to the wedding. I offered to pay for him, but no. Even now when people dropped out last minute, they have given that space to distant relatives they weren't planning on inviting anyway. My stepmum then hosted her own hen do with her family that she kicked me out of the house for for the weekend.

I am buying my own dress and making my own way there and I feel robbed for being the daughter and not being allowed to be more involved in my dad's wedding.

Would I be the arsehole if I don't go? Why should I go if I was frequently fucked over by my stepmum just for my dad's sake? I know it would mean a lot to him and if I didn't, it would put a rift between the family and cause a lot of drama close to the wedding, but I really do feel screwed over by it all.",58,40,0.91
1724,Not the A-hole,"I have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

Obviously that didn’t work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I’m a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she’d changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

I wasn’t thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.

After a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I’m so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I’m able to give my son experiences that I never had. 

He chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he’d always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he’d get yelled at because he’s the oldest, etc. 

His mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

It was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he’ll be needing soon anyway and which I’ve had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I’m a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I’ve ‘never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it’s obvious his dad is spending money on him’ ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn’t feel bad? 

She said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that’s an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

She’s normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it’s acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I’ve never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.",1916,16017,0.9

1726,Not the A-hole,"I've been with my gf for about 4 years. When we first met she was carefree about her appearance. She took care of herself but never made a big deal of it. In case anyone wonders why I'm even with this girl, I should also say she's usually a warm and interesting person, extremely bright and has great potential in a prestigious field, even if of late she has gotten complacent and hasn't been challenging herself.

In the past couple of years she has become more vain, to the point every few conversations are about how she looks, or how her clothes or makeup are. She used to work in a field tangential to plastic surgery, although not anymore, but we find ourselves talking about the subject a fair bit. 

About a year ago I found out she'd had work done before we met, when I saw some pictures she'd posted on social media. She's since taken them down, and it didn't really surprise me because she had teased me multiple times with questions like, if she'd had work done, do I think I'd be able to tell? Either way, it was before we met and she'd always denied having had work done so I didn't think it my business to mention.

As well as being concerned with her appearance, she has also always been critical of others. She wouldn't be able to look at a picture of a female celebrity without commenting on what she considered their flaws. The only people who escape her criticism are her sisters, who she's very open about also having work done. I always just brushed over it and neither agreed nor disagreed.

A couple of years ago though, she started commenting on my female friends too. These aren't even people I meet anymore, but we'd see their holiday pictures on social media, and she'd make passive aggressive comments like, your friends aren't very pretty are they? Again, not wanting to stir the pot I usually just shrug. I mentioned several times that they're my friends and not to be so critical but she's carried on passive aggressively. This has gone on for a couple of years. 

Eventually when she criticised them, while also with the same breath talking about how she's more naturally beautiful, I told her I knew about her plastic surgery and not to be disingenuous. She obviously wasn't expecting this and we got into an argument about me bringing it up. She felt blindsided that I knew, while I felt I needed to put my foot down on her being so critical of everyone, including my friends.

She already spent 90% of her time at my place anyway so we thought it would be a good idea to find a new apartment to make it our own. 

We agreed that because she made less than me, we’d split the cost based on percentage of income. My cost would be $1000, hers $200. 

Well, two weeks after actually moving in together we broke up (*surprise*). It’s been mutual, due to unsolved differences.

I brought up the fact that since we had broken up but were still living together, since she didn’t want to move out, it would be fair for us to each pay 50% of the rent for the time being. 

I feel like I’m no longer obliged to support her, and she feels like I’m using money to “make her small.”

Both of our names are on the contract, but the landlord doesn’t care how she gets the money. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of, because I’ll be the one forced to continue paying since she hasn’t agreed to 50/50.

While we did agree on the 1000/200 split while together, AITA for trying to make it 50/50 after we broke up?  All of her friends are calling me every name under the sun.

Edit: thanks everyone for the responses. Wasn’t expecting this many. 

Some background info: we live in a big city and only have a one bedroom, so to make matters even more awkward, we still share the same bed. We both have the same amount of strange space, fridge space, etc. 

She’s even gone as far as saying even if it breaks her, she will find a way to take over the full amount of rent (1200) and have me kicked out. According to her, there’s no reason for her to have me around if she doesn’t get any benefit.

I’ve always known she cares a lot about expensive clothes and shoes and bags, but I reached my breaking point when her first rent payment of 200 was two weeks late because she decided to buy a new pair of luxury shoes instead. 

After that, she accused me of trying to control her money and I accused her of not caring about her responsibilities, so we finally called it quits.",814,3874,0.96

1731,Not the A-hole,"So, among some in my family, I became Public Enemy No. 1 after my wedding last weekend. I still believe that I am not anywhere near as bad as it's being suggested I am, but don't want to flog a dead horse if I am in the wrong.

My now husband and I never planned to have children at our wedding. A combination of small venue and lack of our own children/children in our immediate family (eg. nieces or nephews), plus nowhere in the budget for costs for childcare or separate entertainment left us firm in the view that we didn’t want kids at the wedding. This was made clear from the get-go (save the dates were sent out a year in advance with it clear that children weren’t going to be invited), and although a couple of our distant cousins and friends of friends tried to kick up a fuss, we stayed firm and reminded these people that we were sending out information in advance so they could decide in good time what they wanted to do, which we believed was well received.

About 3 weeks before the big day, one of our friends had an unexpected issue that would mean that they wouldn’t be coming to the wedding. By this time everything was non-refundable for seats/meals, and so we decided to try to find someone already attending who could have a plus 1, but preferably someone we knew (plus 1s had also been an issue regarding random guests of guests, so we thought it would be best to control it). We settled on one of my best friend’s little brother, who is 16 (17 in 2 weeks). I’ve known ‘Joe’ for as long as I’ve known his sister (my bff), and had no issue with trusting him, mainly because while he is legally a child in my country, he’s mature and responsible. We got Joe’s confirmation and thought that would be it.

Halfway through the wedding reception (literally just before the parents dance, which ruined it), one of my aunts pulled me to the side and started whisper-shouting at me about how come my friend could bring her ‘baby’ brother while one of her kids couldn’t bring their 2 year old. I said that it was a last minute change, and that Joe wasn’t as much of a cost/concern as an actual child. For the rest of the day there were whispers from both sides of our family about how much their young grandchild etc. would have enjoyed the day, and how it was one rule for one and another for others. No one else was as vocal to me as my aunt, but it still put a dampener on the day. My mum told me a couple of days ago that while she agreed with me that inviting Joe (who had a great time and made friends with some of my husband’s 19 year old cousins) wasn’t as much of a problem as it seemed, I should apologise to keep the peace, since she’d be fielding some complaints from our family.

1735,Asshole,"I have waited tables for the last three years.

During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.

About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. 

A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.

Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

I stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

But when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position.

I started working part-time for the first time in my life this year. My parents told me to use my salary as pocket money. So I'll occasionally use the money to buy myself treats (chips, chocolate, cake etc) and couple of times I got angry when I couldn't find them the next day.

I obviously first asked my sister, given her track record, but she denies eating my stuff. I don't trust her, so I started locking my food up in the cabinet.

My sister freaked out at me when she found out because I'm ""not being supportive of her recovery and being doubted by family members is what'll make her relapse"".

1737,Not the A-hole,"I recently just got my license and was going to start looking at cars that I could afford to purchase. I have never been to a car dealership and my dad gave me warnings that the salesmen can be very scary and deceiving sometimes, and I should always have my ""poker face on.""  I went with my dad to a dealership and test drove a car that was in my budget. The car drove nicely, but I was not a fan of the color of the car. I expressed my opinion on the color, but the salesman must've thought it wasn't a big deal.

We eventually got sucked into the building where we starting to do paperwork just to see what he could do for me and how low of a price he could get. After filling out some stuff he got up and went into the back of the building, but I'm honestly not too sure where he even went. While he was gone I told my dad we should maybe go and look at more cars because I wasn't content with this car just yet. He didn't mind and told me to go and find the guy and tell him we were going to go look at other options for now.

Now I could not find this salesman at all. I went through all the glass cubicles they had and didn't see him anywhere, I walked back to my dad and he decided it was okay to leave the dealership and go look at other cars at other dealerships. We drove off and eventually started to receive several phone calls from the dealership. They also sent a text, but it was not the same salesman we had been with, it was someone else at the dealership. He basically asked us where we went, and I just responded with, ""So sorry, looked all over to try to find \[salesman\], but couldn't find him so we just left to look for other options for now."" He sent a text back saying how rude we were and how he's never had a customer ever do that to them and how we wasted their time.

1738,Not the A-hole,"About 9 months ago my wife and I got married.  We had a crazy themed wedding and decided to pour our priorities into centerpieces, music and venue rather than a few of the supplementaries.  One of these items was the photographer.  My cousin is an aspiring photographer and we asked if she would be interested.  She said doing a very themed, off the wall wedding would be great for her business and agreed to a very great price on the caveat she would be able to use the photos to promote her business.  We decided to pay for her and her family to stay in the resort for the wedding night as well as an extra thank you.  She showed up and took photos during the ceremony and everything was going great.  After the ceremony, she hit the open bar and forgot about the photo hour.  My mom had to go find her and remind her to take photos.  By about 9ish PM she had disappeared completely.  My family informed me later that she got really drunk and left.  About a week after the wedding she posted a few photos on Facebook and we were really excited to see the rest.  Unfortunately, that was the last we saw.  She started getting very flakey and only responded to a few messages.  We tried to arrange a file share or sending a flash drive, but every time we mentioned getting the photos she stopped talking to us.  By the 5 month mark, things seemed very odd and she finally told us that she had one SD card, but all of the pictures after the ceremony were on a hard drive that burned out.  I offered to pay for recovery attempts, because all we want at this time is our wedding photos.  Again, she got flakey.  Fast forward to about 7 weeks ago and she said she attempted to recover the drive twice at a cost of almost 500 dollars and they both failed.  Due to that, she could not refund us the check she cashed for the photography.  She also said she was suffering from anxiety and depression and just couldn't handle this right now.  Now, my wife and I live over a thousand miles away and were in the state last week.  We tried to contact my cousin, but sent me to voicemail on every call and didnt respond to any text.  I even told her I would be outside her house to collect literally anything she had available.  Now it has been 7 weeks since she has responded to anything, and we have no pictures, no refund, and no resolution in sight.  I think it's likely she just took a few early day photos and got too hammered to take the reception photos and now is ashamed to tell us the truth.  I am afraid of her mental instability if I pursue legal action that she may do something I would feel responsible for.  WIBTA if I pursued legal action and she hurt herself due to the anxiety of being sued?

Edit: Thank you all for all the advice.  We decided to reach out to one of her close friends who was able to contact her husband.  He was completely unaware of all of this, but said there were a lot of wedding photos on the family computer.  He will be stopping by the post office on Monday to send a loaded flash drive.  I don't know if you are a fellow redditor my dude, but you have made my weekend!

1739,Not the A-hole,"I have (read:had) a friend, we’ll call her Kate, who was the most happy, smiling, well-meaning, absolutely narcissistic a-hole you’ll ever meet. She was so bright and happy all of the time, but she’d rip you down with a beaming smile. 

For instance: we were in a large city on a paid-for trip courtesy of a generous donor to our school. I’ve never left the southeast, this was exciting for me. Like a good human, I waited at a crosswalk for the green light, but I was informed by her (she travels a decent amount) that “sweetie, I know that your family just can’t afford to go places and experience things like my family can but I’ve traveled a lot, and you don’t always have to wait for the light.” It was a simple sentence that made me SO mad. Remember, this was a PAID FOR trip. We ate at a court nice restaurant, which isn’t cheap when you’re feeding 20-odd people. She ate a plate of calamari, a cheeseburger, and a slice of cheesecake. Ate it all, drank her soda, and promptly complained that it wasn’t as good as the food that she’d had in New JERSEY (soft flex). It really aggravated the teachers chaperoning and those of us who were just happy to be there. 

Another incident that happened when I was not even present but another friend called me crying because of what Kate had said, was when Kate and the other friend were talking about college. Kate and the other friend were planning to go the same place, and the other friend was like “hey, I know you already have a roomie, but you need a suite-mate. What about me and my roomie?” Kate actually laughed and said “sweetie, it’s not like I’m going to talk to you at college. You need to branch out, I’ll hold you back. I’ll find some other people to be my suite-mate.” It was a diss posed as a “go forth and conquer” statement. 

So all this culminated at a birthday dinner at a nice restaurant near our town. Myself, Kate, and several close friend were all there, and the majority of the friends knew what Kate had said in the past. We were eating and having a good time, and then Kate says “really, ______, I would have thought you would have picked a better place for your birthday dinner, this place is trash. I’ve had better food on my travels”  yes, she said My Travels. What an absolute walnut. 

Kate said this in front of several staff members and the birthday friends mother, who was paying for ALL OF US. I snapped. It was along the lines of “....shitty person, ungrateful POS, better off without you, travel your ass away from me” etc. Kate was outraged and left, then began commenting about my behavior to mutual friends and making shady posts online.

Today, we took a ferry to my dads hometown. We were playing gin and my uncle came by and whispered in my sisters ear “I hope you lose.”
My sister laughed and looked at my uncle and said “oh shut up, shut up, shut up! I need to win!” And she went back to the game.

Everything seemed fine. We got to the store and I got out of the car and my uncle drove up behind me. My sister was in a different car with my aunt. He told me “I really need to talk to you about how damn disrespectful your sister is. She told me to shut up 3 times on the ferry for no goddamn reason after I spent a load of money to get her here for her father’s funeral.”

My uncle did drive her across Canada to come to my dads funeral and it was my understanding they had a great trip. No complaints.

My uncles wife then said “if she keeps acting up, she’s going to fucking walk back.”

I’m upset. I was there, I witnessed the interaction and it felt like it was all fun and games and fun banter. Also, she’s 14 and just lost her dad. If you’re going to get upset and make a big scene over a 14 year olds words, maybe you should hold it in until AFTER the funeral?

1743,Asshole,"My husband (M 33) and I (F 27) have been married 2 years. Prior to getting married, we obviously had the discussion about wanting children; we both agreed that we want two kids. During every single one of these discussions, I mentioned how despite wanting biological kids, the idea of pregnancy was absolutely horrifying to me. I made comments here and there about wanting a surrogate. 

Since the plan was to start trying about two years into our marriage, we recently started having serious conversations about bringing a baby into our family. As this becomes closer to reality, I am heavily leaning towards wanting a surrogate to carry my baby. I want to continue to work with no concern about complications/sickness, and I don’t want my body to drastically change. I’ve considered the financial costs (manageable with our dual income), weighed the implications of having a stranger carry my child (okay with it as long as we use a reputable agency/source), and still want to go through with a surrogate. I also realize these are shallow reasons compared to those who use a surrogate because it really is the only way. 

However, my husband thinks he has equal say in the decision-making because it’ll be his child too. He doesn’t want me to use a surrogate, and thinks we may as well just adopt if this is the direction I go in. I say that I should be the primary decision maker because it’s my body, and the physical aspects of carrying a child and giving birth only affect me. Once the kid is born, we will obviously have equal say in parenting and how they’re brought up. 

So, AITA for insisting that I should have the decision making power in this?

EDIT: to clarify, the surrogacy would be my egg and husband’s sperm. In addition, the topic of adoption wasn’t actually something he meant seriously - it was more of an offhand comment of “if you’re using a surrogate, might as well adopt because you won’t have the maternal bond that mothers have when carrying a child”. Reading the comments, I feel like it’s important to point out why he mentioned adoption.",149,105,0.85

1746,Not the A-hole,"Today my partner made a joke and I jokingly pouted in return, and he went to hug me and I said no, I don’t want a hug. 
He kept trying, and I said no, and I was physically pushing him away from me. 
We ended up wrestling a little (him essentially pinning me and me trying to break free) so while it was relatively harmless, I really just didn’t want to be hugged right then. 

This has also happened before and I have told him that if I don’t want a hug, please don’t hug me. (He has also done this during a heated fight thinking it will calm me down and when I refuse he gets VERY mad, despite me explaining that in a fight I do not want to be touched. It makes it worse) 

So although today we ended up wrestling, he tried to hug me again after and I said no, I don’t want one, and he has to be more mindful of that. We are planning on having children, so I mentioned something we discussed in my therapy (which consent has been a big focus, it’s for childhood abuse) which is about making sure your kids know you can refuse hugs. I wanted him to understand that this is actually serious, and that’s something I plan to teach them, so he can’t do this to them or in front of them. 

He said it was stupid, I’m acting like he’ll be a bad father, it’s just a hug and now I’ve made it a big deal and I’ve ruined hugs. That I should have just let him hug me the once and it would be over. 

I said that if it wasn’t frequent or also in negative situations it wouldn’t be a big deal, but he’s not learning and I have the right to say who touches me and when, (with more than just hugs, as he pushes boundaries sometimes elsewhere, but I’m just curious for if I’m TA for the hugging thing) especially while I’m going through all my therapy and  whatnot. 

AITA because it’s really  just a hug?

Edit: he has apologized, for not respecting my space and for also saying I ruined hugs. This will take time for him to understand I’m sure, but I am adamant he has to if he wants to build a life.

Yesterday while we were making our groceries list she mentioned something about taking extra money, I asked her to explain why and she responded that she hadn't figured out the prices of the new stuff she was getting yet. My answer to that was that since she was going to be the only one eating those items, she should be the only one paying for them. She was very surprised by this and even offended by it. She said I was being childish about it and that it made no sense because if she used that logic, then she shouldn't have paid all the snacks and other foods that we got all this time that she didn't eat. I told her that it was different because they were bought with the intention of her consuming those items as well but she didn't because she didn't want to.

1749,Asshole,"I have been with my wife for 12 years. She has always been interested in spiritual and occult things - astrology, tarot cards, sage cleansing, pagan practices, spell rituals, etc., but nothing negative like hexes or ghosts. Most importantly, she has never been hardcore about it. She has a full-time job and is well-adjusted socially. She says she is ""in the broom-closet"" and has lots of books on the topic, but she hides them when either of our parents come over (her closest friends know). I don't believe in any of it, but it can be fun and doesn't bother me really. I'll let her read my palm or cards but don't take it seriously. She uses it to ""channel her energy"" and ""improve herself"", and luckily isn't into the death/skulls/bones/goth angle.

We have an 10 year old daughter who my wife is slowly starting to introduce to this world. And I think my wife is getting more into it now that she has someone to play with. They sage-cleansed our new apartment. They burn incense and do yoga and buy crystals. They never shut up about Halloween and watch Tim Burton but blow off Christmas. When my daughter is upset, she will burn incense and use crystals. My daughter started telling friends at school she's pagan/a witch and they reject her and think she's weird (note: my wife doesn't define herself as ""a witch""). My wife wants to take her to pagan festivals, which I won't attend but I'm sure is full of weirdos.

Again, my wife is not pushing the depressed/goth angle, but I'm worried my daughter is going to grow up pigeon-holed in this weird, dark spiritual realm and unequipped to deal with issues in the real world.

I've always been the resident chef for my family. My wife is an awful cook (her words, not mine) so over the years I've been the one to cook every meal for my family. I've spent a lot of time learning too. I've taken multiple classes each year to help me and honestly it's slowly became a passion of mine. So, for most of the night for the past 16 years i've come home and spent at least an hour, often several making diner for my family. 

This is where my daughter comes in, lets call her sally. Sally turned 16 this year and oh boy has it been rough. She never left her rebellious phase. She has always tried to make me and her mom know how much she hates us and that she can't wait till she's in the ""real world"" so she can finally be free. I get it. She's at that age where she wants more freedom and sometimes we can be hard on her. That's not the problem here. 

One of sally's new things though is telling me how much my cooking sucks. For the past two weeks every night i've cooked she will tell me everything wrong with the meal i've cooked. She will go on all night about the ""crap"" I forced her to eat and that she should just be able to cook her own meal instead. She's far past the age of letting her go hungry so I just have let it go, until last night. I got off work late so I just decided to grab burgers on the way home for diner. Sally went on and on after about how she ""finally had decent food to eat"" and that ""this stuff wasn't cooked by a pathetic wannabe chef"". I don't know why but that hit me hard and I ended up crying in my room after. My wife caught me and told me it needs to stop now. 

So tonight when I got home I cooked enough for me, my wife, and my son. I steamed some rice and beans and put them on a plate for my daughter. When she came to eat I informed her since I only cook ""crap"" i made her something else and that was all she would be eating in this house from now on. She blew up. She called me an ass and a bad father before storming to her room. My son things I'm just being mean and that i've sunk to her level while my wife says I did the right thing. I talked to my mom too and she says this was a heavy over reaction and that all teens do this at some point and that I only will make things worse.

Anyway last week she told me she bought me some things to put in my shoes for the wedding photos. I’m very short for a guy, and she didn’t want me to look out of place in the photos, so she got me some things to slip into my shoes to make me appear taller in the photos.

1753,Not the A-hole,"My mother for the last two years of her life, was very sick. She could afford nurses for her palliative care but was adamant nothing be done. Because I don't want my mother's last couple of years be in misery, I decided to leave my career as a HS teacher to care for her. I'd spend all my days there with her, nights at home. Sometimes my husband and daughter would come for the day, too, but I'd say about 85% of my time awake since early 2017 to two months ago was with my mother at her home. When she passed, I was the one who found her.

She left almost all of her entire estate, including her house, to a charity that focuses on her specific illness. She named a third party as executor to handle selling her house so I'm not involved. I basically spoke to the lawyer in one meeting and was told they'll handle it from there. Her funeral was paid out of her estate. It wasn't a life changing amount of money, only about $40,000 plus the bungalow she lived in.

It upsets me because she left nothing to me. Nothing to her granddaughter. Ultimately it was her choice and it should be honored, but this isn't how estates are usually passed down. Sure, I got just enough to not contest the will according to the lawyer, but the brunt of it went to a charity I wasn't even super familiar with. Keep in mind I took care of her, every day, for two years.

It's not like we're destitute ourselves. I could only do it because my husband could carry the family. It doubly stings because there's waitlists for local HS teachers. Leaving my career is one thing, rejoining it is monumentally tougher, even with experience.

I just feel like an asshole that it's affecting me so much. My mother loved me, my daughter, my husband. Why would she give pretty much nothing when she passed?

I had just started a new job and my hours were cut and dry. Off by 4 every single day. 


I’ve since been promoted and given more responsibility, therefore I don’t always get off at 4. I come home late approx 1 day a week(sometimes more, sometimes less). We’ve always told our nanny she’s not obligated to stay past 4:30 because that’s not what is in the contract. We have neighbors, friends, and family all around so there’s always someone available to step in for an hour or 2 so Taylor can leave on time. It’s not ideal though because I rarely know if I’ll be leaving late so I’m usually slammed at work when I realize that I won’t leave on time and need to find backup care. I work in the office portion of a family owned  HVAC company so it can get CRAZY during the summer. 


We asked Taylor if she would be willing to extend her hours until 6:30pm. She wouldn’t be there until 6:30 every day but just in case I got off late, I wouldn’t have to add to my workload by needing to search for childcare. She agreed and then work slowed down for about 2 weeks straight. I was home by 4:30pm every day. 



Now work is crazy busy again and I’ve been getting off late 2 days a week. 


Taylor recently texted us and said:


Hey I know I agreed to work until 6:30 but the inconsistency of it is preventing me from making money at my other job. I’m not able to pick up shifts or get scheduled because I never know if I’ll be off in time. Is there something we can do to fix this situation?


I was confused. We pay her time+half for anything over 40 hours and 7:30am-6:30pm is guaranteed pay whether she’s there or not. I don’t feel like it’s unfair at all to her that we sometimes don’t need her to stay until 6:30.

1. No sex in our house unless it’s with a long term boyfriend that we know and are comfortable with

2. No drugs at all, not even pot. I don’t care what she does, just keep it out of the house.

3. If she’s going to have friends over she needs to tell us before hand and get the okay.

When she first moved in she pretty consistently broke rules 1 and 2 before I put my foot down and told her I’d kick her out if she did again. She seemed to stop after that and we no longer awoke on Saturday mornings to some random guy leaving the house at 8am.

Yesterday I went in to her room to vacuum and saw an ounce of weed partially hidden underneath her jacket. I threw it out immediately and called my sister to come home immediately.

I told her what I found and that she has 1 month to find somewhere else to live. I’m sick of her disobeying what I consider to be three very simple and fair rules. She’s been crying on and off saying she can’t afford to rent and to give her one more chance.

Parents are obviously siding with sister thinking I’m being too harsh, that she’s just a kid. I don’t think I am. AITA?",124,31,0.83

1759,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a couple months ago, but one of the threads on tipping reminded me.  I've never been sure if I was the asshole here.

It was a Tuesday and an Irish bar (the kind named McIrish where the only Irish thing about it is...nothing) in our neighborhood was having a $2 cheeseburger special.  Looking for something to do, and knowing that this place normally had pretty good burgers, two friends and I walked on down. 

Sure enough, the sandwich board out front said ""$2 cheeseburgers!""  Great.

We went inside.  It wasn't too crowded, but definitely more crowded than a regular Tuesday.  We were seated at a table since we were ordering food and the table tent said ""$2 cheeseburgers!""  Great, again.

The waitress took our order pretty much right away and we got a pitcher of beer, an appetizer, and three cheeseburgers.  The service was good and so were the burgers.  We ordered a second pitcher and then, after about an hour, asked for the check.  To my surprise, we were charged $8 for each burger - the normal price!

I asked the waitress if there was a mistake and she said no.  I told her I thought the cheeseburgers were $2 (because of all the signs).  Then she said ""Ohh, you wanted the $2 burgers?  I'm sorry, you should have specified that.""  Then she showed me that on the back (and only the back) of the table tent in smaller print at the bottom, it said something about the special burgers being 2 ounces smaller or something like that.  I'm a little annoyed, but I still act friendly like this is just a genuine misunderstanding.  She's apologizes again and says it's their policy.  So I ask for the manager.

He's no help either and just keeps explaining the policy to me again and again.  I keep my cool and eventually just say ""Ok man, no worries.  Thanks.""  So we pay and don't tip the waitress, which basically makes the whole thing come out as a wash.  We ended up paying what we would have paid for the $2 burgers and a tip.

But I didn't feel good about it.  Was I the asshole?  On the one hand, the waitress didn't invent this dumb policy where they advertise $2 cheeseburgers but do very little to tell you they're different from the normal burgers.  On the other hand, a tip is supposed to be payment for good (or at least adequate) service, and our waitress really should have taken five seconds to clarify that the burgers that were being promoted all over the place were not the ones we were ordering.

1760,Not the A-hole,"I have a side job as a freelance photo retoucher, and I have a steady client base, working mostly with high end fashion photography, product photography etc. My girlfriend is really supportive of this and she takes interest in what I do. My style if very natural and precise, making sure everything looks as natural as possible.

Recently a friend took a beautiful portrait of my girlfriend and sent her the high res image. She absolutely loves it and wants to print it as a gift to both her parents and her grandparents. She asked me to retouch the photo, so that it looks perfect in a large format. Normally, I avoid doing editing for friends and family because I never know what they expect, but my gf knows my work, she often gives me her feedback before I send the finished product to a client, so I thought okay, why not. She specifically told me to ""go for it"" and do the best job I could. The photo is beautiful and didn't need much work, so the next morning I presented her with the finished product, and she completely lost it. She started crying, telling me I made too many changes, made her aware of ""every flaw"", showing her that ""so many things are wrong with her"", and telling me she had never felt so hurt and humiliated in her life.

Needless to say, I was completely taken aback by this. I think she looks beautiful in real life as well as photos, I see no ""flaws"" whatsoever in her, and the very few changes I made to the portrait are just  flyaway hairs, creases and wrinkles on the dress, a visible tanline she hated (she was wearing an open shoulder dress after we returned from holidays) and a few visible objects in the background that the photographer probably didn't notice (wires, stains on wall etc). There were absolutely NO changes to her body, facial features, hair color, eye color or anything that I would expect her to find upsetting... especially a person that knows what photo retouching consists of and how I work. Basically, I corrected a few details that just made the image look more professional, after getting her clear instruction to take retouching as far as I can. If anything, the only person who might have the reason to feel ""insulted"" is the photographer, who approved of the changes and absolutely loves the finished product.

She can't stop crying, says she feels ugly, doesn't want to print the photo for her family and blames me for making her feel unattractive. Nothing anyone says seems to help. AITA here?",17,67,0.95
1761,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:  I've been with my husband since we were 19.  He is the oldest of 3 siblings.  A brother and a sister.  Brother was a ""hippie"" wanna be who didn't want to work or go to school because he didn't want to contribute to ""Big Brother Corporations"".  Sister started having kids at 16.  3 kids with 3 different men.  None of these men did anything for her or her kids.

Husband and I put ourselves through school and have decent jobs, but for most of our relationship have been sick deep in debt due to school loans and health issue.  No kids.  We're now in our late 40's and just starting to get some relief due to our being super cheap and diligent for the last decade.

12 years ago we went NC with his family.  His choice.  It was a lifetime of all of them trying to suck every penny they could out of us to support his lazy brother and his sister and her children.  FIL actually had a really good union job and retired with stupid sick money coming in.  It didn't matter.  The only time we heard from them was to ask for money.  And not just ""Hey, can I have $20?""  It was, ""Hey, can you buy your sister a $300k house and a car?""

BIL wracked up 3k in credit card debt and was considering filing bankruptcy and in laws actually had us over for dinner with him to plead his case so we would give him 3k.  Again, we were super under water with debt and I told him ""You'd be a fool to declare bankruptcy over 3k.  Get two part time jobs and pay it off.""

An elderly family member passed and left them a LOAD of money.

Husband ended up having severe health issues 12 years ago that put him out of work for almost a year and me out of work for 3 months to care for him.  At that time, the phone calls asking for money never stopped.  In fact, since we were off work, it was assumed all the holidays would be hosted and paid for by us.

Husband went NC with his parents.  His brother went NC with us for us ""being so mean.""

Edit: Oh and SIL was NC with us because she owes us THOUSANDS she borrowed and didn't make any effort to pay back.

I get a text a few months ago from his brother saying ""Hey, is DH's phone number still the same?  I want to connect with him and have a relationship with him."" (He had also texted DH.)

Since he contacted me I felt I had a right to respond back ""Hey, please do contact him if you want to have a relationship with him.  He'd love that.  But if you or your extended family are looking for money, I want to let you know we don't have any to give.  But please contact your brother if you genuinely want to have a relationship with him.""

IMO I think they finally ran out of money from FIL's retirement and the inherentance and are now sniffing around.  I wanted it to be upfront that we're not handing out cash.  If BIL hadn't contacted me (and just DH) I would not have taken it upon myself to contact him and say this.

Outcome: BIL fell off the face of the earth.  No further contact with DH.

AITA for doing this?  Or should I have let this play out?




Edit:  Here are just a few examples of how my in-laws have treated me over the years.  

Whether we had money or not, we had to have holidays and provide the food.
One summer cookout I purchased a 24 pack of Italian sausgages, a 24 pack of brats, and 12 fresh hamburgers.  I figured we could cook this up and have lunch and dinners for the following week.  Note, there were 8 in laws coming over.
They proceeded to eat ALL of it.  My FIL ate 12 sausages and 4 burgers.  I was astounded.  He said, ""Well, FREE FOOD!  We didn't eat for a day so we could eat as much as was here!""

Another cookout, MIL actually asked her daughter and BIL's wife to help bring in dirty dishes after dinner.  I had brought out my Pfaltgraff ceramic plates and bowls.  SIL and BIL's wife commenced to take dishes in the house and break them to pieces in my sink because they were so mad someone asked them to help.

Same cookout?  SIL told her oldest son to steal whatever he could find of value from our house.  He stole my late father's watch my father's company had given him for a retirement gift after 43 years with the company.  The reason I found out?  They tried to pawn it and found out it wasn't worth that much and were MAD AT ME that it wasn't that much.

Final salvo?  SIL walked into my living room with a 2 liter bottle of Mountain Dew and proceeded to dump it on my living room carpet in front of everyone.  Immediately everyone jumped to her defense and said, ""She's just jealous you own a home and she doesn't.""  FYI she was 35 at the time.

I don't want anything to do with these people anymore.

OH! and final edit!  Four years ago DH's parents stole his identity and filed a tax return in his name (which took us 2 years to resolve) and on top of that took out 200k in credit in his name.  He got LifeLock and all those accounts were closed out.

Initially he contacted them about the tax return and his father said, ""I didn't do anything!""  Then the IRS contacted us a few months later to let us know that in-laws bank account had been compromised by hackers with that fraudulent tax return.  So DH called them and told them that.  FIL was like ""WHAT?????  What did you DO to us????  Who hacked us???  We just stole your tax return!  Now you are telling me hackers got my checking account info?""",34,203,0.96

1766,Not the A-hole,"First time posting here. Buckle up folks, this is gonna be a bit of a long one. 
My wife and I have been together about 4 years, married for 1. She has always had a poor relationship with her mother (MIL), who, to make a very long story short, was emotionally abusive, misappropriated child support, and when dropping my wife off at college for the first time refused to leave until my wife signed a contract to sell Avon (so she could turn in orders for her and make money off of her). The Avon thing is key, by the way, as it is one in a series of jobs my MIL has bounced to and from since she quit her job as an English teacher. 

MIL’s latest venture is in insurance sales, and she has been badgering my wife and me about getting an insurance policy through her. Wife and I are both young professionals with life and disability insurance offered through employment, and we don’t want her knowing our private financial information, so we have politely declined her services. She has not taken this rejection well, and didn’t speak to us for about a month the last time we told her no.

Yesterday, MIL texts my wife out of the blue asking to meet to drop off the family’s shares AAA card. Wife offers to take MIL out to lunch to smooth over the last fight about not buying insurance, and MIL texts her back “I’ll just mail it. I have nothing to say to you.” Wife spends the afternoon crying because she just wants her mom to act like a mom. 

Today, we’re taking a hike with our puppy, and she again texts out of the blue she would like to meet, so in good faith, we go. As it turns out, she lured us to her under false pretenses: she did not bring the card, and wants to sit and talk alone with my wife. A half an hour later, wife comes out to say, among other things, that MIL called her a “brat,” that she wasn’t acting like a daughter, and was incapable of unconditional love with no strings attached.

So at this point I am god damn livid. We are currently not speaking with MIL, and I am trying to persuade my wife to cut this toxic force out of our lives once and for all. AITA here for not acquiescing and buying some small policy? I feel like I have to stand up for my wife against an emotional abuser, but in doing so, am I being just as controlling as MIL?

TL;DR: My mother in law is crazy and I’m ready to cut her out of our lives because she is emotionally abusive.",17,28,0.91

We're all white save for one SIL is Mexican. I served my LDS mission in Mexico, bro in El Salvador, Sis in Guatemala. My dad speaks fluent Spanish as well and we all speak spanglish with her. We always have and even the nieces and nephews do. 

We get to my parents and its typical family mayhem. I start making introductions and up walks my SIL with a niece on her hip (niece is blond/green eyed SIL is tan/brunette with lots of curls) SIL gives me a hug and in spanish says ""hey there he is! How you been?"" My gf says ""Whooops English please!"" (she doesnt speak Spanish so I didnt think anything of this) SIL laughs introduces herself. Niece starts fussing she takes her inside. 

At dinner they end up sitting next to each other and  gf points out that SIL has spoken only English to her S: You asked for English earlier? Gf: oh no I was only pointing out that your English is good. SIL: Id hope so I've been speaking it for 25 yrs. Bro (her husband) says GFs English is really good too. We all laugh and I nudge my GF hoping she'll drop it. She doesn't. She says : Well yeah but I was born here. I say SIL is from CA. At this point my dad asks that we start clearing up the table for cake & shoots me a look. We clear up & start putting out dessert. SIL shakes the milk carton and starts pouring for the kids. GF: So where are you from again? S: CA. GF: So are your folks immigrants? S: They immigrated as kids yes. GF: Oh that explains the milk. S:What? GF: The shaking for powdered milk? S: Never had that.

GF: Im not trying to offend you I actually think its brave. S: I think you're being pretty brave right now too. GF looks scared and before she could say anything else I tell her to just drop it already. GF says sorry and excuses herself. Before bed GF asks why i didnt help her explain. I said I wasnt even sure what she was trying to explain and that she was more telling SIL about SIL life and insisting she knew better thats not explaining thats being condescending and racist. She says she thought bro met her on his mission originally and was trying to figure things out and shes just never interacted with people like that. I said ""What? Californians? Even saying ""people like that"" is racist."" This was last weekend (Sat) and she's still upset and saying IATA.

1768,Not the A-hole,"This was obviously a while ago, it was last thanksgiving, but I just randomly thought about it. 

&#x200B;

I am 25, my sister is 32. She has always been very cruel to me growing up. She was kind of a stereotypical high school bully when she was younger, so living with her was like living with fucking regina george from mean girls, but somehow even worse. We didn't talk for quite a while, then reconnected sort of when she moved to my city. Then, only 4 days before thanksgiving, she comes over to pick up her dog (I was dog sitting at my place) and starts critiquing everything in my apartment. I thought she had gotten 'better' about this kind of stuff, but apparently not. I tried to keep it light hearted, but then she just started berating me about how I was lazy, didn't clean anything up, asking why I didn't clean a stain off of a mirror in the bathroom, and I responded by saying she needs to stop with this constant critiquing of everything in the house, and she just went ballistic. I mean really off the rails, almost like she SPECIFICALLY came over just to let off steam by bullying me. She seriously went absolutely nuts. The funniest thing she does is attack me for my 'weight', when I am maybe 20 lbs overweight, and there was a point after high school for her where she was easily 60 lbs overweight for a while. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I told her to leave or I am calling the cops, and she got extra mad at that and just threw all of the shit on my counter onto the floor in a rage, nearly assaulted me, then stormed out. Again, psycho. I know. She has always been like that. I could almost tell she was going to be in that type of mood the second she walked in the door, I could see her face was all scrunched up and angry.

I told my mom what happened, and just said, I am not going to thanksgiving if she is there. Flat out. I was supposed to cook a bunch of the food, but I am not gonna go if she is there, so they have to find an alternative to make all the food I was gonna cook. My dad called me, my mom called me, my aunt called me, everyone was upset I wasn't going, and saying that I could just avoid her. Nope, not going.

1770,Not the A-hole,"A few days ago, my ex-boyfriend dropped in on my family home (where I thankfully no longer live) to quote ""visit my parents"". Having not spoken for 2 years, this was first contact and I was livid that he would come by uninvited and unwelcome.

Some backstory:
We split up two years ago, nearly three. We weren't a good match, with him being lazy, unmotivated, satisfied with mundane activities and saw more value in his favourite hobby skateboarding.. whereas I was the opposite. He was also used to being doted on by his mother and wasn't used to being told 'no'. This caused him to think and act in a very childlike way, which caused a lot of friction in many serious situations.  In many ways, he was quite emotionally manipulative and unkind to me.. especially during times of severe distress on my part (I won't say more on that). 

I ended it with him after his laziness had tranformed into taking me for granted and I think his respect for me also fell. It was a bittersweet breakup, since we were fond of eachother. We went our seperate ways and communication dwinded pretty quickly into complete radio silence. I unfriended him on Facebook and Instagram and was content being apart.
Not a word from him in 2 years: happy that we'd both obviously moved on.

My dad shows me our CCTV of him pulling up to our house, bold as brass. He spoke to my dad for over an hour. My dad is too awkward and too polite to turn him away, so invited him inside and updated him on myself/my family.
Upon learning this, my reaction was pure shock. I was appalled at his audacity to come to my house after all this time.. that he thought it would be an OK thing to do. To learn of my new life from my naive father felt like an invasion of my privacy and left me feeling uneasy and unsafe.

I send him a quick FB message to let him know he wasn't welcome and to please not contact me or my family again, as it wasn't appropriate. His response was defensive, bordering on hostile. I blocked him immediately (as I felt my message had been made and I had nothing else to say), but he has made various other accounts to send me messages like ""grow up"".

Under the guise of wanting to talk to my family, who he did get on well with and who enjoyed them as parental figures.. I wasn't comfortable with someone who had done me wrong invading my private home.

1771,No A-holes here,"We moved into a new neighborhood a little over 2 years ago. The main reason for wanting to do so, was because this one was way more family based. Kids ride their bikes up and down the street, they still knock on doors, etc. Our last one was mostly elderly folks and we’re a family of 5 with kids 8 and under. We ended up becoming close with the family next door, who also has a similar size family, with kids close in age. It works out well, our kids are almost always playing together when they can. 

I’m pretty close with the mother as well. One night, over a few glasses of wine, she opened up to me that her eldest daughter was adopted. She didn’t share that it was a secret or anything, she just said that they had tried for years to get pregnant and nothing worked, so they went down that route. Then they had a surprise pregnancy with their middle, followed by using IVF a few years later.

A few months ago, my sister ended up adopting a baby boy. My oldest was a bit confused about how her aunt became a mom, because she wasn’t pregnant and then suddenly had a baby. I explained adoption to her and ended up including other people we knew that were adopted. I threw in, her friend, our next-door neighbor. 

Well…fast forward to now. The neighbor mom called me very upset, saying that her daughter is in tears over finding out that she was adopted and my daughter was the one to tell her. I was so confused and the neighbor explained that my daughter had talked about her new little cousin. It lead two the two talking to how babies were made and my daughter said “Well, my cousin was adopted like you were.” And apparently, the little girl didn’t know.

I feel awful. I would not have told my daughter if I didn’t know that the little girl didn’t know. I explained that to her mom, and she said it wasn’t my place to say anything, period. She really went into me about it, yelling at me for a long time. My husband later agreed that I really shouldn’t have said anything, because it wasn’t my story to tell.

1772,Not the A-hole,"When I was 16, i came out to my strictly religious parents. It was the beginning of three years of strict discipline and shaming. My parents tried to talk me into conversion methods, told me i could never be alone with another man, the works. Down to my mother telling me that i should not wear my coat over my shoulder (like a cape i guess) because it 'looked gay and others could start to suspect something'.

When i was 19 i broke. I couldn't live like that anymore. I started leading a double life and visited gay meetups after class. I told my parents i was in the library. The people i met there were really nice, to some i even opened up about my situation. One girl i met told me that i could always stay at her place if i needed to, an offer which i took her up on. I prepared my things and one morning slipped out of my parents house with two suitcases of clothes and important belongings.

My parents were shocked, and asked me to come to dinner once a week to stay in touch. I agreed, and did so. After a few months, my sister drove to my house to pick me up for dinner (she never did that) and told me my father was going to ask me if i did anything that was 'against god'. In their religion, that would be reason for shunning. I asked my sister if she wanted me to lie, and she only said ""of course not, but just so you know"".
My dad asked, i told him i dont care about his bible so i dont know what he's talking about. Then he asked if i had had sex with another man. By that time, i had. And i said yes. They threw me out and told me i could not be in touch with them anymore.

My brother and sister complied with the shunning, although my sister was not happy about it.

Since then, there has been limited contact. Once i saw my mother in the street. she looked around if anyone could see her, walked up to me and gave me what i could best describe as an attempt at a hug. I didnt respond, i just stood there and she walked off after 2 seconds. No words.

She e-mailed me at one point saying my brother has a kid. I couldn't be bothered - i felt that if he wanted me to know about his kid he should tell me himself.

My sister called me after 2 years. She said that she was sorry it had taken so long, since she promised that she would call me once a year (i dont remember her promising that, but there are a lot of gaps in my memory from that time). I answered her questions and asked the same questions back. I was very emotionless in that conversation and just rode it out until she said goodbye. She never called again after that. This was 7 years ago.

After i got away from the bubble of my family, i started to discover what the world is actually like. And it can be amazing! This partly fueled a resentment i have to my family, for them not wanting me to lead my own life.

1773,Asshole,"So I was on this summer program where I met a bunch of people my age (young adult). I happened to be in the room with two of them, one of whom I knew pretty well and the other of whom I didn't know as well. The one who I didn't know quite as well was talking about his family friend who had done both his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Harvard. He kept going on and on about how smart this family friend was, and used a particular example to illustrate his point:

&#x200B;

He said that this friend refuses to use the words ""yes"" and ""no"", and instead only uses the words ""indeed"" and ""negative"" in their place. The other person that was there said ""wow, he sounds like he must be brilliant"". But I felt that this doesn't necessarily indicate that someone is brilliant. I thought it seemed more like the sort of rigidity you'd see with someone who has autism, like how they always have to do certain things the same way in a very particular way. So I said ""that just sounds autistic to be honest, not necessarily brilliant"".

&#x200B;

And the guy got really offended that I had insulted his family friend, and said I shouldn't throw that word around because it's insensitive and degrading to people with autism. I said that I didn't mean it as a slur, but rather that I just thought that the behavior he was describing sounded similar to someone who has autism. He said I'm not qualified to make an autism diagnosis since I'm not a doctor so I shouldn't make such comments. And sure I'm not a doctor, but I thought it was a fair observation to make?

&#x200B;

And I don't see why I'm being offensive to autistic people, since I didn't make any negative implications about autism. If anything I felt that he was being offensive to autistic people because he took his friend being compared to autistic people as such an insult, implying that he thinks it's bad to be autistic.

I see his post that says “I’m off on deployment to a super secret mission, keep me in your thoughts and prayers, I love you all and hopefully I’ll be back soon.” I read that and was like wtf?? I scroll through his post history and see posts of him wearing army uniforms (incorrectly) and with posts like “Ask a army veteran anything?” To which he responded to questions like “how many Arabs did you kill?” Responded with “3 goatfuckers and counting”  “what was the best and worst part of living in Iraq?” And a load of other shit. Apparently when he was in prison last year, he told everyone he was getting deployed to Iraq on a secret mission and won’t remain in contact until he returns. I tried calling my brother asking him to explain himself, no response. I tried for days and I got nothing. Everyone needed to know the truth so I messaged all of his contacts telling them my brother is a phony, showed them the county jail police report and I had my army friend point out all the uniform discrepancies. He lost a lot of friends and his girlfriend. He’s still not back from the mountains and is in for a nasty suprise. I can’t help but feel bad but at the sane time everyone should know the truth and what he did was ducked up",617,3443,0.96
1782,Everyone Sucks,"My father was an extremist. In his youth he was involved with several white supremacist gangs and was involved in numerous race related conflicts with PoC gangs in our city. He was extremely outspoken about his views before we were born, actively participated with hate groups and harbored incredibly toxic beliefs. He's not nearly ""as bad"" anymore, but still holds many of the same views on a personal level. I grew up to be the opposite of everything he stood for, I'm a lesbian engaged to a Mexican woman, and my career focuses on community outreach and support for minority groups.

One of my new coworkers recently found out about my father after him and his own dad spotted us together at lunch, apparently our dads have had conflict when they were younger. This news spread like wildfire, and now the vast majority of my social circle are pushing me to disown my father, claiming that I can't have a relationship with him without supporting his beliefs. A few have gone so far as to accuse me of being ""self-hating"" and my partner's social circle has gotten in on it as well, telling her that she should give me an ultimatum to cut him off or end the engagement.

Neither of us want to cut my father off. I love my father. His views are abhorrent, and the things he's done in his past are things I have condemned time and again. I'm aware of all his flaws and I have never had a problem telling him. But he's still my father, and flaws aside he truly is an amazing father. He worked two jobs to keep our family afloat, he never pushed his beliefs on myself or my siblings and actively encouraged us to think for ourselves. When I came out to him as gay in my teens, he sat me down and explained that his values don't have to be mine, and that he values my happiness above all else. He allowed me to have a normal dating life and accepted my partner without hesitation despite his beliefs, and she actually gets along with him wonderfully. When I started my education, he paid for it ended his involvement with his groups to avoid it affecting my career.

We've talked about his beliefs at length, especially after this. I hate the beliefs, but I love the man who has loved me and cared for me. Who prioritized my happiness over his own convictions. I feel like my work, and my personal culture, is independent of my father, and that loving the man doesn't mean agreeing with him.

I need someone to tell me if I'm not thinking clearly. I know he'll never be perfect and likely internally hold certain beliefs, but I know he's trying, and in my belief if someone is doing their best to change, you don't give up on them. I love what I do, and I love my friends and care greatly for the people I help and want them to be able to trust me, but at the same time I don't know if I can turn my back on family.

The other night, I brought some beer up to the counter at a gas station, showed the lady my ID, and she gave me a shocked expression. She squinted at it for a while, and told me, apologetically, that she can’t sell me the beer. I reminded her of my ID, and she acknowledged it; but told me I look so far below drinking age that she “just can’t trust it 100%” and doesn’t feel comfortable selling it to me.

I pushed her for a while, and then gave up and left. I went to another gas station where the sold the beer to me. The next day, I called the corporate headquarters of her company and complained about her (providing her name, which I saw on her nametag). I was friendly and respectful to the guy who took my call, but made it clear that I was very, very angry about the whole thing, and that it was my first time ever patronizing said gas station company and that it left a “terrible first impression.”

1787,Asshole,"My son is 17, recently he has been acting out of line. He’s been argumentative and rude to me and his brothers and sisters, and any chance he gets he goes into his room and stays there. (Though he does have good grades, stays out of trouble in school, and doesn’t do drugs or alcohol.) He fights with me and my husband constantly as well. 

For instance one of our most recent fights was about his “privacy”. He said that he didn’t like me going on his computer without his permission because its his privacy. I think thats ridiculous because I’m his parent and should be able to access his things at any time, to make sure he’s staying out of dangerous stuff. and EVERY TIME I have searched I found something. I found out he was gay one time, and porn another time. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with him anymore at this point.

So while he was at camp last week me and my husband made an appointment for him to see a counselor, he got very angry when he heard this.  He said that he should have been notified beforehand, and acted extremely ungrateful for the fact that we are about to spend thousands of dollars on him to see them.  Just a few minutes ago he stomped away because I told him he was out of line for talking back to me.

I don’t know how to get through to him, I feel like I’m losing him by the day because he will not listen to me. I’m about at my wits end with him, AITA in this situation?

1788,Asshole,"I’m posting this from my wife’s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I’m the asshole. 

This is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife’s perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

He is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",1801,15354,0.94
1789,Asshole,"I don't even know where to begin with this. I am both a college student and an Officer Candidate for the US Marine Corp and I've been away this whole summer. I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years and before I left everything was so great between us. We even talked about starting to look for rings and maybe even a house since I will likely know where my duty station will be following commissioning. I thought we were so in love with each other and I thought about her every minute of every day. 

Friday I got an email that literally said this: ""I hate to do this to you while you are in XX, but while you've been gone I have discovered that I have been unhappy in our relationship for a long time and I don't want to be with you anymore. I have packed up your stuff and will drop the box off with *roommate.* After I send this I am blocking you in my contact list and social media so please don't contact me. I expect you to act like a mature adult if we see each other out or on campus and know I do not want to talk with you."" 

And that was literally it. No explanation,  no I hate you, just ""I'm not happy, blocked."" I tried to call her but she had blocked my number, I tried to call her friends and they too have blocked my number. I called my roommate and he said he didn't know anything and the box was just sitting outside our front door. 

I felt like I was dying this weekend. I just needed some sort of answer so I called the number I had from the time we visited her parents. Her mom picked up and said something like ""this is between you and her, we always really liked you so we don't know what she's thinking but we don't have any answers. I'm sorry.""  I tried to let that sit but I called back after an hour because it was some sort of link to her. Her mom answered again but instantly handed the phone who said (best as I can remember) ""look son, you're making a real asshole out of yourself calling us. Our daughter isn't stupid and I suggest you do some soul searching to figure out what part you play in this"" and he hung up on me. I tried to call back one more time and I guess they too had blocked my number.

1791,Not the A-hole,"For some backstory: 

Everyone at work has known this guy for a year and a half. He had a baby before Christmas and is now getting married. Another coworker of ours sent out an email to about 20 people including supervisors. It's a money collection to buy him a wedding gift from all of us.

Here's my issue:

There have been many life events of other co-workers just as big happen before this email went out. Another coworker in the email chain is getting married in October. I am having twins in two weeks. Me and him make the same pay (lowest in the organization). No one has bothered to collect for gifts in the two years I have worked here. I feel like it's extremely unfair to collect for his wedding but nothing for my upcoming family or my other co-workers wedding.

She declined and said she had a boyfriend, to which he said ""oh that doesn't matter, its just as friends."" But the thing is, who asks a receptionist that you see maybe 5 minutes a day to just hang out if there's no underlying intentions? I feel that this is highly unprofessional that he's doing this during his work hours. It's gotten to the point where the receptionist hides in the back around the time the delivery guy is supposed to come.

To clarify a few questions that have been asked:

1. I asked the receptionist if she wanted to do anything about it and she said no. BUT, she's 19 and I feel like she's just uncomfortable saying or doing anything.
2. The guy has done this a few times over the past week. (she's currently hiding)

I hate talking about it and while I continue getting help for it, I don’t want to think about it and I certainly don’t want to talk about it. 

One of my friends, Tanya, was the person who called the cops on me when I was having my episode and got me involuntarily hospitalized. 

After this, it’s almost as if she treats me like her “mental health project”. She constantly asks me how I’m doing and brings up my “struggles” when talking within our friend group. 

I just don’t want to be talking about it all the time. 

I almost suspect Tanya of going behind my back to my family and “reporting on my behavior.” so she can get me locked up again.

I just lost my temper and said that I didn’t want to talk about it and she needs to seriously stop bringing it up.

She told me to calm down and that just made me more pissed off and I left the house.

1795,Not the A-hole,"I have a crippling dog phobia. The serious kind. When I was a kid, there was a house on the way to school where there was a very aggressive guard dog who growled at me every single day when I walked nearby; one day, it jumped the fence and mauled me. An ambulance had to be called, the doctor told me it was a miracle I lived, I still have marks. I have feared dogs, even the small ones, ever since.

To be honest, I try to keep quiet about it because my wife is a dog person and she always tries to argue with me when I bring it up. She claims dogs are cute and loving and cuddly, and she will roll her eyes and say stuff like ""seriously?"" when I cross the street to avoid crossing paths with a dog. Our daughter, Celine (7yo), also loves dogs, her mom teaches her to pet and play with dogs whenever they see one. I'm fine with that, really.

Yesterday night, when I arrived home, there was a dog in there. A border collie, according to Google. It rushed to me and I barely managed to slam the door closed before it reached me. I stayed in my car and my wife came out to explain her friend is out of the country for 3 weeks and she volunteered to dogsit (without telling me or asking my opinion about it) because Celine loves that dog and has been asking to have a puppy for a while. She said that it all happened very quickly and that now the friend is away and the dog is there, she can't just get rid of it, and that learning to know one dog would help me get over my fear. She told me to stop being childish and just go home, but I told her I'm not stepping foot inside as long as the dog's there. She is afraid of spiders, so I asked her how she'd feel if I'd brought a human-sized spider in our house - last time there was a super tiny spider in our bedroom, she insisted we spend the night at her mother's place. She got really offended and told me that it's not the same, that dogs are cute and nice and spiders are awful. I stood my ground and she told me I'm unreasonable but she let me go. I spent the night in a motel.

My wife just called me and asked me in a very condescending tone if I was done ""acting out"" and ""ready to be reasonable."" I told her no, and that made her angrier than I had ever seen her be; she told me Celine doesn't understand why I'm not coming home and my wife refuses to explain that it's because of the dog, because she doesn't want our daughter to turn into a ""dog hater"" like me. Honestly, that hurt. I've gone to a friend's place and I plan to wait out the dogsitting period there, but even my friend thinks what I'm doing is absurd.

Everyone seems to think I'm being stupid and childish and refusing to come home just because I'm stubborn. I feel it is very hard for me to express just HOW SCARED I am of dogs, people just see it as a weird quirk of not wanting to be in the same room as one - but everyone seems to agree dogs are adorable, harmless little things. Am I the one in the wrong, here?

----

EDIT: This completely blew up and ended up on Facebook, and my wife saw this post. So, er, sorry Kat. We had a lengthy discussion about the situation, and I think it's important to update you all about it. You all said she is the asshole but I came the conclusion she is not, and that it is mostly miscommunication - if there is an asshole here, it is me for making this post. I admittedly did it to rant and feel validated, and I nitpicked and exaggerated things to make myself look better. Let this be a lesson, people on the internet will twist reality to make themselves look like the heroes of their own stories.

- My wife brought up the dogsitting several days ago. I honestly didn't remember it until she reminded me today, because at the time I thought she was just talking hypotheticals, about her friend leaving the country and Celine loving that dog and how it would be happy playing in our yard. At the time, I'd waved it off with something like ""Sure, the dog can stay, but then I'm leaving ahaha"" and we quickly changed subjects. I thought that we had concluded the dog wouldn't come to our place (I operated with the idea that I was very clear I never wanted ANY dog at home) and my wife thought we had concluded the dog would come and that I was just joking about leaving. We have since talked it out on the phone and both agreed there was shared guilt there, and we needed to communicate better. Before picking up the dog, she did say to me ""I'm going to [friend's] to see her off,"" she didn't mention the dog and I didn't think about it either. When I came home, the dog was a surprise to me, but my wife was convinced I knew about it and expected it, which is what made her so angry when I reacted badly.

- My wife (rightfully) wants her reputation cleared. She always respected my fear of dogs and never asked me to get a dog despite the fact she always longed for one. She also reminded me that she never made comments about me being afraid of big dogs, and she made comments like ""Seriously?"" only when I got openly scared of tiny dogs. It is true I exaggerated that part by cherrypicking a handful of comments over our 10+ years together. My comments about her tone being condescending and stuff like that are just my perception of things as I have been very upset and wanting to rant; she swears she didn't mean it that way. Overall, she has never tried to force dogs on me.

- She does know about the incident when I was a kid and never disrespected my trauma. She did say that me downplaying my fear played a part in her apparent disregard for my phobia, and that post made her realize just how serious it is for me, even now. She promised to make more efforts in the future.

- We did talk several times over the years about therapy for my phobia, and she brought up not too long ago getting to know one specific dog in particular, especially one of her friends' dogs. She thought the dogsitting would be the chance to help me get over my fear since this one dog is very well behaved, according to her. I always waved off these conversations by saying that, yes, it could be good to do that *at some point in the future*, but I never felt ready for it and thought I'd just say no if the concrete situation ever came up. Again, miscommunication, she apologized and I apologized.

- Please stop saying that my wife is doing dangerous things by petting random dogs on the streets. She knows proper etiquette and makes sure Celine is safe and can interact with dogs in a controlled environment. I'm afraid of dogs, but I never, ever feared that one would hurt our daughter because Kat is always around and keeping a close eye on the situation - she would react properly and quickly to protect Celine if it were ever needed. I trust her entirely with that.

- Overall, this whole situation was mishandled by everyone involved and we agreed to communicate better in the future. But I have to admit I DID act childishly by storming out and abandoning my kid, who has been sad and calling for me since I left. I made an ass out of myself. We agreed I will come back home tomorrow, that the dog will be kept in a room away from me until I feel ready to slowly get to know her and that everything will be done within my own boundaries so I never feel overwhelmed. I feel like a douchebag and a terrible father, and I am honestly blessed to have such a great wife (and I swear, Kat, I'm not saying that to get brownie points!) So please, seriously, stop calling her an asshole. This is a difficult situation but she did what she thought was best.

In the end, I am still glad that I made this post since it humbled me, it sparked a deeper conversation about my phobia and communication in our couple, and I have good hopes it will improve things between us in the future. So, thanks Reddit!",940,2931,0.93
1796,Not the A-hole,"I'm using a throwaway here since I'm just not ready to start this discussion on the wedding subs I'm active on and I figure you guys might be a little more removed and impartial. 

We are getting married in December. I have never gotten along with my future sister in law (SIL). I think she is overbearing, rude and she thrusts her views down everyone's throat whether it's the right time or not. She is also an on/off again Vegan and when she's on, she's preachy and rude but then you can find a Wendy's wrapper in her car the very next day. I think she has BPD but her family seems to tolerate it. 

She is trying to start a catering company (easily the 5th business she's tried to start in the 5 years I've known her). My future MIL asked me if I would consider using SIL business so I agreed to meet with her. 

She was rude from the word go. It's one of those things where everything from the words she used to the tone was just rude. She was on a vegan kick so she didn't even ask me what I wanted but claims she spent ""20 hours"" coming up with a menu that my ""southern family"" could tolerate (my family is Rancho Santa Fe...near San Diego...no idea where she got the idea we were from the south). What it looked like to me was she scratched some notes on legal pad and claimed that took her 20 hours. I told her I was really sorry but I'd always counted on having a great classic dish like Duck a l'Orange at my wedding and asked if she could accommodate. She said she would not use meat at all. I asked she'd be willing to make SOME of the Hors d'oeuvres and she said she'd consider it. I thought we were good.

That night I got a crazy angry call from my future MIL that I had pulled the rug out from my sister in law. I explained to her what had actually happened and MIL calmed down a bit but after I explained the real situation. 

 Well now we are in full histrionic melt down with SIL and she is claiming that if I don't place my order and give her a deposit now, her business will fold. My fiancé and MIL are caught in the middle and trying to keep the peace. I'm trying to make the point that I don't even think this ""business"" will be there in December and then we will have more family drama trying to get our money back from her. I relented and asked her how much the deposit would be and the DEPOSIT ONLY is twice as much as the total we are paying the PROFESSINAL CATERER who is making the main course. This is for some sort of vegan finger food. I asked her what the total would be and she said she didn't know until the food was prepared. I told her I was sick of her bullshit and hung up the phone. 

Well now since no one has ever talked to her like that, I'm the major asshole in the family. My fiancé, my MIL and of course my SIL are pissed. My future FIL is awesome and he advised me not to back down as I'm only one with the balls to counter the insanity. Since I'm getting mixed messages, am I the asshole?",631,5329,0.96

1804,Not the A-hole,So I teach at a night school program that operates out of my day school. The students are mostly 20 year old kids on the cusp of aging out of public schools. Most of these kids are here because they have hectic home lives/traditional education does not work. Keeping that in mind I offer an alternative assessment for students who cannot make it to class. It is a very long/tough essay prompt but it offers the chance to get the credit even if they don’t attend a single day. They can send it to me at any time before the marking period ends. Now enter a young man I’ll call “Jim” (obviously not his name). He emailed me four days before the end of the semester asking for work.

&#x200B;

The kids came home from summer camp a few weeks ago. A famous actor visited their camp, saying every American has to reduce emissions by 66% to prevent global catastrophe. He minimizes his footprint with a private jet, yacht, and four mansions. The kids started started acting out, even bullying friends and family about their lack of environmental action. After our son keyed a friend's Mustang (and our daughter tried to cover for it!), my husband and I came up with a ""learning experience.""

&#x200B;

We had the kids come up with an energy budget that cut their emissions by 66%. We drive a Chevy Bolt and have electric appliances, so it was easy to find most of our carbon consumption. We told the kids that if they can reduce their emissions 66% until school starts, we'll cut our consumption the same way. They were excited to agree.

&#x200B;

Driving to karate consumes their car budget, so they have to walk anywhere else. They only get three hours of AC a day if they want AC at night. They reuse their clothes twice before laundering. They can't have meat, and most of the food they eat is either cold or room temperature veggies (cooking takes A LOT of power, so it's either that or their give up computers, TV, and smartphones.) Honestly, we're letting them fudge on power quite a bit, because the fridge and AC leave nothing left for any other electrical things. They've cut down about 30% emissions in actuality.

&#x200B;

Being kids, they didn't think the sacrifices through and even bragged the cuts would be permanent. But surprise: without the car, they can't escape green living and I work from home so they can't fake their living conditions. They lasted 2 days before wanting the old way of things again. We told them they deserved it for being hypocritical over sacrifices they won't make for themselves, bullying, and damaging other people's property. We told them whenever they bully or act out over their self-imposed emission restriction, we'll help them get closer to their 66% goal for the rest of the summer. Of course, they immediately complained on Facebook, so they're 3% closer to their emissions target without internet, computers, and phones.

It's around 1AM and last call is going to be happening soon, so I walk up to get a couple more whiskey sours. I walk up to the bar and the bartender spots me and walks over. He gives me a nod and I say ""I'll just have two whiskey sours."" 

He responds with: ""and?"" I just think that he may believe I want something else because I had been ordering so many drinks before. ""No, nothing else. Just the two whiskey sours."" 

""Okay, but and....?"" he asks me again. 

Now I'm just baffled. I give him the eyebrow raise and he's still just looking at me. ""Dude, I just want two whiskey sours."" 

He then shakes his head and rolls his eyes and says ""it starts with P and rhymes with knees."" He's dead serious. Me being as intoxicated as I am all I can think of is him making a stupid penis joke which makes me even more confused.

I'm generally a very good tipper. If you bring me a drink for 10 bucks I'll give you 15. The whiskey sours were around 18 dollars and I didn't tip him anything and wrote ""Please"" on the top of the check which then resulted in me being thrown out. AITA here?

1816,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account bc of reasons. 

Anyways, my older sister is getting married in March and I am totally checked out. My parents are putting $30K into the wedding and my sister is acting like she could care less about everything. She has 0 opinions about everything, literally everything. Whenever we ask her for an opinion, she says for someone else to choose and then proudly proclaims, “I’m so easy! I don’t have any opinions!” Like no.... this is your wedding. You having no opinions is making this infinitely harder.

The only thing she had an opinion about is that she A) wanted a super expensive venue and B) wants my parents to pay for it. My mom was getting tired of her constant disinterest the other day and talked to my sister, explaining that she’s feeling used because she refuses to help with any of the planning, constantly talking about how stressed she is even though she hasn’t lifted a finger or gave any constructive opinions, and that she wants to pull her money out of the wedding. Ooof. Well that didn’t go well. My sister threw a fit. Crying, screaming, gathering her things and saying how she needed to leave because everyone was bullying her. 

Anyways, suffice to say, my mom caved to keep her quiet so she’s still paying a ton of money for her wedding.

Anyways, I’m supposed to be the maid of honor. Which is fine, whatever, but I’m about done with this whole thing too. This wedding is gonna be an intimate affair. Only a handful of close friends and immediate family. Because of that, I literally begged my sister to hold the wedding during my spring break. I go to college out of state and I have a cat so trying to fix my schedule around those two things is kind of hard if it’s just in a weekend. Well, that didn’t happen. Her wedding is legit the week after my spring break. I’m angry, said something about it and got nowhere, and that was the end of that.

I don’t really wanna participate in the wedding though. Like my sister is putting a sour taste in my mouth where this should be fun and exciting. I want to help and have fun with my family! But she ignores all my texts, never attempts to reach out when I’m away at college, is overall kind of a jerk. However, I could deal with all that if she at least showed she wanted this wedding. I don’t want to perform any maid of honor duties because she doesn’t care. Why should I care?

I told my mom this offhandedly, and she ended up getting mad at me. Saying that I needed to try, because my sister wasn’t. Like what? I need to try because the Bride isn’t...? That makes zero sense.

1817,Not the A-hole,"Throw away here. 

And I know the title makes me sound like an asshole. But hear me out. 

I have a son who just turned 5. His father and I dated on and off for a few years. We broke things off for good and 3 weeks later I found out that I was 8 weeks pregnant. We decided we’d work together to raise the baby but not BE together. It was a toxic relationship for both of us. 

When I was about 8 months pregnant, he had a change of heart. He asked that I put the baby up for adoption. I didn’t want that. We fought about it. He told me that he didn’t want any part of this baby’s life. He also told me that if I ever filed for child support, he’d take the child out of the country. (He is not a citizen of the US, just a permanent resident.) This scared me and I wouldn’t put it past him. I am financially secure enough to raise my son on my own and didn’t want to deal with the drama of court. After that, I didn’t speak to him again until the day I went in labor. I texted him and told him that it was time if he had another change of heart. He asked me to not contact him again. 

That was the last contact that I had with him and was 5 years ago. My son and I are doing wonderfully. He is healthy, happy and surrounded by people who love him. My life revolves around my boy. 

Then yesterday happened. He messaged me on Facebook and wants to get to know my son. He has since gotten married and his wife is expecting in October. He wants his soon to be daughter to know her brother. 

I haven’t replied yet but I don’t want my son to have anything to do with him. He abandoned us and never said a word after that. He never once contacted me to check up on my son or ask to see a picture of him. Why would I want my son to be around a man who would just turn his back on a child the way he did with no remorse? 

I plan on contacting an attorney today to see what my options are but in the meantime, am I the asshole for wanting to tell him to leave us alone and never contact me again?",469,3505,0.96

Just prior to the climax, the woman in front of me pulls out her phone and starts texting. I had a gut reaction (I HATE people who use their phones in movies) and grabbed a handful of popcorn and chucked it at her. She quickly turned around and yelled, ""Did you just throw something at me?!?""

1824,No A-holes here,"I've been vegan for about 10 years (I'm in my early twenties) and in December, I am getting married to my boyfriend of six years who isn't vegan or vegetarian. We both have quite large families and a lot of friends, so the wedding is going to be a big affair. I want to mention that my fiance is completely fine with a vegan wedding, as he eats only vegan food in the house anyway and understands the sentiment.

As I have been vegan for so long, I don't feel comfortable paying for hundreds of people to eat meat and dairy on account of coming to my wedding. I just don't feel comfortable putting my money towards hundreds of non-vegan meals and then food for the party. Additionally, I and a few of my friends are doing all the catering at home, which is obviously a huge task (and would be very expensive to hire for). We did consider the possibility of hiring a caterer, but their vegan options were quite boring and I'm not really a three different types of fancy salad person.

We intend to cater the wedding with a lot of meat and dairy substitutes (like seitan, soy meats, aquafaba cakes, etc) so it's not as if the wedding is going to be just salad and fruit. I truly believe if we didn't mention all the food was vegan, most people wouldn't be able to tell from the menu alone.

Of course, some people hear the word 'vegan' and take it as a personal attack. My fiance's grandparents don't understand what being vegan means so they are worried, despite lots of reassurance, that they'll be eating carrots all day. Some of the uncles, older male cousins, older women, etc, are fuming and saying they're going to sneak in meat. Some people enquired to ask whether they could bring their own dishes in, which I find a little rude anyway but it doesn't matter, as the venue does not allow outside food unless someone has a severe allergy anyway.

I have no intention of changing my menu as I will be cooking a lot of the food myself in my home, and I don't want to put all of my money towards something that really isn't a big deal for one meal and an evening's worth of snacks, but need to know whether I really am an asshole for this or whether the some of the guests need to just be a little less offended.

Most nights she stays over at my house, but one thing she is very insistent on is the fact that running a fan overnight while sleeping will kill you. I told her this is silly; I have an MSc in physics, and the idea that a fan blows all of the breathable air out of the room is absurd.

When she fell asleep, I dragged a fan from another room into the room where we were sleeping, pointed it at my side of the bed, and turned it on. I fell asleep.

At 7am or so, I woke up to her screaming bloody murder and shouting at me in Korean. I don't speak Korean but I imagine she wasn't wishing me a very happy day.

1827,Everyone Sucks,"Using a throwaway since this is work related. Basically we are in Vegas this week for a conference. Our company owner has basically blown the budget and put us all up at in individual rooms at one of the nicer, newer and ""hipper"" casino resorts. It's been an awesome time. I've worked for the company for 6 years (I'm 28 and female, this might be relevant later) and this is the first time I've ever seen him do something this extravagant. 

Ordinarily he's a nice married, very quiet guy who makes sure we are all out the door at 5:30 and doesn't bother us in our off time. 
We had an office ""huddle"" before we left and he sort of went over his ""expectations of behavior and decency"" and how we were to represent the company while in Vegas. He was clear that our off time was our off time but while on the clock we were to be dressed in appropriate clothes, away from the gambling and day clubs and meeting with clients. Totally fair enough as far as I was concerned. 

Yesterday I was taking break in my room between client meetings. Our company has two college grad hires who I really like. They are also stunningly gorgeous girls and they are each staying in a room to the side of me. I came out to the hall and they were out there at 2pm wearing literal dental floss bikinis. I asked where they were going and they said the pool club. I asked them if the realized there was client meetings this afternoon. They said that a client was paying for them to be at the club. I was like wow...so I told them they had to change as I didn't really care if this was at the club, it was totally inappropriate to meet a client wearing a thong bikini. I genuinely like both girls and think they are smart and capable salespeople but both gave me this look like I was an awful stick in the mud and like I was the mean house mom but they relented and changed into casual business attire. 

I ran into my boss later that afternoon at another meeting and he asked me point blank ""why'd you make an ass of yourself to Katy* and Kate*?"" He's never spoken to me like that in 8 years so it really took me by surprise. I asked him if this was about the bikinis. He said ""you don't think a potential 3 million dollar client knows what he's paying for when he asks our two youngest sales girls to show up in bikinis?"" I reminded him of what he said before we left about keeping decent during the day and he said that after 8 years I should know enough to be flexible and give a high dollar client what he's asking for in order to close a sale. It was the first time in 8 years he's ever spoken to me like that. In full disclosure, I don't think they minded and they were just excited about getting into a club to dance and party while ""working"" (I probably wouldn't have minded either when I was 22).

So, my fiancee and I share a Google Play account because its cheaper to have a family plan. Our finances are always very tight because I'm a full time student and can only work part time. He works full time, but we are constantly digging out of debt he accrued before we were together. He's in a consumer proposal as well, so a lot of our money goes to debt repayment, current bills, and rent. 

Today, I got a notification from Google Play thanking me for a recent purchase. I went into the purchase history and found that he spent $140 on coins for a game he plays on his phone. 

When I asked him about it, he lied immediately and said he thought it was only $40. I know that's not true because he had to input his credit card info that was not previously on the account.

Because of our small income and mountains of debt, $140 is a big purchase for us. I've been scrimping and saving to come up with money to get the brakes for the car fixed, and he just drops $140 on PIXELS without even discussing it with me.

He was immediately defensive and sarcastic and said ""of course, I'm selfish and horrible for wanting to spend a little bit of money on myself"". He said he deserves to treat himself once in a while and it shouldn't matter what he spends the money on. Well, I think it does matter because that money would have been more useful as toilet paper rather than spent on something that doesn't even exist! It's a game that he has happily played for free until just now. I really can't understand it. I would never drop over $100 on myself without discussing it with him first.

We have a lot of Americans, and a fair amount of diabetic people in the school, and the Diet Coke has always sold very well.

At one of the school events last spring, I was put in charge of the concession table, and very surprised to learn that at a board meeting I had missed, two brand new members had railroaded and pushed for a diet soda ban, citing religious and cultural concerns.

NTA: specifically, they are from countries where food has less chemicals, and diet soda is just not readily available (I lived in one for a long time), and they cited something about the Bible that frankly didn’t really make sense to me.

I asked what diabetic people were supposed to drink, and one of the ladies smirked, “if they want to be diabetic, they can just drink water.“

Although I am thin, I have been a t2 diabetic most of my life. (Thanks DNA, you’re the best!) The dozen odd people at the school who know about my condition, are diabetic or parents of diabetics themselves.

I was absolutely mortified to explain to parents and students, the diet soda had been banned. This is not a school rule, this is just something a couple PTA ladies made up. 

The board looked tone deaf, ableist, and not business savvy, but I look like a dumbass traitor.

We have another planning meeting tonight, and I need to bring this up again. I’m probably going to say that because I’m diabetic, I will not be working the concession table as long as they have this unfair and unkind role.

They found out that I have my own business and my grandparents asked if I could try to get my cousin to work with me to help him out a little with experience. I told them that he will need to pass an interview. 

Yesterday we had the interview...The anger of his family being a thorn in my parents side got the better of me. I scrutinized his CV, made him sit a test and purposefully failed him and told him that I cannot give him a job. 

My grandparents weren't happy as to what I did...AITA?",234,1629,0.96
1842,Not the A-hole,"**EDIT** - I made a mistake on the initial post. When the initial incident happened she said to me she thought she’d thrown all her tampons away and then went to go get her luggage from the luggage room to look and clean up. This is when I wrote the post in anger. It turns out she found one tampon that she had packed.

Also, to clarify, I asked how it had leaked and I believe that she was using a tampon at the time, but some leakage still occurred - she wasn’t ‘free-bleeding’ as some people claimed. I realise this completely changes the severity of the post and it was more of an accident, but the point still stands in that she had no backups or anything to hand and frequently doesn’t carry backups anywhere. 

**EDIT 2**
Thanks for all the feedback on the situation. I’ve summarised it as something that I need to discuss and help out with. I have no issue buying her tampons and actually did this today after the fact. I’ve gauged that I get a little too worked up over this but also it’s something we can sort out together as it doesn’t sound like many other women go out without backups. Thanks again for all of your feedback. There’re too many to read individually at this point but I’ve definitely got the sentiment!

Original post below:

So I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost four years now, and all through the time I’ve known her, the girl is literally hopeless at preparing for her period. She never carries any spare pads or tampons in her bag in case it’s early - even when she knows it’s coming she’ll not do anything about it until it’s too late.

The incident that’s driven me to write this post is that we’re on holiday and have just packed to come home. She was ‘spotting’ last night, meaning she knew her period would come soon. This morning, when we packed, she threw away all her tampons to ‘make room’ for stuff in her suitcase. Lo and behold, Mother Nature strikes and now she’s caught off guard with no tampons and a massive stain on her outfit. 

I’m so sick of being caught in infuriatingly preventable social situations because she can’t prepare for it in advance. I’m in half a mind that I’m the asshole for being mad over this but I’d like your opinions regardless on either how to help me help her or what I/she should do in general.",543,1902,0.92

1845,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend has lived with me for around a year now, it's my flat and she pays me whatever she can manage each month as she's a student.  For the last few months she's been asking if we can get a dog, I've said no every time as we already have two cats and it's quite a small flat.

&#x200B;

The other day her parents come over and take her away for a surprise, I obviously have no idea what the surprise was so I leave it and wait for her to get home.  A few hours later her and her parents walk in the front door with this rescue dog from a shelter a few hours away, at this point I'm in shock and trying my best to hide my feelings as I don't really want to freak out in front of her parents..  After a while her parents leave and I tell her I'm angry and upset and she apologizes saying she wasn't thinking because she was so excited, she says she's not going to force me to have a dog and will move back in with her parents if I didn't want it.  I was too angry to have a conversation with her so just left it for the night.

&#x200B;

The next day I'm willing to speak a bit more and tell her I want her to move back in with her parents as I don't want the dog and I also feel like she's disrespected me by going against my wishes, now she gets upset saying I've broke her heart and she wants to live here with me and the dog.

&#x200B;

She's now in crying a lot and saying the reason she wanted a dog was for her mental health as she's finished uni for the summer and needs something to do/take care of and apparently the cats are no use as they show no affection...  However she's been crying a lot and is clearly upset and now I'm feeling bad and wondering if I'm being too harsh..  Am I being the asshole here?",83,108,0.94

We are performing a high school play to quite a big audience and people from the national theatre community will be there. I very much like this and will love to perform with my classmates. 

However, the play is quite controversial, it is about a slave owner who falls in love with one of his slaves and then eventually finds a redemption of a sort and turns away from slavery.  My teacher told me that she wants me to be the lead.  

She said that she was picking me because I have in her words the ability to portray the slave owner as ""not just a one dimensional villain but something more"".

1856,Not the A-hole,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid.

1859,Not the A-hole,"[TL; DR at bottom]

I'm a flight attendant (30F)  who normally works in the economy section of the plane, but on this particular day, I was working my airline's equivalent of ""first class."" 

In a nutshell, I was having a conversation with a woman in my section about her allergies, in order to modify her food accordingly. She was a very pleasant, friendly, and polite woman. 

Towards the end of our conversation, she discretely informed me that the infant right behind her was continually kicking her seat (it was a 9 month old, lap held infant), and asked if I could inform the family. The family consisted of two parents and their lap-held infant. I said ""sure thing,"" and proceeded to politely ask the family if they could please just be careful with the infant kicking the seat in front, as it was bothersome to the woman in front of them.  

I was not prepared for the reaction I received. The family got EXTREMELY defensive, throwing up their hands, raising their voice, and repeatedly stating the baby's age (9 months old), insisting that they can't control an infant that young. I was very, very taken aback, as I was in no way, shape or form rude to them - I simply relayed the message in as friendly a way I possibly could.

It's also worth reiterating that both the family and the woman whose seat was being kicked were in the ""premium economy"" section, where there's a lot more leg room. So, it's not like the infant and his mother (who was the one holding him) were squished in super close to the seat in front. 

When the family reacted that way, I was just sort of dumbfounded and said ""okay, well I'm just relaying the message,"" and walked away.

It was thankfully only a 1.5 hour flight, and the infant fell asleep shortly after take-off. 

AITA for saying something? How would you have handled this?! I'm not a parent, but I feel like as a parent with an infant, you can easily pull them a bit closer or adjust their legs such that they don't disturb the person in front (who in this case paid considerably more money to be in that section and deserves to enjoy her experience as well).

TL; DR:  I'm a flight attendant who politely asked a family if they could try not to have their lap-held infant kick the seat in front of them, as it was bothering the lady sitting in that seat. The family got extremely defensive and rude. AITA?",29,42,0.85
1860,Not the A-hole,"My little sister is staying with me for the summer, and she will celebrate her 15th birthday here in about 3 weeks. I am 32M (she's my half-sister, we only share our dad, hence the age difference). She's currently alone here with me and my SO, and her parents will join us for the birthday party.

Everything was going perfectly for the past 3 weeks, she's a really good kid, loves to help in the kitchen, does chores (voluntarily!), takes our dogs for a walk and so on. But several days ago, I caught her taking photos of herself in her underwear. First, I was shocked at what sort of underwear she has for a 14 year old (lacey red g-string). Then, I saw a cell phone in her hand. I told her to get dressed and come talk to me.

She was crying before we even started to talk. I told her I'm giving her a chance to go into her gallery and delete whatever photos she took before she gives me her phone to check it. It took her several minutes to delete everything, then she gave it to me and I looked at all the photos. I asked her who she was taking them for and how she's sending them. She said she likes a boy (16) and she sends them to him on Messenger. I asked if I would find these photos in Messenger if I go to her conversation with the boy. She begged me not to open the conversation (and I didn't). Then I asked where she got the underwear and she said he bought it for her. I asked her if she's having sex with him (or anyone else), she said no.

I gave her a whole lecture about what is and isn't legal, what kind of websites her photos could end up on if the boy forwards them, why it's weird that a 16yo boy is giving a 14yo girl a g-string as a gift and why it's dangerous to trust anyone with your nudes. I told her about creepy old men online and revenge porn and consent and the inability to give it at 14. I told her she could ruin not only her life, but that boy's life as well if she doesn't stop. And I don't feel like I've exaggerated much. She's promised not to do it again, she deleted her conversation history with the boy and asked him if he could delete her photos because she's embarrassed, but he said that he likes them and refused to do it. It is what it is.

Finally, I told her I'll have to talk to her parents, so I spoke to her mom. Now, her mom thinks I've done some huge horrific mistake. She doesn't think it's weird sending a boy photos of your early teen body in ""sexy"" underwear and she thinks it's healthy (?!) that her daughter is ""in love"". She's appalled that I told her about stuff like revenge porn, and threatened to take the kid back home sooner than we agreed unless I leave her alone to do whatever she wants. So now I look like a dickhead and my little sister is confused. I'm pretty sure she's 1-2 conversations with her mom away from also thinking I was a mean dickhead and just continuing to send the boy her photos.",575,2080,0.97
1861,Not the A-hole,"This situation is making me see red, and my husband thinks I'm not being fair to him. I need an outside perspective on this.

I got my husband and I a roadside assistance plan, that way should either of us break down on the road I could rest easy knowing we were covered. The plan I got has a limited number of times we can call in for service, but I didn't think that would be an issue since I take good care of our cars and they shouldn't be breaking down often anyway.

I had spent a few months away on a business trip and during that time my husband called because his car wasn't starting. It's a newish car, a little under 3 years old, so I didn't think they're could be anything major wrong with it. It sounded like it may have needed a boost, so I told my husband to call for roadside assistance to help since hes disabled and can't do it himself. He called, the car got boosted, started working again and I thought all was well.

Today my husband called me while I was at work to say his car wasn't starting again. That concerned me because it should not be having issues this early on. I told him to call for roadside assistance again and get the car towed to our mechanic. That's when he told me: we were out of service calls. I was blindsided, there was no way we used them all. After I got off the phone with him I called the roadside assistance providers to get to the bottom of this. That's when I learned that my husband didn't call for a boost once: he called several times, all for boosts on his almost-new car all while I was away. I couldn't believe it, how on earth could he have gotten boosted so many times without it occuring to him that something might have been wrong with his car? 


I got home that night and we got into a fight. I demanded to know why he never called me about his car troubles. He didn't want to bother me while I was away for work and said he was taking matters into his own hands. The car always worked after getting boosted so he didn't see a problem, but then would need to be boosted again shortly afterward. I took a look under the hood, the alternator is completely shot. Even if we could get it started, it would be unsafe to drive. It must be towed.

Here's the trouble: because he'd used up all our service calls, our roadside assistance plan no longer covers us and they won't tow the car. A tow is going set us back a few hundred dollars at least and I'm refusing to pay for it even in part. The way I see it I paid for that roadside plan my husband squandered away so this is entirely his responsibility. He earns less then I do so he's complaining about having to shoulder the cost all by himself. Here's the infuriating part: the plan I got covered tows, and the car is still warranty at the dealership. He could have gotten it towed and fixed for free, but he choose not to. I think this is entirely his fault, he's begging me for help. AITA?",30,52,0.95

1863,Everyone Sucks,"My uncle had a beautiful little girl 3 years ago, and both my uncle and aunt are still heads over heels about her.

Problem is, they suck at parenting and won’t let anyone tell them that they’re wrong.

For starters, they’re anti-vaxxers, and have refused to give her any shots; where I live, they’re mandated by law and kids cannot legally attend school without a vaccination certificate, but they’re homeschooling her. Loophole, I guess.

Secondly, her daughter has a horrible behavior, screaming, talking over adults, throwing tantrums and constantly touching fragile objects even when repeatedly telling her not to.

The event that broke the camel’s back was this:
One night, we were having a family gathering at my house, and while my mom was praying (she’s very catholic) the kid farted really loudly.

Her parents just laughed, and carried on like if nothing had happened.

After this, I don’t want her in my house anymore ever again, and I will let her parents know that she is not invited anymore, I don’t care if it ruins my relationship with them at this point.

My mom doesn’t want to do this, as she wants to keep our family very close (she’s very traditional)

WIBTA if I went against her wishes, and told them that she’s not welcome here anymore?

Edit: since so many people are asking why the farting ticked me off so much; it wasn’t the farting itself, kids do that.

What annoys me is the fact that they refuse to teach her why that is not okay, and don’t make any effort to fix this behavior, in fact, they seem to encourage it with laughter, and this applies to many other things.

When she has a tantrum they generally stick an IPad in front of her, and she calms down momentarily, but misbehaves shortly again.

Edit#2: I should mention that she starts screaming, yelling, and sometimes crying when no one is paying attention to her. I mean, whenever her parents aren’t focused on her, she starts yelling, whenever she’s doing something and people aren’t watching her, she yells and cries, it just keeps happening and her parents don’t even try to do anything.

Edit#3: I just realized I should mention that I’m from Ecuador, and culture here is different. Farting is disrespectful in our culture, and we should at least say sorry when it happens. Kids are expected to be well behaved, and this is the case the majority of times.

Edit#4: I shouldn’t have said “ever again” in the title, that’s not what I meant, I was annoyed and made a mistake, sorry.

Edit#5: I refer to her as my niece Bc my uncle is my cousin, he’s older than me and he has a kid, so I refer to him as uncle and to her daughter as niece.

*update*

Talked with my mom, she agreed that the kid was making many guests uncomfortable, and we decided to tell her parents that until her behavior improves, she won’t be invited here anymore.

Of course, they’re mad at us, but we have considered the pros and cons, and we have decided to take this course of action.

1867,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account, and not a shit post! (Pun intended lol)

Warning: this post may be gross.

 I'm a licensed massage therapist. I currently work at a spa, and I pay ""rent"" for my massage room.  Before treatment I ask what areas they want focus on. This client,(F30s?), expressed she was having some pain in her lower back and glute(butt) muscles.
I leave the room, and and I told her to dress down to her comfort level.

This client booked for 1 hour massage. About 15 minutes into the massage, I tell her that I'm going to pull back the sheet and start work on her lower back.

Now the gross part. The client wasn't wearing underwear, and when I pulled back the sheet there was brown liquid mush around her butt crack. This wasnt just a skid mark or not wiping very well, but the sheet now had what appeared to be poop on it. Runny yet sticky at the same time. The sheet was gross.

I've never been in this situation before, and I didn't want to embarrass her. I couldn't continue the massage, it would be a health hazard and it was smeared all over the sheet and some of her lower back. I said to her oh I'm really sorry I think you might need to go to the washroom and clean up a little. I'll give you a few minutes and let me know when you're ready. I left the room and heard her go into the washroom. 15 minutes have gone by and she hasn't come back out, so I knock on the door and ask if she's okay. She responded Yes I'll be out in a minute. But that minute turned into another 15 minutes, so she was in there for a half hour! She came back out and I continued for 15 mins. When I finished, I left the room for her to get dressed and met her up at the counter to pay.

This where I'm wondering if IATA. I charged her the full amount for the massage, because she books the one hour time slot, and I had another client after her so I couldn't exactly run late. She got really mad saying she should pay half the price! I explain that I was sorry, but the hour was booked for her and it would be the same if somebody was late, they would still have to pay the full price of the time slot that they booked. She started yelling at me at the front desk saying how unprofessional I was. She eventually did pay, and later that day there was a review that she posted saying how I ripped her off and charged her more money than the actual massage.
My partner said that I should have given the poor girl a break, she obviously was ill and I should have charged her half of the amount even if it meant I was losing money. My coworker that I discuss this with said any other professional, like a counselor would be charging the full amount that's just what professionals do, and I'm NTA.

1868,Not the A-hole,"Last weekend, I went camping with my boyfriend. We went to a wilderness area in Pennsylvania, where we did some backpacking. It's a place where you're allowed to set up camp anywhere in the woods, as long as you follow ""leave no trace"" 

It was almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit and we'd been hiking for hours and eventually we found a nice place to stop in a clearing near the river. It was well enough away from the trails that we couldn't see the trail. 

He took off his shirt and I was jealous he could just go about shirtless. He said ""why don't you, are you afraid of the squirrels seeing"" and I decided fuck it, I'd hang out shirtless too when setting up camp.

After a couple hours, I heard footsteps coming towards the campsite which was weird because in the woods, with dispersed camping, people usually keep to themselves. It's pretty bad ettiquite to come upon someone else's campsite when it's getting late in the day, or especially if it's dark out. And the sun was getting low in the sky.

This family came into the clearing, 2 preteen boys and their parents. And I was a little shook because I was alone (my boyfriend had went further from the trail to take a piss) 

I momentarily forgot about my shirt, because I was spooked, until the mom started losing her shit at me for being ""indecent"" and exposing myself. I stood there and reached for the knife in my belt because I was kind of wary about strangers coming to my camp and getting confrontational. I don't think she noticed, but she sure did notice I wasn't rushing to cover up.

My boyfriend came jogging back and he saw what was going on right away and handed me a jacket to put on. And he basically asked them to move along. 

I said something about how they ought to be careful coming up to people's camps in these woods, a lot of people carry around here and it generally gets folks on edge if you come up to their camp in the evening. 

And that got the dad snapping at me, asking if that was a threat. I tried to say real calm that it wasn't a threat, just a word of advice.

They moved on after that, and I guess I'm still feeling weird about it. I didn't know folks would give that much of a damn about a natural body. So, input please, AITA?

1869,Not the A-hole,"To start off, I would like to say that I have a good relationship with my parents and they’re generally chill about most things, just so y’all don’t jump to the conclusion that they’re overbearing and abusive. 

About a year ago, my mom heard about this app called Life360 from her friend, and it allows her to track me wherever I go. 

I was opposed to it at first, but I didn’t really care too much as I’m in high school still living with my parents and I tell them where I’m going when I go out anyway. Their house, their rules. 

However, I will be starting my fall semester of college soon, and I’ll be living in the dorms. The college is about a three hour drive from my house and I was excited to finally have a taste of independence. 

That is, until my mom informed me that I would not be allowed to delete the tracking app from my phone. I told her it was an invasion of my privacy, but she said that me moving three hours away made the app even more essential, saying that she’s concerned for my safety and wants to know if I’m ever in trouble or hurt. I said that I would still be able to contact her if that ever happened, but she won’t budge. 

I don’t really want my parents knowing where I am at all times, as that kinda ruins the point of moving away. I wanted to have my first chance at living alone and doing what I please without having to ask permission all the time, but now I feel like I’m being watched.

1870,Asshole,"One of my favourite things to do is to sit down with my family and watch our favourite show together, whatever that show may be at the time. But lately, my enjoyment has been uncertain because of a bad habit that one of my moms seems unable to do. What she does is she makes a remark, usually beginning with a ""You know..."" or a ""You boys realize that..."" when basically anything happens on the show. For example, we were watching Netflix's Sex Education and she immediately started going on about finding the right person, whether that's a male or female, and other topics of the sort. For the third time.

She has been using the nightly family routine as a way to teach my brother and I things that we have been taught many years prior, and she has been doing it for at least two years now. Each time, both my brother and I kindly tell her to please stop and that it hurts the experience of watching the show. She always says sorry and relents but then does it again, often on the same episode. I've dealt with it every time before, but a few days ago I lost my patience. 

The four of us, my brother, her, my other mom and me, were watching the new Stranger Things together and it reached the point where some characters had a strained romantic relationship. She started to talk about how to treat your partner, not for the first time, and I flipped. I paused the show and (loudly) told her that I was sick of her trying to shove a lecture into something I really liked doing, and admittedly said some things that were just there to make her feel more guilty instead of actually having their own points. When I finished she was silent for a while and then started to apologize, saying how she only was trying to prepare my brother and me for our future and how she thought the setting would be a good way to teach us naturally. She was crying. I immediately felt terrible, and told her that I overreacted but I was still tired of the behaviour.

We ended up finishing the episode and we had a good time. The rest of the family felt that I was really too harsh and that she meant no harm. I know she didn't come from a place of malice, but I am still firm that she shouldn't do it anymore. AITA for doing what I did?",143,430,0.96
1871,Not the A-hole,"I(23M) recently was at Dirty Sixth Street in Austin, TX with some friends when we came across a group of girls and kinda hung out with them at a few bars there. There was a girl same age as me who I thought was attractive, and we were flirting a bit. We were both the DDs (aka stayed sober the whole time) and we kinda hit it off and talked a lot about things we found we had in common. 

Towards the end of the night, she asked if I wanted to come over to her place and hook up after getting my friends set. I asked if she had a boyfriend (I probably should have asked earlier before flirting), and she said she did, but he wouldn’t mind. I asked if she was in an open relationship but she said no, so I told her I wouldn’t be comfortable going over. She insisted her boyfriend wouldn’t care and she does it regularly. I didn’t exactly believe her, as I’ve heard that excuse from people who cheat on their SO. I’ve been cheated on before and it sucks , and I don’t wanna help someone else potentially cheat. After a few more times of her saying it’ll be fine, I asked her, “if we’re gonna do anything, can I double check with your boyfriend (idk him) and call/talk to him first to make sure he’s cool?” 

At this point she gets pissed and screams that she can do what she wants, and doesn’t need anyone’s permission to have sex. I apologized and said that would feel better if I just went home with my friends. Her friends joined her saying I was a misogynist and an asshole for not trusting her and treating her as property owned. My friends and I left to them (drunkenly) throwing trash and cursing at me.

AITA? I feel bad if this girl was telling the truth as I do think people can do whatever they please, but thinking back maybe I should have just said no repeatedly without bringing the boyfriend into the conversation at all (EDIT: to see if he was cool)

1872,Not the A-hole,"So my mother and I were at target buying some stuff here and there, and as we reached the automatic checkout machine, one of our items didn’t have a price tag, so I told my mom “wait here I’ll get you one with a tag” and halfway there I realized that may not have been the best idea because my mother might be holding up a line but there were other checkouts and there was practically no one when I left.

Either way for safe measure I double timed and must’ve taken less than two minutes in total.

However when I came back a small line had formed of about three people (which was strange because there were other checkouts open) and right behind my mother was a particularly unhappy looking senior lady. 

I swear everything about her from her tiny just as angry as her chihuahua to her permanent grimace gave me a big no no vibe.

Anyway I didn’t think much of it, we just needed to rescan the items and that would be it. My mom then told me in French “i don’t know what she’s telling me but hurry up, she’s rushing me”.  

Alright then, I guess we’ll just hurry on up. Slightly rude of her I told myself, but no reason to get upset. 

Then the lady speaks and tells my mother, who doesn’t understand English too well, “You have no manners, there’s people waiting you know?”. The nerve on this lady, regardless i just kept going on, I mean I’m going as fast as I can after all.

All the sudden she turns to the young lady behind her who was clearly uncomfortable with her, and said “people these days can be very rude and ignorant can they?” In a tone meant for us to hear. The young lady just smiled uncomfortably. 

At that point I was unbelievably irritated; how impatient do you have to be? All in all this must’ve taken a good 3 minutes at most for her.

I was willing to let it go as we finally finished but as we walked past her she looked me dead in the eyes and told me “your mother is very uneducated and....”

Third time’s the charm I just couldn’t take it anymore. I didn’t let her finish as I raised my voice a bit and told her “Oh shut up you old fucking hag, you’re not one to talk to me about manners” all whilst having a look of pure disgust on my face. The young lady was made even more uncomfortable and when I saw that I decided to just leave the Target right then and there.

My mother asked me what I said and I told her I just asked her to be more patient. I’m not proud of it all but I’d be lying if i said it didn’t feel good. Never in my life have I ever talked back to an adult, let alone an elderly.

It just infuriated me to see my mother insulted and shamed in public when she couldn’t defend herself because of her poor English. I obviously love my mother and am very grateful for her, and I could tell she knew that’s not what I told the old lady.

So, am I the asshole for not handling the situation more politely ?

Edit: I should add that about ten meters away from us was an open auto checkout, and another ten feet from that one was another one with one person there.

Edit 2: Not that important but I told my mother because it felt wrong lying, and she said I shouldn’t get the best of my emotions, and that she’ll let this go just this once.",48,85,0.92
1873,Not the A-hole,"This is a really, really weird situation. Me and my girlfriend live together, we are 23 and 25. My sister often has to go on business trips. 

&#x200B;

4-5 months ago, my nephew came to stay with us. He is 8 years old, and generally a really weird kid. I figure some kind of disorder of some sort. Anyways, there were a few instances where he... well... would go out of his way to see us naked. We don't have a lock for our bedroom bathroom (we got one installed after this), and its almost like he would wait until we were in there, then go into the room and peek in to see what we were doing. We caught him doing this like 10 times. We told him, over and over, please do not do that, but there isn't exactly much we could do. I don't even know how he always knew we were in there, but it was SUPER uncomfortable. We eventually resorted to having to put a 30 lb weight against the door whenever we would use the bathroom. But then he resorted to just pushing the door open with all his weight, not even peeking, frightening the fuck out of us. There was one point where he walked in on us having sex at 3am (why the fuck was this kid awake?) and just was starting at us from the doorway. Who knows how long he was starting... He would also randomly get naked and run around the apartment. It was like the week from hell (well, only 6 days, but w/e). He would also randomly grab my girlfriends breasts out of nowhere. We told my sister about this and she said it was INCREDIBLY weird because hes mostly well behaved at their house and doesn't do stuff like that. And frankly, it is weird, we've been on vacations with him and he never did anything like this to anyone, we went to barcelona for 2 weeks with my sister and him and nothing weird happened. 

&#x200B;

My sister called me in a hurry, saying she has to go to madrid for work for another 5 days, and that her babysitter crapped out on her. She has nobody else to take her kid, and she asked if we could take him. She said she has nobody else to take him. I talked to my girlfriend and she practically laughed at the idea of it, it was a resounding no from her. I honestly felt terrible about this because my sister doesn't exactly know many people here to ask besides us. She only moved here a year ago. But I told her no, I just couldn't deal with this kid making us THIS uncomfortable anymore. My sister sounded like she wanted to cry because she was so upset, but this was just... too weird for us. It doesn't help that my girlfriend would be alone for two days with him while I am getting my surgery, in which I would be in the hospital overnight.

1874,Not the A-hole,"So im expecting a boy, and my husbands first name has been passed down for ten generations. And I hate it, but he's insistent on naming our child that no matter what. I told him no and that I would name him after his grandfather on the other side of the family, but he had some harsh things to say about that. He says I have absolutely no choice in that matter but I think since I'm the one dealing with pregnancy and labor I should have some say In the name, right? I don't know what to do like I don't want to destroy a family tradition that has been going on that long but at the same time I grew up with my child's names already picked out (I never had a set name, I was just excited to name my child) and I despise the name. I feel like it would make me unhappy every time I say it. 

AITA for wanting to break their family tradition?

Edit: thank you all for your opinions! Sorry if I am not making myself clear, this is my first ever post on Reddit. I don't necessarily despise the name, the name is fine and it suits my husband but I would never have named my baby that. He says that he just doesn't want to ""break tradition"". In no way is this a sentimental thing or he loves his name because it's connected to his family. My husband isn't like that, which makes this more frustrating for me because there's no deep meaning with him.

1875,Not the A-hole,"So a little back story my ex hasn’t been a consistent part of my children’s lives for almost three years now, he hasn’t paid child support (which honestly it’s whatever at this point I’ve been raising them without his help since our split) or even spent any real time with them. 

My boyfriend came into our lives and has treated my children with so much love and attention, we don’t force him on the children saying he’s their new dad or anything like that. He’s always made sure it was up to them how they view him. My son is three now so he was just a baby when I split from my ex and he really doesn’t know him well at all. He’s very close with my boyfriend, my six year old still knows who he is and that’s fine I’m not going to ever stop them from having any kind of relationship BUT I’m not going to stress my children out by trying to force a relationship. Basically it’s up to him to have a relationship with his kids. 

On Father’s Day I posted a cute picture of my son and my boyfriend on Facebook because well... it was cute. It wasn’t really a happy Father’s Day picture it was just a picture and my thoughts weren’t to upset my ex in any way. Fast forward a few hours later and he’s bombarding me with messages about how I’m a horrible person and that I should have known how bad it was to post the picture. I quit responding to him and I got a message from his girlfriend basically saying the same, and that “I should know better than anyone how hard Father’s Day is for him”  keep in mind I’ve never kept the kids from him, all he has to do is call me up and I’ll set something up if the kids don’t already have plans. I’ve never said no to calls or video chats with him EVER sometimes it being an inconvenience to myself. 

I just don’t see how I’m a horrible person for posting a cute picture. He has had plenty of chances to come and have cute pictures with his children. It’s not our fault that my boyfriend established a bond with my son and he “is watching from the sidelines”",21,27,0.88

1879,Not the A-hole,"So this happened over 5 years ago, and clearly I’ve got a lot of mixed feelings about it because I still replay the scenario a lot in my mind. Would really appreciate it if I could get some feedback on if IATA. If I’m not, great, but if I am, at least I can finally accept it and make sure I don’t make the same mistakes again.

Disclaimer: I’d like to think of myself as a considerate person. I am more than happy to give up my seat to a senior citizen, pregnant women (god I hope they don’t feel insulted if I try to offer the seat and turns out they’re not with child) or people who just look like they need it more than I do.

Here’s what happened. I was told of a sample sale for a brand that I’m quite a fan of, but usually can’t afford. The discount is ginormous (up to 90% off) and the sale is a well-known event in my city. However, it is on a weekday so the only chance I could go is during my lunch hour. Unfortunately, many people have the same schedule so by the time I arrived, the venue was packed with frenzied shoppers. I was ecstatic to find 2 pairs of shoes in my size and they were so discounted that I could easily justify it as a birthday present to myself.

I got in the very long queue for the cash register and it was definitely going to take at least 45 minutes before I was able to pay, but luckily I budgeted enough time so I felt no stress about standing in line and waiting.

Around 40 minutes later, I was finally near the front and would be able to pay for my goods next. That’s when a pregnant woman holding a bag full of items came up to me and asked, “Can I go in front of you?”

I don’t exactly know what came over me, but my first reaction was to blink, then say “Well you’d have to ask all the people behind me if that’s okay…”

She blinked back and said, “But I’m pregnant.”

And I continued with “Yes but we’ve all been standing here in line for the past half an hour…”

That’s when she glared at me and then just walked up to a sales associate and asked if they had a register for her. I could see the associate stutter, but then led the woman to a register in the corner and helped ring her up.

Now I recognize that this seems contradictory to my statement about how I’d offer my seat to her if I saw her on a train, and if she was behind me in line, I probably would have just let her go in front of me. But her assuming I should let her cut in line in front of me, at a shopping event that’s not considered an essential activity (like transportation or even grocery shopping) made me a little annoyed that she behaved so, in my opinion, entitled.

I was perhaps too self-righteous in justifying my own actions and clearly, it’s weighing on my mind still. Hopefully your thoughts can help me get some closure. It’s not the worst A-potential action but any feedback would be truly appreciated.

So guys, AITA?

EDIT: Wow thanks for all the feedback. Of course I appreciate the majority that said I'm NTA, which definitely makes me feel justified. For the minority that said IATA, I do see your point of view and will take it into consideration. Thanks again. :)",303,1297,0.94
1880,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I bought his parents fourth house. They were trying to sell it for years but it never sold. They finally proposed a deal for us to buy it from them. It was a regular mortgage bank deal. We have a 15 year loan and they got their money now and out of the bills/taxes. We did get a discount, but we also had to deal with boxing up their stuff for them and having to clean the entire house (things they would have had to do themselves if it was sold to a stranger). 

Anyway, this was two years ago. All their stuff is gone minus a few boxes in the attic that they'll ""get later."" They live in the next state over, and they come stay with us 4-5 times a year. They still have keys, so they just let themselves in. Sometimes we're home, sometimes we're at work. They sometimes give us a heads up, but we've also come home from work to find them in the living room watching TV. 

I have no problem with them visiting. I actually love it because I get to play hostess and they get to see their grandkid. My problem is with them acting like it's their house and they're allowed in freely. Anytime I tell my husband he says ""it's just while we transition"" or ""they have us a deal, be nice."" We finally got into a fight on Saturday when we came home from garage sales and his parents were home with no notice. They're still here and tension is mounting in my marriage.

A few years later, she had a baby boy. I met this baby boy and held him. Shortly after that, they moved out of state and we sort of drifted apart, though we stayed in touch via Facebook.

One day, I noticed that all of the pictures of her baby boy were gone. The pictures of her daughter were still up, but even any mention of her son had been deleted. I found that to be weird. I asked a few mutual friends and they thought it was odd as well, she hadn’t said anything to them.

Around the holidays of that year, I ran into her dad at the store. We talked for a bit and eventually, I got around to asking about my friend and her son (not asking about Facebook, but just asking in general how everyone was doing). He told me “I can’t get into it, I just can’t.” He didn’t sound distraught, in fact I couldn’t make out his tone at all.

Recently, I noticed that she was pregnant again and had announced she was moving back to the area. She messaged me, saying hey and that she wanted to get the girls together. I congratulated her on the pregnancy and told her I definitely wanted to do that. We talked for a bit, asking when she was coming back, how things were, etc. Then I finally had to ask about her son. That’s when the conversation halted and she hasn’t responded for over a week.

I was talking to a mutual friend and she thinks I shouldn’t have brought it up at all, but I don’t know. I think it’s weird to just completely erase a child from existence and then no one talks about him. But I can admit I might have overstepped. Am I being an asshole here?",22,31,0.95

He's fairly open about his personal life (parents, friends, hobbies, etc) but very evasive and tight-lipped about his job. I found out he works for our country's Intelligence Agency, but he refuses to say anything else- what exactly his job is, whether it at any point requires relocation, whether it's dangerous, etc. I realize his job is classified, but I just feel uneasy with my daughter marrying a guy without knoeing anything about his professional life, especially since he works in a potentially very dangerous field. 

I brought this up with Eva, asking if he had ever told her about his job or what he does.

However, I cherished the ones I kept. The teddy bear he slept with has always stayed on a shelf and his favorite toy cars and trains have been in a shoebox in my closet.

3 years ago, I remarried (my ex and I separated after we lost our son). I have 3 step-children that I love to pieces. They do not in anyway replace my son, but they do add to a special place in my heart. My husband knows that I lost a child and the older two (12 and 16) know that the nitty gritty of what happened. All the younger one (6) knows, is that I have a son that passed on. He has plenty of toys at both our house and his mom’s (though he spends primarily lives with us). When I moved in with my husband, I put my son’s teddy bear in our bedroom on a shelf and put the shoebox in the closet.

My daughter is thirteen, and very introverted. I love her, and she's the funniest, smartest person I know, but she doesn't have very good social skills. She has severe anxiety and has struggled with clinical depression since she was nine. She's my only child, FYI.

Our family's moving between states at the moment and currently staying at a friends' house for a month. This whole summer, she's been very distracted by her phone. She's always been an avid reader, and when we asked what she was doing all the time she said she was just reading stories online. We assumed it was e-books or something.

We noticed she went over the data limit for the month, so her father asked for her phone and the password. She said no to giving us the password, but agreed to turn the phone off for the rest of the month to avoid going over more. We were understandably concerned, she's normally very complacent, respectful, and not at all defensive about her phone. So we threatened to take it away entirely unless she told us. She did, after a screaming, sobbing shit-fit, the likes of which I haven't seen since she was a toddler. When we opened it, we found tons of *extremely* explicit fanfiction. She's never shown any interest in sex before, and all of this was between two male characters from a TV show we knew she loved (though we didn't know how much). There was fanart too. Not all of it was explicit, some of it just seemed like plain old creative writing, but I went through all of it in front of her. She said she's not using it to get off, she was just curious and found it interesting. I said I was going to start getting into the community too so that I could understand it and she could talk about it with me, but she seemed very opposed to the idea. She begged me not to talk about it more with her father (they have a weird, cold relationship, unfortunately) and I didn't in front of her. But we find this very concerning.

Given what I know about her lack of social skills, I couldn't help but feel this wasn't helping. So I deleted all of what she had saved as well as the pictures. I don't care that it was gay in nature, I've been pretty sure since she was six that she's lesbian. But this can't be normal or healthy. I took her phone for a week, removed the password, and when we see her reading things now we always ask her specifically to tell us what it is. She seems to have stopped, I'm not going to check her browsing history.

I told some of my girlfriends about it and they said I was being controlling and insensitive, and that telling them about it was humiliating for her. She doesn't know I told them, so it can't be humiliating, and I just want what's best for her. I can't imagine this is.

Am I the asshole?

**Edit**: I do want to say that none of what I saw was *disturbing*, per se. No, like, BDSM/rape/super kinky kinda stuff. Very vanilla (*very* explicit, don't get me wrong, but vanilla) for the most part (one threesome, I think). The gayness is a pretty weird, I guess, but that's not why I took it away. I just think it's all kinda gross and distracting for an awkward thirteen-year-old that needs to focus on herself.

**Edit pt.2**: I just want to clarify: I don't think being gay is weird or bad, as I stated above. I just thought it was a little odd for a probably-lesbian girl to be so into male-on-male sex.

**Edit pt. 3: After reading the comments, it's clear that I've fucked this up horrendously. I'm not going to blame anyone else but me for this. I have always tried to make an environment for my daughter where she's aware of sex and safety and comfortable talking to me, but I've just shot myself in the foot. I never meant for her to run in the other direction, and that's what I've done. I should have respected her right to privacy more than I did. Some of you pointed out that this is similar to Harlequin romance novels, which I hadn't considered and which makes this much clearer to me. To clarify, if she came out to me I would, of course, be supportive. If she ends up being straight I'll obviously respect that. It's just always been my motherly instinct that she might like girls, which I never meant in a creepy way. I also didn't realize there's a community there that she may have become attached to, and I don't want to ruin whatever social interactions she has. I feel fucking awful. She's my entire world and I didn't mean to handle this so, so wrong. I'll talk to her tomorrow face-to-face and try to repair whatever I can. I** ***never*** **should have told her father, I'll own that, I just thought he should know as her other parent. I definitely never should have told my friends, oh my god, I only thought they may have had similar experiences. I'm realizing how much I completely cocked this up. Thank you for giving me the slap in the face I needed.**

***Edit pt. 4: Last edit, I promise. Just want to clarify:***

***1) No screaming or over-the-head scolding was involved. I didn't tell her she was gross or strange, just that she'd been spending too much time on it and I was concerned that she wasn't focusing on other things (upcoming school year, talking to our hosts, etc.) I expressed concern that it was stopping her from trying to make friends in real life, and that some of the things she was reading might not be the healthiest in terms of relationship dynamics (consent, etc.) and sexual health (using condoms, etc.). I absolutely concede that I was in the wrong, and that my deletions and helicoptering would make her feel ashamed, but for context, that's what happened there.***

***2) The two friends I told are my best friends and live in Australia. They've never met my daughter and she is only peripherally aware of their existence at best. I never should have told them, I know that now, but the likelihood of this coming back and humiliating my daughter further is minimal, FYI. Her father took a backseat during this whole thing and hasn't altered his behavior in the slightest. He and my daughter are getting on better right now than she's getting along with me, which makes PERFECT sense because I'm an idiot bitch who massively violated her privacy.***

***3) If I could go back and not mention my suspicions about her sexuality, I would. They don't affect the outcome, and I would never, ever in a thousand years try to pry into that part of her life (weird line for me, of all people, to draw, I get it, but there it is). My sister was outed by my ultra-religious parents when we were teenagers and it left her with lifelong scars. I never want that to be the case here. I haven't told anybody my thoughts on it, save this sub. It doesn't matter to me how she identifies, she's my daughter and I love her more than anything. The nature of the fanfiction didn't concern me aside from how explicit it was and how much time she was reading. If it was a straight couple I'd have been just as concerned. Would I have been justified? No, but that was the logic at play, as flawed as it was.***

***4) I meant fandom things, not sexual fanfiction things when I offered to get involved. Like, expos, and such. Not fisting fics. I did not phrase that at all well.***",467,1286,0.92
1890,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I have a 7-year-old son together, Alex. We get along pretty well and are good co parents. She’s married now and has a 4-year-old son James with her current husband. They live an hour away and our current custody agreement is during the school year, every other weekend Alex is with me, we split different holidays and during the summer we alternate every 2 weeks. I always follow the agreement and always pay my child support.


My ex has occasionally made comments about James missing his big brother a lot whenever our son is with me but I just shrugged because, what am I supposed to do about that?  But this summer, since it’s longer periods of times apart she has been making them more and more saying that her son is extremely lonely without his brother for 2 whole weeks. Alex has also mentioned being lonely or bored when he’s with me (I guess since he doesn’t have many friends in my town) so I try and find fun things for him to do and even invite neighbors over. Yesterday my ex asked me if her son could spend a week or so with me when Alex is staying with me and she would be willing to pay if we go out to eat or go the movies or anything during that time and to send her the receipts. This just seemed like a ridiculous thing to ask. It’s my job to take care of my kid not to babysit hers. It seemed like she just wanted an empty house and aloe time. I told her as much but she kept insisting that Alex and James are really close and she doesn’t see the difference between what she’s asking and having a friend or cousin sleep over for a week. I told her she was crazy and firmly said no and she called me an asshole. 

My mom (who helps take care of Alex when I'm at work) thinks I'm an asshole but honestly my mom is still mad at me for ending it with my ex in the first place and think she's perfect so I don't trust her opinion on this.

1891,Not the A-hole,"I'm a 30 year old white woman with EXTRAORDINARILY curly hair - think Merida in the Disney movie Brave. In high school, my best friend (who is black) showed me how to wrap my hair when it's curly to avoid it frizzing out. It has been an absolute game changer for me, and I never really thought much of it. Recently, we somehow got on the topic during a chat at work. One of the (black) women there made a comment about how me appropriating African culture like that is a totally racist move. I generally have a great relationship with this woman, so this whole thing kind of threw me sideways. I never thought about it that way, and honestly just thought that she was blowing it out of proportion, but when I asked a few other women, they agreed that IATA here and that I need to a) apologize and b) stop doing it.

Anyway, I’m not really friends with her, but she’s always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. We talk occasionally. Yesterday she asked if I wanted to add her on social media and I figured why not, so I said yes.

Later in my workout I started looking through her posts out of boredom when I saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. The picture was clearly taken at the gym.

This really angered me because they’re trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it’s not to their face. I scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. She discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they’re working out.

Really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. Without thinking I just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. Ashley was fried immediately.

1898,Asshole,"So this was actually my spouse, on a hike with our kids, their grandma, & our dog. I wasn’t there but we talked about it after & we’re both wondering if we’re delusional dog people.

Dog: mixed breed, mostly husky, about 50 lbs, 1 yr old. She has a very  calm temperament - doesn’t jump up or bark (not something we trained,  she’s just like that). If she sees a stranger she’ll usually either pass by or approach & sit down to see if she can get some pets. If no, she’ll move on. She prefers kids to adults, is more likely to try to get pets from them. So a pretty trustworthy dog, though every dog is unpredictable and she’s still very young. She also has a dark coat and giant ears which some people think looks like German Shepherd, so that can be intimidating (will put a pic in comments if you need that to judge). She generally comes when called or on the hand signal we’ve taught her, but it’s not 100%. 

The setting: National Forest where dogs are allowed to be off-leash except in developed areas like trailheads. When off-leash, the dog must be “under control.” This was several miles down a narrow, wooded hiking trail popular in the summer - especially with families. My spouse said about half the dogs were off-leash. Our dog was leashed in the parking lot, then let off a couple hundred yards down the trail, per the rules.

The incident: Dog would romp ahead with kiddos, they'd pause to wait for adults to catch up, repeat. A family with two little kids, including a girl who’s preschool age, approaches the adults. The mom glares at my spouse in a really hostile way, which was confusing, but she doesn’t say anything. Dog & come running back down the trail, looking for the adults. She runs straight past the other family and stands by my family. The little girl sees dog and starts crying hysterically, obviously terrified. The mom of the other family says “you need to keep your goddamn dog on a leash!” Spouse clips the leash on and they move on.

The  mom didn’t say that our dog had approached the girl/family (our kiddos say dog just ran by with no interaction). I think it’s unlikely that the dog got in anyone’s face, I’ve never seen her do that with a stranger but maybe that’s my dog-owner motivated-reasoning/confirmation-bias. It seemed like the little girl was afraid of dogs in general so seeing one up close was scary.

On  the one hand, we were within the rules (depending on whether letting her get ahead is “under control”) and doing what about half the other  dog owners were doing. And maybe if your small child has a strong fear  of dogs, don’t take her on a popular trail where off-leash is permitted.

On  the other hand, if you’ve terrified a toddler, that’s very not OK and  you need to change your ways. And our dog, while not threatening in  behavior (in our not-neutral opinion), is kind of intimidating looking.  Also why should a family be denied access to a great recreational trail  just because of their child’s fear?",76,38,0.8

1900,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory.. My daughter, we will call her M, just turned 5. Her dad and I split a little over 3 years ago, but the last year and a half or so of our marriage we were really just roommates and he didn’t have much to do with M or me. Since then I have remarried and we have a 1yo son as well that M adores. After the split M’s dad moved into an apartment with roommates about 20 minutes from us. She was to spend every Wednesday and ever other weekend with him. This only lasted a month. Then he suddenly couldn’t have her on Wednesday’s anymore, then he couldn’t have her on Friday’s either. And then she ended up going to her paternal grandparents every other weekend and her dad would “visit” her there for a couple of hours Saturday and/or Sunday. (He would mostly be playing on his phone or watching TV while his mother took care of M. I know this from his sister) Then in April of last year M’s dad moved 8 hours away and rarely sees her anymore (he came to visit for Christmas and then her birthday in May and probably won’t be back until thanksgiving or Christmas). When he visits he stays with his parents and M stays there too so they can spend the most amount of time together possible. However he only gets to spend about 3 days here when he comes to visit and a VERY small portion of that is actually spend with M. He is more worried about hanging out with old friends etc. He originally said he was going to call her daily, but he calls once a month if she is lucky. 

Now to the dilemma. M’s dad wants to take her to Florida (9ish hours from us) for a week and take her to Disney world. He KNOWS that I love Disney and have been looking forward to taking her basically since I found out I was pregnant. 

I do not feel comfortable with her going as she barely knows him and he has shown on several occasions that he isn’t exactly fit to be a father (example: when he lived here with roommates M got sick one time while spending the night there and her dad WOKE UP his female roommate and asked her to give M a shower and clean her off because he wasn’t sure what to do. M also told me that when she woke up early in the mornings her dad would tell her to go get said female roommate instead and let him sleep). 

I would be perfectly okay with it if he wanted to come here and spend a week with her, just not them going so far away. Alone.

1902,Not the A-hole,"Here's the story. I'm no techy, but one of my  housemates purchased some fancy white box full of internet the other day. I asked him what it was all about, and he said it was for hosting video servers, it connects to the wifi. I asked him if that used up lots of bandwidth and he said ""hmnmnfhlfff"" or something along those lines, and scuttled off.

Flash forward to today. I arrive home after being out all day, and there's a big white noisy box attached to the router, which is unfortunately in my room.

This guy didn't ask at any stage if he could go into my room, and install anything. I'm not being responsible for some big white noisy box in my room not getting damaged, especially seeing as it's been put right by my door, and I'm already getting woken up most mornings by this guy getting up and leaving for work fairly early and doing his best to let everyone else know about it. On top of this, he hasn't mentioned to anybody else in the house that he has bought a box that will need internet to work.

Phase 1. Unplug the magic white box.


Phase 2. Put it back on the kitchen table where I last saw it.


Phase 3. Feign ignorance

1903,Asshole,"Hello, 

Not much background information for this, so I'll cut to the chase.

My brother's new girlfriend will be joining us for the first time for our monthly game night. No biggie, except she is afraid of my dog.  I have a pitbull who is the sweetest, biggest baby. I love my pup and consider him part of the family. No one has ever had a problem with him...until now. 

Game night is Friday night, my bro called me today to ask me to please keep Murphy in a room so he can't roam free because his girlfriend is afraid of big dogs, especially pits. I told him I needed to think about it, but also that I don't want to do it because it's 1) my house and 2) my dog lives here, not her. I think she should just suck it up and stop being ridiculous, the dog isn't vicious. 

Anyway, I'm worried that this is going to cause a rift in my relationship with my brother, but at the same time Murph is my baby and if you don't accept him, then you don't accept me. He thinks I am being dramatic because it's just for one night, but I think that if I set this precedence, she's just going to expect my dog to always be locked away, even on days that aren't game nights (I have parties at my house often, cookouts, things like that).

1905,Not the A-hole,"Please read my story before deciding if I’m the asshole and before calling me an incel in the comment section. I’ll try to be as detailed as possible and answer any questions you guys have about the situation. 

I live in Philly and was returning home after finishing classes at my university. I was waiting for a bus at Frankford Transportation Center at the end of a “line”. When the bus rolled up and, after some people upfront entered, some dude not affiliated with SEPTA (SEPTA is the transportation system in Philly) decided to hold the bus door and said that the women should go in first and that he’ll go in last. 

The people around were confused and was wondering what was going on. Essentially the guys just let the women go in the bus first. No one caused a fuss cause it was hot and no one really wanted to make a scene. While they were getting on, he was saying stuff about how the women make the world go around and was smiling with this smug, gleeful look. Then, when the line with all the guys was about to move, he ushered in some women who just got to the bus stop to come in. Once they got in, the rest of the people came in and the dude just left. He wasn’t even taking this bus yet he was waiting in line just to pull this stunt. 

It was a shitty situation to be in. It kinda felt like the situation when you pay for your groceries and the cashier asks if you would like to donate and when you say no then the cashier would make a loud exclamation about it and it makes you feel like an asshole. If any of the guys spoke up, I felt like they would have been berated with statements like “you don’t respect women.”

I felt a bit pissed off after this whole thing for a lot of reasons. For one, I’m a big believer in lines and that you’re an ass if you’re cutting in line unless there is a reason why you are doing it. Like a person paying extra cash to skip a line at a theme park or if they’re disabled/old. I’m also fine with people allowing others to go ahead if it’s not too many people. I understand being nice and allowing some people to get in ahead of you but when there was a line already formed and your making people from the back and people who came late go in before people who were in line and patiently waited because you wanted to be chivalrous then you’re a bit of an ass since you’re telling people that their time is not worth another person’s time. 

Also, there was the fact that the dude was not even getting on the bus. He literally pulled a stunt like that with a smug smile just to do it. I get doing nice gestures  just to be nice and not expecting something from it but there were other things he could of done and it was shitty of him to go to a random bus and pull a stunt like that.

I'll try to make this short but here we go. I dated my ex-boyfriend for about 7 years and his family loved to cook. I dated him in HS through college, so I was usually over at his house helping with dinner pretty often. I learned so much about cooking from his mom and basically learned all the family recipes and know them by heart. My ex-boyfriends parents came from India, so 90% of the recipes I know are basically Indian recipes that have been in his family for generations.

&#x200B;

Anyway, when college ended he took a job in California and things just fizzled out between us. Ended on good terms, no hard feelings and when I asked if I still had his moms blessing to cook her food he laughed and said of course.

Met my current boyfriend from work, we both were living in pretty shit apartments in the city with roommates, ordering food everyday, never really cooking. Finally I moved into a new place a month or so ago (1 bedroom, by myself) where the kitchen is beautiful and I finally can cook again. We've been dating for about 4 months.

&#x200B;

One day my boyfriend came over pretty late and asked what I ate for dinner. I said I made a chicken curry and he was so impressed. He asked why I decided to make that and if he could have some (he likes indian food, we've gotten Indian food take out on multiple occasions). I said my exboyfriends mom taught me how to make her recipes and this was one of them that I loved. He kind of just was like ""oh...wow"" and stood there, it was pretty obvious his demeanor changed. Kind of sad I guess? I asked if anything was wrong and he was like ""I don't really think you should be cooking your exboyfriends moms food"" I don't remember the exact words after that, but it was along the lines of me cooking his moms food is basically keeping the memory of my ex-boyfriend alive in my head. I didn't agree with him and said I enjoy this food and I know these recipes so I'm going to keep making them for myself and he doesn't have to eat them if he doesn't want to.

I just like Indian food and these happen to be my ex's moms recipes! And I want to keep cooking them because they're delicious and they make me feel happy.

1907,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this is a lot to take in... I did something I never thought I would today.

My friend is 18 year old gay male. We both just graduated high school. I am straight, but I’m sure some of you will say I am jealous anyway. I recently caught my friend being intimate with a 56 year old man. He didn’t know but I saw them in the mans house. I know this guy, he has a wife and 2 little kids (we love in a fairly small town) Now this isn’t an illegal relationship per say, but I definitely think it is an immoral one. My friend has struggled with depression and other stuff I don’t really understand but it makes him easy to manipulate (I know this because of the actions of some of our classmates). Needless to say I am worried about him. I attempted to talk to him about if he got any romantic interests and he denied it. Finally I got him to admit that he was seeing someone, but he wouldn’t tell me who. I didn’t need an answer cause he hangs around that guys neighbourhood everyday.

So this is the part where I really feel like I sacrificed my integrity. Long story short I anonymously contacted the man through a gay hook up app, and told him that I know who he is, and what he’s doing with my friend, and that if he didn’t stop seeing him immediately I would expose his profile to his wife. So, blackmail. I don’t think it’s illegal because I didn’t ask for money or anything of value but still pretty low none the less. Of course this guy is scum. I don’t regret what I did to him.

I regret not confronting my friend first. The next day he was visibly very upset, and wouldn’t tell me why. I also feel very bad for this mans lovely wife and kids. I am almost tempted to tell them anyway. It’s none of my business but it’s just feels so wrong to me. I hate people who cheat on those they are supposed to love.

My parents worked (and still do) full time and advised my older brother and I to do the same during summers in highschool. My brother and I would work full time in the summer and part time during the school year. My oldest sibling (my sister) was never told that she needed to get a job. 

Fast forward to now when my brother and I both worked enough to buy our own cars and are both in college.  Instead of my sister having to work for her car, my grandparents just gave her a car. They pay for all of her expenses, insurance, and gas while my brother and I have to pay for our own car expenses. And lately my sister has been acting extremely entitled. For instance, she's a senior in college and hasn't worked a single job during her entire college career. I suggested to her that it would be good to get a job her last semester to prepare for her career. She got extremely upset with me and hung up. Am I the asshole for getting upset with her?

So if he’s having a hamburger, I add condiment; if it’s chicken tenders, I have to remove the lid off each sauce one by one as needed. He says it’s common courtesy and also a safety consideration. I say we are each responsible for our own food, regardless of who is driving, and that I’m not his damn servant. Furthermore, this is how I’ve always done it and, as far as I can remember, how anyone I’ve ever ridden with has done it.

As many of you have probably perceived, entirely happy couples probably wouldn’t fight about something as trivial as this, and that would be a correct perception.

1911,Everyone Sucks," My car was damage, the cops came and it was recorded as ‘accidental damage’.
I was reassured that the company would pay for the damage, they took my details, and assured me they’d call me with details. 
This was day 1.

Day 8, I called them to find out what was happening because it had been so long and I hadn’t heard anything,
“Someone from management will call you tomorrow”, I’m told. 

Day 10. I go to visit the company because I still hadn’t heard a thing. Now this is where I should explain that I’m Scottish, stereotypically a naturally angry sounding prick. This is happening in another country. 
I was taken to the complaints handling assistant who kept showing me a post it on her desk saying “see, I haven’t forgotten about you”.
I asked her to call the manager... reluctantly she did, and he says that he has no idea about the incident, which really irritates me. So I explained what had happened, and he said that another company would pay for the damage because of the contract they have. 

Day 11 - 18
Company 1: the other guys are going to pay.
Company 2: nope, these other dudes are responsible
Etc...
Etc...
Etc...

Day 19, I track down the managers office, and ask him what’s happening,
“I don’t know what your talking about, I know nothing about any accident”.

So, I go home, print out 4 signs that read “this company damaged my car, admitted liability to the police, but now denying all knowledge to avoid paying the damage they promised to pay” I place these in the windows of my car, and park blocking the only entry/exit from the car park. 

I’m then arrested and interviewed by the same police that dealt with the initial incident, that were shocked to hear what I had to say, but said,
“Unfortunately we are investigating you for annoying the company, and we are now having to charge you for it, but we understand why you did what you did”.

Now I’ve still got damaged car, charged and have a 6 month restraining type order from the company.",42,38,0.82

Now I watched the original in cinemas too when I was around my son's age, and it was a magical experience. But here's the thing - I was a quiet kid, I never made a ruckus or anything. My son isn't an infant anymore, yet he is annoying as hell in the cinemas. I took him to watch Spider-Man and he wouldn't shut up throughout most of it, much to the dismay of others in the audience. I spoke to my son about it, but he did it again with another movie we watched.

His grandmother (63F, my mother) was at home and I told her to watch my son (she's done many times before, without issue) as I went out, I just decided on the spot to go watch the remake by myself. And I had a blast. 

When I came home my wife was livid and asking where I was, I showed her my receipts and she got angrier, asking how I could do this to my son, calling me asshole as he desperately wanted to watch the film. My son knows now and was crying. To be honest, I feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed....but at the same time, I sort of don't regret it because my first time watching the remake was quite a carefree experience which gave me fond memories of when I watched the original.

My uncle will not stop ranting to us about how much he hates modern society and how much better everything used to be. Literally, he will talk about it endlessly for hours if nobody stops him. 


Anyways, we had a family dinner for my sister who just announced she is pregnant, my nephews came by and a few cousins. My uncle literally would not stop talking about how much he hates modern culture and how much better everything used to be. It went on for hours, he would rant to anyone that listened. Then it just hit a nerve, where my son was on his cell phone and my uncle just sort of went on a rant to him about how he needs to throw the phone in the trash and live without one, because its turning him into a pansy. Not 'will turn him into a pansy', but 'it IS turning you into a pansy', implying he already is one. I could see my son was a bit hurt, and I told my uncle, please apologize, that was rude. He did apologize.


Later on, my two nephews, teens, were talking about video games. My uncle had been silent for a bit after I told him to apologize, but he just turned to them (at this point he was drunk) and told them that they were too old for video games, and at their age they should have jobs, and said video games are for lazy people and a sign that society is falling apart etc. He then said ""there has to be something in your generations genetics which just make you lazy and selfish""... WHO SAYS THAT TO SOMEONE?? I just snapped at him, I told him, go upstairs, you're causing a disruptance and making people feel uncomfortable. He asked me what I meant, and I just told him, either go upstairs or just leave and come back when you're not being disruptive, because we've sat here for 3 hours listening to you rant and berate people about this topic and its demeaning to the younger people here. He argued with me for a bit, then left. Not just left the dinner table, but left the entire house. He came back at like 2am, packed his stuff up, and left the house for good. Didn't even said goodbye. He drove all the way to Pittsburgh to stay with a friend of his for the remaining 3 weeks. Pittsburgh is 6 hours away from here.


My sister and my dad were both upset at me. They were also upset that I felt the need to argue with him at all, saying that I was rude for doing that and I shouldn't be starting arguments with family members over such petty things. My sister also said it was her dinner celebration, even if it was at my house, and she felt a bit disrespected that I kicked him out without her permission. She was sitting allllll the way at the other end of the table, she wouldn't have even been able to hear him ranting to everyone much.

1914,Not the A-hole,"I’m 19 year old girl living with three other roommates in a four bedroom dorm. All four of us are still on campus since we’re all taking summer classes. We’re all girls too, for context. 


Im a germaphobe. Always have been, always will. I carry hand sanitizer around with me every time I touch something in public, don’t share my food with people because of germs, things like that. All my roommates know that I’m germaphobic.


When you live with people you observe their habits. Two of my roommates take care of themselves hygienically. We have two bathrooms within the dorm and I notice that they take showers everyday, don’t leave big messes and their rooms are clean. The other roommate is the complete opposite. When you enter her room a smell of must and spoiled milk hits you (she always spills milk in her room). She doesn’t shower, in the year we’ve lived together I think I’ve only seen her shower a hand full of times. You could say that she probably showers when I’m not around, but since we’re assigned a bathroom together I know that she doesn’t have any soap or body wash and she doesn’t touch mine. The shower is never used, I can always tell because once I turn the water on it’s alwaus hot and even my other roommates notice she doesn’t shower as well. She also smells horrible. She doesn’t wear deodorant and wears the same black and grey leggings for WEEKS on end. 


I have a sensitive sense of smell and I struggle to even be around her. I always keep the conversations short and brief (also polite I’m not a bitch) because I can’t be around her for too long. My other roomates also agree that she smells but my sense of smell is more sensitive to theirs so they can tolerate it much longer than I can.


The problem is this: she always wants to share clothes/eat my food/use my makeup. I don’t mind when my other roommates do those things because 1) they bring everything back washed and folded or my makeup disinfected and 2) I know they’re not unhygienic. She recently started asking me if she could borrow my clothes and I said no. She asked why do I allow the other roommates too and not her and I told her verbatim: “No offense, but you don’t shower or change your clothes often and you smell. I won’t mind letting you share clothes if you did shower more often but I’m a germaphobe and I just can’t.” She got upset and called me a bitch and said she doesn’t smell even though a lot of people talk about it and acknowledge that she does.

My wife has always taken it upon herself to open anything addressed to me. I’ve asked her several times to not do this. She just doesn’t get it, and the other day I really lost my temper. I have not been well, and someone sent me a get well card. I was literally in the other room. And wife calls out, “Who is so an so?” I said, “Someone I work with, why?” Oh, she sent you card.

I went to the room she was in and just about lost it. WTF.  I get maybe if I was out of town or something... but I was ten feet away and she could have handed me the envelope!  Her response is, we are married and what’s the big deal and what do I have to hide, etc.

Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal. But I kind of feel bad because she was really crying about it, and my friend said I was a jerk for making fun of something that happened right after giving birth. So AITA? I'm just trying to have fun and joke around with her.

I didn't think much of it until he started begging us to get him a bunch of these (pretty expensive) make-up kits. He wants to start trying out the looks for himself and practice.

Although I want my kids to express themselves freely, I don't think it's appropriate for a pre-teen of either gender to wear these looks. Actually, I don't believe it's very healthy for him to look up to these stars so much and develop a warped image of what he should look like, when their looks are artificial.

The other dog was yelping in pain. I'm sure skin was broken.  In the course of 5-10 seconds I managed to break up the fight. Then this woman (who must have been playing with her dog off leash at the park) appeared out of no where screaming about my vicious animal and how I was going to pay the ensuing vet bills.  I told Karen that her dog shouldn't be off leash. Our city has laws that state all dogs need to be on a leash no longer than 6 feet unless at a dog park.

1923,Not the A-hole,"Hello AITA,   
I am a bit conflicted about the way this situation worked out.  


Time: Afternoon on a weekday

&#x200B;

I am in the office working at home and the door bell rings. My girlfriend opened the door and was greeted by two vacuum sales men. Both men were in their early 20s with was wearing business casual appearance.   


From my girlfriend's story, they shook my girlfriend's hand, handed her a business card, and introduced his partner at the door. After that 10 second exchange, the salesman that shook my girlfriend's hand is already \~6 ft inside the door.  


I looked down the hallway and noticed there is a stranger in the house and this was never the protocol, as she would tell me her friends arrived or called me to introduce her friends. I took my firearm from my desk drawer and tucked it into my rear pants waistband, and proceeded to introduce myself to the salesman. At this point my girlfriend is confused how the salesman already entered my home and clearly she is not interested in a vacuum. 

I politely asked the gentlemen to leave two times and clearly stated that we are not interested in purchasing a vacuum. The second salesman walked into the home now with a vacuum in his hand while me and my girlfriend was distracted asking the first salesman (shook my girlfriend's hand) to leave. The second salesman says into the effect of ""You will be impressed by our vacuum, please give us a chance to demonstrate the device""

I decided as this point to pull out my firearm, but point the barrel at the ground. I told the gentlemen firmly to leave the property as you are trespassing into my home.

Salesman: YOU GOING TO PULL A GUN ON US?

ME: YES, YOU ARE TRESPASSING IN MY HOME AND APPROACHING ME IN AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER! YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW!

The salesman promptly left right after. I talked to my girlfriend and asked why she froze still. I let her know she should never let anyone take advantage of her frail situation and always take control if things don't feel right.  


I called the number on the business card that was handed to my girlfriend. I told the company, if they ever send a salesman to my house again, I will have them arrested immediately. The dispatcher yelled at me for pulling a gun at their salesman and I will be reported to the police. I told her, they trespassed into my home, approached me aggressively, They are lucky I didn't put a hole in their leg.

I'm always using protection, doing regular HIV tests and not promiscuous.

WIBTA if I lied about being straight and still donated my blood or plasma?

EDIT: I didn't expect this many responses this quickly, thanks. Some background info:
- I'm in a committed monogamous relationship... Studies show there's no higher HIV risk when sexual behavior is accounted for
- we have a big blood (and especially plasma) demand, not enough donors
- 2h away, across the border, I could donate blood in another country. It just seems ridiculous to go through that, especially knowing my country has higher need
- given how corrupt the government is and raging homophobic values displayed by continually elected party, I don't see a way of changing this policy in next 10+ years
- ridiculously enough, there's no ban on bone marrow transplants. I'm listed in that registry

I'm not set on doing this, just something I've been thinking about.



EDIT #2: I didn't expect this to get so much attention, so few things...

Please, please consider donating blood. There's a huge number of ways that your blood can be used to save somebody's life. On top of that, you'll get free a health test, your blood will be screened for diseases and maybe you'll even get a free meal depending on where you're from. There's multiple studies which show positive psychological effect on donors. It only takes about 10 minutes (or up to 2h for apheresis) and process is completely safe and painless. You can even repeat it every 8 weeks for more karma points :)

Second, be mindful of STDs. HIV is not a gay disease, you should definitely protect yourself in different-sex encounters. Also, please don't stigmatize STDs. Taking regular tests and having adult conversations with your potential partners about testing shouldn't be limited to bi/gay population.

I've decided against donating blood in my country. I'll respond if called for bone marrow donation and donate blood in neighbouring EU country where I can legally do so. Main reason is possible fallout that could happen if it's discovered I lied (recalls, additional testing for recipients, legal issues and other problems I'm probably not even aware of).",323,505,0.91

My first delivery with our now two year old daughter was a disaster.  I hemorrhaged and became anemic, our daughter needed to be resuscitated, she became jaundiced due to underfeeding and I developed a hefty postpartum infection that had me laid up for an extended period.  Both of our families live about 6 hours north of us.  My mom came down immediately following the birth and helped me recover in very personal ways: helped me shower, dress, even wipe after going to the bathroom.  I was essentially incapacitated for almost a month.  There's no guarantees that this one will be as bad as that, but I have to be prepared for the worst.

My in-laws are extremely hard to get along with.  MIL in particular has an ""I'm always right"" attitude and disregards our parenting wishes on the regular.  They're highly argumentative about everything.  On top of this, they're extremely unhealthy individuals.  FIL can barely manage to get up the 4 porch steps to our front door, let alone the 18 stairs down to our finished basement where the baby will be spending most of her time for now.  This means that we would be forced to spend time upstairs, which is not set up for infant care.  MIL isn't in much better shape.  When they're here, we're expected to wait on them because they cannot walk more than 40 feet without needing a break.  

My mom is coming down for two weeks again this time.  We've told them that they can visit immediately after she leaves, but not before.  MIL has disregarded our instructions and wants to be here for the delivery, so she's booked a hotel.  They want to be here ""in case we need help,"" which they are physically incapable of rendering.  Also, we already have help.  I'll probably still be miserable in two weeks, but at least I'll be able to pee unassisted.

I have zero desire to take care of these two adults immediately after pushing something the size of a cantaloupe out of my vagina.  I'll still be  passing golfball sized clots and whipping my boobs out to pump every 2 hours around the clock.  I don't think that requesting a two week delay is at all unreasonable, but my husband seems reluctant to put his foot down.  I, on the other hand, have already put my foot down with my dad and stepmom by telling them the same thing and having them cancel their own reservations.

AITA for demanding my husband stand up to his parents?

However, she has expressed several times that she hated the procedure, and has even said she whishes she had never gotten it, even though that may have killed her.

But when I voice my concern about her transmitting the virus to me when she kisses my cheek, forehead,etc. she gets pretty offended.  I've told her my concern many times and tried to assure her that it isn't anything personally against her.  I already get dry, flaky skin spots on my face that I battle with and I'd rather not have to deal with cold sores as well. But whenever I say these things or flinch away when she tries to kiss my face she gets pretty upset and says things like ""You are making me feel like shit"", or ""You probably already have the virus"", or my personal favorite, ""The virus can only be transmitted through kissing lips"". To be honest it is really starting to irritate me but I've found myself being less resistive in order to avoid another blow up where she ignores me for the next 30 minutes.  I really feel like I am not overreacting, even if there is a good chance I do have the virus but have just never shown the symptoms.  So AITA?",78,49,0.88
1931,No A-holes here,"So my son (9yr old) just started summer camp. They sent us a form to opt out of picture taking and social media posting. Of course I signed it. I signed one of these at his school. I sign one anywhere I put him in care of other adults if they have the mechanism in place to opt out. The reason is simple: I believe it's my job to protect his online identity until he's able to make his own informed choices. I don't even post pictures of him on my own FB page. 

Besides, their form says that they use pictures of kids in camp to advertise the camp and increase enrollment. Screw that. I'm not allowing my kid to become someone else's ad. Go hire some professional kid models. 

So the summer camp is now *surprised* that anyone would sign this form at all, apparently. They're saying that by opting out it's making it so they can't include him in group photos. He's feeling left out. The camp feels bad about it. Kid feels bad about it. I'm surprised that they want to be so freely posting pictures of other people's kids on a public page and they have absolutely no idea how to gracefully handle this. 

But NOW that I'm firm on this despite their protests, they've changed the story and are saying that they would only post pictures to a private FB group of just camp parents. And I'm like ""why do you have to post pictures of other people's kids at all? Can he just go to camp and not have his experience recorded and broadcast and saved forever and ever on a server somewhere?""

They’ve stopped posting pictures at all to the parent’s group because they literally have no idea how to handle this photo situation without him feeling excluded. Other parents in the group are asking where all the picture updates are. They’re getting cranky about it. WTF, people. 

I feel like the unreasonable asshole here. But I can't help but think there's so many reasons to protect a child's identity online. So, AITA?

EDIT: The form was a social media picture form. Sorry for any confusion. I opted out of posting photos online. I did not specify they couldn’t take his picture. Only that they can’t post it. Not taking anyone’s picture is how they’ve chosen to comply. Seems overkill to me. 

I tried to clarify this in comments but I get it. I shouldn’t respond at all. Carry on.

EDIT 2: Seems a lot of people think we should have more pics of minors on Facebook. I wonder how many those same people also roll their eyes and scroll past posts about their friends’ kids.",486,809,0.93

1935,Asshole,"Throwaway because reasons. Also going to change some details. 

This weekend I was at an event and my(23f) boyfriend(23m) and I got to talking to a friend’s dad. This friend’s dad recently adopted an indigenous little girl, while they are not indigenous. He was asking me for insight on how to include her culture in raising her, etc. We live in Canada, where indigenous people have not always been treated respectfully. 

We got to talking about identity because he wants her to have a connection to her heritage. We talked about land acknowledgements, truth and reconciliation. So I said “first and foremost, I identify as (insert indigenous group), because it’s a big ‘fuck you’”

Now, it wasn’t meant to be a “fuck you” to anyone in particular, just in general- the history. In the past, indigenous people were forced to assimilate and lost the culture. And I feel that by taking pride in my heritage, I’m “sticking it to the man,” for lack of better wording. 

Yesterday, my boyfriend said it was a very uncomfortable situation because he couldn’t understand what I meant. I’m also of European descent and so he thought it was strange that I identify as indigenous first. He thought it was insulting to my mother, who isn’t indigenous. 

I tried explaining that growing up without my biological father and in a mostly white neighbourhood, I was often ridiculed and bullied for being indigenous- I was called a squaw, dirty Indian, dirty. I was embarrassed for a long time of who I was. But by now taking pride in who I am, that’s the big “fuck you,” because I won’t allow my heritage to be erased. 

I’ve been with him for four years, and he was suddenly thinking that I hate the government, that I think I’m “owed.” He feels that I shouldn’t hang onto the negative past, and that it’s not healthy. I’ve never been that type of person and I work hard for what I want. Hell, I work in a government position. 

I’m not stuck in the past- I’m merely proud of who I am despite history’s role in trying to erase indigenous cultures. 

The first part of truth and reconciliation is truth- it’s not allowing the past to be forgotten. 

He’s still having trouble understanding why I would say it the way I did, but I see nothing wrong (except for maybe the cursing).

1936,Asshole,"Years ago I heard crying while I was on my way home from work so I followed it and found a very young boy in the trash. He was crying because his parents told him to hide there and left him, and after a bit of waiting it became pretty obvious they weren't coming back.

I called the cops and they reported everything to the CPS equivalent of my country, which took him into custody and placed him in an orphanage. I went back to visit him almost daily, and after a few weeks the people at the orphanage asked if I wanted to foster and possibly adopt him, and I was surprised by my own lack of hesitance. After jumping through all the bureaucratic hoops the government laid out for single parents, I found myself with a son.

It's been a few years since then. My son is now 13 and I am 43. I never married but I never had any plans to. My parents used to pester me to find someone to spend my life with, but after I fostered and adopted my son they realized they wouldn't have any hopes of changing my mind.

Anyway, at a family gathering my nephew asked where babies came from, and not wanting to have The Talk with him without my brother I told him about how I found my son in the garbage. Later, my brother called me an asshole because now my nephew thinks babies are born from the trash. His wife also thinks it was insensitive to refer to my son that way. I asked my son and he admitted he did not really like being the moral of ""one man's trash is another man's treasure"" stories.

1937,Asshole,"Weekday night, my GF and I are home from work. I don't wanna cook and she can't so we decide to eat out. She doesn't know where to go so I say let's go for sushi. She's not 'hungry enough' (whatever that means) for sushi, so I recommend a Pho (Vietnamese white rice noodles in beef broth) place, she shoots it down, I say Pizza, she says too much of a mess.

At this point I say pick a number, 1 to 3 (corresponding to one of the above choices), and she says, ""**Why do I always have to pick the place?**""

I'm so fed up with these games that I just get up and say, ""I feel like having Pho tonight. You're welcome to join me. I'll be in the car for 5 minutes, then I'm gone,""

I actually wait 5 mins in the car and she doesn't come out, so I text her that I'm going, wait a minute, no response, I leave. She blows up my phone in the middle my drive there and says she can't believe I just left her behind. She wants me (she asked, didn't demand) to go back and pick her up and I just ignore her because I'm done playing games - I'm hungry, I want food (this is the potential asshole moment, because I could've gone back - it would've been maybe 10 mins to go back and then back to the spot where I got her texts). FYI, I don't text and drive. I assumed nobody else would be blowing up my phone at this time of night so I pulled over and read them but didn't respond to her.

She tried calling me after I ignored her barrage of texts, and since I was waiting for the food to arrive, I answered. She exploded at me for being so selfish, that I never considered what she wanted (which was what?). She asked for take-out and I was so pissed she was treating me like her chauffeur and deliveryman so I said, ""No, you had your chance"" and hung up on her (2nd potential asshole moment here).

When I got home, she was curled up on the couch crying into a pillow. I asked her if she's hungry now (3rd potential asshole moment because I was definitely teasing her) and she just nodded so I took some soup broth, boiled a bit of vermicelli, threw in some meat balls and put it on the table. She sat down and started eating with her back deliberately to me so I moved her bowl away and said, ""What do you say when someone cooks for you?"" (4th asshole moment)

She says ""sorry"", I say ""that's not what I was looking for"" (5th moment), she says ""thanks"" and I leave her alone to eat.

Sometimes I feel like her dad. (6th asshole moment?)

1938,Not the A-hole,"So first thing's first, I love animals, dogs included. Problem is, I'm allergic to furry/hairy animals. Now I work two retail jobs, one of which outright states that only service animals are permitted, but that rule never actually gets enforced. I also have multiple co-workers who are also allergic to dogs and are all a tad annoyed when they're forced to interact with people who bring them into the store.

I've literally had a customer carry her dog around the store with her, then at one point for no reason, set the dog down specifically on the carpeted part of the floor and then play with it by having it chase her around a pillar. I remember one guy with a huge dog that had its mouth open the entire time and got tiny droplets of drool everywhere. It only became a problem (for other people, not myself) when he finally got to checkout and took so long that those little droplets eventually made a decent sized puddle that he didn't even bother to clean. I've had people set their dogs on the register counter, and in one case the customer just let her dog lick EVERYTHING on the counter. Including things I had to touch. Now obviously those are just a few bad experiences I've had, I've also seen completely well behaved dogs that keep to themselves. But that doesn't stop me from being allergic to them regardless.

The reason I ask AITA is because I was discussing this with my friend and she called me a hypocrite. Her logic is that I go over to her house a lot despite knowing she has cats which I'm also allergic to, but I'll complain about being around dogs. She says it's especially bad since I also pet them when I'm over there and now she's starting to doubt I have allergies at all.

My logic though is, when I'm going over her house, I already know she has pets ahead of time and accordingly take allergy medicine before I go there and after I leave. As well as a shower just in case. When I'm working, I can't predict when someone is going to bring in their pet, and popping some allergy meds every few hours just in case someone does is highly impractical. Plus my friend has a thing for cleanliness and regularly cleans her house, plus her cats aren't usually around me while I'm over and I only interact with them when they come near me. The cleaning team at my job barely do any cleaning, so pet dander in the carpet is likely going to stay there. 

I explained this to my friend, but she says I'm just making excuses because I want to complain about something. So, AITA?",23,35,0.92
1939,Not the A-hole,"My father and I do not have a good relationship, whatsoever. He treated me horribly growing up, lots of verbal and emotional abuse. He also hated my mother and because I was a lot like her, he resented the hell out of me. Once I moved out, things were a smidge better because we weren’t under one roof and had space, but we were never close, he never accepted me for being a lesbian and he grew into a bitter old man that I rarely ever see.

Now, he’s come down with Alzheimer’s Disease. We knew this day would come, it runs in the family and when I was growing up, he never had the best short-term memory to begin with. My mom is already in her own assisted living facility (by her own choice) that my brother pays for (my parents are technically separated, but not divorced). It’s a great place, she’s not abused or neglected, I visit her often and she gets to go on trips, she’s still functional enough that she got to keep her car, etc. My dad would need more care.

He’s still with it enough that he can make requests but it’s getting worse by the day and he can’t live alone. My wife and I work full time jobs, as does my brother and his wife. We also don’t want him around our kids full time. My dad has always said that he wants us to hire a nurse and honestly, we can’t afford that. The only way to do so would be to sell his house and then he’d have to move in with one of us, which isn’t what either of us wants given how he treated us growing up.

Our plan, is to sell the house and to split the cost of a place where our mom is (separate spaces obviously since they’re not together), since we know they’ll take good care of him. My dad is against it, but we feel we have no other choice. He’s okay with selling his house, but only if he doesn’t have to move into a retirement home. The thing is, he already signed off on my brother making choices for him when he no longer can. So ultimately, it’s up to us. My dad says we’re assholes for doing this. A part of me does feel guilty, on the other hand…I don’t know. He was a piece of shit dad and I just don’t want him around. It’s not like I’m sticking him in the first crap hole I can find.

As I’m loading the washer, a women who I have seen around tapped me on the shoulder.  First she asked if I was married, to switch I replied no.  Then she told me how it really wasn’t okay for me to go around the building with just a T-shirt on and I should cover up more.  I admittedly, my boobs are on the large size, especially for my frame.    At first I didn’t really know what to say so I kinda just looked at her for minute but eventually told her that if someone was uncomfortable with my body, that’s their problem not mine.

1943,Not the A-hole,"Quick background; my MIL was born in Poland, moved to the US in the mid 80s with her husband, my FIL. She’s a very kind, generous, good woman. She is devoutly religious as most Polish women her age. While she can get preachy about it to me, it’s not a big deal and I know it’s only because she cares about my soul.

I was not raised religiously, at all. My dads an atheist. My moms a “I’m more spiritual than religious” hippie-type. I strongly believe in freedom of religion. Personally, if there is a god I believe he wouldn’t care so much about Church and would just want you to not be a dick to your fellow man.

That being said. I recently welcomed two flea bitten, raggedy puppies that I adore into my home with my SO. I named the girl Mary, the church not even crossing my mind. My MIL cried when she found out and begged me to change it and accused me of being deliberately disrespectful, which kind of irritated me. I don’t find it disrespectful at all. I genuinely love that name. Mary has just begun responding to it. I’d hate to change it but since I do love my MIL dearly I am open to the idea, however I still find it kind of childish and ridiculous.

Co-worker has also had many recent conversations with HR about performance and attendance; it’s obvious HR is looking for a reason to let her go without exposing themselves to liability (I won’t go into details, but firing her could look like retaliation for something she recently did). 

Wife and co-worker work together in close proximity, and it’s just the two of them plus their manager in an office setting. The two of them used to be friends, but something has transpired recently that I’m not aware of (my wife says she doesn’t know why) that has caused the co-worker to remove my wife (and their manager from social media, but she forgot to remove me. Over the past few weeks she has started posting increasingly hostile and violent things on Facebook that seem directed at my wife. A few recent screen shots I took say the following:

* “There’s always that one co-worker who gets away with stuff you’d be fired for 🙄”

* “Bitches don’t intimidate me. I sit right next to one all day at work.”

And the one that has me shaking mad and considering reporting her...

* “I will NOT kill a co-worker today. I will NOT kill a co-worker today... okay maybe just one.”

1945,No A-holes here,"My ex and I had been together for about 4 years, it ended 7 months ago. We ended on not the greatest of terms. I still talk to her periodically, but I've actively tried to respect her space and give her time to heal. I still have strong feelings for her. I know that I still love her, and I feel like that's part of the reason that makes everything about the situation difficult. We were very close, I was at the point where I wanted to propose to her. I think my mom really saw her as a daughter, and they built their own relationship outside of ours, which I think made both of them very happy.

Recently my grandma passed away, my mom was the oldest daughter and I think it affected her the most out of the people in my family. During her time of grieving she reached out to my ex over social media to connect and see how she was doing. She replied and they started talking. Eventually they decided they wanted to get together for lunch to catch up.

My mom reached out to me to ask if this was okay. Initially I thought it was weird but I also didn't know anyway to tell her no at the time, so I said it was fine. My thinking was she was doing her best to surround herself with friends and family, which made sense. After I thought about it more however, I became a lot more uncomfortable with the whole idea of it.

I would give anything to have some time with my ex in person, just spend the day talking and enjoying each others company. I think I'm jealous that my mom has the opportunity to do that now even though I ruined any chance I had at that. I want whats best for both of them, especially for my mom at this time, I think she'd feel a lot better if they had the chance to meet and talk.

Part of me is upset and thinks my mom is overlooking how I feel in this situation. Even though she asked if it was okay with me first, I feel like I was put in a position where I really couldn't say no, or voice how I was feeling. That may just be my fault though.

I've been reading posts on here for a long time now and I've been thinking about what I've learned from this sub. Most of the time, I refrain from commenting my judgements on potential assholes' posts. Instead, I like to read the posts, form a private opinion that I don't comment, and then look at the comments to see what others think. 

I do it in that specific order (especially when the post isn't flaired yet) because I like to test myself. I want to see if my opinion on a controversial post matches that of the top comment. It's not that I want to see if my opinion is ""right"" or ""wrong,"" because most posts are open to interpretation. Rather, I like seeing when my opinion differs, because I want to understand where the top commenter's opinion is coming from. Sometimes I'm unable to understand why the majority thinks an OP is or isn't an asshole, but most of the time, I'm able to learn something or see the post in a different way.

This sub has done a great deal to help me piece together some of the more subtle aspects of my morals. It's actually helped me improve on considering the effects of my actions on others.

1949,Not the A-hole,"I know this should sound like a no brainer here but I do not want to go for multiple reasons.

First, I am a large human. I'm 6'6"" and a little over 300lbs.  But the problem is that at this particular park, most of the rides have height and weight restrictions.  Of the 85 rides at this park, I can ride 5 of them: the ferris wheel, carousel, bumper cars, pirate ship, and wooden coaster.  I think it's a waste of money to pay full admission for those rides, especially since none of them are unique or exclusive to the park.

Next, the park is about an hour from where we live. My fianceé is off on Fridays which is when they want to go but I work till 5pm. I would then have to drive down there right after work. So assuming no traffic (but there will be. Friday night rush hour) I'd get there for 6pm, and park closes at 10pm. 

I know that I'd end up being their caddie. Again since I cannot go on most of the rides but they all can, someone will need to hold their purses, wallets, and phones as they wait in line and go on rides. This is a lot of money to spend for the privilege of sitting on a bench 95% of the time.

My fianceé is going to spend more time with her friends than me. It's inevitable. Especially, since her and I live together. I get she doesn't get to see them as often as me in person. But aside from catching up and reminiscing, she will be waiting in line or going on rides that I cannot go on, while I wait for them to be done.

Edit: I forgot to mention two other parts.

So there is a little pressure for me to go but it's not a deal breaker if I don't. 

My fianceé and her 3 friends from college are the girls going. 1 of her friends married her highschool sweetheart. The other two girls have extremely high standards and are snooty.  In short, they are in no position to be as picky as they are. Even at 25 neither has had a boyfriend and remain virgins. Now, the only reason I mention this, is that these two friends still enjoy invoking a ""no boys allowed"" rule on their get togethers, so they don't feel like third wheels or get jealous. It's beyond petty IMO. 

Anyways, my fianceé and the friend that is married are sick of this. So they decided to bring us both unannounced to stick it to them. I  appreciate a good dick waving contest.  However, when I told my fianceé why I was on the fence about going, her friend's husband said he wasn't going unless I did because he didn't want to be the only guy there.

The other thing, is that I used to work security at this amusement park in the summer. It was a fun job. But it ruined this park for me. After a week, it lost its magic.  I didn't care I was going. It wasn't for fun. I know the park like the back of my hand. So going here is not special or memorizing to me.",18,28,0.89
1950,Not the A-hole,"One thing that annoys me is that my boyfriend tends to call multiple times in a row when I don't answer for whatever reason.

I ended up snapping at him to respect the fact that if I don't answer the phone right away, it means I'm busy and calling several times just conveys a false sense of urgency that I need to stop what I'm doing and answer his phone call.

1952,Not the A-hole,"So recently, my (25F) little brother (19M) came to visit me. Marijuana is legal where I live. My brother isn't a big smoker or drinker but one night, we went out and we both took an edible. Everything was fine. (I told him edibles can hit you harder, but we didn't get hardcore into it). A day or two later, my brother asks me for another edible. They can be kind of expensive so I told him if he gave me money, I'd buy some for him (he also wanted to take some back home with him, so that's why I said I'd just buy him some). I made sure he understood what he was doing by bringing edibles back home. I told him that ""I gave him nothing"" and made him promise not to tell anyone where he got them. He went home several days later. 

Last night, as I'm finishing up work, I get a text from my mom, telling me my bro was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. His heart was beating really fast. That could mean nothing or something very serious. After trying not to freak out and reaching out to ppl, I finally found out what happened. He got too high on the edibles. After texting him, telling him I was glad he was ok, I asked him how many he took. I also told him not to tell anyone where he got the chocolate from. 

Now, in our family group chat, everyone is freaking out about how marijuana is the worst thing ever. How it can destroy you. I know my mom hates drugs in general (one or two of her family members had drug addictions), but I thought she hated heroin and cocaine and the like. She starts going on about how she HATES whoever gave my brother the edibles. How she wishes she could murder whoever tried to destroy her son. *gulp* And how she's a ""mama bear who protects her cubs"". 🙄

I wish he would've just called me, telling me what was going on. I could've walked him through it.

TL,DR. Little bro asked for edibles to take home with him. He overdid it and went to the hospital. Now, all my family is pissed.

EDIT: this drama happened last night. I guess I made this post too soon. My little brother finally got back to me. The edibles he took were not the ones I bought for him. Plus, he was using a dab pen too. Both of those from his friends. I feel a weight off my shoulders.

1954,Not the A-hole,"  

My mom married my stepdad when I was very young, so he’s been the only father I’ve ever known. Over the years as I was growing, Ioften thought of how nice it will be to be able to have stepdad walk me down the aisle – it’s such a tradition of fatherhood, and I want to show him he will always be my dad, even though we aren’t blood related.

Mom and stepdad were married for almost 20 years, most of them rough. They divorced almost ten years ago, and while my stepdad is happily remarried, my mother is still single (and not happy about it). 

My mom and I are very close, but we’ve had a pretty rocky relationship over the years. She’s very generously offered to help pay for the wedding, and she recently asked me if I would consider letting her walk me down the aisle along with my stepdad. I told her I would consider it, which I am doing, but I’m feeling conflicted – mostly because she feels very competitive with my stepdad, and I’m concerned that this is a factor here.

Now that she has asked the question, I feel obligated to say yes, even though I don’t feel totally comfortable with it.

1955,Not the A-hole,"I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

I'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

Their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.

I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.

**EDIT**

Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""Because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",5008,14987,0.88
1956,Not the A-hole,"This is a weird one. And I honestly want to hear a second opinion. I (20f) met a girl (22) online. My relationships life is a total disaster and I just really wanted someone near. She was really nice (and really pretty). We were texting a lot every day for about a week and a half. We met once and had a really nice evening with drinks. I don’t like to take things too fast so it was more “let’s meet each other” than a date.
After we continued texting. I didn’t have hopes too high, but I liked her and it was all going good. So, I offered to go on a date on Thursday to a horror movie. She agreed and seemed exited.
Today(just now) we were texting again and I asked if she lived alone (cause we were talking about a mess her pets made) and she casually mentioned a guy she lives with. 
I was really surprised and asked if the guy was a bf. And she just answered that yes, they are together for 4 years already but they have an “open relationship in terms of girls” and she’s sure she told me that. Well... no she didn’t. Cause I’m on my side pretty sure I wound notice something like this being said. 
I am not generally opposed to open relationships. And the time spent with this girl was really nice. But as I said I’m pretty lonely and I honestly don’t want to be a side girl to sleep with. 
Maybe it’s just my pride or attention seeking, but I was shocked by the bf news. And it hurt me  quite a bit, so don’t want to see her or talk to her rn. So will I be the asshole if I cancel the date on Thursday and stop talking to her (even as friends)?

I've tried different allergy and cold meds to various flavors of the result ""doesn't do shit for me"" so I tend to just suck it up (sometimes,  like in this case, literally) and tough it out. At work, I go through a few boxes of tissues a week when it gets especially bad, and I'll need to blow my nose often enough that doing so in the restroom is just simply not an option. I'm sure my coworkers fucking love it.

&#x200B;

My commute involves a half-hour bus ride. I try to proactively annoy as few people as possible by stuffing tissues in my backpack before the commute, but sometimes I don't have anymore at home, or the amount I packed is insufficient, or I just simply forget. I also sit in the back by the wheels, where it's noisiest and the most out-of-the-way, but there's only so much I can do. I'm sure the other regulars on my bus fucking love it.

This morning, I didn't have any tissues and I forgot to grab some toilet paper to substitute for it on my way out, so I'm sniffing pretty constantly. On one of the stops halfway through, somebody I don't recognize sits near me. I don't pay any attention to him, I just go back to playing on my Switch, sniffing and wishing Luigi would stop condescending me every second death. A couple stops later, he gets up in a huff and moves seats. He takes a few steps past me, then turns back towards me and loudly and annoyingly yells at me (because we're in the noisy back, near the wheels), over some other, full seats: ""If you have allergies, then blow your nose.""

1958,Not the A-hole,"So, my girlfriend of 3.5 years and I recently moved in together. Things have been great so far, we split work loads equally taking turns cooking and cleaning. Although, I admit she is cooking more than me but I try to offset that by doing more around the house. We are both recent university graduates and for a long time I didn't really have enough money to buy myself new clothes, I now have a job that pays decently well and in turn I like to wear nice clothes to work. It isn't a suit and tie situation, but I like to wear nice polos and collared shirts etc. I like to hang my shirts to dry to avoid them shrinking and I feel like they just last longer when they are hung to dry. I am also on the husky side. Not huge but I carry some extra weight around the midsection. This makes finding clothes a nightmare, finding a shirt that fits nicely and doesn't make me look bigger than I am while still being comfortable is tough so when I do find one I like I tend to load up. I have explained why I like to hang dry shirts to my SO multiple times now and she seems to just completely ignore me. Il come home when she does laundry and all of my shirts will be in the dryer repeatedly. It's not like she must hang every shirt I own, just my dress polos and dress shirts that aren't your typical graphic T. It's been making me mad but luckily up until now it hasn't rendered any shirts un-wearable. It just seems like a lack of respect for things that I clearly have spent some money on and talked nicely with her and explained the situation. I even offered to do the laundry for our household, but she said no. Now last week one of my favorite stores had a big sale I got two nice basic tees and two nice dress polo shirts this time I was specific. I said “these cannot go in the dryer, I read online that they tend to shrink a bit and they fit me perfectly. I even made it into a funny joke like repeat after me, I will not dry BF's new work shirts etc. I wore them all to work last week and then went away to visit family for an extended weekend. I noticed when I got home that she did laundry and when I get up this morning I'm looking for one of these shirts, not in the closet so I go to the dryer and literally all the shirts are sitting in the dryer right on top. I try all three on. Nope all four have shrunk to the point that they are to tight and I can't wear them. 4 shirts that I have literally owned for less than a week, ruined. I lost it this is the 5th time I have asked her nicely to hang dry shirts and have been ignored and now $130 in clothes that I wore once is too small. She says sorry but that it's so weird that I hang dry my shirts and that she doesn't think it's fair. I feel like it's common to hang dry certain clothing. She feels sorry, but I am still out $130, and she has made no effort to rectify the situation. Am I the asshole here!?

So long story short is that an old gradeschool/highschool buddy is getting married. I flew in early to the wedding city (he has since moved from where we grew up).  While here early I have hung out with him and his family a few times in the week leading up to the wedding, one time I was at a family dinner/party with his extended family and I  somewhat hit it off (liked the same sports, similar snarky comments, etc) with one of my friends family friends. I also assumed since she was drinking she was atleast 21, but learned later that night she is actually 18 (note I am 25...). My friends fiance really wants me to try and date one of her friends, but it feels so forced while I just naturally got along the other girl way more. I feel like the age gap of 18 - 25 is big enough that I have questions about it without the added pressure that this is possibly frustrating the bride. Should I just ask my friend if he cares that I flirt with his family friend at his wedding? or WIBTA no matter what here?

1960,Everyone Sucks,"Long story short, my mom cheated on my dad with her current husband 19 years ago. I just found out this weekend that she's cheating on my stepfather for a new guy (we will call him #3). Now #3 is divorcing his wife for my mom while my mom wants to divorce my stepfather.

I'm okay with her leaving my stepfather as he mentally and physically abused me since I was 9 (I'm now 27), but I don't agree with her cheating on him.

After my mom told me about #3, she also told me he's a millionaire. I've already been told that #3 is going to take us (me, mom and sister) on several international trips (Singapore, Japan, Bora Bora), all expenses paid.

But the only thing I am supposed to do is keep their cheating a secret until her divorce is finalized with my step dad.

AITA for keeping my mom's cheating a secret in exchange for monetary gains?

Extra Info:

I am not condoning her cheating in anyway. There was no way I could have done anything about her breaking things off with my father when I was 9. And I even told her she was going to get Karma coming her way for cheating on my stepdad. But I also hate my stepfather for everything he did to me as a child. I'm not lying to anyone about anything. If someone asks me if I knew about it or anything, I will tell the truth. But I will not put myself in the middle of a spat between someone I hate and the woman who gave birth to me. I'm going to stay away from the situation completely until it's over. And if I get to go on a trip eventually, well, whatever.

Edit #2: I think I need to clarify who I'm not telling about the cheating. My mom specifically told me not to tell my sister and obviously her current husband. I would never tell #2 Jack shit as it is anyway because 

1) the abuse

2) My stepfather decided to stop working 12 years ago because he wanted to try to do the storage unit auctions where you buy the storage unit hoping to make a bunch of money off of it. 

3) he turned into a hoarder, 

4) stays at home 24/7

5) never cooks, never cleans and demands my mother do everything because ""she's the woman.""

1961,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so here’s the story.

 
When my old car broke down, my grandma gave me hers. It’s a 2014 Honda Accord, and the thing has basically just been sitting in her garage for the past 5 years. It’s in mint condition, and has crazy low mileage.

 
Now, my coworker, “Louis”, has always kind of given me the creeps. He’s in his late 40’s, but goes around hitting on all the girls in the office that are in their 20’s. He just has this totally fake vibe about him, and I’ve just tried to stay as far away from him as I can.
 
When I rolled up in my new car, he absolutely lost him mind. He starts asking me all the specs, details, other car stuff. Then he asks me if he can take it for a test drive. I tell him absolutely not. Honestly, who even asks that?
 

Later, I come out and he is inspecting my car, running his hands all over it. I asked him wtf he was doing, and he said he was just making sure I got a good buy. He then asks if I can let him inside so that he can see the interior. I said, and I quote “Louis, No. Don’t touch my car, don’t look at my car, you’re never going inside of it.”
 

Now, if it couldn’t get any worse, he brought a bag of candies to work. He was trying to give some to me. I said no. When I got out to my car, he had taken them out of the packaging and laid them out all over the hood of my freaking car. Since it was hot, they got sticky (edit to clarify: didn't fully melt but got really sticky and gross) and I had to take my car to the wash. I honestly feel like I’m in the freaking twilight zone at this point.


He came in to my office this morning and started making more jokes about taking my car. I got up, without saying a word, and left my own office. Now I’m wondering, WIBTA for taking this up with HR?

Edit/Some clarifying information: This happened on work property. We have assigned spots, he is next to me. I didn't take any pictures of the candy (although I should have). I have no clue how long it actually sat on my car for, but it wasn't really melted. Just partially melted/a bit sticky.",850,10523,0.98

1963,Everyone Sucks,"I am prepared to be called TA, but wanted to get some other opinions on this one.

I (M 30) and SO (F 30) have been together for 10 years. SO made it clear from the get go that strip clubs are a no go zone. No big deal for me, not interested in going to one. I had been invited for a friends bachelor party a few years ago but told them I was unavailable and didn't mention this to SO, since they are off limits so why would I push it. Several of my friends had also pushed heavily to go to one for my bachelor party, but I declined as per our limits.

Last week, SO asked me if I would be angry if she went to a male strip club. No big deal, I said I wouldn't be since she isn't the type for it. Seconds later she says awesome, and that her and her friends were planning on going to one for her friends bachelorette next weekend, and that the question was to see my reaction before she told me.

I was not cool about it after that. I didn't act out or anything, but thought it was a bit ridiculous that she was going against a rule she explicitly put out there, and was very relaxed with breaking it and going. I was also unhappy that she asked me a ""probing"" question to see my reaction. Would she have told me if I said no? We will never know at this point.

I told her I was not cool with how she told me, and she should have told me that was on the menu for the party from the get go, as I told her to skip my birthday to go to this bachelorette since they were on the same weekend. She said if its such a big deal that I can go to one. Like what?

I told her my thoughts on it, but haven't really had much else to say, and have avoided her mostly for the last 2 days since I don't really have anything else to say. She has put on the water works etc. and has told me she is sorry I feel this way etc. and that I can't act the way I am.

AITA here?

EDIT: I agree with most people here on both sides. I guess I should clarify, I am OK with her going, not OK with how she was withholding that portion of info and asking ""probing"" questions first to see my reactions. Feels like a bit of a bait and switch.

EDIT 2: She knew about it 2-3 weeks before telling me about her plans to go to the strip club. I am aware I titled this poorly.

1965,Not the A-hole,"Update:  The rabbits are going home.

The dad came and spoke to me, apparently he was against bringing them here from the beginning but got outvoted by Mum and the kids and was expecting something like this to happen, we live in an area surrounded by protected bush land and people here take environmental conservation pretty seriously. 

He’s spoken to his parents who are willing to take them in so the kids can still see them on holidays. He’s doing the drive on the weekend and I fully believe he’s not going to just dump them somewhere. 

To clear some things up, it is straight up not legal to own rabbits in QLD even if they are neutered. The only exceptions are research facilities and bizarrely, magicians, I don’t know how the magicians gained so much power in QLD but there you go. 

So bunnies are going home, obviously we aren’t going to be the best of friends with them but things felt at least amicable, the dad thanked me for not dobbing them in and admitted he was worried now that the kids were back at school it would get out anyway (the little girl kept talking about when she could take them in for show and tell). 

So there you go, good bye bunnies but just to nana and pops.

Here’s a link to some info on why this is such an issue if you’re interested.

[Bunny Invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia) 

to;dr: A family with pet rabbits moved in next door and my job requires me to make them destroy them.

Two important points to consider first:

1) I live in a state in Australia where it is illegal to own rabbits as pets. Rabbits have caused huge amounts of devastation to our native wildlife as well as agriculture, if you are found to own them you face fines potentially in the tens of thousands.

2) I work in conservation and while I love my job the shittiest thing I have to do is trap and destroy feral animals and pests including rabbits. I do not enjoy this, it is not their fault they were introduced to a country they shouldn’t be in and then had idiot owners who didn’t get them de-sexed and allowed them to roam but here we are and our native wildlife is suffering.

So the issue, a little while ago a family moved in next door, they are nice enough but yesterday I discovered they owned 5 rabbits (the little girl started talking to me when I was in the backyard and told me all about it). 

I talked it over with my husband (also in conservation) and we both agree I can’t let it go. This morning I went over and spoke to the Mum explaining what I do for a living and asked if she knew it was illegal to own rabbits here, she admitted they did but had moved from a neighbouring state where it was legal and didn’t want to leave them behind. 

I told her I couldn’t allow them to keep them and she could either surrender them to me and I would handle it without reporting them (explaining the potential fines) or I would have to report her. She understandably got quite upset and I said to talk it over with her family and let me know what she wanted to do. 

It’s now nearly 1am and I can’t sleep because of how horrible I feel but the damage those 5 rabbits could do if they got out or if the males got in with the females is huge and goes against so much of what I believe in and work for.

I did the IB diploma, and scored 43 points, which is very good, but I got praise or anything from my parents, actually they disciplined me for not getting a 7 in danish.

Both my brothers studied abroad for a year, and my parents paid all of their expensives. I was told that I was not ""mature enough"" and that I wouldn't fit in a dorm community.

She said it was a really expensive watch, and after tearing the house apart, she concluded it was stolen. I always figured it was horribly misplaced because I didn’t think anyone in the house would steal a watch, but she was convinced. She accused everyone a bit, but focused the blame on me, since I was around when she last saw it. 

A lot of other fights and stuff followed after that, but it would always come back around to the watch I supposedly stole. When she got drunk she’d get really angry about it. I moved out around 6-8 months after the watch first went missing, in a fiery haste because things had gotten so violent and chaotic. I’ve never spoken to her since, and had no intentions to.

Me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. Our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after Jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


While growing up, despite never being mentioned, Jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. He told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


Initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell Jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell Jon about it when he is older. It must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


I am still still standing firm to our promise. I believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. Jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, I would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. I want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


Now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. They want so much to included a deceased brother into Jon's life. He is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and I cannot stop them. However, I will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.

1977,Asshole,"So this happened today.
I’m in this Facebook group that is solely for females. Usually all the girls do is show off their selfies, or whinge that their boyfriend hasn’t answered their calls.

This afternoon I came across a comment from one of the members of this group (she was responding to a post from a girl asking whether she should dump her partner for bad sex) saying that she dumped her boyfriend because he wasn’t giving her enough orgasms. She went on to state that he was a great guy, kind and thoughtful, and basically treated her like a princess. To me it sounded like she’d met her soul mate.
I questioned her as to why she felt the need to dump such an awesome guy over something so petty as a supposed lack of orgasms. She told me to STFU because her sex life was important and she had a right to be satisfied and if her boyfriend couldn’t do that, she had the right to ditch him.

I told her she was selfish and shallow for doing what she did, and I told her to grow the hell up. 
She said a few choice words to me and told me to mind my own business.
I feel that I had a right to comment because she was being so open about what she did - almost bragging about it. 

Was I in the wrong here?",524,745,0.82

1979,Not the A-hole,"I'm fully prepared to be called TA.  I don't feel so great about what I did.

&#x200B;

Jordan and I have been friends since we were sophomores in college, and we are in our mid 20s now.  I'll admit that Jordan lacks a lot of experience because he gets anxious about social situations.  He's lost a lot of his friends because he will only be engaged in a convo when he wants to gripe about his work, family life, how girls don't like him, or himself.  I really feel that I'm one of the few friends he has left, as some of our mutual friends told me that they were tired of him being so negative all the time.  I've been there to listen to him talk out his problems, because despite all of it, I think he is a well-intentioned person.

&#x200B;

There are a few things that have bothered me lately.  I had a pretty emotional break up a couple months ago, and I confided in him about it because he said he felt something felt off with me.  I didn't go into too much detail about it; I just said that I was heartbroken that I liked the guy a lot but it wasn't meant to be.  He left my message on read and never responded.  I came to realize this is what he does often.  It seems that he will blow me off if I confided him in anything that I was going through.  If he does respond, it'll be with empty responses like ""oh"" or ""I'm sorry"".  I guess I always chalked it up to the fact he doesn't have much life experience.

&#x200B;

I also do cam girl stuff occasionally as a source of side income.  He knows about this because I sometimes will post teaser pics on a gonewild-offshoot sub.   I was upfront about it with him when he asked if it was me.  Now, I really couldn't care less that he's seen me nude, or even if he followed my private blog (he doesn't).  I don't post too often, but he will always text me within *minutes* after I do to compliment the way I look.  Again, the compliment itself doesn't bother me, nor the fact that it's coming from him.  I think it's just the dynamic of our friendship that's getting to me.

&#x200B;

It's been a long time since we had a conversation that wasn't pessimistic.  He seems to feel that he can vent out all he wants to me, but he will be apathetic if I was going through something.  He will only start up a conversation with me when he just wants to talk about himself & his problems.  The last time I spoke to him was last week after I posted something, to which he complimented after not speaking to me at all for 3 weeks.  I lost my patience and said something to the effect of ""Are you seriously going to only talk either when you want to \[vent\] about something or when I post?  Some kind of friendship this has been.""  He responded with, ""Ha, I don't know, just take the compliment I guess.""  I basically told him that enough is enough, that I hope he gets some help because it's beyond me at this point, and to not talk to me again until he sorts himself out.

&#x200B;

There's no doubt that I feel disrespected by him lately.  I probably could have handled it better though. AITA?",236,1149,0.92

1981,Not the A-hole,"So long story short I met my girlfriend 2-3 years ago through Tinder, On our second date she revealed to me she was a germaphobe (a person with an extreme fear of germs and an obsession with cleanliness.), she then mentioned it shouldn't really affect me but it's more for her, she moves from holland to live with me in Belgium and I adapt lots of rules like taking shoes off, cleaning my hand more often than not, ... 

It can be hard sometimes with the rules but I try to adhere as much as possible so she feels at home. It makes it easier that she really checks all the other boxes of the perfect girlfriend.

Now we live in Brussels where there are a lot of transport vehicles, busses, taxi's but als shared vehicles like those e-scooters and recently Uber Jump bikes. I love everything that has to do with technology and nifty stuff, so I really want to use them but since they are here she despises them, she thinks they are filth (they do often lay on the ground or between trash).

So today I had a day off-work and she asks if I could lunch with her at her work, this seemed like a good romantic idea, I look at the options and discover that the bike is the fastest way to travel, 
she already told me she wouldn't like it if I used them but I always tell her that I would really like it, so I decide to take the risk and be honest with her when I'm with her.

I make my way downtown and arrive at her office, I tel her how I am proud of my 30 minutes of biking and it was fun, that I will change my pants when home and I asked to use her disinfectant for my hand so they where clean.

She was very upset, she told me I knew she did not like them and I still went for it anyway. I told her I really wanted it and it didn't harm anybody, she said it harmed her and caused her a lot of stress.

The lunch didn't go as smooth as I hoped because of it and she even asked me to not go home with the bike (25 minutes) but go with transport (40 minutes).

AITA? for using the bike? I adapted so much already I try to live by her rules everyday (and people are often impressed by how much I adhere to them), but some things just doesn't seem fair... I would like to marry that girl one day but I'm having my doubts if she can even see my point of view.",24,50,0.91

1983,No A-holes here,"My Aunt lives in Texas and we have an okay relationship. The best you can when you’ve never lived closed to a family member. Her and my uncle never had kids, and they spend all their cash on luxury trips and high price tagged cars. That’s fine- it’s their prerogative. My uncle mentioned that he thought my aunt really wanted a strong bond with me as an aunt so I’ve been trying hard to reach out and chitchat.
So yesterday was my Birthday(yay me!).  She sent me a text wishing me a happy birthday, and the name was spelled wrong but I wasn’t mad. I chalked it up to spellcheck. As the texts go on, she starts spelling my name right. FINALLY. Lol 
And she always sends me a nice expensive card and a necklace in it. Her card had my name spelled wrong. My name is XXXSIE not the usual XXXSEY.  It’s officially been this way for 26 years now.

AITA for getting upset that my aunt keeps spelling my name wrong ??  I’m torn.. on one side, I see it as “it’s not that big of a deal, it’s just a spelling” but on the other side I see “if you want to have this relationship with me AT LEAST SPELL MY NAME RIGHT.”

1984,Not the A-hole,"My nana wasn’t the best woman to walk the earth. She smoked, was an alcoholic, addicted to pain killers, and overall extremely manipulative over her family. Regardless, when she passed away last year I was sad. As much as a bad role model she was she was still my nana and one of the only links I had to my English heritage (I’m a born and raised Kiwi), and I loved her.

She always told us when she won the lottery she was going to take us to Disneyland. Of course it never happened but every time she took us with her to the Lotto shop or pulled out a ticket she always said she was taking us to Disneyland. By us I mean me and my younger brother, I don’t know if she ever said it my two cousins. (We were the favourites for no other reason than we’re the only grandchildren whose names relate to my Pop, her late husband, who passed away two years before I was born and left a pretty hefty legacy.)

When she passed away her will granted $5000 to each grandchild so me, my brother, my half-brother and my two cousins, but we can only access it once we hit 20. I want to use that money to go on the trip she wanted to take me on when I can access it in two years. 

I told my family my plans and no one’s overly supportive. My dad and his brother’s family are telling me Nana wasn’t worth making a trip with her in mind, and my Mum and Grandpa (other side, only grandparent I have left) want me to use it on my education since I’ll be in uni by then. I understand their points of view, especially Mum’s, but Disneyland has always been my dream and using her money just seems right. 

AITA for using money to go on a trip in honour of a woman I shouldn’t be looking up to?

EDIT: I obviously need to clarify a couple of things.

Firstly, student loans here are awesome, I’ve been working since 13 saving for uni, my parents aren’t paying. 
Secondly I know I say Disneyland in the title but obviously Disneyland, Disney World, it doesn’t matter for what I’m asking.
Thirdly, I AM NOT PLANNING ON SPENDING THE WHOLE 5K! I will invest at least half cause I’m not an idiot, most likely into my KiwiSaver (I think that’s like a 401k correct me if I’m wrong)",402,1720,0.96
1985,No A-holes here,"*Edit: Thank you everyone for the comments. I guess I was wrong about being certain I will not change my mind. I'll have another conversation with my wife and son and try to be extra open-minded this time. I think my stubbornness came from making a decision on my own before even hearing them out, but you lot make some solid points. Especially about them probably spending all day together regardless of living apart and this not being worth creating a rift between us.*


My son and his boyfriend are 18 and they just finished high school. Right before school ended, he came out to us and said his best friend was actually his boyfriend.

My son has always had problems at school, he simply learns stuff in a different way and more slowly, and he's more of an artist than a scientist, whereas his boyfriend is some sort of genius that plays like 10 instruments, speaks 5 languages and could choose between 7 prestigious universities (and I'm talking fancy, difficult stuff like astrophysics and biomedicine). Throughout high school, the boyfriend helped my son with school and I'm pretty sure my son would have flunked several times without his boyfriend's help.

But they're going to go to uni this fall and they're moving to the same city. They and my wife thought it was a given that they will rent a place and live together. I think this is a horrible idea. My son had his boyfriend's help in high school because they were in the same class and had the same subjects. But now he'll study one thing and his boyfriend a completely unrelated thing so he won't be able to help him. Therefore, I think his boyfriend would only be a distraction.

I suggested to my wife we rent our son a small place where he would live on his own and have the peace and quiet he needs, but my wife thinks he also needs the emotional support that his boyfriend gives him. I think he can support our son without them living together, just like we will be able to support him from another city. I can't see them changing my mind about it nor do I think I'm wrong in having this way of thinking, so I wanted to hear other people's perspective.

Edit: Someone asked for more info about who will be financing this so I'm adding my reply as an edit -  Currently, my wife and I will be paying his rent. I don't know if he plans on finding a job. He doesn't need to, we can afford it, but if he wants to, we'll be fine with that.",197,363,0.91

1987,Not the A-hole,"So.... I am in charge of the household laundry. Everything that gets chucked in the laundry bag gets cleaned. DH has the firm belief that towels don't need to be washed. I, obviously, disagree and have been throwing his towel in the wash at least 2-3 times a month for the 7 years we have been married. 

A few months ago though, I just.....got fed up. Something just snapped, and I stopped putting his towel in the laundry. Never told him. It's now been three months. I have no idea if he knows. 

AITA ?

Edit 1: yes, laundry is my responsibility. What we agreed on, however, was that I will launder everything that makes its way into the laundry bin. Not that I would go around the house picking up everyone's clothes. I absolutely launder everything from that bin. All of his clothes make their way in there, and all of them get cleaned and folded.

Edit 2: since a lot of people have wondered,

- we have a clotheshorse on the balcony where the towels dry after each use. So no, it isn't moldy, isn't hanging in the bathroom, isn't touching anything else and doesn't smell THAT bad.
- I did launder it for 7 whole years. Every single time, I would make it a point to tell him and remind him to throw it in the bin next time. 
- I am doing enough of the mental legwork to be bothered with remembering one more thing at this point. We have a small kid now, I work as well. If he doesn't want it washed, it doesn't get washed.
- yes, I absolutely am being petty. I do understand and acknowledge that.",315,810,0.94

1989,Not the A-hole,"So to give a little bit of background my AC stopped working on a Sunday. I called a local business that had good reviews (several hundred reviews). They said it would be extra to come out on the weekend so I asked if they could come out on Monday. I figured I could suck it up for a day. They make the appointment and tell me it will be $40 for them to come out. 

The next day rolls around and I leave work a bit early to be home for the 4:00 service call. I wait and wait, but it gets to be 5:00 and no one is there. I call them and ask where the repair person is. Apparently I was never put into the system. They apologize and agree to get someone out ASAP that day. They tell me it’s going to be $75 for the service call. I explain that I was told $40 on Sunday. She says that they did have a discount but you had to mention when you called. She eventually agrees to go with the price I was originally told and was very nice about it saying, “if you were told $40 that’s what we’ll charge.”

The repair guy shows up and he fiddled around for about 10 minutes and then comes and says to me that he’s done all he can for $40 and if I want anything else done it’s a $150 diagnostic charge. Well I’m stuck in a 89 degree house and it’s too late to call anyone else so I say “sure whatever”. He spends a few more minutes and discovers a loose wire. He fixes the loose wire in about 5-10 minutes comes down out of my attic and tells me it will be $300 total. So to recap it was $40 for the service call, $150 for the diagnosis, and $110 for him to strip and reattach a wire. I was never told about the $150 diagnostic charge when I called them to come out. Well I pay because I’m burning up and he’s not the guy to take this up with anyway. I leave a one star review on their business explaining all of this. Well a week later their business replies saying they’re reversing my charge and giving a full refund. I didn’t necessarily want a full refund. I would have been happy paying about 180-200 for the work. I know I’m paying for his expertise not the speed  or ease of the repair. I just felt it was predatory that I wasn’t told upfront about the $159 diagnostic charge.  I feel kind of bad keeping the refund but they gave it to me and my dad says I should just keep it. 

So AITA leaving my review up and just keeping the full refund? I’m going to go and reply to them thanking them for it and explain that I wish they had been upfront about all potential charges, but I’m not going to change my review because other people should know and people usually check the one star section. 

tl;dr repair company was shady with their charges and did not tell me about a $150 charge before coming out. I left a bad review on google and they gave me a full refund. I feel kind of bad for keeping the bad review up but want other people to be aware.",23,31,0.89

The haircut lasts between 35-40 minutes and I've never had a problem with it. He's a pretty good barber and listens to my requests.

Well, a full haircut costs 3€ , but for the last 3 and a half years, he wouldn't accept my 3€ and just asked for 2€. He usually said something like ""go grab a coffee with some friends with that 1 remaining Dollar"". I always insisted that I pay the full price, but he wouldn't take it.

Fine, I always appreciated it and respect him for that.

1996,Asshole,"Some light backstory: I'm a crier. I cry at *everything.* I'm not even usually all that upset when it happens, it's just a weird physical reaction that I go through at the slightest hint of negative emotion (my own or others). My boyfriend of the last year has been *incredibly* understanding and patient with me about this, and I'm working with a therapist to get a better handle on myself.

&#x200B;

Here's the issue: we recently went out to the other side of the country to visit my family, which was his first time really spending a good amount of time with them. They all get along great, which I couldn't be happier about! One of the days we were out there, though, I went through a small series of inconveniences (a small screw-up on a work email I had to deal with, our dogsitter accidentally locked herself out of our house so I had to call our neighbor to let her in, things like that) that soured my mood a little bit-- and then I found out my dad had gotten us dinner reservations for a seafood place that I'm sort of ambivalent to.

&#x200B;

This is where I potentially become the asshole. No one in my family makes a ton of money, so we don't go out to dinner very often; for that trip, it was reasonable to assume we'd only being going out the one time. Not only was I ambivalent to the chosen restaurant, but there's another restaurant in town that I really love and I'd hoped we'd be able to go to that one, and I guess on top of all the other tiny disappointments throughout the day it was just the one that pushed too far and I started crying. To be clear, I wasn't even that upset! Just a little disappointed. But I couldn't stop myself from crying. I really, really tried, it just happened.

&#x200B;

My dad asked what was wrong, and I told him honestly that I'd hoped we could have gone to the restaurant that I liked instead, and he offered to cancel the reservation for the seafood place and get a reservation for the other place the following night instead. I accepted, and was really grateful. It was a really nice thing for him to do, and I really appreciated it.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend was *mortified.* He said that the way I complained was whiny and childish, and he couldn't believe that after all the work I've put into not giving my tears the weight of genuine sadness that I'm not even feeling, that I would ""manipulate"" my dad by crying to get my way. I'm still kind of in shock that he saw it that way. I told him it wasn't like that, my family's used to how I cry over nothing, and he said that's even worse because that just means they know to drop everything and ""fix what's wrong"" with me so I stop. I don't know. I'm really shaken by this, am I really being manipulative? Should I have told him not to change the reservations even though I was really happy he did? I don't think anyone was heart-set on the seafood restaurant, but I guess I didn't get a chance to ask. So please, Reddit, I need some outside perspective. AITA?",838,3899,0.94

1998,Not the A-hole,"Here's my throwaway named for my love of geodes in Stardew Valley.

The cutting out has been an ongoing status for almost a year now, but where at first people had been understanding now they're impatient. Basically, a year ago my mom remarried a guy I (26F) didn't know well because I was no longer living with her, but someone I had seen around and had no negative impressions of. He wasn't outrageously anything, just kind of an awkward dad type with two younger daughters of his own. Since they were getting married I decided to try and get to know him on better terms than ""that guy my mom's dating"".

I started spending more time around my mom, took his daughters out for movies, attended family barbecues. At one such event he had some guy friends over I had never met, and I knew them less than I did him. They mostly stayed outside drinking, and I mostly stayed inside watching Disney movies with the girls. At one point I went outside to check on the food, and I catch the guys in some twisted ""locker room"" talk about me.

I say twisted because my mom's new husband is engaged in a convo about my ass. He didn't even use my name, he called me his ""stepdaughter"" which is just ugh. I'm not one for huge confrontations though, so I just left and started the icing out process. I told my mom, and she said she was sorry but didn't want to make a fuss out of it. So mom's blocked. My aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, anyone who thought I was making too big a deal or even heard this guy saying these things and never stood up for me got cut. I was left with my brother, father, and some cousins I don't talk to very much.

At first there were plenty of people who at least understood what I was doing. Even my mother agreed we should let things settle. Now, she's saying that her husband has apologized and expressed shame and at this point I'm the only one making problems. After all, it's been almost a year and I don't want to miss their anniversary and the girls miss me so much they never did anything don't I care about them etc...

She's not the only one saying I'm holding onto a grudge longer than necessary just out of spite. Idk, I've missed some people I once considered friends in my life and I feel bad for these young girls who were getting attached to me and suddenly I'm not there. I do feel a little guilty, but at the same time I have uncontested evidence that this was not an isolated incident and these same friends apparently thought it was okay for this guy to sexualize me. Like I said, some people heard him say similar things before and didn't stop him. Others still say I'm overreacting because he didn't say anything to me or make any advances.
